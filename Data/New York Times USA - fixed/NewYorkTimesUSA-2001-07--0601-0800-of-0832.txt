HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Satellite Company Is Trying Life on Its Own

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Like a spacecraft breaking free of the rocket it no longer needs to reach its final destination, Intelsat severed its ties last week with the governments that launched it nearly 40 years ago. 
 Intelsat, a communications satellite operator whose formal name used to be the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization, has been transformed into a Bermuda-based holding company. The bulk of its operations remain at its longtime headquarters in Washington and at a marketing subsidiary in London. 
 As a fully private company, Intelsat has been stripped of antitrust immunities, tax privileges and automatic access to markets that had been its birthright since 1964 and a source of constant irritation to the private sector rivals that grew up to compete with it.
Over the years, those connections brought Intelsat such high-level jobs as providing the original hot-line phone link between the White House and the Kremlin and broadcasting worldwide Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon. Intelsat became so entrenched in global telecommunications that as of last year, 70 of its 146 member countries reported that they relied on it for all international telecommunications and 40 used it for domestic links, as well. 
But, after years of debate, Intelsat officials finally convinced all of the organization's members late last year that support for the old Intelsat was waning in wealthier nations with more telecommunications choices. Without a change, they argued, resources would shrink to the point that service everywhere would deteriorate.
In leaving behind its semiofficial status, Intelsat shed a ponderous decision-making structure and pricing constraints that prevented it from being nimble. The old Intelsat was governed by a 48-member board representing the diverse interests of 146 member countries. 
Intelsat's quarterly board meetings lasted a full week, in part because every issue had to be hashed out in three official languages. 
Ownership shares were based on use of the system, and no significant investments could be made without at least two-thirds of the shares voting in favor. Because every member had to contribute capital based on its ownership percentage, proposals for new satellites or services aimed at specific regions often ran into resistance from the many members that might not benefit directly.
Nor could Intelsat quickly cut prices in regions where it faced competition without cutting prices to all its members. To protect private competitors, regulators in various countries had shut Intelsat out of some lucrative new markets, like satellite television broadcasting in the United States. And unlike its private competitors, Intelsat was barred from offering ground-based communications services that could enhance the appeal of its satellite links.
No wonder Intelsat executives have become every bit as eager for privatization as any of the company's rivals.
"The fact that we needed to privatize became blatantly obvious in the early 90's," said Conny L. Kullman, a 51-year-old engineer who traded the title of director general for chief executive in the transition. His new board has a mere 17 members.
Rival satellite operators freely acknowledge that they may not always come out ahead on the newly leveled playing field they have been fighting for since the 1980's. 
"It will be a jump-ball market," said James W. Cuminale, executive vice president and general counsel of PanAmSat, a a satellite operator based in Greenwich, Conn., that is controlled by the Hughes Electronics subsidiary of General Motors. PanAmSat has long been the most vocal campaigner for ending Intelsat's special status. "Commerce has conquered space," Mr. Cuminale said. 
Intelsat's privatization marks the end of a grand experiment in using government to grease the skids for private enterprise in a sector in which many traditional customers have doubted that market forces should be trusted. At the time Intelsat began taking shape, only AT&T, which was still a regulated monopoly, had managed to launch a communications satellite successfully.
AT&T's satellite, named Telstar, began operating in July 1962. By the time it was silenced early the next year by radiation from nuclear bomb tests, feats like the first trans-Atlantic television broadcasts had fired the public imagination. An obscure British band called the Tornadoes shot to the top of the music charts with the instrumental "Telstar," its homage to the satellite (www .retrofuture.com/telstar.html). 
Governments around the world recognized the potential communications breakthrough, but with monopolies like AT&T controlling the industry in every country, there were concerns about how the new technology would spread and be regulated.
To accelerate investment in what President John F. Kennedy called "vital elements in the march of civilization," the United States and other governments agreed to form a collective organization. The designated American participant, created by Congress in 1962, was called the Communications Satellite Corporation, or Comsat. 
The administrative part of the experiment had its low points. In 1988, Richard R. Colino, Intelsat's director general for most of that decade, was sentenced to six years in prison for organizing the theft of $5.4 million from Intelsat, mostly in connection with construction of its Washington headquarters complex. Jose L. Alegrett, his deputy, was also convicted for his role in the illegal activities. 
But by then, the Intelsat model had already proved its worth. Starting with the 1965 launching of Early Bird, Intelsat built a steadily expanding network capable of reaching nearly the entire planet from so-called geostationary sites 22,300 miles above the Equator. Such satellites orbit so that they appear in a fixed spot in the sky. 
After the Intelsat example, the International Marine Satellite Communications Organization, or Inmarsat, was set up in 1975 in London to provide communications to ships, aircraft and other mobile customers. Not long after, a consortium of European countries set up Eutelsat, based in Paris, to speed development of satellite services in that region and provide competition for Intelsat. 
The privatization movement has now unwound all of those ventures. After years of negotiations, the logjam began breaking up in 1998, when Intelsat spun off 5 of its 24 satellites into New Skies Satellites, a start-up based in the Netherlands, as a first step in its privatization journey. In 1999, Inmarsat went private. 
The final phase of Intelsat's privatization came last week, just weeks after Eutelsat completed a similar transition. Eventually, shares of all the former collectives will be traded on public stock exchanges. New Skies had its initial public offering last October, and Inmarsat plans to follow by the end of the year; Intelsat and Eutelsat are aiming for 2002.
For now, Intelsat's largest shareholder is Lockheed Martin, the result of its acquisition of Comsat in 1999. The privatization agreements bar Lockheed from expanding its 22 percent stake before stock is sold to the public. Other private-sector companies that have inherited or acquired member-state stakes hold an additional 50 percent of the shares. Adopting an employee stock plan is among the first items on the agenda at the initial meeting of Intelsat's new board this week.
At the very least, the privatization efforts serve as a reminder to investors that despite the woes of start-up ventures like Iridium and Globalstar, there are solidly profitable segments of the satellite industry. Intelsat is a prime example. Last year, it had a profit margin approaching 50 percent, earning $505 million on revenue of $1.1 billion. 
The geostationary satellite operators' revenues reached $10.2 billion last year, according to the Futron Corporation, a technology consulting firm in Bethesda, Md. Customers included cable television networks, direct-to-home satellite broadcasters, phone companies, Internet service providers and companies that operate private data networks. 
Intelsat, PanAmSat, Eutelsat and Loral Space and Communications are all large players in the profitable geostationary sector. But the market leader in the near future will be SES Global, a Luxembourg-based company being formed by the pending merger of GE Americom, a unit of General Electric, and SES Astra.
SES will own a fleet of 28 satellites and have access to 13 others through investments in smaller players like AsiaSat and Brasilsat. Overcapacity, especially in Asia, has driven down prices 50 percent the last three years. Analysts and Intelsat executives agree that Intelsat is going private at a time that more mergers are likely in the near future.
"There are incredible economies to scale," said Joseph Corbett, Intelsat's chief financial officer. "You can fly more satellites with very little increase in operating costs. And customers want global connectivity."
Analysts say such pressures are likely to lead to a Eutelsat acquisition of New Skies in the near future. Another consolidation candidate is Loral's Skynet network. Loral's maneuvering room has been limited by the losses at Globalstar, a Loral-controlled constellation of satellites for mobile customers. Those satellites orbit closer to Earth than the geostationary satellites. 
Even without acquiring smaller players, Intelsat plans to add nearly 40 percent to its capacity over the next two years by launching nine new satellites. But the company's biggest selling point may be its track record on reliability. Last year, for instance, Intelsat satellites were in service for all but 32 hours of a possible 7.2 million, or more than 99.999 percent of the time.
"They are the gold standard for operating a fleet," said Michael French, an analyst at SG Cowen.

HEADLINE: Unhealthy Cuts for Head Start 

 BODY:
Buried in President Bush's budget message, released in April, is a plan to dramatically change Head Start, the federal program that promotes literacy as well as healthy and enriched lives for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The president's strategy already needs rethinking.
 Mr. Bush's plan to reform Head Start begins with the admirable intent of improving literacy and easing the transition from preschool to elementary education. But vital parts of the program aimed at other facets of children's well-being -- social development, parental involvement, nutrition and physical and mental health -- could be headed for trouble. Mr. Bush wants to cut funding for 2002, in per child terms, by 2 percent. Inflation will further reduce the value of services received by each child. The program has not suffered a similar cut since the Reagan budgets of 1983 and 1986. 
 Head Start has traditionally come under attack by Republicans who question the qualifications of its teaching staff and its long-term effects on the social and educational outcomes of participating children. Both of these concerns have been addressed in the past few years. Roughly 90 percent of Head Start teachers now hold university degrees or state accreditation in early childhood education.
Recent research shows that Head Start has several positive effects on children's later lives. The government's own reports state that Head Start lifts children's chances of promotion through elementary grade levels and lowers the rate at which they enter special education programs. White children who were enrolled in the program are more likely to graduate from high school than peers from similar socioeconomic backgrounds. Black children, though no more likely to graduate from high school, are less likely to have been charged with crimes. Hispanic-American graduates consistently achieve better test scores and grade-level promotion rates than their peers, in part because of assistance in learning English.
Mr. Bush wants to strengthen the program's emphasis on education and is proposing a modest increase in overall financing. But with projected enrollment increases, the funding per child will actually fall, and any enhancement of education will have to be done at the expense of valuable health and social assistance. That seems shortsighted.

HEADLINE: To Be Young and in Search of the Higgs Boson 

BYLINE:  By JAMES GLANZ 

DATELINE: SNOWMASS VILLAGE, Colo. 

 BODY:
Real estate in this resort town, which cascades down a mountainside a few miles northwest of Aspen, can run over $1,000 a square foot. Compare that with the roughly $6 billion, without furnishings, that senior physicists at a meeting here this month said they needed for a new machine to track down exotic particles weighing about the same as a single silver atom left in the ground from the region's hardscrabble mining past.
 But in physics as in real estate, rising prices can be most painful for the young community members. Although young physicists would not have to pay for the project themselves, their careers could depend on whether world governments decide to heed the elder experts' advice and cooperate in building the machine. 
 With the demise of the cold war arguments for spending on the physical sciences, those soaring costs are creating a new class of highly educated workers now at the mercy of international currents. 
"Sometimes I feel like I'm a character in an independent film," said Dr. Kenneth Bloom, a 30-year-old postdoctoral researcher at the University of Michigan, "where there's some large conspiracy and I'm just some minor pawn in what's going on." Now, he is one of hundreds of physicists collaborating on a particle physics experiment at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.
Scientists like Dr. Bloom, whose position, like that of all postdocs, is a temporary job that allows him to build credentials for a permanent spot, could be forgiven for turning permanently fatalistic. Projects in physics, astronomy, space science and related fields have become ever larger and more costly as budgets in those areas have declined in favor of biomedical and defense research.
But resignation is not what turned up in a brief canvass of the young scientists here, where over 1,000 particle physicists met from July 1 until Friday to plan their field's future. Instead, there were glimmers of a truly post-cold-war generation of physicists who are banding together in their own interest and making the case, politically and scientifically, that many reasons exist to build those big machines.
Those reasons include the expectation of spinoff technologies to help drive the economy, the scientists say as they work out their pitch. They also point to the light the research will shine on the deepest secrets of the cosmos and the large number of students the work will support.
"We have to sing for our supper, and that's something the young people are coming to terms with," said Dr. Robin Erbacher, 33, a postdoc at Fermilab. In spite of her field's introverted stereotype, she gives public tours of the laboratory, lectures in schools and has met with members of Congress to urge increased support for physics research.
Dr. Bloom and Dr. Erbacher were among the organizers here of a series of forums that are designed for young physicists to sound out their colleagues in the hope of eventually influencing the future of their field. A separate group called the Young Physicists' Panel was formed at Fermilab last year, said Sam Zeller, 29, a panel member who is a graduate student at Northwestern while doing research at the laboratory.
The idea, Ms. Zeller said, is to develop education and outreach programs so "you're not just sitting at your desk totally entranced in your own little world."
Being entranced in one's own little world was once almost a cultural imperative of physics.
Decades ago, individual universities could afford frontline particle accelerators to study the structure of matter. The masses were fairly low for the particles of interest, things like electrons, muons, kaons and pions. Reflecting Einstein's equivalence of mass and energy, particle accelerators could study them in the microscopic wreckage of fairly low-energy collisions.
Now, as construction begins on a new $4 billion accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva -- and as physicists here make the case for a giant follow-on machine that could cost $6 billion or more -- no one contemplates building more than one of each type in the world.
As one measure of how high the ante has been raised, a pion has about one-seventh the weight of a proton, while a Higgs boson -- a particle the hadron collider will chase -- is thought to have a weight that is 100 to 200 times as great as a proton's and to be much harder to identify. A silver atom weighs about the same as 100 protons.
These days, no one knows where, or even if, the successor to the hadron collider will be built. That makes career planning difficult, even in a field whose allure has never revolved around financial gain, said Dr. Zack Sullivan, 29, a theoretical physicist who is a postdoc at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois.
"I could have gone to Wall Street and made a ton of money," Dr. Sullivan said, referring to the strong demand for mathematically sophisticated analysts in the financial sector. "But instead I became a graduate student for $10,000 a year."
Dr. Sullivan is not crying in his beer; he finds it thrilling to go to work each day with a chance to discover something new about the universe. In fact, the young scientists are eager to point out that they are motivated not solely by a drive for job security but by indications from theory that a welter of discoveries may be nigh -- if the machines to make them are built.
"There are a lot of hints that there is new physics just around the corner," said Dr. Gudrid Moortgat-Pick, 31, a theorist who is a postdoc at DESY, a particle physics laboratory in Hamburg, Germany.
Naturally, the scientists are not averse to keeping their job prospects healthy, either. In that respect, the challenge that particle physicists face does have parallels in other parts of the high-tech economy, said Harris Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America, which represents 500 technology companies.
As examples of long-term projects with similar stakes for high-tech workers, Mr. Miller came up with projects like the space station, the missile defense program and even the projects required to develop new automobile designs.
Citing a highly successful push by biomedical companies several years ago to increase federal financing for their research, Mr. Miller said the young physicists had been taking the right steps in organizing to promote their cause.
"It wasn't just sort of individual, random scientists or biomedical researchers wandering around the Hill," Mr. Miller said. "It was a huge coalition."
Whether the scientists can change the degage habits of their field so drastically remains to be seen. But at Snowmass, where conference participants carried out a series of public outreach programs, there were hints that the scientists' message may be finding an audience among the people who pay the considerable bills for the science. 
When asked whether it was obvious that a condominium with a view would always trump a particle accelerator as the preferred way for the average person to part with a few dollars, Terry Morse, a real estate agent in Snowmass, hesitated for only an instant.
Even in a Rocky Mountain condo, Mr. Morse said, "you don't have a view of the entire universe."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW; 
Deflation of an Optimist, by a Young Writer

BYLINE:  By BRUCE WEBER 

DATELINE: WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., July 19 

 BODY:
If you're a frequent theatergoer, the sound of a new and singular dramatic voice is the sound you listen for. Hearing it is rare, of course, and you're never expectant but always hopeful, like a bird-watcher attuned to the trill of an endangered bird. The sound is loud and unmistakable, however, here at the Williamstown Theater Festival, where the work of a 25-year-old playwright -- a play called "The Man Who Had All the Luck" -- is surely the herald of an important career. 
 Well, O.K., that's a bit of a fudge. It was the herald of an important career, though critical prescience was absent in 1944, when the play closed after four performances on Broadway. Not until later in the decade did the author, Arthur Miller, have successes -- "All My Sons" and "Death of a Salesman" -- that would begin to make people remember him. 
 The compelling new production, which runs through July 29, has been lucidly directed by Scott Ellis, on a spacious, simple and handsome set by Allen Moyer (its most spectacular feature is a rare antique automobile, a 1930 Marmon) and performed by a glowing cast that had only three weeks to rehearse. Together they show the play -- Mr. Miller's first produced full-length work -- to be swelling with ambition and both flawed and gripping, and one question it leaves you with is how it could have been so easily dismissed 57 years ago. 
And given the subsequent career of the playwright, who is now 85 and whose work has been in resurgence the past few seasons, it's downright bizarre that until now the play has been almost entirely forgotten; this is its first major American revival.
The story of a young man in the Midwest on whom fortune regularly smiles even as it abandons everyone around him, "The Man Who Had All the Luck" is a play that creates the fraternal rivalries and filial conflicts that Mr. Miller revisited and honed, most famously in the Loman family. (Biff Loman's moment of disillusionment with his father and his violent response get a trial run here.) It introduces his penchant for allegory, foreshadows the playwright's career-long probe of American values and shows him as a pesty, contrarian national conscience.
The title character is David Beeves, an all-American boy in easy description and symbolic intent. A fresh-faced 22-year-old as the play begins, he is starting his own business, turning an old barn into an auto repair shop, with no more training or expertise than the founding fathers had in creating a nation. And he is also preparing to face down the father of the girl he has loved since childhood, a locally feared (and wealthy) man who hates David with particular unreason and has vowed to keep his daughter from him, violently if need be.
The threat is short-lived. Indeed, that obstacles tend to vanish from David's path is illustrated early on with shocking suddenness, and when an Austrian immigrant who just happens to be an expert mechanic moves to town just at the moment that an affluent farmer and mink breeder is about to bestow on David all the business of his farm machinery, it becomes clear that there is a fairy tale quality to David's life.
All that is missing is the success of his older brother, Amos, who has been training since childhood, under the obsessive eye of his father, to pitch in the major leagues. Automobiles, baseball, mink coats, childhood sweethearts, the timely contributions of immigrants: America!
Mr. Miller wrote the play in 1940, and set it in 1938, when the nation was grappling its way out of the Depression and Europe was tumbling toward war, and in David Beeves he was questioning, with the fervid earnestness of a young writer, our often smugly held presumption of being blessed. (One explanation for the play's original failure might be that by 1944, with the United States engaged in a world war, no one was in the mood for, or even attuned to, national navel-gazing.)
Like "Death of a Salesman," for example, which exposed the darkness under the sheen of American capitalism, and "The Crucible," which attacked in symbolic fashion the tyranny of American righteousness, "The Man Who Had All the Luck" is an admonitory work, one that pleads seriously for a national acknowledgment that we are not a chosen people but a fortunate one and that declares that our fortune must be wielded with responsibility and without clucking. Otherwise, watch out; there's nothing like the force of nature -- in this case a mammoth thunderstorm -- to illustrate how calamitous hubris can be.
There is a palpable precociousness in the play, particularly in the overly explanatory final act, which takes on a slightly tedious attitude of a goody-goody younger brother waggling his finger at you in warning. Perhaps in the optimism of youth, the playwright doesn't quite have the chutzpah to crank up the stakes to life and death, as he does in later plays. And there are one or two dramatic problems that the young playwright either overlooked or couldn't solve; the sudden demise of David's resistant father-in-law-to-be is received by all the characters with barely a shrug.
Already in place are Mr. Miller's dogged delineation of moral conundrums, his sturdy dialogue that is not without a kind of plebeian lyricism -- "He's got his whole life laid out like a piece of linoleum" -- and a sense of speechifying moment. Two soliloquies, one about the rigors of mink farming, delivered by Dan Dibble, the eccentric and entrepreneurial old farmer, the other about the mysteries of baseball, delivered by Augie Belfast, a grizzled scout for the Detroit Tigers, are beautifully detailed and mythically charged, enough to nourish actors with the fuel for great character turns.
In this production, Mason Adams as Dibble and David Wohl as Belfastprovide vivid, memorably idiosyncratic variations on recognizable American types. Indeed, Mr. Ellis's beautifully cast production is dotted with admirable performances, particularly given the limited rehearsal time. 
Especially to be noted is the young film actor, Chris O'Donnell, who is making a remarkable stage debut as David. Those who recall Mr. O'Donnell's innocently handsome appeal from a couple of "Batman" movies (he was Robin) and "Scent of a Woman" (with Al Pacino) will not be surprised that he is physically perfect for the part of David, but his comfort, solidity and easy charisma on the stage will be the envy of many more experienced players.
At times you can see Mr. O'Donnell thinking on his feet, but with the accelerated rehearsal schedule the same is true of many of the others here, and in a complicated role that moves him in gradations from golden boy to conscience-stricken brother and neighbor to a man on the edge of madness, Mr. O'Donnell never goes over the top, never loses the character's own sense that he is an ordinary man who has been visited by extraordinary circumstances. Being buffeted by the winds of fortune never empowers David, and it never overly emboldens Mr. O'Donnell either. One gets the sense that the character's innate self-scrutiny is a quality of the actor as well.
An early scene in which David meets and is rescued from an embarrassing failure by Gus Eberson, the Austrian mechanic (played by a marvelously warm Sam Robards), has to be one of the most naturally sweet encounters onstage anywhere right now. It reminds you how infrequent it is that friendliness and courtesy are dramatized, and even for the most cynical theatergoer Mr. O'Donnell makes the scene a winning one. His entirely ingratiating performance is propelled from here. Perhaps like the playwright, he has a grand future onstage.

HEADLINE: Cleaning Our Waterways 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "E.P.A. Delays Further Rules of Clinton Era" (news article, July 17): 
 If 40 percent of America's waterways are not fishable or swimmable because of polluted runoff, that is unrealized economic potential of about $9 billion a year in freshwater sport fishing alone. 
Add to that other lost recreational income, diminished values of riparian real estate, reduced tax base, lowered public image discouraging tourism and development, public health concerns and higher treatment costs for public water supplies.
Water pollution is part of the cost of farming, land clearing, city streets, highways and precipitated stack effluents from power plants and factories. Resource economics can identify the costs, who benefits and who therefore should pay to bring back the potential of our polluted waters.

HEADLINE: Pakistan Reckons With a Rising India 

BYLINE:  By Pankaj Mishra; Pankaj Mishra is author of "The Romantics." He writes often on Kashmir.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
 Earlier this month, in the small north Indian city of Agra, the leaders of India and Pakistan met to discuss the troubled relationship that has led them into four wars in the last five decades. The Taj Mahal, a symbol of eternal love, seemed an appropriate backdrop to their efforts: the marble monument was built by Shah Jehan, the 17th-century Mogul emperor, in memory of his wife, who had died young. There also appeared something reconciliatory in the choice of venue by India's ruling Hindu nationalist party, which is not known for its affection for Muslim-built cities and monuments -- the party rose to power after destroying, in 1992, a 16th-century mosque it thought expressed a Mogul invader's contempt for Hindus. 
 The India-Pakistan summit's failure now adds to the Taj Mahal's more melancholy associations. Shah Jehan spent the last years of his life gazing upon it from a small room in a nearby fort, where he was imprisoned by his son, Aurangzeb. General Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan, had a similarly clear view of the Taj from his hotel suite; but it plainly didn't much alleviate the "hurt" and "disappointment" he says he felt over the futile summit. 
His hosts may have been more commercially motivated in their choice of backdrop: India receives, despite the Taj Mahal, just .4 percent of the world's tourist traffic, and a concerned government has recently paid millions of dollars to a New York advertising agency for a campaign that emphasizes the soothing and peaceful nature of India. In this marketing plan, the serene possession of a great cultural and spiritual heritage goes together with the quick adaptability represented by India's information technology tycoons. The projection isn't just meant for foreigners. The Hindu triumphalist belief that India -- despite its gigantic problems of poverty, illiteracy and disease -- is advancing fast toward superpower status is widely shared among the Indian middle classes who have benefited most from the neo-liberal economic reforms of the last decade. The economic lives of the majorities in India and Pakistan are roughly the same; India's per capita gross domestic product is indeed higher, but not wildly so. However, for India's middle classes and elite the interest lies in whatever superiorities can be identified and concentrated upon. The growth of India's software and related high-technology industries is one such superiority; closer ties between India and Pakistan's old cold war ally, the United States, are another. 
To look, as many Indians do, at Pakistan from such heights of ambition is to look at a struggling neighbor, economically reliant on International Monetary Fund handouts and politically blocked by the unworkable ideologies of Islam and a hyperactive military. Some of the Pakistani newspapers themselves seemed to confirm this stereotype of a country unable to move forward when, in the hectic buildup to the summit, they referred nostalgically to the Taj Mahal and the long centuries of Muslim rule over India. 
Such a nostalgia, the dream of recovering lost Muslim glory, contributed greatly to the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan in 1947: it was the other side of the quite real fear among Indian Muslims of being reduced to a powerless minority in a Hindu-majority country. Unlike India, Pakistan had a self-image tied, from the very beginning, to religion. But as the secession in 1971 of Pakistan's Bengali-speaking province proved, a shared Muslim faith couldn't solve the problem of how people with different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds were to live together. 
The peculiar logic of the partition, however, dictated that the Muslim-majority state of Kashmir be part of the new homeland for Indian Muslims; and the civilian and military rulers of Pakistan have started two wars with India, and since 1990 have backed a popular insurgency by Kashmiri Muslims, in an attempt to force India into renouncing, or at the very least reconsidering, its possession of Kashmir. The Indian government has responded by declaring Kashmir an "internal matter" and denouncing Pakistan as a sponsor of "cross-border terrorism."
These accusations are not without basis. Nevertheless, they -- along with India's reputation as the world's most populous democracy -- have helped veil the appalling human rights record of the almost half a million Indian soldiers in Kashmir.
India's more recent intransigence on Kashmir also owes something to the growing closeness of the globalizing Indian elite to the United States. Indian traditions of anticolonialism and nonaligned foreign policy have been transformed with the end of the cold war and the rise of Hindu nationalism. India's rise has been acompanied by Pakistan's fall, as Pakistani help in fighting the Soviet Union and balancing Indian nonalignment has become correspondingly less important to America. This situation has caused anger and frustration among Islamic fundamentalists in Pakistan, the tiny but well organized minority that enjoyed Western patronage during the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan. For these hard-liners, jihad, and not dialogue, is the way to deal with the arrogant and deceitful Hindus of India and their fair-weather American friends. 
Liberal Pakistanis have tried to hold on to the optimistic view that India, weary of fighting the Kashmir insurgency, will eventually negotiate. Few have been willing to confront the harsher possibility: that the Hindu nationalists may not be much inclined to make concessions on Kashmir to what they perceive as a weak and isolated state. This is the bitter lesson Mr. Musharraf learned in India, where he was reduced to arguing that the Indian side settle for calling Kashmir an "issue" if it isn't happy with the word "dispute." 
Some anxious American goading might bring the two governments together. Their ministries continue to arrange future meetings; the failure in Agra does not seem to have greatly surprised the participants or led to a sense that progress is impossible. India and Pakistan can at least talk about their (as yet undefined) nuclear arsenals. It might be easier to create some trust on this issue, since India and Pakistan have achieved a kind of parity with their weapons of mass destruction. Yet in all other ways the gap between the two countries grows, and this disparity -- in status, resources and self-confidence -- lay behind the failure of the India-Pakistan summit. It is likely to make the Kashmir problem even more intractable.

HEADLINE: Will U.S. Resume Aid? That Depends on Jakarta 

 BODY:
In the months leading up to President Abdurrahman Wahid's removal as president yesterday, American State Department officials and the National Security Council developed a contingency plan that calls for the quick resumption of economic aid to Jakarta if his successor, Megawati Sukarnoputri, begins to carry out economic reforms.
 "Things have been essentially frozen because of the incompetence of the Wahid government," one senior American official said. 
"Now the question is whether Megawati can execute promises that Wahid could not." 
 But the question, American officials say, is complicated by fears that Mrs. Megawati may use force to put down separatist movements. Several American officials have said in recent weeks that they are worried that the new president, to secure her position, will show less restraint when it comes to dealing with challenges to Jakarta's authority.
In recent months, the major International Monetary Fund program in Indonesia, begun during the Asian financial crisis, has essentially been in a state of suspension. Many private investors have fled. One senior I.M.F. official recently said, "We can't operate there efffectively until there is a government we can communicate with."
Speaking yesterday in Rome, where she was traveling with President Bush, Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, said, "It is ours to try now to support the decision of the Indonesian people through their properly elected representatives." But she was not specific about what form that support might take. 
She said she would urge the new government "to find peaceful ways to resolve the separatist tentions within Indonesia, to be respectful of human rights in doing so, and to really undertake economic reform in a very aggressive way."

HEADLINE: From a Noxious Landfill to a Nurturing Colony for Artisans 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: PENLAND, N.C. 

 BODY:
The lush peaks and valleys of this Blue Ridge community have long been home to some of the nation's finest craft workshops.
 But Penland, about 50 miles northeast of Asheville, N.C., is also home to a much less welcome landmark: the former Mitchell County and Yancey County dump. 
 "It always seemed a scary place to me," said Jon Ellenbogen, a potter who for 30 years hauled his trash up the winding roads to the six-acre landfill before it closed in 1994. "Without fail, whenever I ventured up there, my wheels would get stuck in the muck, forcing me to remain until one of the bulldozers pulled me out." 
Now, Mr. Ellenbogen and other artisans look forward to going to the old landfill site. In fact, they hope tour groups will visit.
Since May, the noxious fumes that once befouled the landfill have been creating power and incubating the careers of a small colony of artists in energy-intensive fields. The power project uses methane gas, a flammable pollutant and byproduct of decomposing trash, to fuel furnaces for glass blowers and metal workers, and potters' kilns.
Mr. Ellenbogen, board president of the nonprofit project, called EnergyXchange, estimated that the artists would save $1 million in energy costs during the 12 to 20 years the gas is expected to last.
John Geci, a glass blower at the site and a former student at the Penland School of Crafts, said he was grateful for that.
"Even though my work had begun selling," Mr. Geci said, "there was no way I could afford the $1,000 per month it would have cost just to run the furnace."
The artists, two glass blowers and three potters, will pay $200 to $350 a month during their three-year fellowships to work in two Quonset huts on a six-acre site on top of the old landfill, which has one of the best views in the area. A third building will be used as a gallery and visitors' center, and another will be used for offices and business classes that will be offered free to the artists.
"My perception of what it takes to be a successful artist has changed dramatically in the last five years," Mr. Geci said. "Initially, I thought all that was required was the ability to make nice forms. Now, I recognize the business skills I'm going to need to survive, and I'm glad it's part of the program."
In a greenhouse, heated by methane, seedlings of native plants like rhododendrons and azaleas are grown for sale to local farmers.
The project began when a Yancey County official read about a landfill recovery plan in Florida, said Terry Woodruff, the site's project manager and an employee of the Blue Ridge Resource Conservation and Development Council. Officials contacted the development council, an arm of the federal Agriculture Department, which set up EnergyXchange with Mayland Community College and HandMade in America, a nonprofit organization that fosters economic development with crafts. Organizers received several grants to start the project but are now trying to make it self-supporting with money from plant sales.
In addition to nurturing artists and the local economy, the project helps the environment, Mr. Woodruff said.
"If the gas weren't captured," he said, "an estimated 7,500 tons of methane gas would be released into the atmosphere over the next 10 years here and on a neighboring landfill in Avery County." The greenhouse gases captured by the project are "the equivalent of removing 21,002 cars from North Carolina roads," he said. "That's a pretty substantial figure."
More projects are planned, said Becky Anderson, executive director of HandMade in America.
"Once the buildings are finished, we'll be planting a heritage craft garden with plants that can be used for papermaking, basketry, dye and broom-making," Ms. Anderson said. "Ours is in large part a creative economy in Western North Carolina, which is why it's so important to show people just how creative we can get in enhancing our own economic situation in an environmentally friendly manner."
Mr. Ellenbogen, too, said he hoped EnergyXchange could be a model.
"There are some 900 small landfills around the nation like ours," he said. "We're the perfect example of how individual talents can be pooled for the greater good."

HEADLINE: American Express Earnings Tumble, as Warned 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The American Express Company said yesterday that its profit fell in the second quarter, even without its $826 million loss on high-yield bonds, as companies tightened travel and entertainment spending.
 The company, which said last week that per-share earnings fell 76 percent from a year earlier, reported net income of $178 million, or 13 cents a share in the quarter ended June 30, compared with $740 million, or 54 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had expected 53 cents a share before last week's announcement. 
 The company also said last week that it would eliminate 4,000 to 5,000 jobs, or about 5 percent of its work force, to reduce expenses. The cuts, coming in the company's technologies group, corporate travel business, human resources and corporate lending operations, will require $310 million to $370 million in the third quarter to cover severance pay and related expenses.
"Business is lousy right now, there's no polite way of putting it," Charles White, president of the investment firm Avatar Associates, said before the earnings report. Avatar, which manages about $2.75 billion in assets, sold its American Express shares about six months ago on concern about the company's high-yield bond losses and a slowdown in consumer spending.
Shares of American Express rose 15 cents, to $38.13.
American Express, which issues credit cards and sells mutual funds, insurance, and financial plans, said weakness in the economy and financial markets cut into fees in both areas.
The company said net income would have been $714 million, or 53 cents a share, excluding the money it lost in investments in high-yield securities, also known as junk bonds, for a third consecutive quarter.
Net revenue fell 12 percent from a year earlier, to $4.91 billion.
Profit at the company's card and travel unit rose 3 percent, to $519 million. American Express Financial Advisors reported a loss of $307 million, in contrast to earnings of $275 million.

HEADLINE: Mississippi's Teacher Salaries 

 BODY:
For many years Mississippi has lagged far behind other states in teacher pay, even in the Southeast, making it difficult to hire and keep teachers. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove has been working since he took office last year for a big pay raise for teachers to make it easier to recruit them.
 Mr. Musgrove had worried about opposition from budget-conscious state legislators. But when lawmakers began considering the consequences of losing prospective teachers, they approved a $337.9 million bill that will increase average pay by more than 30 percent over the next five years. Initially the bill required the economy to grow by 5 percent annually before the raises could be granted. But yesterday the legislature voted in a special session to remove this "trigger." That was a smart move. A new report disclosing that 465 teacher positions in Mississippi remain vacant less than a month before the opening of school dramatizes the need to move forward on teacher recruitment. Figures from the governor's office indicate that under the bill the average salary will rise from $31,892 now to $41,445 by 2005, slightly above the projected 2005 Southeastern average salary of $41,199. 
 What is being done in Mississippi could also be done elsewhere. Teachers in New York City are paid about 20 percent less than those in the suburbs, an issue now at the center of salary negotiations between Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the teachers' union. The mayor has offered raises of 8 percent over the next two years, in line with other city workers. But that is still not enough to entice the best teachers to come to the city and stay.
Negotiators have also been discussing other options -- longer hours for more pay, for example, as well as merit pay determined by the schools. While those are useful ideas, the city needs to move faster to establish a more attractive pay scale and better working conditions. 
New York's school problems are more complicated than Mississippi's. But with fewer resources and a smaller economy, Mississippi has developed the kind of attractive employment package that still eludes New York.

HEADLINE: A City Takes a Breath After the Dot-Com Crash; 
San Francisco's Economy Is Slowing

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, July 23 

 BODY:
In the two-room flat above the Infusion Bar and Restaurant near Second and Bryant Streets -- a most coveted corner during the dot-com boom -- an Internet start-up came, spent handsomely and closed up shop. Its change of fortune, and that of hundreds of other Internet companies here, was so sudden that perhaps even the new tenant would not have been able to foresee the downfall.
 The new tenant is Jade Miller, a psychic, who might have found the rents prohibitive six months ago, if there had even been a vacancy. But now this neighborhood, called Multimedia Gulch, has cooled considerably, and the clairvoyant's home office looks out onto vacant office buildings, abandoned by retreating start-ups. 
 "We've gone from dot-coms to palm readers," lamented Steve Schefsky, who owns the property and who charges Ms. Miller around $2,500 a month for rent, about $1,000 less than the departed Internet company. 
The summer of 2001 will be remembered here as the season San Francisco returned to normal, or at least its own version of normality. The change has come after three years in which billions of dollars in venture capital showered on the area -- luring tens of thousands of young workers, paying their salaries, driving up rents, supporting housing and commercial developments and other businesses, like new restaurants where stock-option beneficiaries could wash down scallop dumplings with an Absolut martini.
In the South of Market neighborhood most heavily populated by dot-com businesses, the change has been more dramatic, with commercial vacancies rising to 20 percent, from a record low of 0.6 percent only 18 months ago. In the rest of the city, "normal" means only that rents, commercial and residential, are tapering off -- remaining some of the nation's highest -- but at least apartments are available. Restaurants are cutting prices, and some are closing. At the same time, residents say the city is more habitable: parking has become easier and traffic thinner. In short, this is a city that has slowed -- to "fast" from "blur."
"People are selling computers; they are selling furniture; they are moving out of the area -- which is sad," Craig Newmark, founder of a widely used online classified site, Craig's List, said. "But it does mean that the Bay Area is returning to something healthier."
The average two-bedroom apartment in San Francisco still goes for $2,452, but that is down from $2,790 in December, according to Rent Tech, a San Francisco rental agency. The agency, which has 2,500 apartment listings, up from fewer than 1,000 last year at this time, puts the vacancy rate around 5 percent, up from less than 1 percent last year.
Commercial vacancy rates have risen to 10 percent, including space available for sublet; in all, there are five million square feet of space and a million square feet of demand, said Jeff Congdon, executive director of the San Francisco office of Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate company. The office-space market here "reminds me of the Road Runner cartoon where the Coyote runs into the wall," Mr. Congdon said.
But he argued that the economy remained in good shape, just not superheated, with the dot-com downturn providing a cool breeze that Mr. Congdon said he welcomed. "It's expensive to live here, and it was getting scary for a while," he said. "We were losing people to Arizona, Utah and other markets."
Others worry, though, that circumstances here could deteriorate a lot further. Not only are there a number of technology companies on their last legs that may still close shop, the effects are still rippling across the local economy to many other businesses that expanded to accommodate the boom. And now, the city appears to be losing a few workers formerly in the employ of dot-coms. Reflecting the change in fortunes, Craig's List on a recent day had 4,453 household, furniture and other items for sale, triple the number last Labor Day; 3,080 apartments, a sixfold increase; and 2,545 rooms for rent, up from 771. 
One room listing belongs to Courtney Vaughn, whose life is being drizzled on by the economic downturn in several ways.
Ms. Vaughn, 26, recently lost a roommate, who decided to attend graduate school rather than brave the cooled job market. Ms. Vaughn figured she could sublet the room for $800, but she figured wrong.
"A year ago, it would have been the deal of the century," she said, but she learned otherwise within five hours. "I listed the apartment at 9 a.m., but by 2 p.m., it was already on the second page -- that means at least 100 people had listed after me."
Ms. Vaughn, who has not yet rented the room, is also seeing the impact at the restaurant Azie, where she is a spokeswoman. Azie is a high-end Asian-fusion restaurant founded in December 1999 at the height of the boom. "When it was good, we could see the same people every other week -- especially the dot-commers," she said. "They'd come even for lunch a couple of times a week. Now we're not even open for lunch. And we see repeat customers every month or so."
Recently, the restaurant dropped all of its prices 10 to 20 percent and got rid of its signature $60 tasting menu. The butter-roasted lobster is now $27, down from $33; the salad of young greens is $7, down from $9.
"Everyone I talked to is seeing a 10 to 15 percent drop-off," said Jeffrey L. Freburg, executive chef at Kuleto's, a popular Italian restaurant in Union Square. Mr. Freburg said his June revenue was around $670,000, down nearly $200,000 from June of last year, and part of the reason the restaurant was cutting staff. Similarly, at Infusion Restaurant, the contemporary American restaurant below the home office of Ms. Miller, the clairvoyant, patronage is down 25 percent since the year began, forcing the restaurant to cut its staff to 15, from 24, Rob Robinson, the owner, said.
Meanwhile, at Azie, which is about five blocks away, Ms. Vaughn can see another impact from the downturn firsthand. Across the street is a new residential development -- the Yerba Buena Lofts -- scheduled to open in several weeks at prices ranging from $400,000 to $800,000. Alan P. Mark, who handles marketing for the developer, said those prices were 5 to 10 percent lower than the company expected to reap a year ago. He said the company still hoped to sell all the units by the end of 2002.
The idea that San Francisco's economy is slowing is not to suggest the city has come to a standstill. The unemployment rate for the metropolitan area during June was 3.7 percent, compared with the national average of 4.5 percent. But that was up from 3.1 percent in May and 2.4 percent a year ago.
The overall number of jobs is actually up from the last year, to 1,114,700 from 1,096,100, but that has not been enough to keep pace with a growing population looking for work.
And not everyone is troubled by the shake-out. Some residents and businesses report the fall in demand has enabled them to negotiate lower rents, telling their landlords the market will no longer bear the returns of a year ago.
Diane Putnam, a longtime cab driver, said the city was less tense. She gets fewer fares -- 25 percent fewer some days -- but airport and freeway traffic is lighter, and her neighborhood is more livable. "I can find parking on the street now," said Ms. Putnam, with no small degree of enthusiasm. "Sometimes I think it's because there are a lot fewer sport utility vehicles taking up a space and a half."
Webmergers.com, an Internet site that matches buyers and sellers of start-ups, reports that 330 dot-com companies have closed this year across the country, already more than the 220 that shut down in all of 2000. Tim Miller, president of Webmergers.com, said that of those that have died, San Francisco accounted for around 31 percent. 
In the Silicon Valley vernacular, Mr. Miller said the shakeout was complete for "B2C" companies, the so-called business-to-consumer concerns that sold goods and services online; and he said the shakeout was just beginning for "B2B" companies -- business-to-business concerns. 
"The end of the B2C shakeout is overlapping with the beginning of the B2B shakeout," Mr. Miller said. He remained hopeful that the bottom of the downturn was getting close. The "death, misery and destruction," he said, "appears to be plateauing."
In the South of Market area, though, dot-coms continue to give way to other types of businesses, including a law firm and the Tarot-card-reading Ms. Miller.
"It's a good spot," said Ms. Miller, who charges $10 a reading from her second bedroom. "But I wish it was a little busier."

HEADLINE: Bush Ponders Aid for Only Domestic Supplier of Reactor Fuel 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23 

 BODY:
With Soviet-era nuclear weapons now providing more than half the uranium that powers American nuclear power plants, the Bush administration is weighing whether to provide support for the only American company that enriches uranium for reactor fuel.
 The under secretary of energy, Robert G. Card, told Congress last week that the administration was evaluating whether it was "economically feasible or necessary" to produce fuel domestically for nuclear reactors, or whether the country could reliably import uranium from Russia and elsewhere. Another possibility is that other American companies will enter the business. 
 The only domestic company that carries out a crucial processing step that results in enriched uranium, the United States Enrichment Corporation, is plagued by high costs at its 49-year-old factory, and competition from Russia and Western Europe. The administration is facing a decision on whether it should subsidize development of new technology to ensure a domestic supply of the fuel. 
The nuclear power industry, which supplies about 20 percent of the nation's electricity, had used self-sufficiency in uranium fuel as a major selling point for years.
The existence of a healthy domestic uranium industry was a premise of the 1993 agreement to buy highly enriched uranium from Russia for use in American power plants, and of a law that privatized the government's uranium processing plants. That law requires the president to certify annually that the domestic industry is "viable."
But the United States Enrichment Corporation has closed one of its two plants and is threatened by rising prices for electricity, flat demand for its services and competition from more efficient plants in Europe.
"We've already lost self-sufficiency," said Representative Ted Strickland, Democrat of Ohio, whose district includes the plant that was closed by the company. "We're in danger of losing the capacity even to maintain a domestic industry."
Mr. Strickland is seeking federal money to develop new enrichment technology, but industry experts say the price may be too high.
John R. Longenecker, a consultant and a former deputy assistant secretary of energy, offered a dim view of the company's future. "They're stuck with the highest cost of production," he said, "the oldest production capacity and no proven advanced technology, even if they could borrow the money to build it." 
The United States has spent $7 billion on two advanced technologies that were deemed impractical. Company officials say they are exploring another advanced system.
Other experts suggest that the Bush energy plan, and public statements by Vice President Dick Cheney supporting construction of new reactors, will ring hollow if the fuel is imported. The domestic mining industry has been withering away for years, largely because of lower-cost producers in Canada, Australia and elsewhere, but the importance of mining has waned as prices of uranium ore have declined.
What is at stake is a processing step called enrichment. The two plants sold by the government in 1998 were built to accept uranium with the two most common forms, uranium-238 and uranium-235, and sort them to raise the proportion of uranium-235, which is most useful in nuclear reactors and bombs. The technology used at both plants, gaseous diffusion, was developed during World War II, to make the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. Newer systems developed in Europe and the former Soviet Union are cheaper to operate; some use only one-fifth as much electricity. 
One reason the market for enrichment is depressed is that the United States agreed in 1993 to buy highly enriched uranium from Russia, with a uranium-235 content of more than 90 percent, to be blended down to the 5 percent level used by nuclear reactors. The idea was to take weapons material out of circulation and give the Russian nuclear program hard currency to keep Russian scientists and the material itself out of the hands of other countries. 
The company said that by the end of March it had received the equivalent of more than 4,500 warheads in the form of uranium for power plants. 
But because of commercial disputes, Russia has interrupted shipments four times. Charles Yulish, a company spokesman, said he believed that Russia would be a stable supplier in coming years because the company's payments, about $500 million a year, were "a very big factor in Russian revenues." A long-term contract is awaiting approval by the White House, Mr. Yulish said.

HEADLINE: Household Announces Changes in Lending Practices 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
Three days before a Senate committee is scheduled to hold hearings on predatory lending, Household International, one of the nation's largest consumer lenders, announced several changes it would make to practices that largely affect the lower-income families that are its main customers.
 Household, which operates the Household Finance and Beneficial lending operations, said it would reduce interest rates paid by some borrowers, eliminate some penalties for paying off loans early and lend as much as $10 million to people facing imminent foreclosure of their homes. The announcement came two weeks after Household said it would stop selling a type of loan insurance that consumer advocates have charged is little more than a tool for stripping the equity out of borrowers' homes. 
 Citigroup, the nation's largest consumer lender, said in late June that it would stop selling the same product, single-premium credit insurance. Last week, another big finance company, the American General Corporation, said it had also decided to drop the product, which requires a borrower to pay in advance for several years of insurance that would pay off the loan in the event of the borrower's death or disability. 
Household has been the prime target of criticism by some housing advocacy groups, including the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, known as Acorn. But company officials said the impending changes were unrelated to any pressure from those groups or Congress.
"It's not tied to hearings or activism or anything else in particular," said Craig Streem, a spokesman for Household, which is based in Prospect Heights, Ill. "We've been working on these for quite some time. So, it really is a coincidence."
Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has scheduled hearings for July 26 and 27 on the issue. Among those set to testify are four people identified as victims of predatory lending, including a Household customer. Other testimony will come from community activists and representatives of banking industry groups, but no representatives of Household, Citigroup or American General, said a spokesman for Senator Sarbanes.
Household said the package of changes it planned would cost the company $35 million, but Mr. Streem said the company did not expect any material effect on its earnings. He said the company planned to stop penalizing borrowers for paying off loans early after the third year. It also planned to increase the discount it gave after the first two years to borrowers who make timely payments.
In a new twist, Household said it would try to rescue people who were on the verge of losing their homes to other lenders that had engaged in predatory practices.
Maude Hurd, national president of Acorn, said the changes would not satisfy the company's critics. "While Household proposes a small amount of money for loans to rescue the victims of predatory loans, they do nothing to help the thousands of victims of their own practices," she said in a statement.
Mr. Streem said Household also planned to start offering loans with lower interest rates -- what he called a "primelike rate" -- to more creditworthy customers. But he said the company had no plans to reduce much higher "subprime" rates charged to borrowers with weaker credit ratings, a change that Acorn representatives have demanded.
"Price controls have never worked," Mr. Streem said. If Household cannot earn what it considers an appropriate return for lending in poor neighborhoods, he said, "we will not be funding loans in those neighborhoods."

HEADLINE: 1, 2, 3: Connecticut, New York And New Jersey Lead in Taxes 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
Connecticut, New York and New Jersey rank first, second and third among the 50 states in state and local taxes, and New York is the runaway leader in local taxes, a new Census Bureau study shows.
 Connecticut residents and businesses paid $4,425 per capita in state and local taxes during the state's 1998 fiscal year, followed closely by New York at $4,318. New Jersey was a distant third, at $3,698. In New York and Connecticut, the total bill was more than 50 percent above the national average of $2,863, according to the study, released last week. 
 When the tax burden is figured in proportion to personal incomes -- which many economists consider a better basis for comparison than sheer dollars -- New York and its neighbors were closer to the norm in other parts of the country.
Nationally, state and local taxes totaled 11.2 percent of Americans' personal income. New York ranked second by that measure, as well, slightly behind Maine, at 14.2 percent of personal incomes, 27 percent above the national average. Connecticut ranked eighth, at 12.5 percent of personal incomes, and New Jersey was near the middle of the pack, at 11.5 percent.
New York was one of just two states, along with New Hampshire, where more was collected in local taxes than in state taxes. Local taxes in New York were $2,329 per capita, more than double the national average of $1,113, and far ahead of the second-place state, New Jersey, at $1,775. New Hampshire ranked third, at $1,565, and Connecticut fourth, at $1,556. 
Connecticut had the highest rate of state taxes, at $2,869 per person, while New York and New Jersey were not among the highest.
The District of Columbia had a much higher tax burden than any state, collecting $5,524 from each resident, an amount equal to 15.1 percent of personal incomes.
New Jersey easily topped the nation in property taxes, often a politically charged issue in that state, at $1,744 per person. Connecticut was third, at $1,533; and New York, where efforts at reducing property taxes came after 1998, was fourth, at $1,345.
New York ranked second in personal income tax, even after cutting its tax rates by 25 percent in the mid-1990's, with an average collection of $1,294 per person, slightly behind Massachusetts. That was nearly twice the national average of $650. Connecticut ranked sixth, at $1,040. New Jersey, which also cut income taxes in the mid-90's, was nearly average, at $693.

HEADLINE: Albany Ponders a Bare-Bones Bill to End Budget Gridlock 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 23 

 BODY:
After nearly four months of stalemate over the state's budget, Assembly and Senate leaders are considering passing a stripped-down version of the governor's spending plan and then resolving major disagreements in a supplementary budget later this year.
 The details of the proposal had yet to be worked out today, but the Democratic Assembly speaker and the Republican Senate majority leader both expressed strong support for the idea, suggesting that it is likely to happen. 
 Passing a bare-bones budget would relieve lawmakers of criticism that they have failed to do their jobs, and buy them time to see how much revenue comes in later this year. The main sticking point in negotiations has been a disagreement between Democrats and Republicans about the jittery economy and future revenues. 
The Democrats who control the Assembly also hope the gambit will entice Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, to become involved in negotiations, since the spending plan would not include many of his new programs and tax cuts. The plan could backfire, however, if the governor accepts the austere budget and spends the surplus it would produce during the coming election year.
"We will have to give him an incentive to engage in conversation," the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said of Mr. Pataki.
The governor was in Washington today for the funeral of Katharine Graham, publisher of The Washington Post, and had little to say about the idea of a scaled-back budget. His chief spokesman, Michael McKeon, said he was waiting to see details.
The governor has been saying for months that he did his job when he presented a $83.6 billion budget in January, and that it was up to the Legislature to act on it. But Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, has refused to negotiate and pass a budget with the Republican-led Senate unless the governor agrees not to veto many of Democrats' initiatives, as he did in 1998.
The scaled-back budget would continue state spending for most departments at last year's levels, including school aid, legislative leaders said. New programs, tax reductions and spending increases, however, would be taken out of the governor's proposed budget and dealt with later, in the supplementary appropriations bill.
Since the Legislature would be passing versions of the governor's own budget bills, state law would prohibit him from vetoing the plan. Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno said they hoped the governor would then enter three-way talks on a supplementary budget that would be a catch-all for all the big-ticket proposals left out of the initial package, among them school aid increases, various transportation projects and a fund to clean up toxic waste sites.
"What we want to do is to provide for the continuity of government and continue to battle for the things we thing are important," Mr. Silver said. 
The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said the minimalist budget "creates some stability and some certainty" for school districts, cities and state workers while the Legislature and the governor try to come to an agreement on how much additional money can be spent this year. He pointed out that the revenues for the first three months of this fiscal year were at least $285 million more than the governor had predicted.
"We are also trying to buy some time," Senator Bruno said. "This gives us another month or two while we are debating these open items."
For the 17th consecutive year, the Legislature failed to pass a budget for the fiscal year that begins April 1, despite a 1999 law that docks the lawmakers' pay until a budget is approved.
This year, Mr. Silver has accused Mr. Pataki of grossly underestimating revenues to build up a surplus he could spend during his re-election bid. Mr. Pataki, in turn, has claimed that Mr. Silver has proposed more than $2 billion in irresponsible spending increases in a shaky economy. The Senate Republicans are in the middle, asking to spend an additional $1 billion above the governor's plan.
Mr. Pataki has refused to approve any spending above the 5 percent increase he proposed in January.
The Assembly Democrats have been holding out for more money for education, health care and environmental protections, while their Republican counterparts in the Senate have been advocating, among other things, tax incentives to help the biotechnology industry. The government has been limping along on emergency spending measures.
If the two houses were to pass a stripped-down budget, they would then, under the state's constitution, be free to send the governor their own appropriations bills. They may, for instance, pass a larger school aid package than the governor wants, putting him on the spot to either sign it or veto it. 
Democrats also hope that passing such a spending plan will shift the focus away from the chronic lateness of the budget and cast a spotlight on the issues being debated in the supplementary bill. The idea is not new. Thirty years ago, the Legislature, as a rule, passed the governor's budget in April and then spent much of the rest of the year arguing about a supplemental budget, one that was often chock-full of pork-barrel projects.

HEADLINE: The Federal Reserve Is Now Finding the Limits of Its Power 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23 

 BODY:
Despite six interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year and the possibility of more to come, analysts say that monetary policy is packing less of a punch so far than expected.
 The Fed's rate reductions work to the degree that they ripple through the banking system and the financial markets into the economy. And in this business cycle the three main vehicles through which lower rates affect business, investor and consumer behavior -- the stock, bond and currency markets -- have remained persistently unresponsive to the Fed's actions. 
 All year long, economists have predicted that the central bank's rate cuts would ultimately kick in with something like their usual force, stimulating a recovery from the economic slowdown. But one factor after another has conspired to dampen or delay the effects of the looser monetary policy on the markets and the economy. 
"Monetary policy has a major problem in reviving the economy by itself in the year ahead," said David Hale, chief economist for the Zurich Group. "The best the Fed can do for us is a modest growth rate. To do better, the technology recession has got to end."
Disappointing corporate earnings reports have kept stock prices in check all year, and only seem to have grown worse in recent weeks. Worries that inflation might make a comeback next year, and growing concern that the federal government might not be able to pay off as much of its debt as projected, have kept long-term interest rates in the bond market from falling below where they were when the Fed began cutting rates in January.
Increasing evidence over the last few months that global economic growth has slowed has pushed up the value of the dollar -- the opposite of what normally happens when the Fed is cutting rates -- making life harder for American exporters and multinational companies.
The potency of monetary policy is also being diluted by the nature of the slowdown, economists said.
The most powerful brake on the economy right now is not the portion of the economy sensitive to lower interest rates -- industries like housing, and consumer spending generally -- but the steep decline in spending by businesses on new factories, computers, telecommunications equipment and other capital goods.
Capital spending, especially on technology, is likely to remain weak for some time, even if the Fed continues cutting the short-term interest rates it controls. And until capital spending recovers, economists said, the economy will have trouble returning to the kind of robust growth it enjoyed until late last year.
Both Wall Street and Main Street are often impatient with monetary policy, which has always worked with long and unpredictable lags. It is not unusual for interest rate policy to be impeded by other forces. During the last recession, in the early 1990's, the Fed had to cope with crippling problems among banks and savings and loan institutions.
No one is saying that monetary policy is completely ineffectual. For one thing, economic conditions would probably be a lot worse if the Fed had not been so aggressive in cutting rates this year. And Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told Congress last week that the central bank's rate cuts appeared to have set the stage for economic improvement later in the year. He is scheduled to give further testimony on Tuesday.
Moreover, the economy has other forces working in its favor. The tax cut signed into law last month by President Bush will help as rebate checks begin showing up at most households this summer. Energy prices are falling. Consumers have kept their wallets open.
The consensus among most economists is that the economy should bottom out in the next few months and begin a gradual recovery by the end of the year.
Still, economists said the Fed was clearly getting less bang for the buck than it would hope for with its rate cuts, suggesting that the rebound could be modest and drawn out. 
In the most rapid rate reduction on record, the central bank has cut its benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks by 2.75 percentage points this year, to 3.75 percent. Mr. Greenspan has left open the door to at least one more rate cut. But some analysts say the Fed may have to reduce rates further, and keep them low for longer than investors seem to expect.
Monetary policy, said James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management, "may need to be far more aggressive than currently anticipated."
Persistent moves by the Fed to ease monetary policy would be expected to push up stock prices, pull down longer-term interest rates in the bond market and reduce the value of the dollar. All those factors would stimulate economic activity.
This year, however, the overall stock market has remained flat to down by most measures. Long-term interest rates have not fallen. Against some currencies, the dollar has actually shot up in value, inhibiting efforts by companies to offset weakness in their sales at home by selling more of their goods abroad.
"Normally when you have this kind of easing, you would get more help from stocks, bonds and the currency," said William C. Dudley of Goldman, Sachs. "In this case, the stock market's gone down, the dollar has appreciated and bond yields are little changed. What it tells you is that it's not reasonable to expect a big lift from monetary policy."
Stock prices typically rise when interest rates are falling. Rising stock prices would help the economy by making consumers feel wealthier and allowing companies to raise money on favorable terms.
But some analysts say it may be hard to reignite stock prices through lower interest rates because investors are concluding that corporate profits will not fully recover soon.
Competitive pressure to hold down or cut prices is immense, they say, and opportunities for improving profit margins by trimming corporate fat or finding efficiencies in technology could be limited in the next few years. 
Cuts in the short-term rates controlled by the Fed typically help pull down the longer-term rates set in the financial markets. In this case, though, longer-term rates had already fallen substantially last year, when the economy was starting to decelerate. They have not fallen further this year.
To some degree, the bond market seems to be looking beyond the next few months and into next year. And given that long-term rates were relatively low going into this year, interest-sensitive industries -- especially housing -- have held up quite well as the rest of the economy has slowed. But since those sectors of the economy never weakened much in the first place, they will not be able to play much of a role in leading a comeback.
"The composition of the current downturn has important implications for the economy's growth prospects in the year ahead," Mr. Hale said. "It is doubtful that monetary easing will give a significant boost to residential investment and durable goods consumption because neither sector has experienced a major downturn."
The sector of the economy that most needs help is manufacturing. At this point in a typical business cycle, the Fed's rate cuts could be expected to have pushed down the value of the American currency by reducing the return on investments made in dollars. 
But with the rest of the world slowing -- and investors nervous about outbreaks of instability in places like Argentina and Turkey -- the dollar has remained a haven even as growth in the United States has ground nearly to a halt. The dollar has appreciated strongly against other currencies, especially the euro, making it harder for American manufacturers to compete in export markets, and reducing profits earned abroad when they are translated back into dollars.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "What's Wrong With This Picture?"Cuts in interest rates by the Federal Reserve usually take time to stimulate the economy, but they appear to be less effective this year than in the past. One reason is that the stock, bond and currency markets have been unresponsive; another is that housing and auto sales never fell enough to help lead a rebound.

HEADLINE: Ties to a Neighborhood At Root of Court Fight 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: NEW LONDON, Conn., July 23 

 BODY:
Property owners in an old waterfront neighborhood argued today that their lifelong ties to their community would be destroyed if the city proceeded to demolish their buildings as part of a sweeping redevelopment plan.
 In the first day of a trial that follows three years of hostility over New London's plans for its future, homeowners, landlords and tenants testified about their roots in Fort Trumbull and the city's efforts to force them from the neighborhood. 
 The seven property owners claim that the city's use of eminent domain, or condemnation, is unconstitutional because the property is to be turned over to private developers. The federal and state Constitutions allow condemnation only for public use. 
The issue has arisen more and more in the last decade as local governments have grown bolder in efforts to attract economic development, especially to poor cities like New London. It is unusual, however, for property owners to get to trial with legal challenges, let alone win, because courts have held with few exceptions that economic redevelopment serves a public purpose.
The fight has been especially bitter in this city of 26,000, the fourth poorest in Connecticut.
One of the remaining homeowners, Susette Kelo, testified about turning down the city's offers to buy her house, then coming home the day before Thanksgiving last year to find a condemnation notice nailed to her front door. She said she was told that for as long as she remained in the house, she would have to pay rent.
Like the other plaintiffs in the nonjury trial before Judge Robert A. Martin of State Superior Court, Ms. Kelo insisted that she was not holding out for more money and not suing to stop the development. "I just want to be left alone," she said.
About 20 other residents and supporters sat in the courtroom, wearing stickers with the words "eminent domain abuse" circled and with a slash through them.
But lawyers for the city and the New London Development Corporation, the private, nonprofit group that is coordinating the project and has been given the power of condemnation, say they cannot work around scattered holdouts.
More important, they say, a suit like this threatens local governments' ability to carry out redevelopment plans approved by legislators. "The case will test the fundamental principle of the separation of powers," Thomas J. Londregan, the city's lawyer, said in his opening statement.
The city and the development corporation, which is also a defendant, say their planning meticulously followed state law. The agency's lawyer, Edward O'Connell, argued that the plaintiffs' real quarrel was with the General Assembly.
The city's plan followed the decision by Pfizer Inc., the pharmaceutical company, to build research and development headquarters on the Thames River across from Groton. At the same time, the state was restoring the nearby old fort as the centerpiece of a new state park.
City officials, seeing the surrounding neighborhood as a promising site for new development, marked off 90 acres for offices, a hotel and conference center, apartments and other unspecified new projects.
"We said, 'Why couldn't this be the economic engine for the whole city?' " Claire L. Gaudiani, the president of the New London Development Corporation, said in an interview last week.
David M. Goebel, the chief operating officer of the development corporation, acknowledged in testimony today that no developer had been signed for the project yet and that there were no definite plans for the property of some of the plaintiffs.
To many, the plan is reminiscent of the wholesale slum clearance projects of the 1950's, which fell out of favor after many cities were left with thousands of displaced poor people and acres of vacant lots.
No one contends that the Fort Trumbull neighborhood is blighted, however. Rather, the city contends that the area, which had half a dozen residential streets and much bigger swaths of abandoned or vacant land, should support greater development.
Mr. Goebel was questioned today by one of the plaintiffs' lawyers, Dana Berliner, about the degree of control that the city would have over the property. The plaintiffs maintain that any land deals to follow will benefit only private owners.

HEADLINE: Don't Dismiss the Genoa Protesters 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The "sea of faces that stretches from the streets of Seattle to those of Genoa," mentioned by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri (Op-Ed, July 20), has been there because no one is willing to listen to the representatives of the groups that raise informed criticisms of "how we globalize," the issue identified by Thomas L. Friedman in his column the same day. 
 The World Trade Organization, the White House, the United States trade representative, and the World Bank and International Monetary Fund show no willingness to engage with their critics, despite years of efforts by academic experts and nongovernment groups. 
If no one listens, and we get only pious slogans from the White House and other symbols of global leadership, what alternative does civil society have but to take to the streets to challenge "whether we globalize"?

HEADLINE: Isolated on Global Warming 

 BODY:
A wallflower at what might have been its own victory party, the United States could only watch yesterday as 178 countries agreed on a deal that salvages the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and commits the rest of the industrialized world to orderly, mandatory reductions in the gases that are believed responsible for the warming of the earth's atmosphere. The door was left open for the Bush administration to sign on at any time in the future. But that seems unlikely. President Bush has already called the treaty "fatally flawed," and nothing said yesterday by Paula Dobriansky, the under secretary of state who led an essentially irrelevant American delegation at the talks, suggested any change in Mr. Bush's thinking. 
 The agreement must still be ratified by 55 industrialized countries, and even then will not be nearly as effective as it might have been if the United States, which emits one-fourth of the world's greenhouse gases, had signed on. Even so, the agreement will immediately increase the pressure on the administration to develop a plausible alternative strategy. Key Democrats are already calling for big reductions in carbon dioxide, the main global warming gas, through cleaner power plants, industrial processes and vehicles. 
 There is also pressure from the business community. Many corporate leaders are convinced that the United States will eventually have to join in fighting global warming, and would prefer to begin making capital investments now than waiting until the last minute, when the job will be more expensive. Some corporate leaders are also worried that without binding targets, American companies will have no incentive to develop technologies to reduce global warming gases, thereby ceding a lucrative market to the Europeans and the Japanese. 
The huge irony is that this agreement was tailored in many respects to American specifications -- and with an eye to reducing the putative burdens on America's economy that Mr. Bush used as an excuse to abandon not only the protocol but also his campaign pledge to impose mandatory controls on carbon dioxide. The agreement includes at least two important strategies that President Bill Clinton and Al Gore insisted on in Kyoto four years ago. One is an emissions trading scheme that is designed to use market mechanisms to allow countries to achieve their emissions targets at the lowest possible cost. The other is the so-called "clean development mechanism" under which rich countries can earn credits by providing cutting-edge clean-air technologies to poorer countries.
Cementing the deal required softening some of Kyoto's emissions targets as well as making concessions to Japan, which sought and received extra credits toward its target for protecting its forests, which act as a "sink" for carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. And while the revised agreement gives extra credit to Japan for protecting its own forests, it perversely awards no credit at all for projects designed to stop tropical deforestation elsewhere. But even the severest critics conceded that these shortcomings were not disqualifying given the importance of the agreement as a whole.
The hope now is to have the necessary ratifications in hand by the 10th anniversary of the 1992 Rio Summit on global warming in Johannesburg next year. It was at Rio that Mr. Bush's father first committed the United States to a global effort to reduce greenhouse gases. There is still time for his son to honor that commitment.

HEADLINE: Remarks by John Paul 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: ROME, July 23 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Pope John Paul II's statement to President Bush today:
 In recent days, the worlds attention has been focused on the process of globalization, which has so greatly accelerated in the past decade and which you and other leaders of the industrialized nations have discussed in Genoa. While appreciating the opportunities for economic growth and material prosperity which this process offers, the church cannot but express profound concern that our world continues to be divided, no longer by the former political and military blocs, but by a tragic fault line between those who can benefit from these opportunities and those who seem cut off from them. The revolution of freedom of which I spoke at the United Nations in 1995 must now be completed by a revolution of opportunity, in which all the world's peoples actively contribute to economic prosperity and share in its fruits. This requires leadership by those nations whose religious and cultural traditions should make them most attentive to the moral dimension of the issues involved. Respect for human dignity and belief in the equal dignity of all the members of the human family demand policies aimed at enabling all peoples to have access to the means required to improve their lives . . . 
 Another area in which political and moral choices have the gravest consequences for the future of civilization concerns the most fundamental of human rights, the right to life itself. Experience is already showing how a tragic coarsening of consciences accompanies the assault on innocent human life in the womb, leading to accommodation and acquiescence in the face of other related evils such as euthanasia, infanticide and, most recently, proposals for the creation for research purposes of human embryos, destined to destruction in the process. A free and virtuous society, which America aspires to be, must reject practices that devalue and violate human life at any stage from conception until natural death.

HEADLINE: Germ Warfare Talks Open in London; U.S. Is the Pariah 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 23 

 BODY:
European nations and other major powers today urged the completion of a draft agreement to enforce the 1972 ban on biological weapons, a move that puts them at odds with the Bush administration.
 Speaking on behalf of the European Union, Marc Baptist of Belgium told negotiators in Geneva that the draft accord, while not perfect, was still the best way to strengthen the ban on germ weapons. 
 The European endorsement, and support for the agreement by a raft of other nations, has left the Bush administration increasingly isolated on an important arms control issue.
After an extensive review this spring, the Bush administration has concluded that the draft accord is flawed beyond repair. And United States officials have traveled around the world to inform allies of the assessment. 
Donald H. Mahley, the American representative to the talks, is not scheduled to address the negotiating session, which opened today, until Wednesday. But there is a widespread concern in Geneva that he will announce Washington's opposition to the monitoring accord. 
In Washington today, a State Department spokesman said that more work needs to be done to strengthen the ban on germ weapons, but gave no indication of how it could be done.
The mounting debate comes at a particularly awkward time for the Bush administration. With President Bush visiting Europe, the White House has sought to counter criticism that it is relying too much on its plans for a missile shield and not enough on arms control to deal with the threat of a nuclear, chemical or germ weapon attack.
On Sunday, Mr. Bush said he would seek a new understanding with Moscow on antimissile systems and offensive nuclear weapons. And earlier this month, the State Department sent a cable to American diplomats instructing them to make the case that Washington supports multilateral efforts to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. 
At the core of the dispute is the 1972 treaty, which 143 nations, including the United States, have ratified and which prohibits the development, production and possession of biological weapons. 
When that treaty was negotiated, it had no provision for verification, a major limitation because most of the nations suspected of making biological weapons have signed the accord. 
So six years ago, international negotiators began discussing a further protocol that would establish measures to monitor the ban, an effort that was backed by the Clinton administration. The goal was to conclude the agreement by November, and a new round of talks began today.
Throughout the talks, Washington has had conflicting objectives. While it has sought to discourage cheating it has also tried to limit foreign inspectors' access to American bio-defense installations and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in order to protect military and trade secrets.
Under the current draft, for example, a new executive council would be established and a majority vote of council members would be needed to investigate a suspicious plant. 
Supporters of the accord insist that the protocol was never intended to provide an iron-clad verification but rather to increase the odds that cheaters would be caught.
But the Bush administration's review concluded that a nation that was determined to cheat would be able to find a way to do so. At the same time, the administration concluded, the draft accord would grant foreign inspectors too much access to American installations and companies.
As word of the administration's review spread, allies were quick to register their dissatisfaction. The European Union, whose members have their own pharmaceutical industries, said the draft accord, for all of its flaws, was the best way to combat the germ weapon threat. Britain, Washington's closest European ally, has been particularly supportive of the draft protocol.
The Japanese complained that the international community would be signaling "rogue states" that it was not serious about cracking down on germ weapons if it abandoned the effort to craft a new accord.
To blunt the criticism that the United States was turning a blind eye to the problem, some American officials recommended that the White House develop an alternative approach to strengthen the protocol. But American officials say the Bush administration review has yet to identify options that might garner international support.
As a new round of negotiations began today, Bush administration officials said there would be many obstacles to an accord even if Washington went along. Russia and China, United States officials said, are reluctant to allow on-site inspections, while Iran has sought to use the negotiations to weaken controls on the export of biological materials.
But today, Russia, China and Iran were among the nations that called for the accord's completion, perhaps calculating that they had a rare chance to show up the Americans. South Africa, Pakistan and Chile also endorsed the draft agreement. 
A senior United States official insisted that the administration had taken a principled, if unpopular, stance. A nation that was determined to cheat could elude detection under the accord, he said. 
"There are some cases where a bad document is worse than no document," he said.
But Elisa Harris, a former specialist on biological weapons on President Bill Clinton's National Security Council and a research fellow at the University of Maryland, said the Bush administration had not presented a strategy to stop the spread of germ weapons.
"If the Bush administration does not support the protocol, how would it deter other nations from developing biological weapons?" she said. "What does this say to cheaters about the U.S. commitment to enforce the biological weapons convention?"

HEADLINE: Schumer Announces Support For New L.I. Power Plant 

BYLINE:  By ELISSA GOOTMAN 

DATELINE: MELVILLE, N.Y., July 23 

 BODY:
In an unusual show of solidarity for a project that some environmentalists and politicians would rather steer clear of, Senator Charles E. Schumer and an economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council announced support today for a proposal to build a 250-megawatt power plant here.
 Flanked by officials from the Long Island Power Authority and the KeySpan Energy Corporation, Mr. Schumer and Ashok Gupta, a senior energy economist at the resources council, endorsed the project at a news conference at the proposed site: a 31-acre former sand pit on a road off Route 110, near the border of Nassau and Suffolk Counties. 
 In May, the Long Island Power Authority and KeySpan announced that they would seek the series of state and local approvals required to build the $300 million natural-gas-fired plant, to be called the Spagnoli Road Energy Center. The project has been greeted with nods of approval, or at least with none of the outcry that power plant proposals often generate. 
Today's endorsement went a step further, with Mr. Schumer calling on the New York Public Service Commission to expedite a potentially cumbersome approval process. He also called on the utilities to expand their current plans, which call for one combined-cycle generator, which uses heat produced when fuel is burned to power a second generator. If built, it would be ready by the summer of 2004 at the earliest.
"I believe they should even explore doing more here," the senator said. "This is an appropriate site with an appropriate level of environmental control for a power plant. There aren't too many sites like this."
Mr. Schumer said that while energy conservation was critical to ensuring that Long Island would not suffer California-like blackouts in the summers to come, conservation alone would not solve the problems of an area rich in air-conditioners but isolated from regional power grids.
"We need more conservation first and foremost, but we also need more supply of electricity, if it's done in the right way," Mr. Schumer said.
Not everyone is so sanguine about the Melville proposal.
Gordian Raacke, executive director of the Citizens Advisory Panel, a watchdog group that monitors energy utilities on Long Island, said Mr. Schumer's support was premature.
"Absent an energy master plan and absent any sort of priorities as to how we plan to meet future energy demand on Long Island, we should not be making these far-reaching and very expensive decisions," Mr. Raacke said. "Because we don't have a road map, it is therefore premature for Senator Schumer to endorse this plan, especially given that we have not fully tapped into the energy conservation potential on the island."
He acknowledged that the Melville site, which is more than a mile from the nearest house, might be an appropriate place for a power plant. But he said, "It's difficult to compare this proposal to all the other options if we haven't evaluated them."
Mr. Gupta praised the proposed plant as "an excellent project" so far as technology and cleanliness are concerned. But he agreed that a master plan to address Long Island's energy demands and capabilities was lacking, and needed.
"We can always support new power plants, but it has to be part of an overall policy," he said. "I don't think we're there yet."
Richard M. Kessel, the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, said the need was immediate. Long Island's energy demand was projected to rise to between 3,800 and 4,200 megawatts early this week, he said. The total capacity for that period is estimated at 4,459 megawatts.
"Believe me, there is a crisis out there," Mr. Kessel said. "And those numbers tell the story."

178 Nations, but Not U.S., Agree on Emissions Curbs
One hundred seventy-eight countries agreed in Bonn to require industrial countries to cut emissions of gases linked to global warming, a deal that rescued the preliminary accord, the Kyoto Protocol, by softening it. The United States stayed on the sideline. President Bush has repudiated Kyoto as "fatally flawed" for placing too much of the clean-up burden on industrial countries and for being too costly to the American economy. A1

HEADLINE: BUSH PANEL BACKS LEGALIZING STATUS OF SOME MIGRANTS 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23 

 BODY:
A cabinet-level panel has recommended that President Bush endorse a limited plan allowing some of the estimated three million Mexicans living in the United States illegally to apply for permanent legal status, a White House spokesman said today. 
 Some administration officials and outside experts said that perhaps one million to two million of the illegal Mexican immigrants might ultimately meet eligibility requirements, based on their job history and how long they have been here. The exact terms have not been determined, administration officials said. 
 Even so, such a program, if adopted by Congress, would be one of the largest attempts to legalize the status of illegal residents in American history. A 1986 law granted legal status to about three million illegal immigrants from several countries. 
In a confidential one-page memorandum sent to the White House late on Friday, a working group headed by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Attorney General John Ashcroft addressed, at least for now, only unlawful Mexicans, who make up the bulk of the estimated seven million to eight million illegal immigrants in the United States. 
Democrats and immigrant groups have urged the administration to expand any legalization plan to include illegal immigrants from other countries. 
A White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said no decisions had been made on that issue or on many other details of the proposal. 
The stakes are high for Mr. Bush. He is trying to remake relations with Mexico and at the same time court Latino voters who would be crucial to any re-election bid in 2004.
The legalization plan is the most sensitive result of broader discussions on border and migration issues that Mr. Bush and President Vicente Fox of Mexico began in February. Secretary Powell and Mr. Ashcroft, and their Mexican counterparts, were delegated to develop recommendations before the two presidents meet in Washington in early September. 
Allowing illegal immigrants to change their status would be a central component of a new, ambitious temporary-worker program that American and Mexican officials are discussing. It would let some unlawful Mexicans living in the United States legalize their status and also permit future migrants to earn legal residency.
"The panel recommends consideration of a new temporary-worker program that would allow for some of the workers to achieve permanent residency status over a period of time," Mr. McClellan said. 
Congress is already considering legislation to expand and streamline a temporary farm-worker program that would let undocumented laborers of any nationality earn permanent residency under certain conditions. It is estimated that 50 percent to 80 percent of the 1.6 million farm workers in the United States are illegal immigrants, most from Mexico. 
Building on that effort, Secretary Powell and Mr. Ashcroft recommended that the White House, for now, consider legalizing the status of illegal Mexican workers in sectors other than agriculture. They include a diverse array of workers, from health-care aides to meatpackers, and together could be three to four times the number of farm workers.
The White House would work closely with Congress on pending legislation for a new agriculture guest-worker program, Mr. McClellan said. That program, administration officials said, might serve as a model for a larger temporary-worker initiative. 
Indeed, two leaders of a bipartisan guest-worker program, Senators Gordon H. Smith, Republican of Oregon, and Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, met with Elaine L. Chao, the secretary of labor, on Thursday to discuss their ideas. 
In the week since the first outline of a legalization plan for Mexicans emerged, more details of the internal deliberations of the administration's working group have become known, like the range of how many Mexicans may qualify.
"The president is pleased with the progress we are making through the high-level working groups," Mr. McClellan said. "We're working toward a shared goal of a more orderly, safe and humane border." 
Proponents said that such a guest-worker program, with labor and wage protections built in, would allow Mexicans to travel back and forth across the border without fear of arrest. It would also acknowledge the growing interdependence of the Mexican and American economies. 
Mr. Bush's initiative caught Democrats off guard. Championing immigrants' rights has long been one of their most potent issues, especially with Latino voters, and Democratic leaders, while commending the White House's efforts, have sought to up the ante. 
"We believe it's time to pass a broad legalization program for undocumented, longtime workers -- not just Mexican workers, as some in the administration have suggested," Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, said last week. 
Other immigrant groups have demanded inclusion, but they also acknowledge Mexico's special border status with the United States.
"We would wish the administration would legalize everyone, but we're mindful that Mexicans are the largest immigrant group in the U.S.," said Oscar Chacon, president of the Salvadoran-American National Network, an advocacy group, who estimated that about 400,000 of the 1.5 million Salvadorans here are undocumented.
Mr. Bush faces a challenge from Republicans who oppose any legalization plan and support new limits on legal immigration. But the pro-immigrant bloc within his party is applauding a temporary-worker plan that includes legalization. 
"The president's goal is to eliminate to a great extent the black market in labor that now exists," said Senator Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican. "That can save lives and improve the marketplace by providing legal and orderly mechanisms for U.S. employers to hire available workers." 
Some Republicans, like Senator John Ensign of Nevada, said that Mr. Bush had to publicly support the legalization plan.
"Nobody has the bully pulpit that the president has," said Mr. Ensign, whose aides are scheduled to go to the White House on Tuesday to discuss the proposal. Nevada's Latino population jumped to 349,000 in 2000 from 121,300 in 1990, according to the latest census figures. 
Senior Bush administration officials have been reluctant to comment publicly on any plan which still has so many loose ends. 
But on Friday, Secretary Powell, while ruling out any blanket amnesty, seemed to embrace a temporary-worker program that would allow for legalization.
"We're proud of the fact that we offer opportunities for people to come to this country and to make a living, some to go back, some to ultimately become American citizens," he said. 
And then Secretary Powell added, "We want to regularize this. We want to make it less dangerous, less threatening to become a citizen, if that is where your destiny takes you."

HEADLINE: Powell Seeks to Put Japan First, but U.S. May Find Itself Left Out 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, July 24 

 BODY:
On his trip to Asia, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell insisted that Japan, with which Washington wants to strengthen its ties, would be the first port of call. By going out of his way to put Tokyo at the top of his five-nation list -- if only for seven waking hours -- the secretary wanted to demonstrate Japan's importance to the United States.
 But soon after arriving here Monday night, he discovered that the new government of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, by agreeing to a compromise with the Europeans, had played the pivotal role in isolating the United States at a conference of the world's industrialized countries on climate change. 
 In so doing, Japan rescued the Kyoto protocol on climate change from extinction and increased the possibility of eventual ratification of the treaty that President Bush has said his administration will have no part of. Secretary Powell put the best face on the Japanese move, saying that Mr. Koizumi had expressed a preference for finding a way "to move forward with the United States."
The Bush administration has welcomed the popular Mr. Koizumi as a breath of fresh air in a stagnant political and economic scene here and is placing considerable faith in his ability to pull off an ambitious economic reform program. 
In the longer term, Secretary Powell and Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage have said that they want to strengthen the military relationship with Japan and, in particular, hope that the Japanese will take on more responsibilities in the region. Mr. Armitage, who is the secretary's closest adviser, argued last year in a widely read paper, which was also co-authored by other senior Bush administration officials, that the special relationship between the United States and Britain should be the model for the Japanese-American alliance. 
But before tackling that, Secretary Powell and Mr. Armitage argue that Japan must improve its economy. 
The omens for the economy were quite mixed as Secretary Powell arrived. The Tokyo stock exchange tumbled to a 16-year low Monday, apparently in alarm over aspects of Mr. Koizumi's proposed economic austerity program. The Prime Minister has said he will force Japanese banks to write off bad loans, estimated at between $300 billion and $1.2 trillion.
Secretary Powell met today with Japanese economic specialists assembled at the American embassy for a roundtable discussion. The idea was for him to learn more about the economic reform agenda. He then met with Mr. Koizumi, who had just returned from the Genoa summit of industrialized countries.
The State Department worked overtime to try to ensure that Secretary Powell's brief interlude here was not dominated by recent incidents of American soldiers who have been arrested at the Okinawa base. But in the Japanese press, the arrest of an American soldier on charges of rape and his eventual release to the custody of Japanese authorities has dominated. The Japanese were critical that it took four days for the Pentagon to hand over the soldier for what the Japanese called a heinous crime. The secretary said the United States does "everything we can to instruct our youngsters as to how to behave as guests in Japan, especially in Okinawa, but there will be these occasional incidents."
Overall, the secretary stressed, the 50,000 American troops in Japan "are playing an important and valuable role."
"I don't think it is possible," he said "for us to remove our presence from Okinawa and I don't think that is the position of the Japanese government."

HEADLINE: 178 NATIONS REACH A CLIMATE ACCORD; U.S. ONLY LOOKS ON 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: BONN, July 23 

 BODY:
With the Bush administration on the sidelines, the world's leading countries hammered out a compromise agreement today finishing a treaty that for the first time would formally require industrialized countries to cut emissions of gases linked to global warming.
 The agreement, which was announced here today after three days of marathon bargaining, rescued the Kyoto Protocol, the preliminary accord framed in Japan in 1997, that was the first step toward requiring cuts in such gases. That agreement has been repudiated by President Bush, who has called it "fatally flawed," saying it places too much of the cleanup burden on industrial countries and would be too costly to the American economy. 
 Today, his national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, said in Rome, where the president met with the pope, "I don't believe that it is a surprise to anyone that the United States believes that this particular protocol is not in its interests, nor do we believe that it really addresses the problem of global climate change." She reiterated that the president had created a task force to come up with alternatives. 
The agreement by 178 countries was largely the product of give and take involving Japan, Australia, Canada and the European Union. But Japan's role was crucial because it is the largest economy after the United States and its opposition would have killed any agreement.
Largely as a result of concessions to Japan, the product is a significantly softened version of the Kyoto accord, allowing industrial nations with the greatest emissions of greenhouse gases, principally carbon dioxide, to achieve their cuts with greater flexibility. For example, Japan won a provision to receive credits for reducing the gases by protecting forests that absorb carbon dioxide.
Still, the agreement is a binding contract among nations -- excluding the United States -- under which 38 industrialized countries must reduce those emissions by 2012 or face tougher emissions goals. Those countries now account for close to half of the emissions. The agreement now moves to a complex ratification process that calls for approval from the biggest polluting countries, which can be achieved even with United States opposition.
Officials from the European Union exulted over the compromise. Olivier Deleuze, the energy and sustainability secretary of Belgium, said there were easily 10 things in the final texts that he could criticize. "But," he said, "I prefer an imperfect agreement that is living than a perfect agreement that doesn't exist."
The Kyoto accord calls for the 38 industrialized countries by 2012 to reduce their combined annual gas emissions to 5.2 percent below levels measured in 1990. It set a different, negotiated target for each, with Japan, for example, accepting a target of cutting gas emissions back to 6 percent below 1990 emissions. Those targets were included in the Kyoto agreement and were untouched by the compromise today. Developing countries do not have to do anything to reduce emissions.
The biggest sticking point was how much to penalize countries that miss their targets. Japan held out for a fairly painless system. Europe wanted countries that missed targets in the first commitment period, from 2008 to 2012, to pledge to reduce more carbon dioxide in the next period, with the equivalent of penalties plus interest.
On that point, Europe got its way.
The talks also clarified the design of the first global system for buying and selling credits earned by reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Such a system tends to focus investment in pollution cleanups where the job can be done effectively and cheaply.
In general, Japan was in the driver's seat. After Mr. Bush rejected the treaty, Japan became a pivotal player. It sought, and received, extra credits toward its emissions goals for protecting its forests.
Forest experts calculated that the credits for forests essentially would drop Japan's target from 6 percent below 1990 levels to just 2 percent below. Canada and Russia would gain large forest credits as well.
But climate scientists said that in most cases the forest credits were not as big a gift as they seemed, and that economic growth -- if continued as projected -- would put all the industrialized countries listed under the treaty 15 or 20 percent above their 1990 levels. So a drop even close to 1990 figures would be a big change, they said, essentially lessening the benefit of the forest credits.
Still, some participants grumbled about countries getting credit for gas reductions "by watching trees grow," as one environmentalist put it. The compromise was laced with of something for just about everyone.
The European Union pledged $410 million a year through the first years of the treaty to help developing countries adapt to climate change and build the technological ability to avoid adding to the problem. 
That was something demanded by, among others, Saudi Arabia, among the group of developing countries that are not required to reduce their emissions. 
The difficulties in moving ahead on the Kyoto Protocol far exceeded those surrounding other environmental treaties, experts said, because the treaty, by controlling carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, would limit something released by almost every act of daily living.
That this was an economic as well as environmental treaty was evident at every turn.
"This protocol is about the climate, but it is also about the interests of each country," explained Ali Al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister. 
Indeed, he said, Saudi Arabia's interest lay not so much in curtailing gases, but in preventing economic disruption should the treaty lead the world to curtail its use of oil.
Much of the momentum appeared to be maintained personally by Jan Pronk, the indefatigable Dutch environment minister and chairman of the talks here. Mr. Pronk often locked himself in a room with clusters of delegates. By dawn today, dozens of delegates were sprawled asleep on every spare cushion and couch in the meeting rooms of the Maritim Hotel. 
In the end, the diverse array of countries at the table, faced with the possibility of an embarrassing collapse of the entire treaty, overcame their differences. 
The compromise caps a six-year struggle between a group of industries and countries that claimed mandatory emissions caps would harm economies, and environmental groups and other nations that saw such limits as the only way to stave off potentially disruptive climate shifts.
At the meeting, there were unusual combinations of interests, with companies that build nuclear power plants eager to jump into the climate fight because nuclear power produces electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. Japan, Canada, China and other countries supported credits toward emission targets by substituting nuclear power.
But the European Union, despite wide use of nuclear power in some large European countries, insisted there be no nuclear option in the agreement.
To some of the participants here, the achievement was a bit hollow given that the United States, which by some measurements accounts for about 25 percent of greenhouse gases, chose not to participate.
Others noted that, among them, the three dozen industrialized countries that supported the treaty language accounted for far more emissions than the United States.
Environmental campaigners said Europe had proved it could lead despite its sometimes fragmented appearance.
"There's really a new force on the world stage," said Philip Clapp, the president of the National Environmental Trust, a lobbying group based in Washington. "If the United States will not lead, Europe can and will."
Many of the negotiators from other countries held out hope that, eventually, the United States would rejoin the pact. 
Chances of that happening in the short run are slim. During the session celebrating the accord, Paula Dobrianksy, the under secretary of state for global affairs, congratulated the parties to the protocol but reiterated a common theme of the Bush administration -- that it was "not sound policy." She did not come to Bonn with any alternative ideas.
Japan's environment minister, Yoriko Kawaguchi, in a clear reference to the United States, said it was important to try to build a bridge between the Kyoto process and countries waiting on the sidelines.
"In order to achieve the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol, we need to have the widest possible participation of countries," Ms. Kawaguchi said. "We should try to encourage all our friends to join us in our common effort to address global warming."

GRAPHIC: Photo: The chairman of the conference, Jan Pronk, right, of the Netherlands, and Michael Zammit Cutajar of Malta, the conference secretary. (Agence France-Presse)(pg. A11) Chart: "AT A GLANCE: Compromise in Bonn"The accord reached in Bonn yesterday to save the 1997 Kyoto protocol included concessions to entice countries to ratify the treaty. EMISSION CREDITS: Over European objections, countries will be able to earn emission credits for carbon sinks, areas that pull carbon dioxide from the air, like forests and cropland. Countries like Australia, Canada and Japan had fought for such credits. TRADING EMISSION RIGHTS: Countries that do not meet their own emission targets can buy emission rights from countries that do better than required. Countries like Russia, where factory closings since 1990 have already reduced emissions, could reap a financial windfall selling emission rights. CREDIT FOR INVESTMENT: Industrialized countries can earn emission credits for investing in emission-reducing projects in developing countries, allowing more emissions at home. FINANCING: The European Union pledged $410 million a year by 2005 to new funds established to assist developing countries in adapting to climate change. ENFORCEMENT: Countries failing to meet targets must reduce emissions an added 1.3 tons for every ton above the target. Japan balked at making these penalties legally binding, so such classification was left out of the agreement. RATIFICATION: At least 55 nations, and nations that represent at least 55 percent of 1990 carbon dioxide emissions from industrialized countries, must ratify the agreement for it to become binding. Without U.S. participation, ratification hinges on Japan's support for the agreement. (pg. A11)

HEADLINE: Earnings at 3M Drop 4% as Demand Falters Worldwide 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, July 23 

 BODY:
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company said today that its second-quarter profit fell 4 percent because of weak demand in North America, Europe and Asia and the effects of the strong dollar.
 Net income fell to $451 million, or $1.12 a share, compared with $470 million, or $1.18 a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales fell 3.9 percent, to $4.08 billion from $4.24 billion. 
 3M, which makes products ranging from Post-It Notes to circuit boards, said earlier this month that profit would trail analysts' estimates, citing a rapid sales decline late in the quarter, particularly in Europe and Asia. The strong dollar reduced profit by 7 cents a share, or about 6 percent.
"Our customers are running lean and to the bone, and we don't expect them to run up inventory anytime soon," Robert Burgstahler, the chief financial officer, said on a conference call.
Before 3M's revision, analysts expected the company to earn $1.19 a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. The most recent projection was for profit of $1.11 a share.
Shares of 3M, based in St. Paul, fell $1.61, to $111.39.
3M said full-year profit would be in the range of $4.50 to $4.75 a share, excluding one-time items. The company will perform at the lower end of that range if the economy remains about the same, 3M said.
The low end of the range also "assumes that international economic growth continues to decline for the rest of next year, mirroring and lagging the recent trajectory of the U.S. economy," Mr. Burgstahler said.
This would result in a drop in sales of about 4 percent in the second half, without acquisitions, he said. Some areas of the world still have excess inventory, he said.
Analysts expect full-year profit of $4.57 a share, according to Thomson Financial.

HEADLINE: BUSH'S TRAVELS: ANTIMISSILE DIPLOMACY; 
A Day After Seeing Putin, a Harder-Line Bush Emerges

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: ROME, July 23 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that "time is of the essence" in his new arms talks with Moscow and warned that he would move ahead with testing missile shield technology even if he did not reach an agreement that would scrap the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.
 Mr. Bush's comments came only a day after he and President Vladimir V. Putin agreed to begin "consultations" that would tie deep cuts in the nuclear arsenals of both nations to the discussions on new defensive technologies. They were much more toughly worded than anything he had said publicly in Mr. Putin's presence in Genoa, Italy. 
 Administration officials quickly reinforced the message, with Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, saying that while Mr. Putin had not been given a time limit, the Pentagon was speeding toward a series of missile defense tests that were clearly prohibited by the 29-year-old accord. 
"We do not want to be in the position of being constantly accused of violating the treaty," she said.
Ms. Rice noted that "presidents only have a limited amount of time to leave a legacy to their successors." Mr. Bush, she said, "feels very strongly that we've lost a lot of time" as previous presidents struggled to conduct tests within the limits of the treaty.
In Moscow today, Mr. Putin's advisers argued that his agreeing to hold arms talks with Mr. Bush did not mean that he had dropped his adamant opposition to an antimissile system.
But many in the Russian press thought otherwise today, saying the keystone of Russian policy, a refusal to change the 1972 treaty to permit construction of an American missile shield, had crumbled during the weekend talks.
In remarks at his regular cabinet meeting today, Mr. Putin took pains to say that that was not so. "Of course there has been no basic breakthrough," he said. "We confirmed our commitment to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. Nevertheless, there has been considerable progress."
He said Russian and American experts had agreed that questions about offensive and defense missile systems needed to be addressed jointly.
The warning to Mr. Putin came in the midst of a state visit here by Mr. Bush that has swirled with some of the most difficult issues confronting his six-month-old presidency: his effort to convince Russia and Europe of the need for a new nuclear strategy, his confrontation with Europe and Japan over a pact limiting greenhouse gases, violent protests on globalization, and, today, Pope John Paul II's entry into the debate on stem cell research.
After the tear gas clashes that surrounded the summit meeting of industrialized nations in Genoa, and after his position on global warming was roundly criticized by several of his allies, Mr. Bush looked relieved and delighted to arrive in Rome on Sunday night.
He immediately visited the Roman Forum to see where the Senate met and to stand, as all visiting presidents and prime ministers must, at the altar of Julius Caesar. 
In a rather un-Caesar-like address, the president declared that Rome had a "fantastic history" and noted that "so many of the words we use in America have come from right here."
Today Mr. Bush moved from ancient politics to the modern day, meeting with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, with whom he appears to have developed a good rapport. 
Like Prime Minister Tony Blair in Britain last week, Mr. Berlusconi all but endorsed Mr. Bush's new framework for a post-cold-war security strategy. He chastised "certain European states" that have not "understood how the world has changed."
But the highlight of Mr. Bush's day was clearly his visit to Castel Gandolfo, the pope's summer residence outside Rome. 
Even that visit was tinged with domestic American politics after the Pope publicly condemned all major forms of embryonic stem cell research, fully aware that Mr. Bush is considering whether to allow financing of the research to go forward.
The president is not expected to make a decision on the research until next month at the earliest.
Meanwhile, his national security aides kept one eye on a drama playing out half a world away, in Indonesia. They were clearly relieved that the agonizingly slow removal of President Abdurrahman Wahid had come to an end, and that Megawati Sukarnoputri had been sworn in as Indonesia's president peacefully, even as Mr. Wahid stayed in his palace.
Mr. Bush interrupted his discussion of the American-Italian alliance during a news conference with Mr. Berlusconi to say that "we look forward to working with President Megawati and her team," but warned that she must find a "peaceful resolution" to the separatist movements in Aceh and elsewhere. 
His aides hinted privately that they were looking for ways to resume economic assistance to Indonesia, which has effectively been frozen.
But the main drama of late has been the dynamic between Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin on missile defense. Both men have described their relationship as friendly and cooperative, even trusting. 
But just as Mr. Putin left their first meeting, in Slovenia last month, and immediately declared that a violation of the ABM treaty by the United States would spark an arms race, Mr. Bush waited until Mr. Putin was out of Italian airspace to deliver the harder edge of his message.
"I have told President Putin that time matters, that I want to reach an accord sooner, rather than later, that I'm interested in getting something done with him," Mr. Bush said at Villa Doria Pamphili, a 15th-century residence that Italian prime ministers use for such visits.
Standing before a sweeping view of the city's ancient monuments, Mr. Bush spoke with far more passion about missile defense than he had on any of the other major topics of his visit. 
He repeated that "America is no longer Russia's enemy," and said he believed that Mr. Putin and Europe's leaders were gradually coming to understand the need for what he called a "strategic framework."
"You saw the president yesterday," he said to reporters, referring to Mr. Putin. "I thought he was very forward-leaning, as they say in diplomatic nuanced circles."
"We signed an agreement," he said, apparently referring to a three-sentence statement that they would hold talks.
But he also made clear that he had already decided what to do if those talks should fail: move ahead with the missile shield tests, even if that requires giving notice that the United States is withdrawing from the ABM treaty.
"Since I feel it so strongly," he said, "if we can't reach an agreement, we're going to implement" the tests. 
"It's the right thing to do." he said. "It's what I told the American people we're going to do. It's what I've explained to our allies we're going to do."

To the Editor:
Re "Support Grows for Corn-Based Fuel Despite Critics" (front page, July 23): 
 California has not determined its response to Washington's mistaken decision not to allow us flexibility to produce the cleanest, cheapest gasoline we can (with or without any additives). 
 If and when California makes the switch to ethanol, we have not yet determined the most economical source of that fuel additive. Just as refiners must sometimes use imported oil, it may sometimes be more practical for us to use ethanol that is not made from corn.
Gov. Gray Davis has assigned me the task of analyzing our state's ethanol situation. After I report in mid-September, the decision will be made as to whether we import additional Midwestern ethanol.

 Culture Clash
Striking Greek Culture Ministry workers closed the Acropolis and hundreds of other cultural sites yesterday. "From today until July 29 we will be on strike," Giorgos Alvanos, a workers' representative, told Reuters. The sites are major tourist destinations, particularly in summer, when Greece attracts some 90 percent of its visitors. A tourism industry union deplored the strike's impact on the Greek economy and stated, "It is equally unacceptable for the state not to understand that the loss from shutting the ancient sites is many times that of the demands." Ministry employees want increases in pay and staffing.

Success Story
Daniel Peterson, who worked as a boatswain on a ship, taught his five children to play the piano as they were growing up in Montreal. Like the rest, the fourth child, who had begun playing at 6, in 1931, outgrew his father's skills and was sent to study with a classical pianist. At 14, the boy won an amateur contest, and thus was born a career as an acclaimed jazz pianist. His name is Oscar Peterson. At 9 p.m. tomorrow, Mr. Peterson will open a four-night, engagement at the Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, in Greenwich Village.

Across Centuries
Summer, with its flowers, butterflies, bright birds and fishes, inspirits the exhibition that links the Dutch Golden Age to modern times and opens today at the Knoedler Gallery, 19 East 70th Street, in Manhattan. The show, "Models of Observation," through Sept. 29, consists of more than 30 works on paper and canvas, as well as sculptures. Three Dutch paintings are precedents for the modern artists Milton Avery (1885-1965), Nancy Graves (1940-1995) and Donald Sultan, who was born in 1951. Set against the exacting details of 17th-century still lifes by Jan van den Hecke, Jacob Bogdani and Pieter van Noort, the modern art yields echoes of the past.

Picasso Pictures
The year was 1953. The place was Vallauris on the French Riviera. The photographer was 23. His subject, the artist, was 72. They became friends and collaborators until the artist died in 1973. The photographer is Andre Villers. The artist was Pablo Picasso. Beginning today, 30 of Mr. Villers's black-and-white photographs, taken in Vallauris, Cannes and Nice from 1953 through 1963, will go on view in "Portraits of Picasso" in the art gallery of the French Institute Alliance Francaise, 22 East 60th Street in Manhattan. Some photographs show Picasso at work; some, at play, mugging and assuming identities like Gary Cooper or Popeye. The exhibition continues through Sept. 7.

HEADLINE: ABB, Reporting Lower Profit, Will Cut 12,000 Jobs 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 24 

 BODY:
ABB Ltd., Europe's largest electrical engineering group, reported a 21 percent drop today in half-year profit and said it would shed 12,000 jobs, or 8 percent of its work force, to try to counter the global economic slowdown.
 It also pared its 2001 profit outlook. 
 Shares in the company, which is based in Zurich, slid 18 percent on the news, losing 4.35 Swiss francs to close at 19.25 francs. In New York, its American depository receipts fell 17 percent, to close at $11.35. The company's market value has tumbled 55 percent this year. 
"This is a very bad blow to ABB's management credibility," an ABN Amro analyst, Gabriel Hors, said in a note to investors.
Jorgen Centerman, the chief executive of ABB, said in a telephone interview that the company's "underlying operational performance is improving," although he acknowledged that new orders were down 7 percent, to $12.6 billion, and revenue in the first half was flat, at $11.1 billion.
He said that "uncertainty in the investment climate as the U.S. slowdown spread into Europe and Asia" was the cause of the decrease in orders. And he also said that he was "taking action now to improve our competitiveness, as we expect challenging conditions in the next 12 months."
Mr. Centerman took over as ABB's chief executive in January, after former president Goran Lindahl was dismissed by the board.
Mr. Centerman is trying to retool ABB, which has traditionally focused on building dams and managing other major engineering projects, to become a major supplier of automation and control systems, like climate controls for building.
That strategy, however, was undermined today when a British competitor, Ivensys P.L.C., issued its third profit warning since September, and said it would move ahead with its own job-cutting measures.
Earlier this month, two other ABB rivals, the Emerson Electric Company and the Rockwell International Corporation, announced layoffs and reduced profit forecasts.
ABB is under pressure from Martin Ebner, a Swiss corporate raider, whose investment fund, the BZ Group, owns 10 percent of the company. 
Mr. Ebner has criticized ABB for not warning investors about the company's asbestos-related liabilities, which were made public when the company listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange this year.
The costs, connected to a defunct subsidiary, Combustion Engineering Inc., could be hundreds of millions of dollars more than originally disclosed, investors fear.
The company said income from continuing operations fell 40 percent in the first half, to $329 billion. Net income fell 76 percent over the same period, although last year's net included a one-time gain of $548 million from the sale of its Power Generation company.
ABB revised its 2001 profit forecast, saying revenue growth would lag in the first half of the year but the second half "expected to see higher comparative earnings growth." It lowered its target for earnings before interest and tax, a performance measure known as EBIT, to 9 to 10 percent of sales by 2005 from 12 percent.
"The order intake was below what was expected, and the EBIT and income were lower than expected -- and it won't meet it's 2001 target," said Kevin Lyne-Smith of Bank Julius Baer, which reduced its recommendation on ABB shares to "sell."
In the last two months, the number of orders worth less than $15 million -- which are the bulk of its business and provide its greatest margins -- dropped to single digits. Before the slowdown began in May, ABB had won a $300 million contract to build two high-voltage power transmissions systems in Brazil.
One-third of the job losses will come from attrition, ABB said. 
At the end of June, ABB had 163,838 employees around the world.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Aiming at the over-50 traveler, a Minneapolis agency stresses mystery and avoids stereotypes.

BYLINE:  By Patricia Winters Lauro 

 BODY:
THE ads promote exciting sights, exotic locales and romance.
 Add a beer or a Cosmopolitan, and it sounds like the perfect vacation for young people seeking adventure. 
 But this latest campaign promoting tourism to Turkey is not focused on the young but on their parents or maybe even their spirited grandparents. The average age of an American tourist in Turkey is 61, and to better reach this audience, the government of Turkey this year hired Colle & McVoy, a midsize agency in Minneapolis with a new division called Code 50 dedicated to reaching older adults. 
The older-than-50 population in the United States is already a big market, but it is poised to explode as the bulk of the baby boom heads toward the half-century mark. Every seven seconds, someone in the United States turns 50, according to data collected by Colle & McVoy, which is majority owned by the Maxxcom unit of the MDC Corporation. Last year, 37 percent of the United States population was 50 or older, and by 2010, that percentage will rise to 43 percent, the agency said.
The Turkey campaign is the first effort from Code 50, which was created when Colle & McVoy bought the Sandcastle Group, a smaller firm in Minneapolis that specialized in marketing to older adults, late last year. 
With the huge aging baby boomer market, Colle & McVoy's new division is hardly the only agency specializing in such marketing. The Standard Directory of Advertising Agencies lists dozens of small shops that specialize in the market. But according to John Nielson, Sandcastle's founder, who now runs Code 50, the older-than-50 market is still largely misunderstood and the advertising often falls victim to stereotypes. 
In America's youth-obsessed society, the biggest misperception is the assumption that older adults pine to be young again, Mr. Nielson said. Indeed, Code 50's research shows that such a suggestion is often offensive to older adults, who feel they have gained insight and wisdom with their years. Code 50 has a database of information from 700 people older than 50 who participate in focus groups. 
"Assuming you want to be 20 or 30 again isn't true," Mr. Nielson said. "It's offensive and not relevant. People over 50 want to celebrate where they are now."
Hence, the campaign for Turkey rests on research that indicates that as people age, many become more interested in collecting experiences instead of material goods. In the ads, Turkey is depicted as a mystical, mysterious and exotic place that can be a transforming experience. One print ad depicts the ruins at Ephesus -- among the most extensive on earth -- and carries the headline "To understand someone, walk in their footsteps." Another shows an ancient 30,000-seat stadium at Aphrodisias with the headline "The city of love. A thousand-year-old theater. Two seats. Tonight's performance: sunset." 
The audience that Turkey is trying to reach does not represent all older Americans, of course. The advertising is aimed specifically at healthy, active older Americans who have some disposable income and are seasoned travelers. Print ads are appearing in upscale publications like The New York Times Magazine and Travel & Leisure. The $4.5 million campaign also includes TV spots in top markets like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami.
"They've done Paris and Rome, and now they'd like to do something that's outside of the norm -- a bit off the beaten path," Mr. Nielson said. "Part of what we discovered in focus groups is that it's the whole unknown of going somewhere new and experiencing something different."
Last year, 515,000 Americans visited Turkey, up 20 percent from the year before, said Selami Karaibraihimgil, director of the Turkish Tourist Office in New York. While Germany, Russia and Britain send a million or more tourists to Turkey each year, he said, Turkey is also becoming one of the fastest-growing international destinations for Americans. 
Another obsolete view about the older-than-50 market that is the focus of the Turkey effort is that advertisers must cement a relationship with consumers while they are young. But Mr. Nielson said there were many ways to build brand loyalty, especially in tourism, where about 80 percent of luxury travel is taken by people older than 50. Colle & McVoy has an extensive trade program for Turkey intended to educate travel agents on how to develop profitable long-term relationships with Americans older than 50.
"That market is there, especially at the higher end of the economic spectrum," Mr. Nielson said.
So certain is Colle & McVoy about the future of the market for people older than 50 that Code 50's staff members go through a one-day sensitivity training program at the University of Minnesota. They learn what aging feels like, from simulating foot pain by putting corn kernels in their socks to wearing goggles with duct tape to impair their vision. Staff members are even exposed to staged events with rude young people to help them understand what it feels like to seem suddenly invisible because of age, Mr. Nielson said.
The training exists for good reason, he said. Advertising may not be depicting older Americans well partly because the people who create advertising tend to be young, said Mr. Nielson, who cited a recent study that found the ad industry is overwhelmingly made up of people 20 to 39 years old. 
"The natural tendency is to market to oneself," Mr. Nielson said. "That's not to say they can't do it right, but they tend not to."

HEADLINE: In Simeon's 'Court,' 2 Yankees of Sorts 

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: SOFIA, Bulgaria, July 24 

 BODY:
The king has won most of the attention, but a few facts have not escaped note about the two American-educated investment bankers who, as of today, are among the most powerful people in the new order of Bulgaria.
 First is their age: the new finance minister is 35 and the deputy prime minister in charge of the economy is only 31. 
 Second, in a nation where the average monthly wage is just over $100, are the salaries they just left behind. "Two ministers quit $715,000 jobs," a front-page headline in the leading daily newspaper read on Monday. The paper did not neglect to say that, as ministers, they will now earn only $450 a month. 
"I really can't comment," the new finance minister, Milen Velchev, a former vice president with Merrill Lynch in London, said with some embarrassment today when asked about his old salary.
King Simeon II, the deposed child czar whom Parliament officially approved as prime minister today, preferred not to disclose many specifics during the campaign that ended in a sweep last month for his new party.
And so the people of Bulgaria -- a poor nation that is nonetheless a haven of stability in the troubled Balkans -- are looking for fresh clues about his intentions in the faces of the 16 people also approved today to form his new cabinet.
At first glance, some say, his choice of a cabinet appears to show him keeping his promise to appoint professionals, untainted by the corruption and cronyism that has angered Bulgarians. In fact, most are untainted by government at all: like the king himself, few in the new cabinet have any political experience. None have ever been a minister.
"Rather than looking for jobs to reward his people, he is actually trying to find the best people to fill the particular jobs," Mr. Velchev said. "That's why most of them are experts in their fields, not politicians."
But some Bulgarians express at least mild concern about having so many unknown faces running the government -- particularly given King Simeon's now famous unwillingness to reveal too much.
"This is the first time in the last 12 years or so to have prominent politicians you know nothing about," said Boyan Belev of the Center for the Study of Democracy, a research institute in Sofia. "It doesn't have to be bad. I think it's not.
"But he has to talk about it," he added, "because Bulgarians are now used to hearing about the personal and professional accomplishments of their politicians. The less transparent, the public fears, the less democratic."
Ivan Stancioff, a Bulgarian businessman who is the former ambassador to Britain, praised King Simeon's "courage" in taking on the job of prime minister, a much grittier job than the largely ceremonial post of president that he was thought to prefer when he first entered the political fray in his native land more than five decades after being forced by the Communists to flee. But, Mr. Stancioff said, today marks a new phase in his new political career.
"He's proven that he can be successful in getting votes," he said. "He is successful because he has said very little. He has said nothing. Obviously that is over. He has to produce."
Today, in a speech to Parliament, King Simeon outlined in broad strokes what he has called his 800-day drive for reform in Bulgaria. He promised a speeded-up improvement in living standards, a fight against corruption, an increase in foreign investment and the lowering of personal and corporate taxes.
He also repeated his promise to push Bulgaria toward membership in NATO and the European Union. The king had reportedly been undecided about joining with European defenses, but in the end he picked as his foreign minister a mathematician named Solomon Passi, who has campaigned for more than a decade for Bulgaria to join NATO.
"Today we stand a real chance of being able to usher Bulgaria into the new 21st century and take the place we deserve in united Europe," King Simeon, who is 64 and who fled Bulgaria in 1946, living mostly in Spain, said in his speech in Parliament.
The king's party, the National Movement for Simeon II, won exactly half of the 240 parliamentary seats last month, and joined in a ruling coalition with the Turk Movement for Rights and Freedom to ensure a working majority in the legislature.
Ethnic Turks make up roughly 10 percent of the nation's eight million people and, while they have had some say in government before, today marks the first time they have held ministerial seats. Two cabinet posts were given to Turks, the agriculture ministry and a minister without portfolio.
Ahmed Dogan, leader of the Turkish party, today noted what he called a historic moment for Turks in Bulgaria, who faced repression in the 1980's during Communist rule and remain far poorer than most Bulgarians. "We are prepared to bear the responsibility for being in government," he said in Parliament.
The previous government, the Union of Democratic Forces, was credited with many reforms that moved Bulgaria forward economically, and the country has grown for the last three years. But voters were angry because living standards are still low, unemployment is high and the economy remains the most pressing issue for Bulgarians.
And so King Simeon's economic team has perhaps attracted the most interest. 
Mr. Velchev began his career in the foreign ministry, then studied on a Fulbright Fellowship, first at the University of Rochester in New York and then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The 31-year-old deputy prime minister, Nikolai Vassilov, studied at the State University of New York in Oswego and at Brandeis University. An investment banker most recently with Lazard Capital Markets in London, he became well known in Bulgaria during the last two years through a program in which Bulgarians working abroad commented on government reforms.
The two men have given themselves 800 days to produce tangible change. But today was given over both to celebration and the mundane.
"Nice office," Mr. Velchev said, in his new, and bare, space in the grand finance ministry building in downtown Sofia. "Still trying to find out if the phones work."

HEADLINE: The Travails of Zimbabwe 

 BODY:
All of southern Africa has an interest in seeing a free and fair election next year in Zimbabwe, where President Robert Mugabe seems prepared to reduce his once hopeful nation to violent ruin in a desperate bid to cling to power. Washington and its friends in the region and beyond need to take steps now that will make possible a level playing field throughout the campaign.
 Mr. Mugabe, who has been in power for 21 years since he led Zimbabwe to independence from white rule in what had been Rhodesia, will be seeking a fifth term in April 2002. He has allowed violent attacks on the independent press, the courts and white-owned factories and farms. Nearly 50 farmers, farm workers and opposition activists, black and white, have been killed in the past year and a half. 
 To its credit, the opposition Movement for Democratic Change remains dedicated to constitutional procedures. Its leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, has called on the outside world to send observers now to begin monitoring the campaign. Western nations and their African friends should find a way to respond to his plea. They should insist on the establishment of an independent electoral commission and on the ability of the independent media to operate unhindered.
Zimbabwe's political turmoil has already exacted a terrible cost. Joblessness approaches 60 percent, inflation is close to 70 percent, and the health care system is collapsing in the face of one of the world's worst AIDS epidemics. Most multilateral aid has already been suspended.
Secretary of State Colin Powell, on his trip to Africa in May, set the right tone when he forthrightly called on Mr. Mugabe to "submit to the law and the will of the people" in a free and fair election. There is bipartisan support in Congress for legislation that would condition any resumption of aid on fair elections, restoration of the rule of law, a demonstrated commitment to a lawful land reform program and withdrawal from the war in Congo. Washington needs to follow through in the coming months, working closely with South Africa and other regional democracies whose own economies and political stability are closely tied to Zimbabwe.
The fact that Zimbabwe has journalists who risk bombing and torture, judges who risk beatings and opposition activists who risk jail and murder is evidence of the enormous courage of Zimbabweans who want to rid their country of an obsolete tyranny. They will need the scrutiny of the outside world if they are to stick to their strategy of constitutional change.

HEADLINE: Hanoi Welcomes Powell, the Foe of 3 Decades Ago 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, July 24 

 BODY:
Almost 40 years after he first slogged through the jungles of South Vietnam as an American adviser, Gen. Colin L. Powell arrived as secretary of state today in the capital of his former enemy, bringing with him memories of American friends who perished in a war he has caustically called "a conspiracy of illusion" and the Vietnamese colleagues who suffered mightily after he left. 
 Unlike many who served in Vietnam and then went on to highly visible public careers, the secretary of state has never before revisited the land that framed the cautious military thinking that he exercised as the top United States commander at the end of the cold war. 
 It was a lesson that Secretary Powell learned from the elders of the people swirling around the streets on mopeds, cycles and beaten-up vans below his hotel room tonight that ensured that the United States committed plenty of troops in the Persian Gulf war and that Washington refrained from military action in Bosnia during his watch as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
But leaving strategy behind, Secretary Powell was greeted at the airport by a Vietnamese government official dressed in a long scarlet ao dai and guided to a limousine that took him to the city past once-familiar sights of water buffalo and conical-hatted peasants tending verdant green rice fields. Instead of riding in an army convoy on a rutted track as Americans had done during the war, the secretary of state traveled in a motorcade led by a blue-and-white sedan labeled "Canh Sat Giao Thong," meaning traffic police. 
Secretary Powell's official business here is to attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting of foreign ministers and to introduce himself for the first time as the new face of the Bush administration who will be tending to Asian affairs. But the visit is obviously laden with more than that. 
"There are no ghosts within me that need exorcism," Secretary Powell said before leaving for the trip. "But at the same time I'm sure the years will peel back three and four decades and the emotions will be powerful and strong." 
In his autobiography, written with the freedom of being out of office, General Powell was scathing about the conduct of the war and in particular about the "so-called whiz kids" around Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. If the commanders had taken the time to read the books written by the French who experienced earlier defeats in Vietnam, they would not have committed so many young troops to such a losing proposition, he reasoned.
He was particularly outraged that the "poorer, less educated, less privileged" were sent to the war as "economic cannon fodder" while rich kids escaped their duty. The policies, he seethed, represented "an anti-democratic disgrace." 
Now that he is in office, he speaks more politely. "When I went over and arrived in Saigon on Christmas Day of 1962, I was convinced that we were doing the right thing," Secretary Powell said from the podium of the State Department briefing room where copious justifications of the war were read decades ago. "But it became clear that we were not going to prevail and maybe different political and military judgments should have been made at that point." 
The secretary of state said he lost some of his best friends from college, fraternity members and "a lot of people I was close to" in the fields of Vietnam. 
During his first tour of duty -- he completed two tours -- he befriended his Vietnamese counterpart, Capt. Vo Cong Hieu, who was in charge of the 400 Vietnamese soldiers that the young American captain was assigned to. During nights deep within the triple-canopy jungle of the A Shau Valley along the Laotian border, Captain Hieu and Captain Powell would trade stories: one telling of his traditions in Vietnam, the other telling of fast food and other American institutions. 
Captain Hieu was reassigned after seven months, not to be heard of again by General Powell until 1991 when he called from Bangkok saying he and his family needed help to get to the United States. Captain Hieu, 72, who survived 12 years in a Vietnamese re-education camp, now lives in Minneapolis, and every now and again the two men from different cultures meet as citizens of the same country. 
From an apartment decorated with photographs of the two -- taken when General Powell visited Minneapolis on speaking engagements -- Captain Hieu described the early relationship where each man depended on the other for his survival.
"We were in an area near Laos where the mountains were very high and the enemy was so close he could even throw stones at us," Captain Hieu said in a talk on the telephone. "We were there to prevent their infiltration and resupply." 
The two got along well, he said, because Captain Powell "convinced me that he was not an adviser who knew it all." The young Powell had virtually no Vietnamese language skills, Captain Hieu said, but even so they managed to bond against the terrors of leeches, the dangers of bamboo spikes poisoned with buffalo dung and the seeming futility of ever engaging the guerrillas. 
When the last Americans evacuated Saigon in 1975, Mr. Hieu, who had since been promoted to colonel, was working in a sensitive intelligence position at the Presidential Palace. He was quickly picked up by the Vietcong as a prime candidate for re-education and dispatched to a series of hard work camps.
After his release in 1988, he sought help to leave Vietnam and managed to get to Bangkok and then the United States, where he lives as a retiree in Minneapolis with his wife. A daughter and son-in-law live nearby. He now suffers from polio, he said, a childhood disease that has worsened with age. 
Secretary Powell, during a visit to Minneapolis in 1991 while he was still chairman of the Joint Chiefs, met Captain Hieu in a teary reunion and introduced him, to big applause, to an audience of local dignitaries. They keep in touch, with visits now and then. Most recently the secretary of state sent a postcard soon after assuming his new office, sending regards to a mutual friend from the war who remained behind in Ho Chi Minh City.

HEADLINE: Powell Said to Be Dismayed by Beijing Trial 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, July 24 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who is scheduled to be in Beijing this weekend, learned of the 10-year sentence imposed on Gao Zhan, a Chinese scholar with United States residency, as he was flying here today from Tokyo. A senior State Department official told reporters that the Bush administration was "quite dismayed" by the sentencing, as well as the circumstances of the trial.
 "Our hope has been that she would be reunited with her family," the official said. 
 The United States had asked the Beijing authorities for permission for American officials to attend Ms. Gao's trial on espionage charges, but were informed shortly before the proceedings began that this would not be allowed. "We are concerned about the lack of transparency in the process and the speed at which this was done," the official said. 
The sentencing of Ms. Gao and another United States resident, Qin Guangguang, presents Secretary Powell with a challenge as he heads to Beijing, where he has said he hopes to put relations with China onto a more even footing after a rocky start. He has declared an early complication in that relationship, the collision of an American spy plane and a Chinese fighter plane off the China coast, as a thing of the past, and he has said he has to try to stabilize relations while stressing how important human rights is to the administration.
In Tokyo on Monday, at the start of his Asia trip, Secretary Powell told reporters that he would tell the Chinese that there were broader human rights issues, beyond the well-publicized cases of people who have been recently detained. Human rights, he said, were "part of our agenda with China, and just removing one or two cases that might be high-profile cases for the moment isn't enough."
China, he said, should understand that becoming a "full-fledged member of the international community" did not just mean economic achievement. "The international community is not just an economic community," the secretary said. "It's a community of human rights. It's a community of individual rights of men and women. It's a community of increasing democratization if you want to be a full-fledged member."
Secretary Powell is scheduled to meet Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan of China on Wednesday here, where Mr. Tang is also attending a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The secretary plans to raise Ms. Gao's sentencing and the cases of other prisoners with links to the United States, his aides said. The new assistant secretary of state for human rights, Lorne W. Craner, is traveling with Secretary Powell and is expected to accompany him at many meetings in Beijing.
In talking to the Chinese about human rights in terms of membership in the international community, Bush administration officials said the secretary was trying to take human rights beyond the usual context.
"I've told the Chinese that the detained are not a human rights issue, that it's a bilateral issue," said a senior administration official who deals with China on rights. "That it's the same category as the EP-3 plane and that you need to clean it up, just like you cleaned up the EP-3."
That was the model of the plane forced to land on Hainan Island after its collision with the fighter.
A major dimension to Washington's agenda on human rights in China is religious freedom, and that will be a topic for Secretary Powell in Beijing, his aides said. 
According to Human Rights Watch in New York, about 10 Roman Catholic bishops are missing and are believed to be in custody in China. One of them, Bishop Pei Shangde, 82, was detained while in Beijing in April, when seven priests and 13 lay people were detained around the country, Human Rights Watch said.
The senior official who deals with human rights said Washington was not interested in establishing what is known as a formal "human rights dialogue" that focuses on issues that the Chinese prefer to discuss like local elections and the rule of law. Instead, it wants to focus on religious freedom and the cases of those who remain in prison under a counterrevolutionary crimes law that was revoked in 1997.

HEADLINE: Leasing of Trade Center May Help Transit Projects, Pataki Says 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki, speaking yesterday at the closing of the $3.2 billion deal to lease the World Trade Center, said the money from the deal could help finance the long-stalled Second Avenue subway and plans to provide tunnel access for Long Island Rail Road trains to Grand Central Terminal.
 The governor said that financing such transportation projects with proceeds from the 99-year net lease would bring the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey out of the real estate business and back to its main mission of developing and maintaining regional transportation facilities. The Port Authority opened the trade center 30 years ago. 
 "When I came into office in 1995, the Port Authority had hotels, shopping malls, industrial parks and we asked why," Governor Pataki said. "We have worked hard to put those developments in the hands of the private sector experts who pay taxes. And today the Port Authority returns to the core mission of dealing with transportation."
Aides to the governor and others said that the possibility of using the funds for mass transit had emerged in discussions in recent weeks, as the Pataki administration sought an alternative to the unsuccessful efforts to get federal aid for the two projects. In addition, the two projects were dealt a blow by the defeat last year of the state transportation bond issue, which would have allowed the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to borrow money for the projects.
Mr. Pataki disappointed many mass transit advocates and M.T.A. board members earlier this year when his proposed budget failed to make up for the loss of financing and instead directed the agency to come up with the $320 million it needed to keep their five-year capital plan on track. If he follows through on his suggestion, New York's expected $50 million annual share of the trade center lease proceeds could help advance the two projects.
The governor's comments came as he stood with Acting Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco of New Jersey on the sun-baked plaza of the trade center in a ceremony marking the transfer of the final installment of the $616 million down payment on the deal. Yesterday was also the beginning of a 90-day transition period in which control will move from the Port Authority to the partnership of Silverstein Properties and Westfield America.
Touted as the largest real estate deal in the city's history, the transfer of the trade center to private operators comes at a time when the economy and by extension the real estate market is cooling significantly, said Bruce E. Surry, executive managing director at Insignia/ESG, the commercial real estate company.
But while the transaction was happening at "a difficult time in the market cycle," Mr. Surry said that the Silverstein and Westfield partnership was apparently able to get financing for the deal from bankers who were betting that the downturn would not be severe enough to affect the fortunes of such an iconic property as the World Trade Center.
"The economy is a problem, but it's not a problem of the level of the one we had in 1991," Mr. Surry said, recalling the last recession, when occupancy at the World Trade Center dipped to 78 percent.
Conspicuously absent from the ceremony was Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose administration has been at odds with the Port Authority over everything from the trade center lease to the operation of the city's airports. A spokesman for the mayor said that he did not know whether the mayor had been invited.
Either way, the event was likely to intensify the tensions between City Hall and the bistate agency. The Giuliani administration contends that the 99-year lease is in effect a sale of the two towers, and therefore requires the "buyer" to pay the full real estate taxes on the buildings. The city has estimated that amount at $100 million a year; the Port Authority now makes a $26 million payment to the city in lieu of those taxes.
Neil D. Levin, the executive director of the Port Authority, maintained that the agency still owned the buildings but stood ready to negotiate with the city on a "fair" payment in light of the new lease arrangement. The city has chosen not to negotiate with the agency and has instead in letters to Silverstein Properties and Westfield put the partnership on notice that they "will be responsible for payment of the taxes in full."
When asked yesterday about the ceremony at the trade center, Mr. Giuliani said: "I know that they are going to try to privatize it, and the city should get the full amount of the property taxes on it. If we get the full amount of the property taxes, then it has actually been privatized."

HEADLINE: It's Not the Heat or the Humidity; It's the Ozone 

BYLINE:  By JOYCE WADLER 

 BODY:
There was an ozone alert in New York City for the third day in a row yesterday, and with it the usual warning that everyone should avoid strenuous outdoor activities. But did cyclists Dan Plitman and Shayna Kadidal, racing down the Hudson River bikeway in 90-degree-plus heat, show any concern? 
 Not much. 
 "I did know about it, but it seems to me riding the bike on the side of this highway in this heat will probably kill you faster than ozone," said Mr. Plitman, 30, an Internet management consultant who is unemployed. 
Mr. Kadidal, 33, a lawyer for Internet start-up companies who is likewise unemployed, said: "There was somebody in the park who said he had trouble breathing, he was talking about it. My feeling is if I can't see it, I'm not worried about it. I'm going away to Bangalore for a wedding. The pollution in India is much worse."
A sociological note, from Mr. Plitman, about ozone alerts:
"I used to go to L.A. a lot. It was a much bigger deal out there. They used to put it on the news every morning, rated 1 to 10."
Actually, there was something else of sociological interest on the Hudson River bike path yesterday: many people were unaware of daily ozone alerts, and environmental pollutant brand-name confusion was markedly high. Some associated ozone with a hole in the atmospheric layer, which might result in a nasty sunburn, not a particle that is a major component of smog, which might cause coughing or shortness of breath. 
The same confusion reigned in Central Park. The temperature there -- which hit a high of 91 degrees at 4 p.m. according to the National Weather Service -- seemed no deterrence to people out and being active, either biking, jogging or tossing around a football. Many admitted that they did not know much about the science of ozone levels, while others scoffed outright at the advisories.
"The environment is of course important, and when I'm 70 it will perhaps be a personal concern," said West Rapoport, 38, a lawyer, resting after a long bike ride. "But of all the things that could kill you in New York, this is low on my list of worries."
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation says that ozone is a health concern. It advises, for periods when the ozone level is considered high, that everyone -- especially children, those with respiratory diseases, and those who exercise or work outdoors -- limit strenuous activity during the afternoon and evening hours.
Dr. Scott Schroeder, the chief of critical care and pulmonary medicine at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, which has two childhood asthma programs, also said high ozone levels pose a serious concern.
Ozone, Dr. Schroeder added, also affects healthy adults. "If you went out to run on a day like today, you would feel it, you would get some chest pains," he said.
Lance Yoon, a 31-year-old law student and a novice in-line skater, was not worried.
"I didn't know that," he said, when told of possible effects from ozone. "But it kind of gives me an excuse to stop. I borrowed these and they're killing my feet. But I feel fine."
Has Mr. Yoon never paid any attention to ozone health warnings?
"I think I do recall hearing about it, but it's never been an issue," he said.
"I've never been out on a date and had somebody say, 'Let's go home. There's an ozone alert.' "

HEADLINE: Two Chinese Residents of U.S. Sentenced to Prison by Beijing 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 24 

 BODY:
A court today convicted two Chinese citizens with permanent residency in the United States of spying for Taiwan and sentenced them to 10 years in prison. A third person, a local Chinese scholar, was sentenced to 13 years. 
 The sentences sent a chill through the academic world, where the activities for which the three were convicted are not considered unusual. 
 Lawyers for one defendant, Gao Zhan, a sociologist and researcher at American University in Washington who was sentenced to 10 years, said she had told the court that she was unaware that documents she had received from the local scholar, Qu Wei, could be considered "state secrets."
Less is known about the case against the other permanent resident who was sentenced today, Qin Guangguang. He had been a visiting scholar at several universities in the United States before returning to China to work in the pharmaceutical industry. 
The sentences drew immediate criticism from the White House and cast a shadow over the planned visit here by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who is scheduled to arrive on Saturday.
"We're following it carefully and we'll see what happens next," Secretary Powell told reporters after landing in Vietnam for a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Hanoi. Page A8. 
Lawyers for Ms. Gao immediately applied for medical parole, saying she has a heart ailment. There was some hope that China would grant the parole and release her before Secretary Powell's arrival. 
"Medical parole is our only hope," Ms. Gao's husband, Xue Donghua, said before attending a rally in support of his wife at American University.
In Hanoi, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Sun Yuxi, told reporters that China had "irrefutable evidence that Gao Zhan worked for Taiwan espionage agencies and received funds from them," adding that Ms. Gao had "openly admitted her crimes."
Ms. Gao's lawyers said she had given photocopies of the speeches, book excerpts and magazine articles that she had collected to Li Shaomin, a Chinese-born American citizen and fellow scholar who was convicted last week of spying for Taiwan and ordered deported, presumably because of his nationality. 
A United States Embassy spokesman in Beijing confirmed that Mr. Li was en route to San Francisco and that a State Department official would be there to assist in his entry to the United States and his reunion with his family. Mr. Li is expected to arrive in San Francisco at 9:20 a.m. on Wednesday.
Mr. Li had been teaching at a university in Hong Kong, which is now Chinese territory, and it is not clear whether he will be allowed to return there.
The cases are of particular concern to scholars who do research in China, because collecting photocopied materials like those gathered by Ms. Gao is one of their primary activities. Contact with Taiwan government agencies and academic foundations, often a source of financing for such research, is also common.
It is often unclear what China considers secret. Even information in the public domain is sometimes considered intelligence if it is sent abroad.
Last year, a court sentenced a well-known Muslim executive to eight years in prison for mailing newspapers from the restive northwest to her husband overseas. In August 1999, Song Yongyi, a researcher at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., was arrested for sending intelligence abroad but later released.
In April, the State Department issued a warning to Chinese-born American citizens and permanent residents that they risked detention in China if they had written critically of the Chinese government or had contacts with Taiwan.
Other cases that have attracted Washington's attention include that of Wu Jianmin, 46, a naturalized American who was arrested on April 8 in China on suspicion of having collected and sent abroad Communist Party documents related to the pro-democracy protests of 1989. Those documents were published last January in the United States as the "The Tiananmen Papers."
Ms. Gao, 39, spoke in her defense at least eight times at the three-hour trial today at the Beijing First Intermediate People's Court, according to one of her lawyers, Bai Xuebiao. He said Ms. Gao was depressed by the sentence, which she thought too severe.
Her lawyer from the United States, Jerome Cohen, said that Ms. Gao had "some sort of cardiac episode" a few days ago and that her Beijing lawyers had requested copies of cardiograms to document her history of heart trouble. 
Mr. Xue, her husband, said that the question of medical parole had to be made by prison authorities and that the decision could take 10 days or longer. If medical parole is denied, he said, Ms. Gao's lawyers would file an appeal, though verdicts are almost never reversed in such high-profile cases. 
He said he would wait until all options to secure his wife's release had been exhausted before deciding on further actions. He said he might bring lawsuits in China and the United States against the Chinese officials responsible for the abuse that he and his 5-year-old son suffered when they were detained along with Ms. Gao in January. 
Mr. Xue and his son, who was already an American citizen, were separated and held for 26 days without anyone being notified, as required by law and United States-China bilateral agreements. Mr. Xue was denied a visa to attend his wife's trial.
Ms. Gao's arrest, along with those of other China-born scholars with ties to the United States, has complicated improving relations between Beijing and the Bush administration, which is under pressure from conservative Republicans to give China's human rights record a larger role in that relationship than it had in the Clinton administration, when commercial engagement was the top priority. 
Mr. Powell's trip is meant to ease remaining tensions created by the collision of an American reconnaissance plane and a Chinese fighter jet in April and to capitalize on the good will engendered by Washington's neutrality on Beijing's effort to invite the 2008 Summer Olympics, which it won this month. Beijing may have intentionally delayed the trials until after the Olympics decision.
But a month ago, the House of Representatives approved a nonbinding resolution that called for President Bush to put the detained scholars atop the administration's agenda with China. This month, Mr. Bush telephoned President Jiang Zemin of China and asked him to resolve the outstanding cases quickly. 
A spokesman for the White House, Sean McCormack, told reporters today, "We continue to call on the Chinese government to release Gao Zhan and Qin Guangguang on humanitarian grounds." 
Some China experts suggested that Beijing's tough stand was intended as a rebuke of Mr. Bush's strong position on Taiwan, over which the mainland wants to recover control. Mr. Bush angered Chinese officials by saying the United States would do "whatever it took" to help Taiwan defend itself in the event of an attack by the mainland. 
"Gao's stiff sentence may have been intended as a tit-for-tat response to the Bush administration's in your face style of diplomacy in the Taiwan Strait," said Richard Baum, a political scientist at the University of California in Los Angeles.
Nevertheless, many people say they believe that the impact of the convictions on United States-China relations will be fleeting.
"The tone for Bush's October state visit to Beijing is largely set," said Suisheng Zhao, program director of the Center for China-U.S. Cooperation at the University of Denver.

HEADLINE: Albany to Pass Austere Budget, Ending Logjam 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 24 

 BODY:
The leaders of the State Assembly and Senate announced today that they would move to break the four-month deadlock over the state budget by passing an austere spending plan next week that is far smaller than the one Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed.
 The bare-bones budget would leave out many of Mr. Pataki's tax cuts and economic development initiatives and keep spending for almost every state agency at last year's levels. It would also accept the governor's proposal to increase school aid by $382 million, rather than $1.7 billion as Democrats in the Assembly had proposed. 
 The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said that after passing the budget, legislators would try to resolve their disagreements with the governor about additional spending for schools, health care and other programs in a supplemental budget later this year.
In some ways, lawmakers are reaching back to the past for a solution to the chronically late budgets in Albany. Before Hugh L. Carey became governor in 1975, it was not uncommon for the Legislature to pass the governor's budget on the April 1 deadline and then spend the rest of the year wrangling over a supplemental budget that included school aid and local projects. In some years, they would also pass a third budget in the last quarter of the fiscal year to spend any surplus.
"Budgets were done like this in New York State for years and years and years," Mr. Bruno said. 
Mr. Pataki seemed receptive when asked about the agreement during an appearance Tuesday in Columbia County, saying that "bare bones is appropriate" in the current economic climate.
"The idea of doing a no-frills budget that reflects the national economic slowdown and the concerns over revenues that states across America have makes great sense," Mr. Pataki said. "It depends on how that can be done."
In a sense, however, the Republican-led Senate and the Democrat-led Assembly are also calling the governor's bluff. Mr. Pataki proposed in January a $83.6 billion budget, about 5 percent above last year's. Under a longstanding practice, the governor's proposal usually sets the floor for spending and the debate revolves around how much the two houses can add to it.
But this year, the booming national economy slowed down to a crawl and the governor's advisers predicted that tax revenues will plummet. Mr. Pataki, a Republican expected to seek re-election next year, insisted the state could afford no more than he first proposed. He also refused to enter talks with legislative leaders, saying he had finished his job when he unveiled his budget.
Now legislative leaders, frustrated with months of gridlock, have agreed to pass a minimalist budget stripped of even the governor's spending increases, tax cuts and new programs. The Assembly Democrats are betting the loss of those items will bring Mr. Pataki to the bargaining table to negotiate a supplemental budget later this year that would resolve their major differences.
"This is like cutting the Gordian knot," said Richard L. Brodsky, a Democratic Assemblyman from Westchester County. "It forces the governor to face his own inadequacies or, for the first time, to negotiate seriously."
Such a budget carries risks, however. The governor may choose to accept it, blame the lack of new programs on the Legislature, and spend the surplus it would produce in the coming election year. 
The current impasse marks the 17th straight year that the government has failed to pass a budget by the April 1 deadline.
The skeletal budget unveiled yesterday solves several political and personal headaches for lawmakers from both parties. For starters, they will begin to receive paychecks again. Under a 1999 law, the state withholds their salaries until a budget is passed. 
Legislators also can no longer be blamed in their districts for the late budget and the uncertainty it has created for school districts and local governments. The lawmakers would be able to leave Albany until September. Then the revenue picture for the state will become clearer and serious talks about additions to the budget might have a better chance of success.
"It's an alternative to where we seen to be heading, which is a whole year of month-to-month extenders," Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a Democrat, said. "It forces everyone to the table to do a good faith, three-way negotiation and focus not on when do we do the budget but what is in the budget."
Passing a smaller version of the governor's budget also clears the way for the Legislature to pass its own appropriation bills. The state constitution prohibits the houses from approving new spending until they have first acted on the governor's budget bills. 
That means the Assembly Democrats and Senate Republicans might reach agreements on additional spending for schools, transportation or the environment and then send them to the governor for his signature. Mr. Pataki would then have to take a very public stand on each issue.
"The only option left to the Legislature is to take the governor's numbers as a baseline, pass a budget based on the governor's numbers and see what will be possible in the fall to fill in some of those gaps," Assemblyman Steven Sanders, Democrat of Manhattan, said.
While Democrats see the no-frills budget as a tactic to goad the governor into bargaining with them, the Senate Republicans see it more as a way to provide stability to school districts and local governments while negotiations drag on over tougher issues. 
The final plan is expected to allocate at least $2 billion less than what Mr. Pataki proposed. The Legislature plans to pass the budget next Thursday, on Aug. 2, two days short of the record of late budgets set in 1997 and 1999.
"There is about $81 billion worth in this budget that we don't have any disagreement on," Senator Bruno said. "All of that is being held up by a couple billion dollars we cannot agree on."

HEADLINE: New York Turns Into a Lab On the Future of Electricity 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
George Crethan has four new window air-conditioners stacked in the foyer of his Queens apartment, waiting to be installed. They use about half as much electricity as the ones he is replacing, and he will get a $300 rebate check from the state of New York as an added sweetener. 
 But Mr. Crethan will probably not get to install them until September, because his co-op apartment complex is replacing all its windows with new energy-efficient models, and the co-op board has said he has to wait until that work is finished. 
 This is how the future of electricity is arriving in New York this summer: as a makeshift, sometimes colliding jumble of schemes and mechanisms that Rube Goldberg might have assembled. To stave off shortages and rising rates until large new power plants can be built -- the first is not expected until 2003 -- utility companies, the state government, businesses and consumers are each cranking up their own quick fixes, from adjusted thermostats to elaborate financial incentives that reward conservation to rooftop diesel motors that can pressed into service on hot days to squeeze out a few watts. 
This transition is portrayed in Albany and the industry as an unpleasant but brief intermission that will end when the new plants are completed and New York can return to business as usual.
But many energy experts say the intermission could upstage the show. The first big new plant will not be ready for at least two years, and in the meantime, they say, anxiety over electricity supplies and prices is already provoking the kind of change not seen since the oil crisis of the 1970's. They predict that the collision of forces -- new technology, government incentives, private investment and the long shadow cast by California's rolling blackouts -- will transform the way New Yorkers think about and use electricity long before a new plant is ever switched on. 
Where exactly that transformation will lead remains to be seen; whether, for example, it will reduce or delay the need for the new plants. The experts are watching closely.
"Every process of change reaches a point where it all comes together and accelerates exponentially, and we've reached that point with electricity," said Allen J. Zerkin, an adjunct professor at the Wagner School of Social Research at New York University. "In five years, we won't even recognize the landscape."
The New York area, particularly Long Island and New York City, is emerging as a laboratory for new approaches. In the city and on the Island, electricity supplies are tightest and stakes are high, given the electrified mass transit systems, the many elevators and the city's crucial role in global finance.
To increase supply, ideas and technologies that were stalled or dismissed as impractical a few years ago, including wind power, solar cells and fuel cells, are suddenly blossoming on Long Island and upstate. The number of households and businesses that generate their own electricity is expected to surge by the middle of the decade.
To reduce demand, new companies are coming forward with devices and monitoring systems that can both save power and earn payments from the state. Traditional suppliers like Consolidated Edison say they will soon begin installing "real time" meters that allow customers to know the price they are paying for power at any given time, and adjust their consumption.
Even the very concepts of supply and demand are getting a second look, as a new state program allows large energy consumers to behave like suppliers, by selling their reduced use of power on the wholesale electricity market. The state government, which had been poised to abandon its historic role of regulating the electricity industry, is playing a huge, if ambiguous, part as both an electricity generator and an investor through its conservation rebates and other incentives. 
These disparate threads have already eased New York City's supply problem by 250 to 500 megawatts, roughly the output of a small- to medium-size power plant, according to various estimates. The city will have to come up with another 1,500 to 2,500 megawatts by 2006 to avert a crisis, Con Ed and others say. 
This is not to say, however, that Rube Goldberg's machine will run smoothly. Some of the new strategies may not work as envisioned, and some are bound to conflict, like Mr. Crethan's new air-conditioners and windows. The state's moves into making electricity are already annoying private generators, which do not appreciate the competition and could be discouraged from pursuing their own plans to build new plants.
It is also unclear whether these remedies will make any dent in deeper energy problems, like the aging transmission lines that are already near capacity, thus keeping New York City and Long Island from importing more power. The success of these moves hangs on how intense a sense of crisis the public feels. So far this summer, New York's jitters have have been soothed by moderate temperatures and Con Ed's assurances that it has enough power. 
But most electricity industry leaders and analysts agree that the innovations, fears and conflicts of the next few years will force a change in attitudes: if nothing else, that electricity is not a limitless commodity.
"Some people resist change, and some people embrace it, but this period we're in now is going to drive change all by itself," said Philip Herman, a vice president at Aqualine Resources, an energy demand management company in Waltham, Mass., that plans to open a New York office this summer.

New Lines of Supply
H Power, a company in Clifton, N.J., will open a factory in North Carolina in the next few months to make residential fuel cells, small electrochemical devices related to batteries that convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity and heat. The cells can back up a home's power needs or take a household completely off the electricity grid.
Part of the company's impetus is a new technology that makes smaller fuel cells economical. But an equally important force is harder to quantify: anxiety. California's energy problems have made some feel that electricity is undependable, company officials say, and the first homeowners to react to that feeling will be those with the most to lose in a blackout: the growing ranks of home-based businesspeople and telecommuters for whom power failures could be devastating.
"People don't know how to protect themselves," said H Power's chief executive, H. Frank Gibbard. "Residential, we think, is a multibillion-dollar market in the United States, and right now the Northeastern U.S. is the center of commercialization of that technology."
Industry experts say that while the fuel cells are just starting to be made, they expect 100,000 a year to be turned out by 2005, at a cost of $5,000 for a five-kilowatt unit big enough to power the average home.
Bigger outfits are also worried. Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx will become self-sufficient this summer when it starts up its own natural-gas-fired generating system. Office buildings with electricity back-up systems are at a premium in the real estate market. At least one new office tower has been proposed in Manhattan that would make all its own electricity there to supply tenants' needs.
Energy experts caution that the number of those leaving the shelter of the grid is expected to remain small for now, barring a severe price increase or power failure. They also stress that because many of these new systems rely on natural gas, they provide limited protection from rising energy prices. 
But what has changed is the money trail. Private capital, hard to attract for alternative energy projects in recent years, is now flowing. And the main reason, they say, is the state of New York. 
Last month, Gov. George E. Pataki announced that he would require all state buildings to have at least 20 percent of their electricity supplied by renewable, nonpolluting sources like wind or solar power by 2010. While that deadline is years away, Mr. Pataki's order is already stimulating the market for so-called green energy by putting the state on record as an interested consumer. 
The state's energy agency, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, has invested $40 million, most of that in just the last few months, to encourage conservation and alternative generation. The agency is working with 50 private companies specializing in energy management products. Nearly half of those companies have entered the New York market in just the last two years, and the number of companies is expected to double again over the next year, according to estimates from the authority.
"Finding investing capital is no longer a problem," said Bill Moore, a principal at Atlantic Renewable Energy, a Richmond, Va., company that is developing a 75-megawatt wind power project west of the Adirondacks in New York State.

Challenges for Old Suppliers
For utilities and power suppliers, however, the state's new efforts and the scramble for innovative solutions have been a mixed blessing.
Many energy company officials have been outraged as the New York Power Authority, a state-chartered agency that supplies power to government and other customers, has built 10 small emergency power plants around New York City this summer. While private companies wait in line for the state to consider their plant proposals -- spending millions of dollars in some cases just to complete the preapplication process -- the state itself has leapfrogged ahead of them Yesterday, a state appeals court said that in its rush to install the plants, the state had failed to conduct environmental impact studies of the minipower plants.
"Here you are, running as hard as you can, and you look over your shoulder and find that the project that gets done quicker, faster and better is the state's," said an official at a company that has applied to build a plant in New York City.
For big energy providers, the great question of the next few years is how the new growth in independent generation, alternative energy and conservation technology will fit, if at all, with their existing operations and their future. 
The Long Island Power Authority has jumped with both feet into alternative energy, investing in fuel cells, solar and wind projects that it predicts will supply 10 percent of the Island's energy needs by the end of the decade.
But its neighbor on Long Island, the KeySpan Corporation, faces a quandary. KeySpan, which owns power plants and sells natural gas, has built the Montefiore Medical Center's new generation plant, and will sell the hospital the natural gas to run it. But every sale like that means less demand for the electricity the company sells from its large generating stations like Ravenswood in Queens. Projecting the region's energy mix four or five years from now, a company spokesman said, has become much harder.
"It's a very different energy dynamic than we were talking about even just two months ago," said David J. Manning, a senior vice president for corporate affairs at KeySpan.
In this confusing time, the prospects are unclear even for the new power plants that are supposed to end all the uncertainty. 
Although proposals for 85 plants across the state are in some stage of consideration by state officials, the sheer volume of proposals has slowed the approval process. No one says that the state needs anywhere near 85 plants, so each time a plant is approved, uncertainty is cast on the rest. That uncertainty, in turn, further slows the process, as companies delay expensive reports and analyses while reassessing their likelihood of success.
So while the electricity industry looks to 2003 as the year when the first new plants will start to relieve New York's supply problem, the wait could stretch on.
"This is a shaking-out period," said Bill May, the project manager for Astoria Energy, a subsidiary of SCS Energy, which has proposed a 1,000-megawatt plant in Astoria, Queens.

Reducing Demand
For many decades before the world was wired, ice was the main ingredient for cooling a building. It may yet be again. 
Beginning this fall, an otherwise ordinary-looking Manhattan high-rise office building on the Avenue of the Americas at 45th Street will install in its basement enough tanks to make and store about 380 tons of ice, which it plans to use next summer for air-conditioning. By using ice instead of chilled water, which is the ordinary technology, the building will use less electricity. The ice will also be made at night, when electricity prices are lowest, so that little or no power will be needed to run the cooling system during peak daylight hours. 
But those savings are only the beginning. The building's owner, the Durst Organization, then plans to bid the saved energy back into the wholesale electricity market and get paid all over again. The company will, in effect, sell its savings. 
The idea that demand for electricity is a commodity that can be sold is the core of a provisional program created this year by the organization that administers the state's power market, the Independent System Operator. The program, which the system operator says is the first of its kind in the country, allows energy users to put on the table just how much electricity they will forgo or defer using if the price is right.
Since the program began in June, 29 businesses around the state have proposed forgoing 500 megawatts of energy that they will be paid not to use if supplies run short. Users of another 400 megawatts have volunteered to take payments to shut off power if supplies reach a more critical stage.
The Durst plan depends on real-time pricing, the ability to gauge what electricity costs at any given time. Con Edison plans to begin installing as many real-time electricity meters as possible this year under a metering plan recently approved by the state, though the number of customers seeking the new devices is still small, a spokesman said. In many parts of New York City, the meters are probably years away, because many older buildings have a single meter for all units.
Prof. Roger Anderson, director of the energy research center at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, does not think the piecemeal remedies will solve the long-term energy problems. But the attempt, he says, will force a reckoning. Looking ahead five years, Professor Anderson says he is a pessimist, but his view changes to optimistic after 10 years.
"It's like a car," he said. "You fix the transmission and find that the engine is busted, so you fix the engine the rear end is busted, and then you need a new car. We're going to come out of this realizing we need a new car."

HEADLINE: New Proposal To Route Power Cable Across Sound 

BYLINE:  By ELISSA GOOTMAN 

 BODY:
Four months after Connecticut regulators rejected a plan to build a power cable across Long Island Sound, saying it would damage oyster beds and provide little benefit to Connecticut residents, the company seeking to build the cable has come up with a new plan that seeks to limit its environmental and commercial impact.
 Under the latest proposal, the cable system -- which would include two high-voltage cables and one fiber-optic connection -- would be rerouted to avoid the areas of New Haven Harbor that are rich in commercially cultivated shellfish. 
 The Cross-Sound Cable Company, a subsidiary of TransEnergie U.S. Ltd., submitted the new proposal yesterday afternoon to the Connecticut Siting Council, the regulatory body that rejected the previous application in March. 
Richard M. Kessel, the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, said that the cable, which would be able to transmit 330 megawatts of electricity between New Haven and Shoreham, in Suffolk County, was a critical component of the utility's plan to prevent blackouts on Long Island.
Under the new proposal, Mr. Kessel said, New England regulators would be able to control the flow of power through the cable.
But while the company may have addressed some of its critics' concerns, others remain. Some people are skeptical of the very idea of a cable, saying that like scarves or perfume, imported energy could prove to be expensive.
"The idea that Long Island's going to be able to buy a lot of cheap power during the peak summer hours doesn't make any sense," said Nathanael Greene, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "The people up in New England are going to use the cheap power, and whatever is left for Long Island to purchase will be expensive."
Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, suggested that Long Island meet its energy demand by creating more supply, building more power plants on its own turf.
"As long as it's sucking energy from elsewhere, it will fail to meet its own energy obligations, and it will contribute to price increases on both sides of the Sound," he said.
As utility officials and their watchdogs debated the merits of the new cross-Sound cable proposal, the Suffolk County executive approved a law limiting the amount of carbon dioxide that its power plants could emit.
According to the bill, which the Legislature passed in June and County Executive Robert J. Gaffney signed yesterday, power plants that emit more than 1,800 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour will be fined $2 for every ton above the limit. The law goes into effect next March.
Alternatively, plants could buy emission credits through carbon dioxide trading markets or avoid penalties by investing in alternative energy sources.
Mr. Kessel said the new law would not drive up electricity prices.
"I think that this bill certainly makes a very important environmental point," he said. "We are comfortable that we can comply with its provisions without facing serious economic harms that would force us to raise electric rates."

Getting Away From It All, at Least for a Little While

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
It's summertime, and that means the beach and other vacation spots beckon workers away from the office. But with a weak economy, high gasoline prices early in the season and higher costs for meals and lodging, some vacations may be scaled back or shortened this year. 
 Fourteen percent of travelers cited gasoline prices as a deterrent to traveling, and 7 percent said the state of the economy caused them to have more modest travel plans, according to a survey by the Travel Industry Association of America. In addition, the average length of travelers' longest summer trip is expected to decrease this summer, to 8.3 days from 10.1 days last year. That might not affect most people's plans, though, since trips over six days made up only 15 percent of all trips taken last year. 
 AAA predicts that the number of Americans traveling during summer holidays this year is close to that of previous years, but Jerry Cheske, a spokesman for the association, notes that Americans are adjusting their plans in the face of the economic slowdown. "People might rely on shorter trips and trips closer to home to save money on gas and to save money over all," Mr. Cheske said. 
 According to AAA, the average price of meals and lodging is up 5 percent this year, the largest increase in three years. And though the price of gasoline has fallen recently, it still is about 30 cents more a gallon on average than it was two years ago. KATHLEEN O'BRIEN

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT; 
Getting the Corporate Point Across to Employees

BYLINE:  By THOM WEIDLICH 

 BODY:
In January, General Motors announced an unorthodox plan: its employees in charge of communicating with employees would no longer report to a G.M. executive but to a New York City consultant who specialized in management-employee relations.
 G.M.'s so-called integrators -- about 100 employee-communications specialists spread throughout the company -- now report to Gary F. Grates, president of GCI Boxenbaum Grates, part of the GCI Group public relations unit of the Grey Global Group. Mr. Grates, in turn, reports to Steven J. Harris, since 1999 the G.M. vice president for communications. 
 Why the change? "We do an annual census of employees about their perceptions," Mr. Harris said. "We weren't seeing the movement as far as employees understanding what we were trying to communicate. We weren't satisfied with the pace of the progress." 
Mr. Grates, he added, "has leading-edge theories about how to change cultures."
"We want to move the needle in providing our employees with information about G.M. and the automotive business."
Since January, Mr. Grates, who now spends three days a week in Detroit, has been evaluating how G.M. talks with its employees. "We've been getting our arms around how that looks and feels, beginning with the way the leadership communicates to what it looks and sounds like at the plant level," he said. "We've assessed where things are, and now we're rethinking some things in regards to aligning the messages with the company's business goals.'
An innovation of his at G.M. was to introduce a monthly report, Messages from the Marketplace, that describes how G.M.'s responses to changes in the auto industry and the economy affect workers. "That's information we haven't always provided them," Mr. Harris said.
General Motors' decision to farm out a crucial management task takes an emerging corporate trend to a new level.
"We get hired a lot by organizations to support their internal communications efforts," Mr. Grates said. "At G.M., we're actually brought in to lead it."
The practice of hiring outside professionals first emerged in the early 1980's, and by 1995 had become commonplace enough for the New York-based Public Relations Society of America to create an employee-communications section.
At first, outside specialists were brought in mostly in times of upheaval, like mergers, revampings and layoffs, which is why the practice is sometimes also referred to as change communications. But for most companies today, change is constant. Therefore, so is change communications.
The professionals are hired, usually for individual projects, for the same reason other consultants often are: they can bring a fresh perspective and knowledge of the best practices in the field.
Last year, for example, Delta Air Lines decided to remake its image with a new ad campaign and changes in its logo, plane exteriors and uniforms. Such a rebranding had not been tried in at least 15 years, said Dan Lewis, Delta's director of corporate communications, and the airline wanted to make sure the employees were on board.
"We needed some help in shaping the messages and in the strategy for presenting it to employees," Mr. Lewis said. "We wanted to get experiences from other companies that had gone through rebranding efforts since it had been a long time since we had done it."
So Delta hired Banner McBride, the workplace communications arm of the Hill & Knowlton unit of the WPP Group. One thing the agency helped the company with, Mr. Lewis said, was to step back and define for employees "what a brand is and why it makes any difference at all to a front-line employee."
A cost-cutting drive is another corporate event that can spur a phone call to an internal-communications specialist. Consolidated Papers hired Edelman Public Relations Worldwide of Chicago last year to help explain a major layoff to its work force.
"We had not gone through one in the recent past. So to ensure we had all the communications bases touched, we brought in Edelman so we weren't learning as we went along," said Scott Deitz, a spokesman for the company, which is now owned by Stora Enso of Finland and goes by that name in the United States.
It does not have to be a crisis, though. This year, the wireless service provider Nextel Communications turned to the New York public relations agency Porter Novelli, a unit of the Omnicom Group, to help explain its new three-year business strategy to employees. And A.& P. hired Davis & Company, an internal communications agency in River Edge, N.J., to help it explain its revamped operations and its workplace culture.
"They're good at plain-old straight talk," Susan G. Adam, A.& P.'s vice president for leadership and organizational development, said of Davis. "Given the complexity of what we're trying to do, it takes time to say things simply. They'll come up with that calm and simple way."
The reason for the shift is simple: companies have become painfully aware that sending the right message to their employees is just as important as making a good impression with customers, vendors and investors. At the same time they have come to realize that their senior executives are not always very adept at it.
Good rapport can improve a company's performance. A 1998 Harvard Business Review article reported that Sears, Roebuck & Company found that a five-point improvement in employee attitudes on internal surveys ultimately led to a 0.5 percent increase in revenue growth.
"Today's managers were accountants, engineers, I.T. people who got to where they are not because of their great communications skills," said Alison Davis, chief executive of Davis & Company, who often trains managers to fill in that gap. "They say, 'O.K., we're going to close this plant. You're the front-line communicator.' These managers need to know how to communicate."

Nextel and AT&T WirelessRegister Losses

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Nextel Communications Inc., the wireless telephone company controlled by Craig McCaw, and AT&T Wireless Services Inc., which Mr. McCaw sold to AT&T in 1994, posted second-quarter losses today as they spent more to draw customers.
 Nextel's loss widened to $369 million, or 56 cents a share, compared with $241 million, or 38 cents, in the quarter a year earlier. Per-share figures are after the payment of preferred dividends. Sales climbed 38 percent, to $1.88 billion, as Nextel signed up 658,600 users, bringing its total to 8.95 million worldwide. 
 The company said the recent quarter included a charge of $22 million, or 3 cents a share, for restructuring, and losses on foreign-currency transactions of $45 million, or 6 cents a share. 
Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call had expected Nextel to post a loss of 53 cents a share.
AT&T Wireless, separated from its parent on July 9, had a loss from operations of $35 million, or 3 cents a share, excluding an after-tax gain of $298 million, or 12 cents a share, from the sale of a stake in the Japan Telecom Company. Including the gain, net income in the quarter was $263 million. Overall revenue rose 37 percent, to $3.38 billion from $2.48 billion. The company added 668,000 customers, bringing its total without affiliates and partners to 16.4 million.
AT&T Wireless was expected to have a loss of 1 cent a share, according to Thomson Financial.
Nextel and AT&T Wireless maintained their forecasts for second-half growth, even with the sluggish economy. Nextel expects to add about two million customers this year; it has already added just more than one million. AT&T Wireless forecast 20 percent subscriber growth in 2001. Not including affiliates and partners, the company has attracted 1.25 million new users.
Shares of Nextel, based in Reston, Va., fell $1.40, to $15.96. Shares of AT&T Wireless, based in Redmond, Wash., fell 44 cents, to $16.75.

HEADLINE: White House In No Hurry With Options To Kyoto Pact 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
The 178 countries that completed a treaty on Monday aimed at curbing global warming may have to wait a very long time before President Bush, who rejected the pact, puts any alternative on the table, some American officials say.
 Mr. Bush and members of his administration have repeatedly said that they consider climate change a serious issue, that greenhouse gases eventually need to be stabilized and that they are reviewing options. 
 But some officials involved in the policy review, and business executives and experts who have briefed the cabinet, say there appears to be little, if any, pressure from the top to come up with something soon. 
The highest echelons at the White House, they say, see little need to amplify what was said last month, when Mr. Bush made a Rose Garden speech and a cabinet panel headed by Vice President Dick Cheney issued a 32-page report on the subject.
"There is going to be a Phase 2, but what happens depends on domestic political pressure," said one American official involved in parts of the administration's policy review.
Global warming has been a major topic in Europe, where various Green parties exert a powerful influence in several countries, but it generally remains far down on lists of day-to-day concerns in the United States, fading in and out of the news.
"There's a sense in which everybody's saying the American public doesn't have the attention span or background to pay attention to this issue," the official said. "There's still a hopeful perception around the White House that this has gone away."
White House officials defend the slow pace of the review, saying it reflects the importance and complexity of curbing the rising concentrations of carbon dioxide, which is a basic byproduct of burning fuels and thus a result of almost every daily activity.
"The long-term goal is stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere," a senior White House official said recently. "But our approach must be measured, flexible and consistent with economic growth and prosperity."
In the meantime, by standing firm against binding restrictions, particularly in the form of a treaty, Mr. Bush is satisfying conservative Republicans, who rarely support treaties on global problems.
Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, has long objected to the treaty on curbing gases that contribute to global warming, which is called the Kyoto Protocol. On Monday, he praised the president and American negotiators for steering clear.
He and the president both say the treaty threatened the economy and is unfair because emissions cuts are required only of the 38 top industrialized countries, and not of developing nations. 
Mr. Hagel, who was once an outspoken skeptic on the science of global warming, now believes that it is a serious problem and is interested in legislation to tackle it. 
In the absence of a new policy direction from the president, the driving force at home now appears to be Congress. This month alone, there have been several proposed bills and three Congressional hearings on global warming. 
Over all, experts say, it is becoming clear that rejection of the Kyoto treaty will not stand as a substitute for action for much longer. 
"Kyoto has become something of an albatross," said William K. Reilly, who was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under Mr. Bush's father. "Deficiencies with Kyoto are advanced as a reason not to address the climate problem seriously. It's as if it's the only mode for addressing the problem."
Mr. Reilly worked on the first climate treaty, the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was signed by the first President Bush nine years ago, but was strictly voluntary. That earlier accord gave rise to the Kyoto Protocol, which is expected to be formally adopted at a meeting in the fall in Marrakesh, Morocco.
For now, the Bush administration is focusing on developing a plan to improve research on causes of global warming and on ways to capture greenhouse gases with new technologies. The only international initiative Mr. Bush has announced is new work with Central and South American countries to promote conservation of forests, which absorb carbon dioxide. 
Some officials from Europe, which spearheaded the drive to finish the details of the treaty in Bonn, have sensed the lack of political urgency in the United States and expressed deep frustration over the situation.
"We've fallen into a trap," said one European diplomat. "We knew that Bush wasn't going to accede to Kyoto and gave him a bit of space to let him develop a policy. But the upshot is there's nothing."

HEADLINE: Greenspan Says Fed's Rate Cuts Are Working 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today that the central bank's interest rate cuts were having their desired effect on the weakened economy, and he again left the door open to further cuts if the slowdown did not bottom out soon.
 "Clearly, where monetary policy goes from here will depend crucially on the evolving situation in the economy," Mr. Greenspan said. 
 Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan repeated a prepared statement he had delivered last week to the House Financial Services Committee in which he said the economy still faced risks but appeared to be past the worst.
In response to questions, Mr. Greenspan said that he did not see deflation as a threat to the economy and that the problems facing Japan were very different from those facing the United States. 
He played down any threat that the economic problems in Argentina could set off cascading problems in the rest of the world in the way that financial difficulty in Asia in 1997 and 1998 led to a global financial crisis.
He also defended the Fed's conduct of monetary policy over the last year, saying the central bank did not wait too long to cut interest rates as it became clear that the economy was decelerating.
Asked whether the Fed's six interest rate cuts this year had been as potent as expected in reviving the economy, Mr. Greenspan said monetary policy interacts with the economy and the markets in complex ways that are hard to track.
"I'm not saying there is a black box, or anything of that nature, but the complexity of our economy is such, and the way liquidity flows through the system is such, that you essentially get very complex differences in the way monetary policy plays out," Mr. Greenspan said. "But at the end of the day, it does seem to be effective."
Mr. Greenspan said that while long-term rates set by the bond market had not responded much to the Fed's rate cuts -- in part because they had fallen last year in anticipation of an easing of monetary policy -- shorter-term rates had declined this year. Rates on auto loans and credit cards, for example, had fallen by a percentage point, he said.
The Fed chairman said that financial markets were signaling that Argentina was making headway in bolstering its economic condition. In any case, he said, there is now less chance than a few years ago of a problem in one developing country spreading rapidly through the global financial system, despite the slowdown in the United States.
"The tinder out there, if I may use the term, is much less than there was in 1997," he said. "There are very few fixed-exchange-rate problems. The extent to which debt was extended is much less. The reserves are better."
Asked whether he shared the concern of some economists that the United States could face deflation and a liquidity crisis of the sort that has plagued Japan, he said no. 
The problem in Japan, he said, is that banks, saddled with huge losses on real estate loans, have all but ceased to perform their function as financial intermediaries -- that is, lending to creditworthy enterprises to keep the economy moving.
The United States has problems, he said, "but it is scarcely an issue of lack of liquidity or a lack of financial intermediation," because the banking system and the financial markets have remained healthy.

HEADLINE: A Climate Pact Without America 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Calling the Bush administration "shortsighted" for refusing to join the Kyoto participants because of "the potential drag on future American economic growth" (editorial, July 23) ignores the present state of the United States and world economies. 
 Further, if Gerhard Schroder, the German chancellor, is, as you say, "frustrated by Mr. Bush's unreasonable withdrawal from the Kyoto agreement," imagine Mr. Schroder's distress as he tries to improve the German economy while complying with the Kyoto treaty.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Quietly Left Four Mostly White Clubs 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

 BODY:
Two months before announcing his bid for mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg quietly began resigning from four exclusive clubs in Manhattan and Westchester County that have predominantly white memberships.
 The disclosure by the Bloomberg campaign came yesterday in response to queries from The New York Times about Mr. Bloomberg's affiliations with private organizations. The campaign released the names of 10 private social and sports clubs in which Mr. Bloomberg maintains a membership, but it also acknowledged that beginning in April, he sent letters of resignation to four others. 
 "Mike feels that the clubs he is currently a member of have inclusive admission policies that are consistent with his personal beliefs," said Edward Skyler, a campaign spokesman.
Two of the clubs that Mr. Bloomberg quit, the Harmonie Club in Manhattan and the Century Country Club in Purchase, were founded by Jews in the 19th century because they were routinely denied admission to the established clubs of the time. Mr. Bloomberg had been a member of both clubs since at least the late 1980's, his campaign said. 
The other two clubs, the Brook Club, which is all male, and the Racquet and Tennis Club, both in Manhattan, are also venerable institutions with predominantly white memberships. Mr. Bloomberg joined those clubs in the late 1990's, according to his campaign.
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign was careful not to criticize the clubs or their members, an indication of the delicate balancing act the billionaire candidate is trying to perform between his social life among the city's elite and his nascent political ambitions. A campaign official said the resignations were an acknowledgment of "the obligations of running for public office," but Mr. Bloomberg did not want to make a big issue of them.
Mr. Bloomberg's decision to leave the clubs has been so low-key that one of his golfing partners at the Century Country Club, Arthur Levitt, did not know about the resignation when asked last week about Mr. Bloomberg's membership there.
Mr. Levitt is the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and a member of the board of Mr. Bloomberg's company, Bloomberg L.P. Mr. Levitt said the club's roster included many influential people, including Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and James D. Wolfensohn, the World Bank president.
"I think there are probably a limited number of non-Jewish members," Mr. Levitt said. "I have seen blacks and I have seen Hispanics, but I have no idea whether they are members or not. Somebody told me there was a black member, but you could hardly say there was lavish representation of the black or Hispanic community at Century, or any other club, for that matter."
Steven A. Seiden, president of the Century Country Club, would not discuss the club's admissions policy or membership. "We don't comment about any aspect of the club to outsiders, one way or the other," he said. "We just don't discuss these things. Period." 
None of the other clubs responded to telephone calls requesting information about their membership requirements. The Brook Club is closed for renovations until September, according to someone who answered the phone there. 
Mr. Bloomberg has spoken during the campaign about the importance of trying to change organizations from within, particularly in the context of the Boy Scouts and the ban on homosexual members. But in leaving the four clubs, he implicitly acknowledged that they could not be changed fast enough for his political needs and that his affiliation with them could prove an embarrassment.
Asked if Mr. Bloomberg's membership at the Century Country Club might pose a problem for his mayoral aspirations, Mr. Levitt said, "I have learned that in politics, any issue is a legitimate issue."
Elinor Guggenheimer, the founder of the New York Women's Agenda and a member of the Century Country Club since 1946, said the nature of social and sports clubs was to be exclusive -- not out of prejudice, but because like-minded people enjoy socializing together. Mrs. Guggenheimer said she did not know of any black or Hispanic members, but she also did not know of black or Hispanic applicants who were denied membership because of race or ethnicity.
"A club is a peculiar place," she said. "It is not a job. It a place where friends get together. Until you break down all of the nice little barriers we put up and we all get to be friends, the chances are you get a group of people who are very much alike."
The club, she said, has come a long way in other areas, like the treatment of women, although she said it still did not permit women on the golf course in the early mornings on the presumption that they did not work and could play later in the day. 
Mr. Levitt said memberships were limited and very few openings came along. "It is a practical fact that they have filled up their roster," he said. "There isn't much turnover. Very few people leave these sought-after golf clubs."
Over the years, various members of the Sulzberger family, which owns the controlling shares in The New York Times Company, have also belonged to the Century Country Club. Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the chairman of The New York Times Company and publisher of The Times, said his father had once been a member but he was not.
According to his campaign, the clubs where Mr. Bloomberg maintains a membership include the Bond Club, the Century Association, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Harvard Club, the New York Yacht Club and the Kappa Beta Phi fraternity, all of which are in New York City; the Golf Club of Purchase, ; the Caves Valley Golf Club in Maryland; and the Coral Beach and Tennis Club and the Mid Ocean Club, both in Bermuda.

HEADLINE: Bush's European Theater 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: ROME, July 24 

 BODY:
Midway through President Bush's journey across Europe, from the friendly terrain of Britain to the violent protests in Genoa to the bleak border between Kosovo and Macedonia, a senior German official offered this revised assessment of how the president is viewed by his closest allies.
 "We're getting used to him," he said. 
 It was a phrase that came up often on this trip, six months into Mr. Bush's presidency, as a prelude to both guarded praise and harsh criticism. If Mr. Bush's first foray to Europe in June was, to use his own phrase, all about "icebreaking," this one was mostly deal-making. And his performance alternately perplexed and pleased. 
Over the week the Europeans saw all the contradictory shades that have made him so hard to define in domestic politics: the defiant Bush, the obstinate Bush, the creative Bush, and the malleable Bush.
Mr. Bush was defiant when it came to the protests that racked Genoa during the meeting of the leaders of the world's largest industrialized nations and Russia. He declared the people on the streets plain wrong, saying they should just accept as a matter of fact that free trade is the only path out of poverty. He appeared not the least bit interested in entertaining the intellectual arguments about whether borderless competition worsens the gap between rich and poor. 
"I know what I believe," he said Sunday night in the Roman Forum and added, "and I believe what I believe is right."
He was obstinate when the subject turned to the Kyoto Protocol on global warming. Mr. Bush told the leaders in Genoa that they should sit and wait until his administration came up with an alternative plan, but he would not say when. 
So they papered over their dispute in the meeting's communique and then delivered him a stinging rebuke in Bonn, where a simultaneous conference resolved long disputes over specific language on how countries will define and limit their emissions of carbon dioxide. One hundred and seventy-eight countries agreed, but not the United States.
Yet Mr. Bush seemed just to shrug when asked whether the United States had isolated itself. His aides suggested the treaty was worth little if Washington did not sign, leading one senior Japanese official to ask a reporter how long it would take for the White House team to "rid itself of this American arrogance." 
But at the next moment, Europe saw the creative Bush, who can capitalize on his freshness to the world scene to force a rethinking of old approaches. In this case, the issue was the balance of nuclear terror 12 years after the cold war ended. 
By the end of the week, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia all said that Mr. Bush was right to force the world to think about a new "strategic framework" that links drastic cuts in bloated, unnecessary nuclear arsenals to the first talks over missile defenses.
Mr. Bush looked elated. "You saw the president yesterday," he said of Mr. Putin. "I thought he was very forward-leaning, as they say in diplomatic nuanced circles." Then Mr. Berlusconi stepped in to suggest, ever so gently, that Mr. Bush would be wise to tone down his threats about dumping the Antiballistic Missile Treaty if Mr. Putin does not reach an accord soon enough.
"They come from a past," Mr. Berlusconi said of the Russians. "They were a world power. They had a very strong fall as far as their economy was concerned." But they have "that old pride," he said. 
And then, driving home the point to Mr. Bush, he said, "I believe that this can all be done without unilateral measures." 
Finally, Mr. Bush came close to full circle on a position he took in the campaign: that American troops should withdraw as soon as practical from the Balkans, leaving the Europeans to keep the peace. When Mr. Bush landed at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo this morning, he told the troops that they play a vital role, declaring that America and its allies "came in together, and we will leave together." 
His only nod to his old view is the statement that "our goal is to hasten the day when peace is self-sustaining," which was, in the end, the goal of President Clinton before him.
The Balkan experience has convinced the Europeans of one thing: Mr. Bush can, under the right conditions, be persuaded to change his mind. A senior French official at the Genoa meeting said the caricatures that filled the French press for months of a dumb cowboy are "plain silly."
"He's a good listener," the official said. "He has his convictions, but it's not as though he's not open to discussion."
But these many faces of the new president have left the Europeans posing the same question as Congressional Democrats: when Mr. Bush says he wants to consult, does he mean he wants to converse for a while then go ahead as planned? And how does one reconcile his seeming absence of intellectual curiosity about the roiling debate over globalization with his intense engagement on the subject of nuclear defenses and embryonic stem cell research?
Perhaps one reason that it is taking the world so long to get used to Mr. Bush is that his interests bear little resemblance to Bill Clinton's. Mr. Clinton could wax on for hours about the pros and cons of a free trade and its intersection with domestic and world politics.
In fact, he would talk about the issue so much that he got himself into trouble. Mr. Clinton's public musing about strategies to spread American-style environmental standards and labor rights around the world so terrified developing nations at the Seattle trade conference in 1999 that they sank Mr. Clinton's hopes for another round of global trade talks.
"Our responsibility is to help countries prepare for the new world they are entering, not to talk endlessly," said Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, during a break in the Genoa meeting. "Rather than say. 'On-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand,' President Bush has a concrete way to say to Senegal and El Salvador, 'This will help you.' "
Mr. Bush's fellow leaders, when speaking publicly, say they detect signs that he is becoming more internationalist as he gains experience. "We were all pleased by his new orientation," President Jacques Chirac of France said at the end of the Genoa meeting, where Mr. Bush had solicited Mr. Chirac's views at length on the Middle East. 
But it will be a long while before Mr. Bush can erase the early image of a man who defines America's national interests narrowly and who looks to unilateralism when frustrated by slow diplomacy. 
Of course, it took Mr. Clinton more than two years to define his diplomatic style and one senior American diplomat, a veteran of the debates over Bosnia, noted this weekend that "getting him to the right place wasn't pretty." Getting Mr. Bush there, in the midst of the global warming debate and the fragile new arms talks with Russia, may not be much prettier.

That's How the Bubble Bursts: One Goes Down for the 10 Count

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER HAWTHORNE 

 BODY:
 In June, Interiors magazine shut its doors. Now, One Media, the publisher of One, both a magazine and a Web site, has succumbed to the economic downturn. 
Its August-September issue, the fifth and final One, is on newsstands now. One, produced in San Francisco, sought a mainstream readership with its breezy architecture and design coverage. One Media, founded 18 months ago by Dana Lyon, former publisher of Wired magazine, raised money as if it were an Internet startup. It employed 40 people, and One's circulation reached 200,000. "When we look back on this period we'll all be floored by how quickly the economy went south," said Stacy Morrison, One's editor in chief. CHRISTOPHER HAWTHORNE

HEADLINE: THE POP LIFE 

BYLINE:  By Neil Strauss 

 BODY:
Still Wild, Wildly Talkative
 "How long have you got?" asked Reg Presley, the lead singer of the 60's band the Troggs, speaking by telephone from his hotel in Manhattan on Tuesday. His words were ones that every journalist wants to hear at the start of an interview: an artist implying he has all the time in the world to talk. 
 What followed was a nearly two-hour conversation that grappled with the mysteries of life, the universe and religion. And on occasion, the discussion touched the subject of the Troggs. The group formed in 1964 in Andover, England, where Mr. Presley continues to live (he was named Reginald Ball, but decided to adopt a famous rock 'n' roll name to spark rumors of a blood connection to the king). 
Impressed by the band's version of "You Really Got Me," Larry Page, an early manager of the Kinks, took the Troggs under his wing. He gave them a song written by an American, Chip Taylor, and the resulting single, the snarling, suggestive, ocarina-laden "Wild Thing," made it to No. 1 in the United States. 
"They tried to ban 'Wild Thing' in England because it was too sexual," Mr. Presley said. "It's like a nursery rhyme compared to what they get away with today. And I'll tell you what, nursery rhymes are vicious too. You have Humpty Dumpty falling off the wall and smashing to pieces."
Though "Wild Thing" remains the Troggs' best-known song, the band went on to record numerous classics of the era, ranging from rough, crude rock 'n' roll ("I Can't Control Myself," "I Want You") to gentle, beautifully orchestrated ballads ("Any Way That You Want Me" and "Love Is All Around").
The group's hit-making days ended with the decade, though the circulation of an unintentionally hilarious studio argument by the band gave them a new notoriety. With Mr. Presley telling the rest of the band that the music was lacking the requisite "fairy dust" that makes a No. 1 hit, the recording is said to have inspired the movie "Spinal Tap." Though the reputation of the Troggs is ultimately that of British punk precursors, they also have a lasting influence in the realm of treacly pop, thanks to the Scottish boy-band Wet Wet Wet, whose 1994 version of "Love Is All Around" sat at No. 1 on the British pop charts for 15 weeks.
"I'm now in the position where I don't have to ever work again in my life because I made so much money out of 'Love Is All Around,' " Mr. Presley said of the Wet Wet Wet success. "But you still want something to do and something to interest you."
And that is one reason that the Troggs, who never performed in the United States at the peak of their success, have become more regular guests on New York stages in recent years. Tonight, the band is to perform at the Village Underground in Greenwich Village as part of the Cavestomp garage-rock series.
As anyone who searches for Reg Presley's name on the Internet will find out, when the singer discusses doing something to interest him, he doesn't mean just music. In recent years, he has become known as an expert on U.F.O.'s, crop circles and other mysteries. He often appears at such conferences as a speaker and is working on a book, which he plans to call "Wild Things They Don't Tell You."
Much of his conversation involved the articulate elucidation of his current theories. They ranged from thoughts on white-powder gold and the Messianic bloodline of Jesus Christ, based on the writings of Sir Lawrence Gardner and the research of David Hudson, to his own proposal for creating a nonmonetary economy, in which people work for six months a year and then enjoy free time the other six months.
The seed for Mr. Presley's esoteric interests was planted before the Troggs, back when he was a bricklayer. "I never used to swear when I was a builder, believe it or not," Mr. Presley said. "I only started swearing when I got into the rock business."
On a job one day, Mr. Presley and an older worker were told to find an underground water pipe. The other laborer went to a hazel wood tree, chopped out a V-shaped piece of wood and began dowsing for water. Mr. Presley watched, mocking the process, until his colleague pointed to a spot in the ground. Mr. Presley dug and struck the pipe three feet down. 
Three decades later, in 1990, Mr. Presley read about a crop circle that had formed in a field an hour away from his home and decided to see what it looked like. While standing in the middle of the formation, he noticed a man dowsing with metal wires. Mr. Presley asked if he could try. He took the dowsing implements, and as he walked around the crop circle the wires kept crossing and uncrossing. This led him to believe that there was some type of energy in the formation, and he began to wonder where it came from. "If there's one thing I like, it's puzzles," Mr. Presley said. 
And so began a second career for Mr. Presley, who began looking at life anew and trying not to take everything he had been taught about religion, the human race and the universe for granted. "We're fleas living on a dog's back," he said of humans in this world. "And one day that dog is going to rub her back to get the fleas off."

Father Earth
Mr. Presley isn't the only one worried about the earth. So is Mike D. of the Beastie Boys. Soon, music fans will begin to hear about something called the New Power Project, an environmental organization he has founded. Also known as the Save Our Environment Coalition, the project includes the Dave Matthews Band, Alanis Morissette, Jackson Browne, Moby, James Taylor, Trey Anastasio of Phish, the Barenaked Ladies and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. 
The coalition plans to turn the fan bases of each artist into environmental activists and to stage concerts to benefit environmental organizations and spread the word.

HEADLINE: Siemens, Posting 3rd-Quarter Loss, Fires a Unit Chief 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 25 

 BODY:
Siemens, the German electrical engineering company whose products range from light bulbs to nuclear power plants, fired the head of its telephone networks division today and promised drastic cost-cutting after surprising investors with a worse-than-expected loss of $428 million in the third quarter.
 The chief executive, Heinrich von Pierer, said "there are no taboos" in the plans to scour Siemens divisions for cost reductions beyond the 9,700 layoffs already announced this year. 
 Like other companies, including Ericsson of Sweden and Nokia of Finland, Siemens, which is based in Munich, has been hammered by a slowdown in the formerly booming telecommunications business. 
The company's third-quarter results showed a sharp reversal of that trend, with traditional businesses like power generation, transportation and medical operations posting solid gains, while its mobile phone and phone networks units lost a combined 1.1 billion euros, or about $964.6 million, in the quarter. 
Analysts at the ABN Amro bank warned, however, in an investors' note that the gains in the industrial divisions "are miles away from being able to offset the bleeding in the technology divisions."
With the economies in the United States and Europe slowing, job losses and executive purges have become commonplace. ABB, Europe's leading electrical engineering group; Ericsson, the phone and telecommunications switch maker in Sweden; Reuters, the financial-information company; and Invensys, a factory controls maker in Britain have all announced job cuts recently. Both Invensys and Marconi, Britain's biggest telephone equipment maker, announced the departure of top executives as investors complained about falling share prices and earnings.
Part of the problem lies primarily with telephone companies that incurred vast debts last year acquiring new wireless licenses at a time when the demand for mobile phones seemed unquenchable. No one had apparently foreseen the depth of the economic slowdown in the United States and its rapid effect on European companies.
These days, by contrast, phone companies have pared spending on new networks just as consumers started to postpone replacing their mobile phones with new models.
The gloom that resulted from these developments had already pushed down Siemens shares by 7 percent on Tuesday in anticipation of today's figures. The stock rose $1.91, to $51.31, today as investors looked beyond the bad news and focused on the company's readiness to reduce costs and change its management, analysts said.
Mr. Von Pierer said the cost cuts would include a further 800 million euros at its networks business and 400 million euros more at its mobile phone business, which vies with Ericsson as the world's third-largest maker of telephone handsets after Nokia and Motorola.
Among management changes, Siemens said Roland Koch, the head of its networks unit, would step down and be succeeded by Thomas Ganswindt. The company, which said it lost money at 5 of its 13 divisions in the third quarter, also replaced the senior executives at its industrial services and automation units.
"Our third-quarter results are unsatisfactory," Mr. Von Pierer said. "Over the coming weeks we will define further measures to improve our results," particularly in the networks division, which lost 563 million euros in the quarter before interest, taxes and amortization.
While many analysts had been forecasting a far less radical decline in the quarter, they ascribed its losses primarily to the decline in the technology businesses and the higher-than-expected cost of earlier job reductions. The company said it spent 790 million euros to pare its work force.
In the period last year, Siemens posted a 592 million euro profit.
The figures did not take into account exceptional items, mainly a one-time gain of 3.5 billion euros from the transfer of a stake in Infineon, a chip maker, to the Siemens pension fund, or results from Infineon itself. Taking the pension fund transfer into account, Siemens made a profit of $1.4 billion in the quarter, the company said.
Siemens has a roughly 51 percent stake in Infineon, Europe's second-biggest chip maker. Infineon posted a 371 million euro loss in the same quarter and may also be considering job reductions. That would bring it into line with other companies, like Royal Philips Electronics, a Dutch company that is Europe's biggest electronics manufacturer.

HEADLINE: Meek or Masterly, A Challenger Awaits 

BYLINE:  By LISA SCHEER 

 BODY:
WHEN Kenny Salan isn't playing chess online, there is a good chance he is watching chess online, or checking out an online lecture on the game. "I try to play every day," said Mr. Salan, 22, who studies health fitness management at Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Tex. After midnight he logs on to observe games between grandmasters, studying opening gambits and mating patterns. "I watch all of them if I can," he said.
 Mr. Salan, who uses the screen name Artisan Haxan, learned to play chess at age 9 and joined a local chess club four years later. A year ago he played his first game on the Internet. Now he is one of hundreds of thousands around the world who play chess online, an accessible and convenient alternative to the local chess club or the action in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village. 
 Many players are drawn to the chess sites by the prospect of improving their game while making small talk with comparable players around the world. There is even a community of masters and grandmasters who regularly visit the Web to challenge one another before an online audience. Many top-level players offer private lessons online or play casual players for a small fee. 
The decorum usually associated with the game often gives way to the no-holds-barred nature of the Internet. With some players not above mocking their opponents or brazenly flouting the rules, the result may seem like chess as brought to you by the World Wrestling Federation. 
Mr. Salan started his online chess playing at the World Chess Network, a crisply organized site that reports 500,000 visitors monthly. After registering and downloading a small chessboard program, players can scan a roster of potential challengers with screen names like Fat Masta G, Mr. Slurpy and Swimsuit Model, classified by the game length they want (from one minute to a half-hour) and identified by their numerical rating, based on performance online. 
A challenge is announced by the sound of a race car revving, and the game begins with the sound of a bell clang in a prizefight. After the game, the winner hears a wave of gentle applause; the loser hears taps.
Ratings become quite important to some players. My 10-year-old son, Elijah, responds to a drop in his rating like a gambler pumping quarters into a slot machine: he compulsively seeks one-minute games with highly rated players, hoping for a big, quick payout in rating points.
Other players are so ratings-obsessed that they will cheat to boost their numbers. A common method is to crib moves from a desktop chess program, viewed elsewhere on the screen, during a match. Another is to disconnect from the Internet in the middle of a losing game. The World Chess Network recently stiffened its penalties for such behavior, forcing offenders to resume play within three minutes or forfeit the match, and has threatened to expel offenders. 
A code of civility is hard to enforce when players exchange real-time messages. Although most online conversation is fairly friendly, insults are also a staple, even among some highly rated players. "One guy I beat 20 times in a row called me an idiot," said Larry Christiansen, a grandmaster and former United States chess champion who lectures frequently online. 
I have been cursed at in several languages, goaded, flirted with and told by an opponent that my playing "stinks like stinky cheese." In the beginning it bothered me, but now I vent back, calling my challengers crybabies, losers and worse. Several sites have features to offer some protection against gross profanity, either by filtering chat or turning it off completely. You can also send the sore loser to Siberia by putting him or her on your "avoid" or "no play" list.
For stronger players, the Internet Chess Club is worth checking out. Home to the Web's oldest for-profit chess server, the club now claims 26,000 paid subscribers, said the company's president, Daniel Sleator, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. He said that about 300 grandmasters and 500 international masters play at the site at no cost. 
For hard-core players like Ulrich Konig, 30, the Internet Chess Club is the place to go to play different chess variants. Mr. Konig, a researcher in the department of economics at the University of Vienna, favors an esoteric form of chess called Shatranj, which is thought to have originated in India in the seventh century. "This game is interesting because you want to know how people played chess before 1500," he said. 
Private lessons with top-level players are available at prices typically ranging from $20 to $100 an hour. My son recently took a one-hour lesson with Tim McGrew, an expert-level player who is an associate professor of philosophy at Western Michigan University. After playing a few quick games to assess Elijah's capabilities, Mr. McGrew introduced a concept called "flight square analysis," a fancy term for checking out the escape options of your opponent's king. 
Later he walked Elijah through the well-known Morphy vs. Allies game played in Paris in 1858, demonstrating with bright red arrows and blue circles how to sacrifice a queen to force a checkmate. Despite some glitches -- the text window was so narrow that Mr. McGrew's comments sometimes whipped past, unread -- the lesson was worthwhile.
One benefit of playing chess online is that it allows the timid to lose, and learn, with minimal humiliation. "Chess is a very private game, in a sense, because a lot of people don't want to be in an open setting when they lose," said Maxim Dlugy, a grandmaster and former president of the United States Chess Federation, which rates players and sanctions tournament chess. "When you play at home and lose a game, it's much easier to start a new one and learn that way because you don't feel that everyone in the world is laughing at you."

In Search of a Game or a Gambit
A sampling of online chess sites where people can play and learn strategy:

WORLD CHESS NETWORK: www.worldchessnetwork.com Users register and then download a small program containing a graphics interface. All the data required to match two challengers is crunched by the site's servers. Players click and drag pieces over a two-dimensional chessboard in timed games. Players receive numerical ratings that rise and fall based on the outcome of each game, with results weighted to reflect the strength of the opposition. Visitors can play eight rated games per day free. An annual subscription fee of $49 or monthly fee of $4.95 buys unlimited rated game play and extras like lectures by experts.

INTERNET CHESS CLUB: www.chessclub.com -- A site for stronger players, although its president, Daniel Sleator, maintains, "Our goal is not to intimidate." The cost is $49 a year ($24.50 for students), and seven-day trial subscriptions are available. The site also offers hundreds of chat channels where members discuss strategy and debate theory. Players can also chat while observing blitz, or speed chess, games between grandmasters. The site, based on the Unix operating system, is more difficult to use than the World Chess Network, but an online tech support staff usually responds to typed queries within minutes.

KASPAROVCHESS: www.kasparovchess.com -- Started up last year, the site allows users to register and play at no charge, or pay $4 a month for features including occasional tutorials by the world champion, Vladimir Kramnik, and the option to participate in blitz chess. The site is backed financially by Garry Kasparov and an Israeli investment group.

U.S. CHESS LIVE: www.uschesslive.org -- The official site of the United States Chess Federation, it is free to federation members. Nonmembers may log in and play free, unrated chess games or check out exhibition games by titled players and weekly lectures by experts. LISA SCHEER

HEADLINE: Need for Summer Jobs 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Summer jobs (Economic Scene, July 19) offer many teenagers a first job experience, and give them money for school and other expenses. One should not underestimate the impact of $900 in earnings for impoverished families, and spending that money locally in community stores. 
 In New York City, nearly 50,000 teenagers have worked each year in summer camps, libraries and senior centers. Without them, many organizations would be forced to cut or cancel summer services, which provide supervised activity for children of working parents. 
Without jobs, teenagers would lose work force experience and access to mentors and future employers, and the self-esteem that comes from a paycheck. New York and the nation should work to preserve summer youth employment.

HEADLINE: Deep in the Desert, No Longer Far Out 

BYLINE:  By ALASTAIR GORDON 

 BODY:
IF tie-dye T-shirts and Volkswagen Bugs are back, Paolo Soleri can't be far behind. For those who remember him as a Woodstock-era guru of alternative architecture, Dr. Soleri conjures images of trust-fund hippies trekking to Arizona to cast bronze bells in his foundries or to pour the concrete walls of Arcosanti, his hivelike community 65 miles north of Phoenix.
 For most of his 60-year career, Dr. Soleri, 82, has been perceived as a cult figure on architecture's freaky fringe. But what was once dismissed as counterculture dreams seems to be up for reappraisal. 
 "Until the late 80's most people thought we were just a bunch of odd people out in the desert," Dr. Soleri said during a New York stopover last month. "We have been talking about a 'lean alternative' in this opulent society, and more people seem to be responding." 
In 1970, Dr. Soleri began building Arcosanti, a planned community with observation towers, sweeping concrete vaults and dwellings clustered along the steep basalt cliffs of the Agua Fria River. Dr. Soleri conceived it as a prototype that would show how other cities might minimize energy use and motor transportation while encouraging human interaction. By concentrating inhabitants in a sequence of partly submerged multilevel structures, he sought to preserve the wildness of the surrounding desert landscape. Greenhouses provide gardening space and tap warm air for heating. "Our mission at Arcosanti has been to bring the city up to date, socially and culturally," Dr. Soleri said, "to create an antidote to sprawl."
Thirty-one years after Dr. Soleri founded his desert compound, the rest of the world may finally be coming around to his environmental design and pedestrian-oriented planning -- even as his career winds down. "Soleri has always been there and people are just now rediscovering him," said Jeffrey Cook, a professor of architecture at Arizona State University. "He was part of a flock of utopian dreamers who designed megastructure cities in the 1960's, but he had more of a social and ecological agenda than the others. His arguments continue to hold water."
The Soleri revival is marked by the publication of four new books, including an English edition of a monograph, "Soleri: Architecture as a Human Ecology" (Monicelli Press). Last year, he was presented the Golden Lion Award by the Venice Biennale for a lifetime of achievement. "They rediscovered me 40 years too late," Dr. Soleri said, smiling. 
At a time when signature architects are attended by publicists, Dr. Soleri plays the role of enigmatic elder statesman, a desert Obi-Wan Kenobie who defies easy categorization. He is at once an architect, artist, builder, teacher, writer and philosopher. He is incapable of the snappy sound bites, speaking instead in elliptical bursts peppered with words like vegativity, vectoriality and stardust. Thoughts trail off, sentences double back. In recent years, urban planners have thought small, tending toward the diminutive paste-and-patch approach. Now efforts to take on big problems like urban sprawl and energy shortages are regaining credibility. 
Dr. Soleri has never been afraid of thinking big. Really big. In fact, he seems to operate on his own extraterrestrial scale. During the 60's and early 70's, he created a series of renderings for what he called arcologies, fantastical combinations of architecture and ecology. They were vast, vaguely biomorphic cities with spheres and towers built on the ocean or asteroids. "Unless we moderate, unless we reinvent the American dream, then it's not going to be a dream," he said. "It's going to be doomsday."
For all their sci-fi brilliance, Dr. Soleri's plans suggest to some an authoritarian hand, a drawback that may have contributed to his period of disfavor. "He still belongs to the tradition where everything gets designed from the micro to the macro and I think that's where people feel he may be a bit out of touch," said Moshe Safdie, the Canadian architect who designed Habitat '67, one of the icons of 60's architecture. "People today demand to determine their own micro environments and they react when life appears to be designed for them." 
Autocratic as they may be, Dr. Soleri's drawings showed a generation of younger architects an alternative to corporate modernism. Will Bruder, a Phoenix-based architect whose new work includes the Burton Barr Central Library in Phoenix, apprenticed with Dr. Soleri in 1967. "Paolo's mind was always going out into the cosmos," Mr. Bruder said. "I learned how much you can do with very little, the potential of simplicity and the ability to make unbelievable things from modest means, to dream huge dreams." 
While Dr. Soleri's plan for high-density communities may be best suited to crowded third world countries, Mr. Bruder feels strongly that Dr. Soleri's lessons can work here, as well. "My own work is driven by discovering the extraordinary in the ordinary, and this comes from Paolo, who knows how to take ordinary things to another dimension," Mr. Bruder said. "My design for the Burton Barr Phoenix Central Library would not exist without Paolo's precedent -- organic forms tied to a rigid understanding of structure."
Dr. Soleri's native Italy was the first to see his work in a fresh light. One of the country's leading architecture schools at the Universita Degli Studi Roma, in Rome, held a conference this May devoted to his legacy. "A thousand people showed up when we only had room for a few hundred," said Sandro Bignozzi, an urban planner who organized the event. "Soleri is so important to Italians now. It is a time to look to his ideas again because we are overwhelmed with environmental problems here." 
The surge of interest among his countrymen has brought Dr. Soleri full circle. He studied architecture in Turin. After getting his Ph.D. in 1946, he spent a year and a half working for Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin West in Arizona, and at Taliesin East in Wisconsin. His design for a sweeping bridge called the Beast was exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1948. (The bridge brought more attention to Dr. Soleri than to Mr. Wright, contributing to a rift that led to Dr. Soleri's departure.) One of his earliest projects was the 1949 Dome House in Cave Creek, Ariz., made from cast concrete and natural stone with a sunken living area and a glass dome overlooking the desert. Dr. Soleri would later marry the client's daughter Colly Woods.
On their honeymoon in 1950, he was hired to build a ceramics factory (now being restored) in the Italian hillside town of Vietri sul Mare. He then returned to Arizona and in the 1960's started his own version of Taliesen, a compound on the outskirts of Scottsdale called Cosanti, with rustic rock walls and cast-concrete vaults integrated into the desert landscape. To raise money, he cast bronze wind bells that were sold at museum stores.
With his lean good looks and Italian charm, Dr. Soleri had no trouble attracting volunteers. Lucinda Ziesing, now a film producer in Camden, Me., arrived at Cosanti in the summer of 1969, at 19, after driving across the country. "I woke up listening to the bells ringing, and I met Soleri and we started to talk," she said. "Here was a man who appeared to be extremely focused, a man with a vision. He had no shirt on and he was very tan and he was busy sculpting something. He obviously had a big vision but then there were all these little bells. He was into the big and the small at the same time."
While Cosanti's poured concrete arches rose from the desert, Dr. Soleri filled sketchbooks with sinewy lines, drawn like human musculature, into arcologies, his imaginary cities. By the late-1960's, Dr. Soleri's Cosanti, on only five acres, was too small for the ambitions sketched in his notebooks, and he purchased 860 acres of desert north of Phoenix, near Cordes Junction. There, in 1970, he began building Arcosanti. For a rotating band of loyal followers, it was an irresistible mission. "There was Soleri out in the middle of the desert looking back at the world," said Harry Fischman, a 52-year-old architect of Sag Harbor, N.Y., who visited as a student in the 1970's. "He took the materials and forms of the desert and transformed them into shelter and poetry."
Arcosanti has been under construction continuously since 1970; roughly $10 million later, it's only 3 percent completed, Dr. Soleri said. Today, the semifinished, semiruined spaces of Arcosanti resemble a sketch from Dr. Soleri's notebooks, complete with erasures and rough edges. It's easy to see the influence of Frank Lloyd Wright and Buckminster Fuller, plus vestiges of Romanesque architecture and Maya temples. Butresses bulge like giant insect wings. The inner curves of a large vault have been washed in bright colors, as if tie-dyed. This part of Arcosanti was built in its heyday, in a delirious burst of energy from 1970 to 1975, when 350 paying volunteers were working in five-week stints.
"There is something bittersweet about Soleri and the building of Arcosanti," Mr. Bruder said. "The meeting of resources and ideas never fully gelled. Arcosanti became labeled by its roots in the late 1960's and never fully grew to maturity." 
Thirty-one years after Dr. Soleri began his desert experiments, the surrounding desert is all but gone. Cosanti (now a headquarters for his nonprofit foundation) is engulfed by suburban-style development, and sprawl has begun to encroach on Arcosanti. "I feel a bit of sadness," Dr. Soleri said. "The market demands the high consumerism of suburbia. We at Arcosanti may be economically powerless, but we have been trying to develop an alternative."
Undaunted, Dr. Soleri continues to expand Arcosanti, which has 60 permanent residents. The East Crescent section, containing stores and residences, is under construction. A residential wing will be built in the coming year, in part to house students from Rome. .
Dr. Soleri himself seems only to thrive with age. While his energy has leveled off, he still bikes and swims every day. He also continues to write and think on a grand scale, and he remains enigmatic to the end. 
Does he have plans for more city schemes in the near future? "Yes," he said, "something like Paradise, or Nirvana."
Will those be built here on planet Earth or in outer space? "I'm not telling," he replied.

HEADLINE: Sales and Rising Prices Rouse Housing Market 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25 

 BODY:
Existing homes sold at a faster pace than expected in June, an industry report showed today, suggesting that housing will help buoy the economy. Home prices surged to a record.
 Resales fell 0.6 percent last month, to an annual pace of 5.33 million houses from a 5.36 million rate in May, the National Association of Realtors said. Analysts had expected sales to fall 1.3 percent, to an annual pace of 5.30 million. 
 Even with the decline, though, June was the fifth-best month on record, and the pace is faster than the record 5.2 million homes sold in 1999.
"This year and last year have been about the same, and last year was a booming year," said Carolyn Shamis, the president of Carsha Inc., a real estate company in Dallas that sells homes priced from $400,000 to $5 million. "I think it's going to get stronger."
Demand for more expensive houses drove up the median price of a home to a record $152,600 last month from $145,000 in May. The price was 8.8 percent higher than in June 2000, the biggest annual increase since 1991.
Previously owned homes account for 85 percent of all houses sold and are an important predictor of consumer demand. Home purchases typically lead to spending on furniture, appliances and decorations. Rising home values have also provided a source of cash for consumers who can refinance mortgages or take out home-equity loans.
By region, sales fell 4.2 percent in the Midwest, to a 1.14-million-unit pace; 2.3 percent in the South, to a 2.11 million pace; and 1.6 percent in the Northeast, to 630,000 units at an annual pace. Sales rose 6.6 percent in the West, to a 1.46-million-unit pace.
The supply of homes available for sale increased to 3.8 months' worth in June, the most in a year, from 3.4 months' worth in May. The supply is still lower than the 4.5 months average in 1999, the record year for sales.
The average rate on a 30-year mortgage dropped last week to 7.08 percent, the lowest since April. A year ago, the rate was 8.21 percent.

HEADLINE: Social Security's Stable Benefit 

BYLINE:  By Hugh Price and Julian Bond; Hugh Price is president of the National Urban League. Julian Bond is chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A recent report by the Bush administration's commission to study Social Security claims that African-Americans get a bad deal from the Social Security program. The report says they would do better if the system included private individual investment accounts. But there are good reasons to doubt whether privatization would be as positive as proponents claim. 
 Advocates of privatization erroneously claim that because African-Americans have higher mortality rates than white Americans, they do not benefit as much from the Social Security system. 
 It is true that African-American men have a shorter average life expectancy than whites, but this is because they are more likely to die at dramatically younger ages. When black and white men reach 65, the gap in their life expectancy has narrowed to only about two years. And because African-Americans are more likely than whites to retire earlier, at 62, the actual difference in the number of years that blacks and whites receive Social Security benefits is less than two years -- contrary to what privatizers claim.
Moreover, the commission's report glides over the fact that African-American families are more likely to be dependent on Social Security benefits. In addition to providing retirement income, Social Security acts like life and disability insurance. It pays benefits in the case of disability of the contributor; or, in the case of death, it pays benefits to surviving spouses and children.
This guaranteed assistance is important in the African-American community. African-Americans are only 12 percent of the population, but they make up 17 percent of Americans receiving Social Security disability benefits and 22 percent of all children receiving survivor benefits. Because privatization proposals would divert large amounts of money from the current system, it's unclear just how these survivor and disability benefits would continue to be financed.
How do privatization proposals deal with the particular needs of the African-American community? Not very well.
First, the commission argues that African-Americans could bequeath their private accounts to surviving relatives in the event of an untimely death. But a recent study by the National Urban League found that a typical black man dying in his 30's would only have enough in his private account to cover less than 2 percent of the survivor's benefits under current law. 
Second, privatization proposals don't do much to help low-income earners, and African-Americans make up a disproportionate number of low-income earners. Social Security benefits are progressive -- that is, low-income people receive a larger percentage of benefits, relative to their earnings, than higher-income individuals do. That progressivity, combined with a cost-of-living adjustment that increases benefits every year, strengthens the safety net for the most economically disadvantaged.
The proposal to privatize would weaken the progressivity of the system. Low-income individuals would accrue interest (assuming a healthy stock market) only on their contributions, which would be based on their much lower wages. Even if low-income African-Americans earned the same rate of return on their accounts as high-income earners, they would have very different portfolios because of the disparate nature of their salaries.
Essentially, privatization changes Social Security from a program of social insurance to one focused on personal gain. Helping individuals accumulate wealth is not inherently bad policy, but Social Security's guaranteed benefits should not be sacrificed.
We must find another way to strengthen and enhance Social Security, ensuring that it remains a vital source of guaranteed support for generations of Americans.

HEADLINE: Six Are Dead, Many Missing, As Boat Sinks Off Bahamas 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 25 

 BODY:
A sailboat packed with perhaps as many as 156 Haitians trying to get to the United States ran aground on the reefs surrounding Great Inagua Island in the Bahamas during the past week, leaving six dead and possibly dozens more missing, American and Bahamian authorities said today.
 Helicopters and boats combed the waters off Great Inagua, the southernmost island of the Bahamas, on Tuesday looking for signs of life and evacuating 69 survivors from the island. Based on interviews with survivors, the authorities could be looking for as many as 81 others. 
 "The information is pretty scant right now," said Capt. Raymond Farquharson, a senior commander with the Royal Bahamas Defense Force. "We understand quite a number came on that craft, more than 69 in any event."
The authorities are unsure when the boat left Haiti, which is about 75 miles south of Great Inagua, but the survivors told rescuers that the vessel ran aground and sank on the second day of the journey. They said they had been on Great Inagua for up to a week after swimming to the island's northern coast and making their way to a town on the other side.
"They were in pretty bad shape suffering from malnutrition, lack of water and exposure," said Brian Bachman, a spokesman for the United States Embassy in Nassau. "We don't have many details on what happened, other than it was a boat with migrants headed to the United States that went off course and ran aground."
Captain Farquharson said he doubted that the migrants had been on the island for more than a few days. He said that the Bahamian government was first alerted Tuesday by residents of Great Inagua and that a rescue operation was mounted with the help of a helicopter from the United States Coast Guard.
He said the survivors would be taken to Nassau and held in detention facilities until they could be returned to Haiti.
The Bahamas continues to be a popular destination and way station for illegal Haitian migrants fleeing economic hardship and political instability. Some 60,000 Haitians are believed to be living illegally in the Bahamas, where many of them work in menial jobs while trying to save money to travel to the United States.
Last year, when a boat carrying more than 250 Haitians was shipwrecked in the Bahamas, Haitian officials said they would take steps to discourage illegal migration. 
"It has gotten heavier over the last two years," Mr. Bachman said. "We have documented an increase. There is a sizable portion who stay in the Bahamas. Some stay temporarily until they find other means to get to the United States. It is a problem the Bahamians are very concerned about."

HEADLINE: Free Trade With Vietnam 

 BODY:
During Colin Powell's visit to Vietnam this week, the secretary of state found a nation whose economy has taken more strides toward the future than has its cumbersome, authoritarian government. Vietnam's people are dynamic and optimistic. Roughly 60 percent are younger than 30 years old, the product of half a century of war with France, the United States and China. Though their politically rigid government has yet to conquer corruption and poverty, it has encouraged entrepreneurial activity. Both countries can benefit from a closer relationship. The free trade agreement awaiting approval by Congress can help build those ties. 
 Outside capital began to flood into Vietnam after the country gave itself a new, economically progressive Constitution in 1992. The Vietnamese economy grew by nearly 9 percent a year in the mid-1990's, beating out some of the established Asian tigers. Per capita income grew by 50 percent between 1994 and 1997 alone. Trade came to dominate the economy, with exports growing by more than 20 percent a year. But the government, made shy by the region's financial crisis, stifled early enthusiasm with heavy-handed bureaucracy and postponement of structural reforms. Foreign investment fell by about 80 percent between 1996 and 1999, and economic growth slowed by half. 
 Congress can help to reverse this trend by ratifying the free trade agreement with Vietnam that was completed last year under President Bill Clinton. The agreement grants Vietnam the same "normal trade relations" that China has enjoyed for over a decade. It lowers tariffs on both sides and provides vital copyright protection to American intellectual property. American businesses and diplomats have been pushing hard for the agreement, which would confirm the Vietnamese government's wisdom in offering open markets a second chance.
Under the sponsorship of Senators Tom Daschle and Trent Lott, the Democratic and Republican leaders, a joint resolution to approve the deal passed the Senate Finance Committee last week. But the House has yet to decide whether to vote on the pact with Vietnam by itself. Some Republicans want to make it a bargaining chip in the bigger debate about the president's authority to negotiate trade agreements. Today the House Ways and Means Committee will indicate whether it plans to delay approval further. It would be shameful to hold Vietnam's 79 million eager workers and consumers, and American businesses, hostage to Congressional machinations.

HEADLINE: In America; 
Death in the Ashes

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
A counterpoint to the egregious Philip Morris report suggesting that the early death of smokers can benefit a nation's economy is an extensive study by the World Bank that details the chilling -- and very expensive -- toll that cigarettes are taking around the world.
 According to the report, called "Curbing the Epidemic," the only two causes of death that are huge and growing worldwide are AIDS and tobacco-related illnesses. 
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, tobacco is expected to become the biggest killer in most developing countries within the next 20 years, causing more deaths than AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, automobile crashes, homicides and suicides combined.
If current patterns hold, a half-billion people who are alive today will eventually be killed by tobacco. More than half of those are now children and teenagers. By the year 2030, tobacco is projected to be the single biggest cause of death worldwide, accounting for about 10 million deaths per year. 
Big Tobacco ought to send thank-you notes to new moms and new dads around the world because their newborns are absolutely essential to Big Tobacco's strategy of addicting ever-larger waves of young customers to replace the ever-increasing loads of smokers lost to early death.
The World Bank estimates that in affluent countries, 14,000 to 15,000 children and young people take up smoking each day. In middle-income and low-income countries, somewhere between 68,000 and 84,000 take their first insidious puffs.
The idea that they know what they're in for, that they understand the agony that may well await them years down the road and have made a rational choice to risk it, is ludicrous.
And this is significant when you talk about the economics of smoking. According to the World Bank study (which was done before the recent study commissioned by Philip Morris), it appears that smokers' lifetime health care costs in affluent countries are "somewhat higher" than non-smokers', despite their shorter lives. It is not at all clear what the situation is in less affluent countries with less extensive health care networks.
But that, of course, should not be the issue. The first issue to be addressed is the non-economic value -- one would hope it would be a high value -- that we ascribe to human beings based solely on the fact that they exist. But even if the discussion is limited to economic matters, there is a problem with Philip Morris's contention that countries can derive benefits from the early demise of smokers. It flies in the face of accepted economic theory, which argues that the benefits of a free market flow from rational decisions made by consumers who, when spending their money (and only their money), understand the risks and rewards of the choices they make.
That is largely not the case with smokers. Despite all the warnings about the murderous effects of tobacco, it seems clear that, as the World Bank study noted, "People's knowledge of the health risks of smoking appears to be partial at best." That is especially true with young smokers and smokers in poorer countries, where information about the hazards of smoking is limited.
The study said, "In China, for example, 61 percent of adult smokers surveyed in 1996 believed that cigarettes did them 'little or no harm.' "
People tend to underestimate the addictive effects of nicotine and grossly underestimate the likelihood that they will contract a horrible disease from smoking.
Moreover, the health-related costs of smoking -- both physical and financial -- are never limited to the smokers themselves.
Was the Black Death a boon to Europe in the Middle Ages? Is AIDS a boon to Africa today?
Smoking a boon? I don't think so.
Some years ago I interviewed an anti-smoking activist named David Goerlitz, who had once been known as the Winston Man because he had appeared in Winston ads for the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
He once asked a group of R. J. Reynolds executives if any of them smoked. They all said no. Mr. Goerlitz said one of the executives shook his head and said: "Are you kidding? We reserve that right for the poor, the young, the black and the stupid."
Not much has changed. That philosophy is now being played out on a global scale.

HEADLINE: OPEC Plans A Reduction In Daily Output Of About 4% 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided yesterday to reduce its daily production by about 4 percent, or one million barrels, to buoy crude oil prices amid fears that worldwide oil demand was weakening. 
 The move to decrease production to 23.2 million barrels a day, which would go into effect Sept. 1, is not expected to produce a spike in oil prices to last year's levels of $30 a barrel or more, industry analysts said. But they warned that OPEC, in its haste to bolster prices that have been falling rapidly in recent weeks, risks driving the price of crude oil higher in the fall and winter, just as demand for heating oil surges. 
 Yesterday's decision is the third instance this year of the 10-member cartel's having decreased its daily output. This time, OPEC is believed to be reacting to the fears of many speculative investors on the oil markets, mainly hedge funds, that have bet heavily that the price of oil will fall. Three years ago, speculative investors with such positions drove down the price of oil sharply, which throttled the flow of revenue to OPEC economies. 
"OPEC wanted to respond as quickly as possible," said Edward L. Morse, executive adviser at the Hess Energy Trading Company. "They had a lot at stake. They believe that speculators who have been shorting the market will learn a lesson."
OPEC leaders said late last week that they were considering a production cut before their scheduled meeting on Sept. 26 because prices had slipped badly. Before that announcement, the price of crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange had fallen $3.50 in 10 days of trading, to $24.78, according to the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consulting group. At the end of trading yesterday at the exchange, the price of oil for September delivery had risen to $26.84, or 53 cents more than the previous day.
OPEC members rely almost exclusively on oil revenue to fill their coffers, and most have stated that they prefer -- and believe consumers can handle -- oil prices of $25 to $28 a barrel. Moreover, the conflict in Israel has made it politically difficult for Western allies within OPEC, like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, to make concessions on the price of oil, some analysts say.
"The politics within these countries right now is such that they can do nothing but keep up higher revenues, challenge the West and act only in their own self-interest," said Amy Myers Jaffe, a Middle East expert and senior energy adviser at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.
Despite its hands-off approach to OPEC, the Bush administration voiced concern over the cut, which would bring the total reduction in the cartel's output this year to 3.5 million barrels a day.
"Our economy is bumping along right now," President Bush said yesterday, "and a run-up in energy prices would hurt."
Many analysts pointed out that OPEC's decision yesterday may be unwarranted. At the heart of any appraisal of the oil markets is the balance between supply and demand. The speculative investors and some OPEC members have been concerned about a recent report by the International Energy Agency in Paris that demand had fallen significantly because of the lagging global economy. At the same time, inventories of crude oil, gasoline and heating oil in the United States have been robust. And Iraq, which withheld exports earlier this summer because of a dispute with the United Nations, is now supplying about 2.3 million barrels a day.
But many economists pointed out that demand may not have fallen as sharply as stated by the I.E.A., whose figures are regularly revised because of inaccurate or incomplete data countries provide it. Analysts expected the current high inventories of crude oil to start decreasing by the fall, even without the OPEC cut, as refiners gear up to supply more heating oil. As that increased demand converges with a loss of one million barrels of crude oil supply, prices could surpass $28 a barrel, some analysts said. That, in turn, would mean that if winter is typically cold, the price of heating oil could rise.

HEADLINE: Revenue Falls, But Xerox Sees Bright Spots 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation, trying to rebuild its ailing businesses in the face of a slowing economy, said yesterday that its second-quarter revenue was down 13 percent from last year, and that it had lost money for the fourth quarter in a row.
 While Xerox executives held out little hope that the company would show a profit for the year, they said sales in North America were inching back up, that it had plenty of cash and that it might show black ink by the year's final quarter. 
 "Our turnaround plans are on track, our liquidity is strengthening and our cost-reduction efforts are paying off," Paul A. Allaire, Xerox's chairman, told analysts in a morning conference call. 
Xerox, based in Stamford, Conn., lost $281 million, or 40 cents a share, in the second quarter, in contrast to a profit of $202 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier. After one-time charges, the largest associated with ending its low-end printer business, Xerox lost 10 cents a share. 
That met analysts' expectations, and shareholders showed only mild disappointment. Xerox shares fell 40 cents, to $7.59.
Xerox is still in better shape than it was six months ago. At the end of last year, the company was battling rumors of bankruptcy. And questions about its accounting practices in Mexico led to an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and caused Xerox's own auditors to balk at signing off on its 2000 financial statements. 
Even after paying down considerable debt, Xerox has $2.6 billion in cash, up from $1.7 billion at the end of last year. The S.E.C. investigation continues, but Xerox's auditors did approve the company's numbers, with only slight restatements.
Skeptics about Xerox's prospects still abound. "They've got a decent turnaround story going, but it's still too soon to say whether they'll have solid long-term growth," said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
But in past quarters, analysts have sharply criticized Xerox management, arguing that it botched a sales force reorganization and lagged on product introductions. This time, many analysts gave Xerox management high marks for maintaining research spending even as it cut other costs, for introducing new color copiers and filling in gaps in its line of black and white machines, for starting to rebuild its sales force and for making good on promises to farm out manufacturing and to get out of businesses that it could no longer afford to support. 
"They are on track in terms of cutting costs and getting the balance sheet in shape," said Jack L. Kelly, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. 
The worsening economy has caused most equipment manufacturers to face weak sales in the United States and plummeting sales in Europe and Latin America. But Xerox's problems have been worse than many. Xerox's revenues dropped 33 percent in Latin America, where the company has been backing away from what it calls unprofitable contracts. 
And, in the United States, Canon, Ricoh and others are still chipping away at Xerox's most lucrative product line: very fast black-and-white copiers. 
Jim Ivy, president of Ricoh's Office Products Group, says that once-loyal Xerox customers are increasingly inviting Ricoh to bid. 
"Our U.S. revenues are up 9 percent," Mr. Ivy said, "and roughly half of the products we sell are replacing older Xerox machines." 
Xerox's performance has been even worse in the low-end market. It finally pulled the plug on its once-promising line of low-priced printers for the small-office and home-office market. Such printers can be a source of lucrative sales of papers, toners and inks. But Xerox never sold enough machines to get that annuity stream flowing. Xerox lost 8 cents a share in this market in the second quarter. 
Xerox also took a $196 million charge to cover the costs of shutting down this business and expects to take additional charges next quarter. 
Anne M. Mulcahy, Xerox's president, said that if losses from this business and the cost of getting out were factored out, Xerox would show a profit for the year. 
Xerox is betting on color copiers -- one of its few truly profitable product lines -- and services. 
"Our revenue declines are manageable," Ms. Mulcahy said, "and we're already seeing improvements over last quarter."
In fact, she said in an interview, she was buoyed by Xerox's performance and prospects, at least in North America.
"It's starting to look like a well-run business," she said with a laugh.

HEADLINE: A Survey of Wall St. Finds Women Disheartened 

BYLINE:  By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
Women on Wall Street have a hard time arguing with the money to be made, but a survey released yesterday of men and women at seven major securities firms suggests that many women are dissatisfied with the extent of progress that has been made to help women advance in the securities industry. 
 The findings reaffirm an impression by many women on Wall Street that the industry remains inhospitable. 
 "It's extremely disheartening to see how far we have not come," said Alexandra Lebenthal, who heads her family's Wall Street firm and has been in the business for about 15 years. 
Most of the nearly 500 women who responded to the survey conducted by Catalyst, a nonprofit research and advisory organization in New York, say they are happy with their jobs, citing the challenging work and generous compensation.
But they also describe an industry where it is difficult to get ahead. Two-thirds say that they must work harder than men for the same rewards, and a third report a hostile environment where crude or sexist comments are tolerated, they are treated unfairly or are subject to unwanted sexual attention. 
The survey, which is the first extensive look at the experiences of women working on Wall Street, also suggests that many women are making significant sacrifices in their personal lives, similar to the ones made by lawyers and other professionals. Only half of the women surveyed have children, compared with about three-quarters of the men surveyed. In a 1996 survey of senior women at Fortune 1000 companies, about two-thirds had children. Two-thirds of the Wall Street women were married or living with a partner, compared with 86 percent of the men.
While women praise the efforts of the securities firms generally to promote an atmosphere of respect, they say this has not yet translated into a workplace free of harassment or one that can be seen as a true meritocracy. Fewer than half of both men and women said they thought that promotion decisions were made fairly at their firm. "Cultural change is very tough to make happen," said Sheila Wellington, the president of Catalyst.
Catalyst sent surveys to 2,200 women and men, both in senior and junior positions, at seven firms, the names of which it agreed not to disclose. All the findings were reported anonymously. Some 38 percent, 482 women and 356 men, responded. Catalyst also conducted nine focus groups in New York, Chicago and San Francisco. 
About a quarter of the women who responded held the title of managing director or higher, with the typical respondent having worked at her current firm for 10 years and in the industry for 14 years. 
The report is part of the settlement of a sex-discrimination lawsuit brought against Smith Barney, now part of Citigroup, in which women charged that there had been a "boom-boom room" in one of the firm's offices, where male managers would harass female employees. 
While the leaders of many Wall Street firms are committed to change, many in their organizations are not, Ms. Lebenthal said, adding, "I think there are a lot of people on Wall Street who do not see the need to change."
And only a fifth of the women surveyed say that the opportunities to advance have increased greatly in the last five years.
Given the resources many of the firms are pouring into efforts to diversify their work forces and given the large number of women on Wall Street, the lack of progress is surprising, said Dee A. Soder, an executive coach in New York who is managing partner in the CEO Perspective Group. "It's gotten much better," she said, "but there is still a glass ceiling with less reason for a glass ceiling."
There needs to be a greater commitment by the leadership at many Wall Street firms, agreed Janice Reals Ellig, an executive recruiter in New York and the co-author of "What Every Successful Woman Knows," which offers advice from senior women executives about how to get ahead. "The progress is so slow," she said. "By the year 3000, we're going to get there."
But some argue that the securities industry is difficult for both men and women. "Wall Street, in general I believe, is undeservedly maligned," said Cristina Morgan, a senior investment banker at J. P. Morgan, the investment banking arm of J. P. Morgan Chase. Many women, and men, choose to leave Wall Street because of the hours and the travel required, she said. The clients "pay us lots and lots of money to be at their disposal 24 hours a day, 7 days a week," she said.
And juggling the demands of a family with the work is extraordinarily hard, Ms. Morgan said, adding: "I am filled with admiration for my women partners who are successful and have children. I am mystified to how they do it." She indicated that she thought Wall Street was indeed a meritocracy. 
But many of the women who remain in the business are deciding to forgo having children. "I cannot imagine ever having children and doing this business," a senior-level woman told Catalyst. 
Men, of course, are also aware of the sacrifices required to rise on Wall Street, particularly in investment banking. "It's hard to be a middle-level vice president and not spend 90 hours a week at the firm," one man said. "That just doesn't jibe with trying to raise a family."
As a result, many women simply leave, as Janet Tiebout Hanson did when she departed from Goldman, Sachs to create her own firm, Milestone Capital Management. An adviser to Catalyst on the study, Ms. Hanson has also worked to improve the ability of women to network by creating 85 Broads, an Internet-based network of women who work or used to work at Goldman, Sachs. The name refers to the firm's famous address. 
Ms. Hanson, for one, is optimistic that securities firms will be forced to change as women, especially those coming out of business school, leave Wall Street for friendlier, if not greener, pastures. Many, she thinks, will go elsewhere in corporate America. "It's a much bigger problem than they think," Ms. Hanson said.
Ms. Soder, the executive coach, agreed, saying, "Corporations are now losing many of the best and the brightest."
Many of the women cited as a barrier to their moving up exclusion from important networks. "Well, it was every broker but me that got invited," a senior-level woman told Catalyst. "So they all got input as to maybe what they were doing wrong, or how they could improve their business, but me." 
The survey also offers a glimpse into the continued problem of sexual harassment on Wall Street, which continues to surface from time to time. While sexual harassment is difficult to define and to measure with any precision, with little comparative data in private industries, the survey suggests that many women think that inappropriate or crude comments continue to be tolerated where they work. Some men agree. "In my experience," one said, "brokers are the raunchiest people that you'll ever meet."
About 13 percent of the women surveyed say they receive unwelcome sexual attention at work.
The impetus now, according to Susan Chadick, an executive recruiter who works with Ms. Ellig at Gould, McCoy & Chadick in New York, is to take some of the findings and look deeper. "It requires a lot more probing," Ms. Chadick said.
And she worries that the downturn in the economy may make the future, especially for senior-level women, more bleak. "Not only hasn't there been any progress," she said, but "I'm concerned we're going backward."

HEADLINE: Auditors Doubt Amtrak Will Meet Profit Goal 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25 

 BODY:
Amtrak is unlikely to meet the date Congress set five years ago to break even or face the possibility of liquidation, two outside auditors told a House subcommittee today.
 But the head of Amtrak testified that he found the mandate to end the railroad's losses, while running unprofitable trains at the same time, irrational, frustrating and "wacky." 
 Amtrak said it anticipated that the slowdown in business travel that had hit the airlines would hit it, too, one of the reasons it was having difficulty meeting operational self-sufficiency. 
Congress voted in December 1997 to require Amtrak to generate enough profits within five years to meet all operating costs and ordered that if Amtrak failed, a newly formed council should create a plan for restructuring Amtrak, while the General Accounting Office should create a plan for liquidating it. 
George D. Warrington, president and chief executive of Amtrak, insisted that the railroad was making good progress toward self-sufficiency in operating funds. But Mr. Warrington added that a deeper question was whether Congress would supply capital funding, as anticipated in the 1997 law, and whether it would recognize that some service could not be profitably provided.
"I believe we will be very close, even in a downturned economy," Mr. Warrington said.
The railroad is considering laying off 15 percent of its managers and 10 percent of its unionized personnel.
Kenneth Mead, the inspector general of the Department of Transportation, said that the railroad could cut enough to break even but that the cuts would be so draconian that "such a victory would be hollow and have serious repercussions for the future of intercity passenger rail."
Mr. Mead also testified that the new high-speed Acela trains serving Boston, New York and Washington were lightly used and that the number of seats filled was declining on Boston-to-New York runs. He added, though, that this might simply be because the service was new.
Experts differed on the amount by which Amtrak was likely to miss the self-sufficiency goal. 
JayEtta Z. Hecker, director of physical infrastructure issues at the accounting office, a Congressional agency, said Amtrak had closed the gap between revenues and expenses by only $83 million in the last six years and had $280 million left to go. But Mr. Warrington said about $200 million a year that Amtrak paid for retirement benefits for employees of predecessor railroads did not count. 
Most members of the subcommittee were friendly to the railroad.
Robert A. Borski, Democrat of Pennsylvania, compared Amtrak with the French high-speed train, T.G.V. "It goes fast, it is smooth, they put a lot of money into it, and we just don't," he said.
But Representative John L. Mica, Republican of Florida, berated the railroad for "half-baked" efforts, including inadequate terminals at the southern end of the Auto Train in Sanford, Fla.
"The future of Amtrak is dismal at best," Mr. Mica said, adding that the railroad was "near death" and that "we should begin restructuring and liquidating now."

HEADLINE: This Time, Prospect of Pink Slips Makes Workers Grim at Lucent 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: MURRAY HILL, N.J., July 25 

 BODY:
A few weeks ago, long before Tuesday's announcement that Lucent Technologies would eliminate 15,000 to 20,000 more jobs, photocopies of fliers went up in a hallway of the company's headquarters here exhorting employees to keep their spirits high.
 "Don't give up!" the unsigned flier said. "Better days are coming!!!" Scribbled in a corner of one of the notices, an employee offered a response: "When?" 
 It is the same question that many of those at Lucent were asking themselves today. After a dismal year of layoffs, job buyouts and a falling stock price, many said they were numbed by Tuesday's avalanche of bad news, topped by the job cuts, a $3.5 billion quarterly loss and elimination of the dividend. Once the latest job eliminations are made, the company will have fewer than half the 155,000 employees it had a year ago. 
After Lucent began in 1996 as a $21 billion spinoff of AT&T's manufacturing and computer businesses and its stock price grew, employees relished their stock benefits and talked about how they would allow them to retire early. But today, after shrugging off the previous rounds of layoffs, many Lucent employees were less than sanguine, saying the nation's slowing economy and rising unemployment rate made the prospect of a pink slip somewhat more sobering than it had been in the past. 
One 52-year-old employee who ignored the earlier buyout offer said he now regretted the decision. He said management had told him those who remained at Lucent should not fear being laid off. 
"Now I have that sinking feeling that I'm not going to win on this one," he said. "The thought of starting someplace new at this point or the thought of not finding anything new is frightening."
The company said it had yet to decide at which of its locations it would make its job cuts. Here in affluent Morris County, where Lucent has about 4,000 employees, some business owners said they were already feeling the pain of a smaller, leaner Lucent.
Tom Taha, 38, the owner of the Village Cafe and Bagel Shop in New Providence, said his breakfast and lunch business had fallen by half since January, around the time the first Lucent employees began taking early retirement. Last Friday, he said, more than 100 customers who had accepted the recent buyout offer stopped by to say goodbye.
"It was sad," he said. "A lot of people moved into town to be close to work, but I hear that a lot of them are getting ready to move. If there is no work, why stay?"
Still, most economists said the company's rapid tumble would have little impact on the state, which has slightly more than 4 million jobs. Joe Gonzales, president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, said many companies are still crying out for skilled workers. "It's sad when anyone loses their job, but I think these people will land on their feet." While telecommunications and Internet companies in New Jersey are still bleeding badly, pharmaceutical corporations like Johnson & Johnson, Pharmacia and Merck have been reporting hefty profits, he said. 
After years of dizzying growth, however, New Jersey has lost 8,000 jobs since December, a marked contrast to the addition of 95,000 jobs in 2000. The state's unemployment rate, at 4.5 percent, has come up nearly a point since February.
James W. Hughes, dean of the Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, said the job reductions at Lucent might have a small effect on businesses that serve the company and an even smaller impact on housing if former employees move away. "However, I don't think the loss is going to do permanent damage to the New Jersey economy," he said. 
In Hopewell Township, where Lucent plans to close a research facility, the mayor, Marylou Ferrara, said she saw no reason to worry. "Lucent didn't even own the property, so we won't even lose any taxes, although the landlord will lose a tenant," she said. "So I don't think it is perceived as having a large impact locally." 
For now, the cutbacks will inflict the greatest pain on Lucent employees and their families. Some employees, especially younger ones, said they were unconcerned.
"One door closes and another will open," said a 38-year-old man from New Providence. But one of his co-workers, a 34-year-old with children, said she was afraid for the future. "I moved here with my family with the dream of raising my family here, having a short commute to work and staying with Lucent until retirement," she said. "Now those dreams seem to get less realistic every day."
Employees said that spirits at company headquarters were palpably bleak. "We are all in a period of limbo," a 28-year-old man said. "We all want to know if we'll be here next week or unemployed." Beyond their concerns about job security, some of those nearing retirement said they had been fretting about Lucent's stock price since it toppled to less than $7 from its peak of $77 in December 1999. "My nest egg is looking pretty puny," a 57-year-old secretary from Irvington said. 
Then there are the now-reduced perks and services that made the workday so much more pleasant. The in-house fitness club, once free to employees, now costs $20 a month, it was announced today. The free bottled spring water and coffee have been eliminated. And a scaling back in security services means that many of the sprawling headquarters' side entrances have been closed, forcing employees to walk a greater distance from the parking lots. 
"We're looking at things that in the past might have been useful benefits and we're asking whether they're necessary in this new economic environment," said Bill Price, a company spokesman. "Everyone is being asked to tighten their belt." 
But for some employees the most pronounced changes have been showing up in the company's modern, glass-walled cafeteria. Gone are the custom-made wraps, the whole-grain Mediterranean salads and the wok station, a grill where stir-fried dishes were made to order. A soup counter, where soup was once ladled out by a server in a chef's hat, is now a serve-yourself affair. 
"The quality of food has really deteriorated meal by meal," said one employee, a 24-year-old software designer. "Not to sound glib, but it's really taken a toll on my morale."

HEADLINE: In Loss, DuPont to Cut Jobs 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
The DuPont Company, posting a second-quarter loss, said yesterday that it would eliminate more jobs and warned that its third-quarter earnings would fall short of estimates because of weak demand for chemicals and plastics.
 DuPont, which is based in Wilmington, Del., increased its planned job cuts by 1,500, to 5,500 workers, or 6 percent of its work force. An additional 1,300 contract workers will also be laid off, as previously announced, as the company combats high energy costs, a strong dollar and weak demand for its products. 
 "Industries important to many of our customers -- electronics, automotive, textiles and chemicals -- have been particularly affected by the economic downturn," said Charles O. Holliday Jr., the chairman and chief executive. "This has temporarily reduced fundamental demand for our products."
E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, as it is formally known, posted a net loss of $213 million, or 21 cents a share, in contrast to net income of $688 million, or 65 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
Excluding one-time items, income fell 54 percent, to $432 million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $949 million, or 90 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales fell 12 percent, to $7 billion from $7.9 billion.
Analysts had expected the company to earn 40 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/ First Call.
So far in the current quarter, business has not improved, DuPont said, warning that its third quarter "will be substantially more challenging than the second quarter."
Earnings for the third quarter will probably fall at least 70 percent from results in the period a year earlier, the company said, a far bigger drop than the roughly 40 percent slide that analysts on average had been expecting.
Shares of DuPont rose 29 cents, to $43.21.

HEADLINE: Military Budget Creates Rift in G.O.P. 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25 

 BODY:
The debate over Pentagon spending has exposed a deep rift within the Republican Party's conservative wing, pitting supporters of tax cuts and smaller government against military hawks who contend that President Bush is shortchanging the armed forces.
 The struggle is being played out in Congress, editorial pages and veterans groups, as supporters of a military buildup have complained bitterly that the Pentagon seems to be taking a back seat to tax cuts and spending on education and health care when it comes to White House priorities. 
 Though the fight is over money, it also reflects a broader trend in the Republican Party, where advocates of a muscular military contend that they are losing influence to economic conservatives who say the idea of reining in government ought to apply to the Pentagon as well.
While President Ronald Reagan was able to hold these competing strands together during the cold war by cutting taxes and raising military spending, the demise of the Soviet Union and the passage of Mr. Bush's $1.3 trillion tax cut have combined to reveal the fault lines once again. 
What seems particularly dismaying to those hawkish critics is that Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney vowed in last year's campaign to restore troop morale and replace aging weapons systems, repeatedly proclaiming "help is on the way" to pro-military audiences across the country.
While Mr. Bush has proposed a 7 percent increase in military spending, many Pentagon officials and their supporters in Congress had been counting on twice that amount to pay for new ships, fighter jets and artillery weapons. Instead, most of the president's proposed $32 billion increase over the last Clinton budget is intended for basic needs like health care, spare parts and base improvements.
"We came in to rebuild national security, with an administration that I think wants to rebuild national security, at a time when you have a relative prosperity and a budgetary surplus," Representative Duncan Hunter, a Republican from California who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, said in a recent hearing. "And all of a sudden, we find ourselves making tortured statements to each other and deploring on both sides of this table today the shortfall in important military resources. That's sad, I think."
Those sentiments were amplified last week in a scathing editorial in The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine, in which William Kristol, the editor, and Robert Kagan, a columnist, accused Mr. Bush of "shorting the military." They even urged Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and his deputy, Paul D. Wolfowitz, to resign in protest of "the impending evisceration of the American military."
"If the president does not reverse course now, he may go down in history as the man who let American military power atrophy and America's post-cold-war pre-eminence to slip away -- the president who fiddled with tax cuts while the military burned," said the editorial, in the magazine's July 23 issue.
Representative Curt Weldon, a Republican from Pennsylvania who sits on the Armed Services Committee, said many Republicans privately agreed with The Standard's views.
"I don't think he's doing enough to sensitize the American people as to what the real needs of the military are," Mr. Weldon said of President Bush. "We knew the train wreck was coming for the last six years."
But these hawkish critics have themselves come under fire from economic conservatives who argue that there is little political support for a huge increase in military spending. The president was right to focus first on economic issues and tax cuts, they contend, even if those cuts have drastically reduced the surplus money available for weapons programs in coming years.
The economic conservatives also praise Mr. Rumsfeld's efforts to review and revamp the nation's war-fighting strategies, looking for savings along the way before blindly demanding a huge budget increase. And they have accused the hawks of wanting to bloat the proposed $329 billion Pentagon budget with pork-barrel projects.
"There's no grass-roots demand for dramatically increasing defense spending," said Grover G. Norquist, a prominent conservative strategist who heads Americans for Tax Reform. "What Bush promised on the campaign was to rethink the demands on the military and have national missile defense. He's doing what he promised. It's dishonest for people to claim he was going to shower money on them without accountability."
Several conservative analysts argued that the world had changed from when Mr. Reagan sharply raised military spending and deeply cut taxes, driving up the federal deficit. Then, the cold war was at its peak, and deficit spending was considered the norm. Today, the Soviet Union is gone, even liberal Democrats promote balanced budgets and the pro-military wing of the Republican Party has lost influence.
"This is not a terribly hawkish world," said James Pinkerton, a conservative writer who worked in the administration of Mr. Bush's father. "There's a need for a reality check."
Some hawkish Republicans like Senator John McCain of Arizona and Mr. Weldon said they would have been willing to accept a smaller tax cut if the money had been dedicated to the armed services. But there now seems to be little appetite among the hawks for scaling back the tax cut, as Democrats have urged. 
But many conservatives who agree with Mr. Bush and Mr. Rumsfeld's step-by-step approach to modernizing the services also acknowledge widespread disenchantment among conservatives regarding the size of the Pentagon budget. 
"You can't find a whole lot of people who are happy at this point," said Jack Spencer, a military analyst with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy group.
Democrats, meanwhile, have been trying to exploit the Republican rift by asserting that Mr. Bush's tax cut might weaken the military.
"We got no help from the administration to try to have a more balanced approach toward cutting taxes and providing for defense," Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Democrat from New York not known as a proponent of military spending, said in a hearing last week.
Even Mr. Rumsfeld, in defending the president, has acknowledged that the military is not spending enough to modernize. Government officials say Mr. Rumsfeld had sought as much as $40 billion in additional money for 2002.
"It is not possible to repair the damage of year after year after year of underfunding" in one year, he told reporters recently. "And the president has any number of factors to take into consideration in fashioning his overall budget."
Disenchantment with the size of the budget has spread to veterans groups, which constitute a small but influential segment of the Republican base. Leaders of several groups have warned that the White House seems bent on paying for missile defense and other costly weapons by cutting conventional forces.
"There's a lot of anxiety in the services," said Ted Stroup, a retired lieutenant general and the vice president of the Association of the United States Army. "Since it doesn't appear that the money will be there, they may be told to cut internally." 
The problem, the military hawks say, is that the spending picture will probably remain bleak for several years as the surplus shrinks, pitting military spending against popular education and health care programs for years to come.
"The people are saying, 'We want tax cuts, we want education, we want a prescription drug program,' " Mr. Weldon said. "They aren't saying, 'We want more defense.' "

HEADLINE: Earnings at Brunswick Decrease by Half 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: LAKE FOREST, Ill., July 25 

 BODY:
The Brunswick Corporation, the world's largest maker of pleasure boats, said today that its second-quarter profit fell by half, matching the low end of Wall Street estimates, as the company fought to stave off slowing sales.
 Brunswick, which also makes fitness and bowling gear, reported income from continued operations of $41.5 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with $81.5 million, or 93 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
 Wall Street analysts polled by the research firm Thomson Financial/ First Call had expected earnings of 47 to 60 cents a share, with a consensus forecast of 51 cents. 
"The weak domestic economy is affecting demand for our marine products as well as causing health club and bowling center owners to defer investments in new fitness and bowling capital equipment," George Buckley, the chairman and chief executive, said. 
Brunswick shares closed up 52 cents, to $22.78, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Brunswick has slowed production to match weaker demand. The company said second-quarter net sales declined 11 percent, to $928.8 million from $1.04 billion a year earlier. 
Brunswick said it expected total full-year sales to be off about 6 percent to 8 percent and added that it would miss Wall Street's full-year earnings estimates. 
The domestic marine market is expected to be off about 15 percent to 20 percent and the boat maker expects marine sales will be down 9 percent to 10 percent for the year. 
Brunswick expects full-year earnings ranging from $1.15 to $1.35, compared with $2.73 a year earlier. Wall Street analysts had expected Brunswick to post a profit of $1.72.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. POSTPONING VOTE IN THE HOUSE ON PATIENT RIGHTS 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25 

 BODY:
Lacking the votes needed for a quick victory, House Republican leaders said today that they would delay action on a patients' bill of rights, possibly until after Labor Day.
 The House had been scheduled to take up the legislation this week. But Republican leaders switched signals, even after President Bush summoned lawmakers to the White House and lobbied them to support a Republican version of the bill, opposed by almost all Democrats in the House. 
 Congress is scheduled to begin a monthlong recess late next week. Republican leaders stopped short of saying explicitly that they would postpone a floor debate until the House reconvened, but many signs pointed in that direction. 
The Republican leaders said they would defer action until they had the votes to pass their bill, and as of today, they said, they clearly did not.
Representative Greg Ganske, Republican of Iowa and the chief sponsor of the bill favored by House Democrats, said House Republican leaders were delaying action because they lacked the votes to pass their alternative. While not offering precise numbers, Republicans indicated they were about 20 votes short of what they need to pass their bill.
"The speaker told us today that this very well could go past the August recess," Mr. Ganske said. "To me, that indicates that, despite the fact they're breaking arms, they don't have the votes. They have pulled out all the stops for two months on this bill, and they don't have the votes."
The bill favored by House Democrats is similar to one passed by the Senate last month.
Since Democrats took control of the Senate in early June, President Bush has relied on the House to advance his agenda and to block Democratic initiatives. But just as the president's reliance has grown, House Republicans are no longer showing the unity and discipline with which they passed his tax cuts earlier this year.
Divisions between conservative and moderate Republicans have forced House leaders into a difficult balancing act. In recent weeks, some Republicans rebelled and joined Democrats to overturn Republican-set rules for a debate on campaign-finance legislation. The House leadership last week had to take an extra day to subdue a potential rebellion before approving Mr. Bush's proposal to give religious groups a larger role in delivering social services.
More difficulties may occur as early as next week, when the House could take up the president's energy program, including a proposal to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
Mr. Bush, just back from Europe, plunged quickly into lobbying on patients' rights today. He met with 12 House Republicans at the White House and said again that he would veto the version of the bill favored by most House Democrats. 
"I am hopeful we'll get a bill I can sign," Mr. Bush said.
Neither the president's powers of persuasion nor an all-out lobbying effort by other administration officials succeeded in winning the immediate commitments that Mr. Bush sought on patients' rights. By and large, those who went into the meeting undecided came out the same way.
One Republican, Representative Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania, said he had been impressed with Mr. Bush's command of the issue.
"I have not decided yet," Mr. Weldon said in an interview, "but I am moving in the president's direction. I don't want to support a bill that gets vetoed. Then we would end up with nothing this year, and that would be disastrous."
The speaker, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, and the majority leader, Representative Dick Armey of Texas, had scheduled a House vote for Thursday or Friday of this week.
But Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said today that "it isn't reasonable" to adhere to that schedule in view of the latest unofficial vote counts, indicating that the Republican leaders could not be sure of victory.
The Democratic and Republican bills both define a wide variety of rights for patients covered by health insurance, guaranteeing access to emergency care, medical specialists and an independent medical review of decisions denying claims for benefits.
They differ on one big issue. The Republican bill, introduced by Representative Ernie Fletcher of Kentucky, gives patients a much more limited right to sue health plans for injuries caused by the delay or denial of care.
At a closed-door meeting of House Republicans, Mr. Hastert said that a House vote on patients' rights might be put off until after the August recess, as party leaders try to rally support for their position.
Though on Tuesday, Mr. Armey said he expected a vote on Thursday or Friday, today he said, "We consider this so important in the lives of the American people that we will take whatever time it takes to get it right."
Co-sponsors of the Republican bill hinted at the possibility of a long delay.
"These are complicated issues," said Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut and one of the main co-sponsors. "It is important we resolve them right." 
The battle over patients' rights is a major test of strength for the president. Opinion polls have shown that voters support legislation to define patients' rights and trust Democrats more than Republicans to deal with the issue.
President Bill Clinton began the push for patients' rights legislation, and Democrats have continued to lead the fight, with strong support from a handful of Republicans. Now, Republicans say they must not be seen as bottling up legislation, or else their opponents will attack them in television commercials in next year's Congressional elections.
The bill favored by House Democrats closely mirrors the one approved in the Senate by a vote of 59 to 36. Mr. Bush has threatened to veto the Senate bill and the House Democrats' bill, even though both were revised to address many of his earlier objections.
The president says the Democratic bills would permit too many lawsuits against insurers and employers, raising the cost of insurance and prompting many employers to drop coverage for workers.
Representatives John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, and Charlie Norwood, Republican of Georgia, are co-sponsors of the Ganske bill. 
Mr. Norwood said he was continually talking to White House officials, most recently on Tuesday night, with the hope of reaching a compromise. Such a compromise, he said, might include a limit on the damages that could be awarded in lawsuits.
White House officials misjudged the situation in the Senate last month and lost every major vote there, but they have tried to learn from that experience. A senior administration official said the White House had been involved with House Republican leaders in deciding that there should be no vote on the issue this week. 
Republican leaders said they were gaining ground and would pick up more votes with time. But Mr. Ganske said that delays actually helped his cause.
"The closer we get to the elections, the stronger our hand is," Mr. Ganske said.
Representative James T. Walsh, Republican of New York, said he was still undecided after he met with Mr. Bush today.
"Democrats would love to see Bush veto this bill so they would have the issue for the next election," Mr. Walsh said.
Mr. Walsh was one of 68 Republicans who defied their party leaders and supported the Dingell-Norwood bill when it was passed by the House in 1999 by a vote of 275 to 151. The vote will be closer this time, Republicans say, because their party has a better alternative.

GRAPHIC: Photo: Representatives met yesterday to discuss the patients' bill of rights, including, from left, Marion Berry, Jim Turner and Greg Ganske. (Paul Hosefros/The New York Times)(pg. A20) Chart: "AT ISSUE: Sticking Point on Patients' Rights"The House has reached a temporary impasse over legislation to define patients' rights because of a bitter dispute over the right to sue. Most Democrats support a bill introduced by Greg Ganske, Republican of Iowa, and John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, that is nearly identical to a bill passed by the Senate. President Bush and most House Republicans support a measure introduced by Ernie Fletcher, Republican of Kentucky, and Collin C. Peterson, Democrat of Minnesota. GANSKE-DINGELL STATE COURTS: Patients could sue insurers over medical decisions that cause harm. DAMAGES: Patients could win economic damages, for lost wages and other financial losses; non-economic damages, for pain and suffering; and punitive damages. Payments would be subject to the limits of state laws. FEDERAL COURTS: Patients could sue in disputes over the terms of a contract, including eligibility and co-payments. DAMAGES: Patients could win unlimited awards for economic losses and pain and suffering. For flagrant violations, patients could win up to $5 million in "civil assessments," resembling punitive damages. FLETCHER-PETERSON STATE COURTS: Patients may sue in relatively rare circumstances: if a health plan fails to authorize or provide coverage ordered by an independent medical review board. DAMAGES: Similar to the Ganske-Dingell provisions, including keeping any awards or damages subject to the limits of state laws, if any. FEDERAL COURTS: Patients may sue for certain injuries caused by a health plan's failure to exercise "ordinary care." DAMAGES: No limit on economic damages, but payments for pain and suffering would be limited to $500,000, and punitive damages would not be allowed.(pg. A20)

HEADLINE: A Vote to Lift a Cuba Ban 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25 

 BODY:
The House voted again today to approve a measure that would effectively lift the ban on most travel to Cuba. But travelers considering a Cuban vacation should not rush to pack their bags. 
 The 240-to-186 vote on the amendment to a spending bill seemed to reflect a growing sentiment in Congress that many sanctions on President Fidel Castro's government have outlived their usefulness. 
 A similar bill passed last year in the House, only to die in the Senate. Members of the House Republican leadership who adamantly oppose lifting sanctions are widely expected to intervene to make certain that the measure dies again this year.
The 40-year-old embargo was eased last year to permit food and medicine sales. Some travel is allowed for Cuban-Americans, journalists and other categories of visitors.

HEADLINE: Iraqis Nearly Hit a U.S. Plane 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25 

 BODY:
A surface-to-air missile came worrisomely close to an American U-2 surveillance plane high above southern Iraq on Tuesday, more evidence that Saddam Hussein's forces are increasingly adept at zeroing in on aircraft patrolling the no-flight zones, a senior Defense Department official said tonight.
 The U-2, probably the world's most famous spy plane, was at an altitude above 60,000 feet when it was fired on by the Iraqis, whose missile came "fairly close," the official said -- close enough, in fact, that the American aircraft flew through the missile's turbulence. 
 "But it was not so close as to actually threaten to shoot it down," the official said. The pilot and plane returned to base without further incident.
The attack, first reported by CBS tonight, appears not to have been by a new missile in the Iraqi arsenal. Instead, the official said, it represented another example of how Iraqi forces are able to use their existing technology more effectively.
In February, the United States and Britain carried out the most recent large-scale airstrikes against radar stations and air defense command centers in Iraq. President Bush called the strikes a necessary response to Iraq's increasingly aggressive and effective offense against patrols over the two no-flight zones.
The Bush administration is reviewing its Iraqi policy, which includes enforcing the no-flight zones as well as maintaining economic sanctions and supporting opposition groups.
Several options are under consideration for the no-flight zones, including continuing sorties at the current rate or decreasing the number of patrols but responding more forcefully to Iraqi violations.

HEADLINE: Other Immigrants, Envying Mexicans, Demand a Break, Too 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va., July 25 

 BODY:
A proposal from President Bush's top advisers to let more than one million Mexicans living here illegally earn permanent legal status has stirred envy and some anger among millions of non-Mexican immigrants, many of whom are now demanding equal treatment. 
 Nowhere were those views more evident today than outside the federal immigration office here in suburban Washington, where hundreds of immigrants from Albania to Zambia stood in the muggy heat in a line that snaked around the block. 
 Many said that Mexico's 2,000-mile border and special relationship with the United States should not allow Mexicans living illegally in this country to leapfrog an unyielding American bureaucracy that has been endured for years by those who have played by the rules. 
"It's not fair," said Guillermo Pena, 35, an auto technician who emigrated from Bolivia 14 years ago and earned United States citizenship.
This morning, Mr. Pena sought a work visa for his mother. "I know the Mexicans need a lot of help," he said, "but we've been doing this step by step, like we're supposed to." 
Mr. Bush and his top aides are weighing the legalization plan as part of broader negotiations with Mexico concerning border safety, trade and energy, and they have defended this approach as an outgrowth of the groundbreaking talks.
Of the estimated seven million to eight million illegal immigrants in this country, about three million are Mexicans, by far the largest single group and the one that can be dealt with directly in the bilateral talks. 
As news of the administration's proposal broke last week, the plan, assembled by a working group led by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Attorney General John Ashcroft, received largely favorable reviews for taking the initiative on an issue usually associated with Democrats at a time when both parties are courting the Latino vote.
But now White House aides are startled by the intensity of the reaction to the details of the proposal, and they say that everything, and everyone, remains on the table with no decisions yet made.
Either way, since Congress must eventually approve any legalization plan, lawmakers would most likely broaden it to reflect their diverse constituencies. 
"Our biggest immigration problems are on the border and that should command our immediate attention, but we need to go beyond just Mexico," said Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska. 
Meanwhile, immigrant advocates, including those for unlawful residents from other countries, are scrambling to position themselves for what everyone involved believes will be a bruising, summerlong political fight to remake the nation's immigration policies. 
"Mexicans are certainly deserving of an amnesty of some kind, but it's extremely divisive to give benefits to one group and not another," said Cheryl Little, director of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center in Miami, which defends the interests of Hondurans, Guatemalans, Haitians and other immigrants.
Karen Narasaki, president of the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, an advocacy group in Washington, said cabinet-level talks with Mexico, which resume next month, should be a starting point for a more inclusive legalization program. 
"The president is to be commended for doing what needs to be done and for a more humane policy," Ms. Narasaki said. "But if they truly believe it's a good idea to regularize the flow of immigrants, they need to look just beyond Mexicans." 
Many details must be resolved, but under the plan, some unlawful Mexicans would be permitted to earn permanent legal residency if they had lived and worked here a set amount of time. It would also let future migrants attain legal residency through a new guest-worker program. 
News of the plan has galvanized immigrant groups across the country. Haitian groups in New York and Miami are bombarding lawmakers with e-mail messages. Salvadorans in California and Texas are gearing up lobbying efforts. And Asian and Central American groups in the Midwest are girding for late-summer rallies in Washington. 
"The reality is, we do have a lot of illegal immigrants and legalizing them would, for example, allow many to receive health benefits they need," said Mee Vang, executive director of the Hmong United International Council of Minnesota, which serves the state's Southeast Asian communities. 
In Washington today, Representative Luis Gutierrez, an Illinois Democrat who heads the immigration task force of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, met with more than 30 immigrant-rights groups from Chicago, New York and Houston to plot legislative strategy and organize rallies. 
At a news conference on Capitol Hill, other groups urged the administration to broaden its scope.
"We realize this doesn't just affect Latinos, but also Asians, Africans and Middle Eastern communities, regardless of where they come from," said Angelica Salas, who emigrated from Mexico as a child and heads the Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights of Los Angeles. 
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, has assigned three lawmakers to develop a rival plan and intends to introduce it next week. 
"We believe that we have to look at the idea of earned legal adjustment," Mr. Gephardt said today. "The president's suggestion to us seems incomplete and not grounded in a comprehensive policy."
Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, have said they were caught flat-footed by the administration's initiative, and are hustling to regain the momentum.
But White House officials and their congressional allies say Mr. Bush must now walk a political high wire. Mr. Bush hopes to score a foreign-policy triumph with his friend and geopolitical partner President Vicente Fox of Mexico, but he does not want to alienate any particular group of Latino voters, who will be crucial to his re-election bid in 2004. 
"The president has a record of making America more welcoming to immigrants," a White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said today.
For example, Mr. Bush agreed in March to let as many as 150,000 Salvadorans remain in the United States for up to 18 months to help El Salvador recover from a series of devastating earthquakes. 
The views from immigrants in line at the Immigration and Naturalization Service office and in Washington's Adams-Morgan neighborhood, a hub for immigrants, ranged as widely as their accents. 
"Maybe at least some people who are down will get something they deserve," said Sylvia Navas, 34, a legal assistant who has held a work visa here since coming from Guatemala in 1989. "After all, these are people who have jobs and pay taxes." 
American immigration history is rich with examples of excluding or favoring specific immigrant groups, from laws in the early 1900's that barred Chinese immigrants to cold-war-era legislation that granted permanent residency to Cubans. 
"It doesn't bother me at all what the Mexicans might get," said Shirley Bala, 24, a restaurant manager from Malaysia, who was first in line here at 4 a.m. to pick up the green card that ended her five-year quest for permanent residency. "They are from a large neighboring country. I'm from a small country far away.' 
Hanu Komaragiri, 31, a computer software designer from India who was about to end a three-year wait for a green card this morning, said a Mexican-only legalization plan could serve as a model.
"If this can be done for Mexicans," Mr. Komaragiri said, "it can be done for others, too."
But some immigrants were suspicious of the administration's motives, noting that Republicans scuttled a deal late last year that would have let some illegal farmworkers earn legal status as part of a guest-worker program. 
"Bush is doing this because he wants the Latino vote in the next election," said a 34-year-old airplane mechanic from Nigeria, who declined to give his name. "You think any politician does anything for any other reason than self-interest?" 
Bassam Al-Bizri, 37, an engineer who emigrated from Lebanon 16 years ago and is now an American citizen, joined his wife this morning to get her green card stamped.
Mr. Al-Bizri predicted that the bickering over legal status might eventually be moot. "In the global economy, this is just a small fix," he said. "The real fix is open borders."

Quest for Mideast Peace: How and Why It Failed

BYLINE:  By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
Days before the Palestinian uprising erupted in September, Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasir Arafat held an unusually congenial dinner meeting in the Israeli's private home in Kochav Yair. 
 At one point, Mr. Barak even called President Clinton and, two months after the Camp David peace talks had failed, proclaimed that he and Mr. Arafat would become the ultimate Israeli-Palestinian peace partners. Within earshot of the Palestinian leader, according to an Israeli participant, Mr. Barak theatrically announced, "I'm going to be the partner of this man even more so than Rabin was," referring to Yitzhak Rabin, the late Israeli prime minister. 
 It was a moment that seems incredible in retrospect, now that Mr. Barak talks of having revealed "Arafat's true face" and Ariel Sharon, the present prime minister, routinely describes the Palestinian leader as a terrorist overlord. 
But during the largely ineffectual cease-fire effort now under way in the Middle East, peace advocates, academics and diplomats have begun excavating such moments to see what can be learned from the diplomacy right before and after the outbreak of violence. Their premise is that any renewal of peace talks, however remote that seems right now, would have to use the Barak-Clinton era as a point of departure or as an object lesson -- or both.
In the tumble of the all-consuming violence, much has not been revealed or examined. Rather, a potent, simplistic narrative has taken hold in Israel and to some extent in the United States. It says: Mr. Barak offered Mr. Arafat the moon at Camp David last summer. Mr. Arafat turned it down, and then "pushed the button" and chose the path of violence. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is insoluble, at least for the forseeable future.
But many diplomats and officials believe that the dynamic was far more complex and that Mr. Arafat does not bear sole responsibility for the breakdown of the peace effort. There were missteps and successes by Israelis, Palestinians and Americans alike over more than seven years of peace talks between the 1993 Oslo interim agreement and the last negotiating sessions in Taba, Egypt, in January.
Mr. Barak did not offer Mr. Arafat the moon at Camp David. He broke Israeli taboos against any discussion of dividing Jerusalem, and he sketched out an offer that was politically courageous, especially for an Israeli leader with a faltering coalition. But it was a proposal that the Palestinians did not believe would leave them with a viable state. And although Mr. Barak said no Israeli leader could go further, he himself improved considerably on his Camp David proposal six months later.
"It is a terrible myth that Arafat and only Arafat caused this catastrophic failure," Terje Roed-Larsen, the United Nations special envoy here, said in an interview. "All three parties made mistakes, and in such complex negotiations, everyone is bound to. But no one is solely to blame."
Mr. Arafat is widely blamed for his stubborn refusal to acknowledge publicly any evolution in the Israeli position, and later to seize quickly the potential contained in the 11th-hour peace package that Mr. Clinton issued in late December. 
Mr. Arafat did eventually authorize his negotiators to engage in talks in Taba that used the Clinton proposal as a foundation. Despite reports to the contrary in Israel, however, Mr. Arafat never turned down "97 percent of the West Bank" at Taba, as many Israelis hold. The negotiations were suspended by Israel because elections were imminent and "the pressure of Israeli public opinion against the talks could not be resisted," said Shlomo Ben-Ami, who was Israel's foreign minister at the time.
Still, the details of a permanent peace agreement were as clear at Taba as they ever have been, most participants said. So afterward, United Nations and European diplomats scrambled to convene a summit meeting in Stockholm. There, they believed, Mr. Arafat -- who is known to make decisions only under extreme deadline pressure -- was prepared to deliver a breakthrough concession on the central issue of the fate of Palestinian refugees, and a compromise was possible on Jerusalem.
For a variety of reasons, the summit meeting never took place. In the Israeli elections in February, Mr. Barak lost resoundingly to Mr. Sharon. It was then that peace moves froze -- not six months earlier at Camp David.

After Camp David
Much Went On Behind the Scenes
Key Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, as well as several American and European diplomats keenly involved in the peace talks of the Clinton-Barak era, were interviewed for this article. Mr. Arafat also gave an interview. Mr. Barak did not; Gadi Baltiansky, his former spokesman, said the former prime minister, who has kept a low profile since his defeat, was unwilling to talk.
Few Israelis, Palestinians or Americans realize how much diplomatic activity continued after the Camp David meeting appeared to produce nothing. Building on what turned out to be a useful base, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators conducted more than 50 negotiating sessions in August and September, most of them clandestine, and most at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem.
There were also some field trips to examine the practicality of ways to divide Jerusalem -- some so complicated that Nabil Shaath, a senior Palestinian official, joked about fitting residents' shoes with global positioning devices that would light up in different colors to alert them as to whose territory they were in.
One day, Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian negotiator, accompanied a high-ranking Israeli security official on what was to be a quiet visit to the City of David area outside the Old City walls, where some Jewish families have established homes in the Palestinian residential neighborhood of Silwan.
The Israeli official gave Mr. Erekat an Israeli paint company cap, and the burly Palestinian negotiator removed his eyeglasses and dressed uncharacteristically in casual clothes. He thought himself incognito, he said, but a young Palestinian boy on a bicycle peered in the window of the Israeli secret service car and said loudly, "Hi, Dr. Saeb!"
During August and September, Mr. Erekat and Gilad Sher, a senior Israeli negotiator, drafted two chapters of a permanent peace accord that were kept secret from everyone but the leaders -- even from other negotiators, Mr. Erekat said.
At the same time, American mediators were pulling together Mr. Clinton's permanent peace proposal. It appeared in December, but Martin Indyk, the former American ambassador to Israel, disclosed recently that they were already prepared to put it before the parties in August or September. 
All this behind-the-scenes movement was reflected in the atmosphere at that dinner party at Mr. Barak's home. The prime minister, who had refused to talk directly to the Palestinian leader at Camp David, now courted him. Mr. Ben-Ami, then foreign minister, said he left the dinner and told his wife that Mr. Barak -- whom he describes as "deaf to cultural nuance" -- was so intent on forging a peace agreement that he was willing to change "not only his policies but his personality."
But Palestinians drove away from that dinner with something else on their minds -- Mr. Sharon's coming visit to what Muslims call the Noble Sanctuary and Jews know as the Temple Mount. Mr. Arafat said in an interview that he huddled on the balcony with Mr. Barak and implored him to block Mr. Sharon's plans. But Mr. Barak's government perceived the planned visit by Mr. Sharon, then the opposition leader, as solely an internal Israeli political matter, specifically as an attempt to divert attention from the expected return to political life by a right-wing rival -- Benjamin Netanyahu, the former prime minister.
On the heels of very intricate grappling at Camp David over the future status of the Old City's holy sites, Mr. Sharon's heavily guarded visit to the plaza outside Al Aksa Mosque to demonstrate Jewish sovereignty over the Temple Mount set off angry Palestinian demonstrations. The Israelis used lethal force to put them down. The cycle of violence started, escalated, mutated and built to a peak between mid-May and June 1 with the Israeli use of F-16 fighter jets in Nablus and the terrorist bombing outside a Tel Aviv disco.
In June and early July, a flimsy, American-brokered cease-fire rekindled talk by diplomats of what they said remained their goal: to push the parties back toward "final status" talks. But all acknowledged that the distance between what was achievable at the negotiating table and what would be palatable to the Israeli and Palestinian publics had become greater with every passing month of violence.
Some Israelis and Palestinians, in fact, believe that the clock has been set back decades and question the very two-state solution that was the goal of the Oslo accords.
Many Israelis now believe that Mr. Arafat has been completely discredited as a "peace partner" and that there is no point in negotiating more agreements with him. They believe that he deliberately resorted to violence to put pressure on Israel to give him what he could not obtain at Camp David. And an increasing number believe that he once more has his sights fixed on destroying Israel.
At the same time, many Palestinians have been led to believe the worst of the Israelis. Many fear that the inclusion of far-right parties in Mr. Sharon's coalition government signals a new respectability in Israel for the extremist belief that Palestinians should be "transferred" to neighboring Arab lands. In the last 10 months, their frustration has turned to despair, anger and, in some cases, suicidal and homicidal vengefulness.
The bloom is off the rose for the "peace camps" on both sides as well. "The Woodstock-like idea of peace -- did you hug your Palestinian today? -- is over," said Avraham Burg, the speaker of the Israeli Parliament who is the front-runner to become Labor Party leader in September.
Similarly, Mr. Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, said: "The rosy peace is out. I just want my state and to be done with them." 
Yet relatively few Israelis, Palestinians or outside observers believe that there can be a military solution to their conflict -- or that a solution can be imposed. Thus the two sides will eventually have to return somehow to some kind of talks.
"For us living here, we have no alternative in the long run to a permanent status agreement," said Mr. Sher, the Israeli negotiator. "On the horizon, we will become a minority on the West Bank of the Jordan River. And if we don't have recognizable and coherent borders, we will live through a much worse period than we are living through now."

Progress by Inches
Peace Effort Meets Rising Disaffection
In the Oslo accords signed in 1993, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization agreed to recognize each other's legitimacy and to enter a transitional period during which a permanent peace was to be negotiated as Israel gradually transferred land in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to a new self-governing Palestinian Authority.
In actuality, the "peace process" involved considerably more process than peace. Still, American mediators believed that it was probably irreversible and would eventually achieve its goal of two neighboring states. The mediators devoted themselves to inching the effort forward as the region withstood assassinations, terrorist attacks and countless political crises.
The inching, which produced several interim agreements, went on for more than seven years, however, and always the big final-status issues -- the fate of Jerusalem, of Palestinian refugees and of Jewish settlements and the future borders -- were deferred. Mr. Shaath, the de facto Palestinian foreign minister, said: "The lingo during all those years was 2 percent territory here and 3 percent there. Release 20 prisoners today and 30 prisoners next week. Open this dirt road. It was bits and pieces. This did not create any deep understanding between the parties on the big issues."
Many Israelis were not in much of a hurry to get to the endgame. They simply wanted the terrorism to stop. Right-wing Israeli politicians complained that the Palestinian leadership was not educating its people for peace, not collecting illegal weapons and not acting to reduce incitement against Israel. But many Israelis chose to focus instead on the relative quiet that they eventually came to enjoy as a result of the Israeli-Palestinian security relationship.
The Palestinians, however, while they began the process of building a state, lost faith as land transfers were routinely delayed and as they watched the West Bank and Gaza sliced up by Israeli bypass roads and expansion of Jewish settlements. The settler population increased by 80,000 between 1992 and 2001. The expected economic dividends of the peace path did not materialize; the Palestinian standard of living dropped by 20 percent. The Palestinian Authority proved increasingly corrupt. And Mr. Arafat kept setting and postponing dates for declaring Palestinian independence, most recently last Sept. 13.
This created a growing disaffection with the peace effort that was largely ignored by the Israeli and American negotiators. The Palestinian opposition -- the Islamic militants who considered the negotiations to be a sellout and others frustrated by the corruption of the Palestinian leadership -- gained adherents who were more than ready to return to the streets when the peace effort broke down.
Looking backward, Dennis B. Ross, the long-serving American mediator, told The Jerusalem Post recently that "one of the lessons I've learned is that you can't have one environment at the negotiating tables, and a different reality on the ground."
Yossi Beilin, an Israeli architect of the peace effort, echoed the sentiment. In an interview in Tel Aviv, he said Israeli advocates of a negotiated peace, those known as the "peace camp," had not been tough enough about the settlement expansion and not tough enough on the Palestinians about incitement from their ranks against Israel.
Rob Malley, the National Security Council's Middle East expert under Mr. Clinton, added that the Americans had not been tough enough on either side. Speaking at a public forum in Washington last spring, Mr. Malley said, "If the fundamental equation had to be land for peace, how can it have any meaning and any relevance when, on the one hand, land was being taken away on a daily basis and, on the other hand, the peace was being maligned on a daily basis."
An Israeli expert on the conflict, Joseph Alpher, who was an adviser to Mr. Barak at Camp David, argues that the Palestinian uprising, or intifada, was provoked by the failures of the seven-year interim period rather than by the Camp David impasse. "Postponing the discussion of the contradictions between the most fundamental Israeli and Palestinian narratives allowed the Israeli-Palestinian dynamic to be invaded by a virus that has now paralyzed it," he wrote in a recent study for the Bertelsmann Foundation.

The Blame Game
Why Did Talks End in Collapse?
Assuming the mantle of Mr. Rabin, Mr. Barak came to office in July 1999 trumpeting his intent to end the conflict with the Palestinians in short order. But then he chose to direct his energy at seeking peace with the Syrians, and ignored the Palestinians long enough to make them suspicious. He also brought the settlers' representatives, the National Religious Party, into his coalition and gave them the Housing Ministry, which led to a significant expansion of the settlement enterprise.
Four years late by the original peacemaking timetable, the first substantial final-status talks began secretly only in late March 2000, after the Israeli-Syrian talks died. "It all started too late and on the wrong footing," said Mr. Larsen, the United Nations envoy.
As a signal of his good faith, Mr. Barak promised to transfer to the Palestinians three Jerusalem-area villages, a promise that was relayed to Mr. Arafat by Mr. Clinton. Mr. Barak even won Parliament's consent to do so. But, on the day of the vote, an intense spasm of violence erupted in the West Bank, which seems in retrospect a harbinger of what was to come. 
Mr. Barak indefinitely deferred the transfer because of the violence. Both Mr. Arafat and, according to Mr. Malley, Mr. Clinton later said they felt burned by Mr. Barak's broken promise.
Nonetheless, what became known as the "Stockholm track" consisted of 15 substantive sessions, culminating in three long weekends, two in Sweden and one in Israel. Israelis and Palestinians who took part say now that the discussions were groundbreaking and that the mood was positive. They made progress on the issues of territory, borders, security and even refugees, although there were both advances and retreats on every issue.
In mid-May, the fact and the substance of the talks were leaked to Israeli newspapers, and what was printed about potential concessions caused political problems for both Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat. That in effect brought the talks to a halt and led Mr. Barak to seek a summit meeting before the Palestinians considered the groundwork laid.
"Stockholm died once revealed," Mr. Indyk, the former American ambassador, said in an interview in June. "If Stockholm had continued, it might have laid a better foundation for Camp David. But Barak felt the leaks would lead to the breakup of his coalition and he'd never get to the endgame."
Mr. Ben-Ami said the negotiators had supported Mr. Barak's decision to push for an American-led summit meeting at that point. "We didn't feel there was a purpose in eroding our positions further before a summit where we'd have to give up more," he said.
For other reasons, though, Mr. Ben-Ami said that in retrospect he considered it a pity that the Stockholm track was aborted. Referring to Abu Ala, he said: "The Palestinian negotiator there was an extraordinarily talented and able man who had the trust of the chairman. And he liked discreet channels. The moment they collapsed, he became an enemy of the process. He thought Camp David was a show."
The palpable displeasure of Mr. Abu Ala, whose given name is Ahmed Qurei, at Camp David was considered by many to have contributed to the talks' failure -- just as his subsequent leadership role at Taba was believed to have contributed to greater success there.
Mr. Abu Ala himself said Mr. Barak had doomed Camp David by cutting short the preparatory session. "We told him without preparation it would be a catastrophe, and now we are living the catastrophe," Mr. Abu Ala said in an interview in Abu Dis, his village in the West Bank. "Two weeks before Camp David, Arafat and I saw Clinton at the White House. Arafat told Clinton he needed more time. Clinton said, 'Chairman Arafat, come try your best. If it fails, I will not blame you.' But that is exactly what he did."
The Palestinians went to Camp David so reluctantly that the failure of the talks should have been foreseen, many now say. "The failure of Camp David was a self-fulfilling prophesy, and it wasn't because of Jerusalem or the right of return" of refugees, said Mr. Beilin.
Mr. Larsen agreed: "It was a failure of psychology and of process, not so much of substance."
The Palestinians felt that they were being dragged to the verdant hills of Maryland to be put under joint pressure by an Israeli prime minister and an American president who, because of their separate political timetables and concerns about their legacies, had a personal sense of urgency.
The Palestinians said they had been repeatedly told by the Americans that the Israeli leader's coalition was unstable; after a while, they said, the goal of the summit meeting seemed to be as much about rescuing Mr. Barak as about making peace. At the same time, they said, the Americans did not seem to take seriously the pressures of the Palestinian public and the Muslim world on Mr. Arafat. Like Mr. Barak, Mr. Arafat went to Camp David dogged by plummeting domestic approval ratings.
Mr. Indyk, who is planning to write a book on the peace effort called "Unintended Consequences," said Mr. Barak's requirement that Camp David produce a formal end to the conflict had put too much pressure on the summit meeting. 
The discussions on some issues actually went backward during the two weeks at Camp David, Mr. Sher and Mr. Ben-Ami said. Mr. Sher said he believed that it was because Palestinian negotiators had kept Mr. Arafat in the dark about key details of the Stockholm talks, which they deny. He said he and Mr. Ben-Ami had traveled to Nablus, in the West Bank, to see the Palestinian leader shortly before Camp David and were stunned to discover that Mr. Arafat did not know precisely what had been discussed.
The Israelis and the Americans describe a "bunker mentality" on the part of the Palestinians at Camp David. In response, the Palestinians say that at one point Mr. Barak did not come out of his cabin, the Dogwood, for two days and that he refused to meet with Mr. Arafat personally except for one tea.
"There was also one dinner in which Barak was on the right side of Clinton and Arafat was on the left," said Mr. Shaath, the Palestinian, adding in reference to Mr. Clinton's daughter: "But Chelsea sat to the right of Barak all evening, and she received his undivided attention. Why the hell did he insist on a summit if he did not intend to meet his partner for a minute?" 
Western diplomats here say the Palestinians believed that they were being manipulated by the Americans. They said American officials had made a crucial mistake in trying to nurture special relationships with two younger-generation Palestinian officials whom they thought were pragmatic: Muhammad Rashid, Mr. Arafat's Kurdish economic adviser, and Muhammad Dahlan, the Gaza preventive security chief. That angered the veteran Palestinian negotiators, they said, who felt that the Americans were seeking to divide and weaken them.
In the middle of Camp David, one of the negotiators, Abu Mazen, flew back to the Middle East for his son's wedding. He was furious about the American tactics, a European diplomats said, and pledged that Camp David would never succeed if such games continued and that he would use the refugee issue to foil it, if need be. 
Mr. Sher said the Palestinians had never put forward any counterproposals to what the Israelis were suggesting. They just said no, he said. Mr. Malley, who was at Camp David, wrote in an op-ed piece in The New York Times in mid-July that the American mediators were "frustrated almost to the point of despair by the Palestinians' passivity and inability to seize the moment."
The two sides had discussed territorial swaps at Stockholm, in which the Palestinians would cede a percentage of the West Bank for settlement blocs in exchange for territory elsewhere. They continued the conversation at Camp David. But Mr. Abu Ala said the Israelis had talked of an unfair swap -- annexing about 9 percent of the West Bank and giving the Palestinians the equivalent of about 1 percent elsewhere.
"I said, Shlomo, I cannot look at the maps. Close them," Mr. Abu Ala said, describing a conversation with Mr. Ben-Ami. He declared that he would discuss only the 1967 borders. "Clinton was angry at me and told me I was personally responsible for the failure of the summit. I told him even if occupation continues for 500 years, we will not change."
But at Taba, the Palestinians were more than willing to look at maps. Now the Israelis were talking about annexing 6 percent of the West Bank in exchange for land elsewhere that was equivalent to 3 percent. That would have given the Palestinians some 97 percent of the total land mass of the West Bank, which is much closer to their long-held goal that the Israelis should return all the territories captured in 1967.
At Camp David, Mr. Ben-Ami said, the Israelis discovered very late in the game how differently the two sides perceived the final status talks. 
"That the Palestinians would agree to less than 100 percent was the axiom of Israeli politics since 1993," he said.
Mr. Sher said most members of the Palestinian leadership "knew and agreed that this is a historic compromise that requires the Palestinians yielding on some issues -- all except one: Arafat." At the end of Camp David, the three parties agreed that the chemistry had been bad. That was about all they agreed on. The Americans were dejected, although months later Mr. Clinton described Camp David as a "transformative event" because it forced the two sides to confront each other's core needs and allowed them to glimpse the potential contours of a final peace.
At the close of July 2000, however, the Israelis felt that their generosity had been rebuffed. And the Palestinians felt that they were being offered a state that would not be viable -- "less than a bantustan, for your information," Mr. Arafat said in a recent interview.
"They have to control the Jordan Valley, with five early warning stations there," Mr. Arafat said. "They have to control the air above, the water aquifers below, the sea and the borders. They have to divide the West Bank in three cantons. They keep 10 percent of it for settlements and roads and their forces. No sovereignty over Haram al Sharif. And refugees, we didn't have a serious discussion about."
Mr. Ben-Ami said he spent considerable time after Camp David trying to explain to Israelis that the Palestinians indeed did make significant concessions from their vantage point. "They agreed to Israeli sovereignty over Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, 11 of them," he said. "They agreed to the idea that three blocs of the settlements they so oppose could remain in place and that the Western Wall and Jewish Quarter could be under Israeli sovereignty."
Mr. Malley added that the Palestinians had agreed to negotiate a solution to the refugee issue that would not end up threatening Israel's Jewish majority. "No other Arab party that has negotiated with Israel -- not Anwar el-Sadat's Egypt, not King Hussein's Jordan, let alone Hafez al-Assad's Syria -- ever came close to even considering such compromises," he said.
In the public analysis, the summit meeting fell apart in bitter disagreement over how to share or divide Jerusalem. Mr. Clinton recently said it was the refugee issue that did it in. But Mr. Malley and others who took part said there were gaps on every issue.
But at the end, Mr. Clinton praised Mr. Barak's courage and vision and said Mr. Arafat had not made an equivalent effort.
Mr. Shaath said: "I personally pleaded with President Clinton: 'Please do not put on a sad face and tell the world it failed. Please say we broke down taboos, dealt with the heart of the matter and will continue.' "
"But then the president started the blame game, and he backed Arafat into a corner," he added
Mr. Ben-Ami expressed a similar sentiment. "At the end of Camp David, we had the feeling that the package as such contained ingredients and needed to go on," he said. "But Clinton left us to our own devices after he started the blame game. He was trying to give Barak a boost knowing he had political problems going home empty handed but with his concessions revealed. But in doing so he created problems with the other side."
Mr. Arafat "rode home on a white horse," Mr. Shaath said, because he showed Palestinians that he "still cared about Jerusalem and the refugees." He was perceived as having stood strong in the face of incredible pressure from the Americans and the Israelis.
Nonetheless, Mr. Erekat said he had traveled from Bethlehem to Gaza preaching that "Camp David was good, Camp David was progress." He also said Mr. Arafat had made such comments, but if he did, they were very quiet.
But after Camp David, negotiators plunged back into their work at the King David Hotel. And the results were positive enough that Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat held their upbeat dinner meeting, and the Clinton administration summoned negotiators to Washington on Sept. 27. On Sept. 28, Mr. Sharon visited the Temple Mount. On Sept. 29, the situation began disintegrating with a rapidity that shocked everyone.
Each side blamed the other. The Israeli government has said the Palestinians initiated the uprising to force the Israelis to give them what they could not get at Camp David. Mr. Arafat said in an interview that Mr. Barak in effect conspired with Mr. Sharon "to destroy the peace process" once he could not get the Palestinians to accept his offer. Mr. Arafat called Mr. Sharon's visit to the Temple Mount "a vehicle for what they had decided on: the military plan."
An international fact-finding committee headed by former Senator George J. Mitchell did not hold either side solely responsible for the breakdown and described a lethal dynamic on the ground that grew from the behavior of both sides and took on a destructive life of its own. More than 650 people have been killed since Sept. 29, an overwhelming majority of them Palestinians.

'Too Late' at Taba
Some Still Look to Eventual Peace
Both sides, in recent interviews, wondered aloud why Mr. Clinton could not have presented his peace proposal at Camp David or immediately afterward. In late December, when he finally did so, the timing was very tight. Mr. Clinton was due to leave the presidency on Jan. 20, and Mr. Barak faced elections on Feb. 6.
The proposal offered more to the Palestinians than what was on the table at Camp David, but they initially responded with skepticism. The plan was too vague, they said. In the midst once more of a violent relationship with Israel, they were not emotionally poised to abide by the political timetables of others and to rush into a fuzzy deal, they said.
A European diplomat said the Palestinians did not understand the imminence and implications of a victory by Mr. Sharon; another said they did not want to waste their time with Mr. Barak, who was predicted to lose.$

Museums

* "AFRICAN FORMS," Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 966-1313 (through Aug. 8). This show forgoes the figurative sculptures and masks that made African art a foundation of Western modernism to concentrate on supposedly humbler stuff, objects of physical adornment and daily use. With some 400 objects created by 156 ethnic groups, it proceeds in clusters of related carved wood neck rests, stools and boxes; ivory hairpins and snuff bottles; all kinds of jewelry; baskets and ceramic vessels; and spoons, weapons and musical instruments. The show is pervaded by an elegance, an economy of form and a sensitivity to materials that is both intensely spiritual and protomodern. Figurative sculpture and masks may be the "high art" of Africa, but there is no low. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 65+ (Roberta Smith).

"BEYOND THE EASEL: DECORATIVE PAINTING BY BONNARD, VUILLARD, DENIS AND ROUSSEL, 1890-1930," Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1000 Fifth Avenue, at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sept. 9.) The themes of the 80 or so French paintings in this show, created for bourgeois homes by artists who called themselves the Nabis, couldn't be more lightweight: city parks and country gardens, gift-wrapped tots and fusspot nannies, with the occasional nymph thrown in for tone. Yet the results, with their clotted textures and mildewy palettes of puce, mauve and brown, often look leaden and suffocating, trapped in nostalgia. Bonnard and Vuillard, unsurprisingly, come off best; Maurice Denis and Ker Xavier Roussel less well. Works that haven't been seen together for a century have been gathered for the occasion. Of most interest, though, is the concept of decoration that the Nabis promoted, one that was at once radical and reactionary. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5 for students and 65+ (Holland Cotter).

"MARC CHAGALL: EARLY WORKS FROM RUSSIAN COLLECTIONS," Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200 (through Oct. 14). When Chagall returned to Russia in 1914 after four years in Paris, he intended to marry his beloved fiancee, Bella Rosenfeld, and hurry back to the French capital. Instead World War I and the Russian Revolution kept him in his homeland for eight years, during which he did some of his greatest work. The 60 artworks here, most being exhibited in the West for the first time, form a series of intense Chagallian doses rather than a comprehensive overview. They are accompanied by nine paintings by Chagall's first teacher, the sensitive realist Yehuda Pen. The show culminates in the seven large, deliriously inventive murals Chagall made for the Jewish State Chamber Theater in Moscow during three feverish months in 1920. Hours: Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Tuesdays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50 for students and 65+ ($2 surcharge for "Chagall") (Smith).

* JACQUES AND NATASHA GELMAN GALLERIES, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5000 (continuing). These glorious new galleries display 50 French modern works, almost all paintings, drawn from the Gelmans' collection. In addition to the paintings here, the collection includes five sculptures, more than 30 drawings and a major work on paper: a Matisse cutout, the Met's first, which will be shown in a subsequent hanging. The standouts installed here include Matisse's Fauve masterpiece "The Young Sailor II"; a matched set of small, classic Cubist paintings, one by Picasso, one by Braque, both from 1911, arguably the high point of their collaboration; and a fantastically refined, sexually fraught 1929 Dali, "Accommodations of Desires." It is a selection that is not only consistent in its high quality but also, for all the big names and visual firepower, surprisingly personal. It makes the museum a modern art destination in a way that it has never quite been before. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

* "FRANK GEHRY, ARCHITECT," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Aug. 26). A full-dress retrospective that showcases history unfolding, even as we walk through it. Mr. Gehry has shown that even in architecture, a form notoriously resistant to creativity, it is possible not only to realize a personal vision but also to gain wide public support for it. The show is a tribute to the ideal of service: to an art form, to the city and to the continuous reconstruction of a democratic way of life. Nothing, not even familiarity with Mr. Gehry's buildings, can prepare you for the impact of seeing his work presented in Frank Lloyd Wright's magnificent rotunda. The energy hits you on entering the show and increases as you proceed. Hours: Fridays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8, students and 65+ (Herbert Muschamp).

* WILLIAM KENTRIDGE, New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Sept. 16). By way of drawings and film animations, Mr. Kentridge uses searing images to address South Africa and its racial problems, along with the longings and frustrations of bourgeois lives played out in the country's deeply dysfunctional setting. The exhibition begins with his jarring "Shadow Procession" (1999), a ragtag parade of silhouetted moving images projected on a big screen, which evokes the displaced and dispossessed who haunt not only South Africa but also the history of the world. At the heart of the show are his drawings and the short animated films he makes of them, in which the process shares importance with the content. Many of the films contrast the lives of two antiheroes, one a crude rapacious businessman, the other a sensitive artist, in compelling medleys of images that touch on the personal and the political. Departing from this format is "Ubu Tells the Truth" (1997), a highly charged satire based on the hearings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, set up in 1995 to investigate human rights abuses in the apartheid era. It's not often that good art is shaped from such raw angry material, but Mr. Kentridge's powers of invention are equal to the challenge. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3 for students, artists and 65+ (Grace Glueck).

* "MASTER DRAWINGS FROM THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART," Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0610 (through Aug. 19). From Michelangelo to Louise Bourgeois, from Rembrandt to Franz Kline, this cornucopia of drawings from one of the most important collections in the United States bristles with the work of stellar talents. A standout is a double-sided drawing in red chalk by Michelangelo, probably done around 1510-11. One side reveals the trouble he had sketching a foot that fits the position of a youthful male nude on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel; the other shows the headless nude, a powerful, ingeniously posed figure that emphasizes the sculptor's magnificent grasp of anatomical rendering. A rare compositional drawing by Fra Filippo Lippi, a subtly toned landscape by Claude Lorrain, a scene of battling horses by Gericault, a stately portrait by Ingres, one of Seurat's brilliant black crayon drawings of a French vaudeville scene and works by Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec are among the highlights. The 20th-century American group is something of a disappointment, but there are enough great things from other eras to make this a masterpiece of a show. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6 for students and 65+ (Glueck).

"MASTER DRAWINGS FROM THE SMITH COLLEGE MUSEUM OF ART," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Aug. 12). This selection of drawings spanning six centuries has compelling works on paper by some of the more resonant names in Western art history, names like Tiepolo, Boucher, Ingres, Gericault, Beardsley, van Gogh, Mondrian and others. There are works of only academic proficiency, but in far more cases the drawing sings: in the 15th-century Italian Rosso Fiorentino's near-orgiastic vision of a double martyrdom made with urgent sensuousness in red chalk, for example, or Seurat's studies for "La Grande Jatte," in which broad, deft swipes of a black crayon evoke the silhouettes of women who seem almost dissolved by watery light. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 62+ (Ken Johnson).

* "MIGRATIONS: HUMANITY IN TRANSITION," photographs by Sebastiao Salgado, International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 860-1777 (through Sept. 9). The show (there are two accompanying books) is the product of seven years in more than 35 countries documenting what Mr. Salgado calls "the reorganization of the human family," partly because of the shift from "majority rural to majority urban." His subjects are refugees, exiles, orphans, landless peasants, homeless families, boat people, internees and others. This is a sprawling, frequently gruesome story -- the scale and gravity of it should speak for themselves -- and if the suffering doesn't prompt guilt, indifference to it will. That's how emotional blackmail and effective moral photojournalism work. Mr. Salgado practices both as well as anyone does these days. Of course, the pictures are also exploitative, but that's also a feature of photojournalism. We respond despite the voyeurism and the manipulation because of the formal beauty. The good photographs are so stupendously gorgeous that, for better and worse, they can make you forget everything else while you are looking at them. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6 for students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* WAYNE THIEBAUD: A PAINTINGS RETROSPECTIVE," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Sept. 23). The world not being a perfect place, this show will be around only through the summer, so consider yourself forewarned. At the Whitney, as in life, happiness is fleeting. Meanwhile, you are free to bask in these pumpkin pies, meat and cheese deli counters, lipsticks, hot dogs and gum-ball machines, which, as Mr. Thiebaud has painted them for the last 40 years, have the aura of loves lost and too fondly recalled. Joy yielding to melancholy then yields to the less jolting but more durable satisfaction of being in the presence of pictures so lovingly and wittily made. These pictures provoke happiness if for no other reason than that they are content to be what they are, which is enough, this being the same message they convey about the modest objects and people they depict. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8 for students and 62+ (Kimmelman).

Galleries: Uptown

"MINIMAL," Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677 (through Aug. 10; reopens Aug. 27 to 31). This elegant show includes works of classic Minimalism like a box made of stainless steel and fluorescent red Plexiglas by Donald Judd; an iconic arrangement of red, pink and yellow fluorescent lights by Dan Flavin; and a gorgeous, glossy red, thick plank shape by John McCracken. It also embraces more Conceptually motivated works, like words on the wall by Lawrence Weiner that say "Around the bend"; a square of typewritten concrete poetry by Carl Andre; and photographs of framework houses by Bernd and Hilla Becher (Johnson).

* "POP ART: THE JOHN AND KIMIKO POWERS COLLECTION," Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 77th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through Aug. 31). With his Japanese-born wife, Kimiko, John Powers (1916-1999), a former president of the Prentice-Hall publishing company, gathered a big-bang collection of Pop Art by the movement's stars. The 26 objects shown here, including works by Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Claes Oldenburg, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and James Rosenquist, are mostly from the 1960's, and they bring a whole era back into vivid focus. Among the signature works are Warhol's serial extravaganza, "200 Soup Cans" (1962); Mr. Rauschenberg's "Broadcast" (1959), a combine painting with a working radio attached; and Mr. Oldenburg's soft "Drum Set" (1967), a bodylike sendup of a professional drummer's instruments in vinyl and canvas that droops on a platform in a metaphor for its own spent energy. Collectors' collectors, the Powerses made the pursuit of art into an art of their own (Glueck).

"SALT OF THE EARTH," Bettina Werner, Winston Wachter Mayer, 39 East 78th Street, (212) 327-2526 (through Aug. 15). With unabashed grandiosity, Ms. Werner calls herself the "Queen of Salt." Since the 1980's she has specialized in making abstract paintings using colored salt crystals in various grades, from sandy to chunky, as her primary medium. She evidently wants to be some kind of 21st-century alchemist, but her multipaneled pictures are formally generic. Maybe they should be saltier (Johnson).

"SERIAL THINKING," Kouros, 23 East 73rd Street, (212) 288-5888 (through Aug. 31). Zeuxis, an organization of still-life painters, presents works by more than two dozen artists, most represented by multiple versions of a single motif. Some impressive works stand out against the earnestly academic background, including Victor Pesces's iconic, subtly humorous pictures of isolated cups; Suzanne Biggins's small close-up studies of matches, which verge on grid-based abstraction; and Lucy Barber's hazy images of objects that seem almost dissolved by light and heat (Johnson).

"VOYAGES: A SMITHSONIAN LIBRARIES EXHIBITION," Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, (212) 838-6690 (through Aug. 4). Mostly a selection of mostly rare books with some curious objects also, "Voyages" offers a miniature cross section of the vast holdings of the Smithsonian Institution Libraries. Contents range from remarkable antiquities like "Mundus Subterraneus" by the 17th-century Dutch scholar Athanasius Kircher, thought to be the earliest printed study of geophysics and vulcanology, to a copy of Neil Armstrong's "Stroll on the Moon," which is signed by the author and the fellow astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins (Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

MORRIS GRAVES, "Still Life," Schmidt Bingham, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 888-1122 (through Aug. 17). This small retrospective honors a great American original who died in May at 90. Ranging from vigorously palette-knifed paintings of drinking fountains from the 1930's to exquisitely delicate pictures of flowers in transparent bottles from the 90's, the show gives a fine taste of Graves's craftsmanlike versatility and his modest yet intense poetic sensibility (Johnson).

ALEXANDER LIBERMAN, "Maquettes for Monuments," Ameringer/Howard, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 935-1110 (through Aug. 10). In the late 1960's, this Modernist sculptor and Conde Nast editorial director produced gigantic abstractions using old, unearthed gas pipes. On view here are sleek little copies of those monumental works, compositions of standing, leaning or tumbling cylinders finished in glossy red or matte rust-colored patina. Though not deeply consequential, they are appealingly precious (Johnson).

"MINIMALISM PAST AND PRESENCE," Galerie Lelong, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 315-0470 (through Aug. 15). For its final exhibition before moving to Chelsea, Lelong presents a retrospective of Minimalist or near-Minimalist artists who have exhibited here over the years, including Robert Ryman, Robert Mangold and Donald Judd. Alfredo Jaar's lightbox-lighted Social Realist photograph, Sean Scully's loose stripe paintings and Ana Mendieta's photograph of an archetypal earthwork undermine the show's coherence, but being definitive seems not to be the point (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

"CAMERA WORKS: THE PHOTOGRAPHIC IMPULSE IN CONTEMPORARY ART," Marianne Boesky Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9889 (through Aug. 10). Despite the encompassing title, this show focuses almost exclusively on photographs by 31 established artists, mostly in their 30's and 40's, who are not known primarily, if at all, for working with the camera. Usual suspects are in the majority, from Ross Bleckner to Lisa Yuskavage, with Peter Doig, Jessica Stockholder, Rachel Whiteread and Gregor Schneider in between. But there are still plenty of surprises and revelations, especially when you find yourself thinking that some of the assembled should stick to photography (Smith).

"ELECTRIFY ME!" Friedrich Petzel, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9467 (through Aug. 10). This judiciously selected (by the curator Mark Fletcher) and beautifully installed exhibition of sculptures that use electric light includes a heart-shaped neon sign with a funny but unprintable message by Tim Noble and Sue Webster; a window of cool light by James Turrell; Jorge Pardo's lamps of thick glass scattered on the floor and looking vaguely like collapsing squashes; an elegiac string of bulbs by Felix Gonzalez-Torres; and a neon palindrome by Bruce Nauman. Only Rachel Whiteread's aluminum cast of an electrical switch box doesn't light up (Johnson).

ENEAS, "Thriller," Esso, 211 West 28th Street, (212) 560-9728 (through Aug. 16). Every canvas in this empty but archly sophisticated display of insider gamesmanship has the name Michael Jackson stenciled across the top above a skillful simulation of gesture or drip painting by Jackson Pollock, who shares a name with the mercurial pop star. These works so closely resemble George Condo's jazz album cover paintings that you can't help suspecting the sly Condo might have invented Eneas. (Johnson).

"FOUR ABSTRACT CLASSICISTS," Gary Snyder, 601 West 29th Street, (212) 871-1077 (through Aug. 25). This punchy time capsule of a show features works from the 1950's and 60's by four West Coast painters of hard-edged abstraction -- Karl Benjamin, Lorser Feitelson, Frederick Hammersley and John McLaughlin. The exhibition recalls a generational shift away from Abstract Expressionism toward the cooler aesthetics of the 1960's. Its title invites reflection on the paradoxical tension in reductive abstraction between historical avant-gardism and timeless formalism (Johnson).

RICHARD HAMILTON, "Prints, 1968-1998," Charles Cowles Gallery, 537 West 24th Street, (212) 925-3500 (through Aug. 17). James Joyce's "Ulysses" and tabloid subjects like Mick Jagger's arrest for drug possession are part of the huge print repertory of the English painter Richard Hamilton. Mr. Hamilton is wide-ranging not only in subject matter but also in print technique; while not dispensing with venerable practices like etching and engraving, he sets no limits on technical possibilities, fooling around with contemporary techniques from silk-screening to computer manipulation of digital images, sometimes using several in the same print. This wonderfully animated show illustrates his belief that images will always be more important than the manner of their execution. But it also reveals the role that technical innovation plays in the impact of his graphic work (Glueck).

"LARGER THAN LIFE," Center for Figurative Painting, 115 West 30th Street, (212) 868-3452 (through Sept. 28). The standouts in this five-artist show are two painters of opposite but equally ambitious sensibility: Leland Bell, whose large, perfectly composed figure compositions project an Appolonian love of order and clarity, and Paul Georges, a passionate hedonist whose big, recklessly vigorous painting of wild pink roses under a bright blue sky evokes a summer day to almost unbearably delightful effect (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

* LOUISE BOURGEOIS AND YAYOI KUSAMA, Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441 (through tomorrow; reopens Aug. 21 to Sept. 15). Bringing Ms. Bourgeois and Ms. Kusama together for the first time in this illuminating drawing show was an inspired idea. Both have found inspiration in the wilder parts of consciousness, and both have long practiced repetitive mark-making. In a recent drawing by Ms. Bourgeois, nested ovals made in a scratchy red line create a primitivistic, enigmatically iconic image. Ms. Kusama's dot fields and allover linear networks produce, at their best, eye-buzzing opticality and cosmic transcendentalism (Johnson).

TEUN HOCKS, P.P.O.W., 476 Broome Street, (212) 941-8642 (through Aug. 10). For his large, funny and mysterious photographs, this Dutch artist constructs and paints his own sets, and, like Buster Keaton or Magritte's bowler-hatted Everyman, performs actions that prompt philosophical meditation on reality and illusion. The image of the artist concentrating on a burning candle in his hand while the sun blazes behind him might be a metaphor about the human limits of spiritual perception (Johnson).

"SURF'S UP! SURFING PHOTOGRAPHY FROM 1922 TO 1942," by Tom Blake and Don James," Ariel Meyerowitz, 580 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 625-3434 (through Aug. 10). Blake and James got into surfing and photographing surfers long before the Beach Boys made it a national craze. Blake's pictures from the 1920's and early 30's and James's from the late 30's and early 40's are shown here in the form of poster-sized digital prints made from original negatives. The warm-toned, often blurry images of men riding waves on long boards look at once nostalgically antique and fashionably contemporary (Johnson).

Last Chance

JOHN BALDESSARI, JEFF KOONS, TOM WESSELMANN, Sonnabend, 536 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-1018 (through today). The big surprise is how shockingly uninteresting one finds Mr. Koons's dry, anonymously painted, Rosenquist-style montages. Mr. Baldessari's new photo-constructions offer the familiar conceptual impenetrability and visual enervation that have always characterized his least interesting works. But the unassuming hedonism of Mr. Wesselmann's three cutout steel works -- a rippling abstraction, a still life and a cartoon landscape -- is delightfully if not deeply seductive (Johnson).

JACQUELINE BOOTIER, "Basic Training," Lombard/Freid, 531 West 26th Street, (212) 967-8040 (through today). This promising show of exuberantly painterly pictures based on old family snapshots is Ms. Bootier's first solo. The L.A.-based artist trowels swathes of thick paint this way and that, creating vibrant, fractured spaces around lumpy, gnarly figures. In "Potty Training" a sad little girl with her pants down seems overwhelmed by the inexplicable and chaotic pressures of her young life (Johnson).

JASON DUVAL, Marcello Marvelli, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 627-3363 (through today). The small, blocky abstractions in this young painter's first solo exhibition have a painterly touch that veers from graceful to brusque and a finely tuned sense of color. At best, in two larger, more finished works that call to mind the paintings of Thomas Nozkowski, the circulating line, semi-transparent glazes and vibrating play of reds or greens reward extended contemplation (Johnson).

* "EL GRECO: THEMES AND VARIATIONS," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Sunday). This gemlike single-digit exhibition (just seven canvases) outweighs some of the more grandiose shows in New York museums at the moment. It brings together, mostly for the first time, four versions of the artist's tumultuous "Purification of the Temple," which provide a vivid time line of his transcultural development, and three versions of his resonant portrait of St. Jerome as a cardinal, which were all painted toward the end of his life when he skillfully copied -- always with interesting differences -- his works for private patrons. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 62+ (Smith).

"FACES AND FIGURES: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHY IN SCANDINAVIA," Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, near 38th Street, (212) 779-3587 (through today). Nordic photography makes a good showing here with a mix of established and lesser-known talents using a range of approaches, from documentary to personal diary. The aim is to dispel stereotypes about "coolness, control and psychic remoteness" in the words of Ann Sass, chief curator. And the show succeeds, with a humanscape of transvestite haunts in Paris, high jinks in Swedish suburbs, hunting and farming in Iceland, plain folk at home in Sweden, Christmas in Finland, prostitutes plying their trade in Denmark and children frolicking in Norway (Glueck).

NEIL FARBER: NEW DRAWINGS, Clementine Gallery, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-5937 (through today). Children, cats, the Devil and hell are recurrent themes for this young Canadian artist, whose cartoony, vaguely "Peanuts"-like whimsies seem to proliferate like rabbits on the gallery walls. In his artfully artless drawings, sometimes mordant, sometimes terminally cute, animals morph into more unaccustomed creatures; children drink poison and descend to the netherworld; a pair of swallowed birds preen in the stomach of a smug cat. His free flow of the pen could use, if not quenching, a little editing (Glueck).

ADA GILMORE: "THE SUMMER OF 1915: WATERCOLORS FROM PROVINCETOWN," Mary Ryan, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 397-0669 (through Tuesday). All 22 paintings in this modestly radiant exhibition were made on the backs of official United States Postal Service postcards during the year after World War I drove this American Modernist from Paris to Provincetown. Gilmore's sunny, Impressionistic pictures of women gardening or doing laundry or views of houses among trees become more absorbing the more you look. Like her most obvious influence, Vuillard, she worked a fine balance between vibrantly patterned surface and evocative domestic space (Johnson).

"SUPERIMPOSITION," Caren Golden Fine Art, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 727-8304 (through today). This smart group show by mostly young American artists, organized by the critic David Hunt, focuses on art based on stacking, layering, volume or the illusion of depth. One sculpture is made from vertically arranged reels of film, another from painstakingly assembled stones. A painting is composed from layers of drizzled paint; a fabric relief from a free-associational network of words. The deep space of science fiction gets some play in a Minimalist wall piece that doubles as a star ship control panel. And a digital work weaves together personal references, abstract forms and music (Cotter).

JUDI WERTHEIN AND LEANDRO ERLICH, "Turismo," Kent Gallery, 67 Prince Street, (212) 966-4500 (through Thursday). This photo-installation piece by two Argentine artists, a hit at the seventh Havana Biennial last fall, revolves around big color Polaroids of ordinary Cubans posing as they please in a loonily unlikely setting: a sparkling winter wonderland incorporating a bright Alpine backdrop, fake snow underfoot and props that include skis, a sled and Styrofoam snowballs. The original snow-scene set is also here -- pristine, carefully lighted and inviting. They exemplify the best kind of site-specific, political art, one that makes its points effortlessly and travels well (Smith).

"WET!" Luise Ross Gallery, 568 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 343-2161 (through today). Some summer group shows just want to have fun, and this one accomplishes the goal with admirable flair and ecumenicism. The slippery subject helps. Wetness is surveyed with a thoroughness that includes geography, food, sport and sex. The artists range from Sigmar Polke to Bill Traylor to Patty Chang and Nicole Eisenman, and the styles are just as various (Smith).

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
From Taipei, Snapshots Full of Atmosphere Show an Accidental Family

BYLINE:  By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
The 1990's may well be remembered as a heroic age of Taiwanese art cinema, a period of creative ferment akin to the French New Wave of the late 50's and early 60's. Like Francois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, and Claude Chabrol, a handful of directors -- among them Edward Yang, Hou Hsiao-hsien, and Tsai Ming-liang -- have been making films that simultaneously extend the formal possibilities of the medium and reveal the half-hidden facets and barely audible rhythms of contemporary life. 
 Unlike their French or Italian predecessors, however, these filmmakers have received very little attention in the United States. Their work has been shown mainly at film festivals, in museum and film society retrospectives, or during brief and underpublicized commercial releases. So American audiences --and a number of American critics, including this one -- are only now catching up. One hopes that the warm embrace of Mr. Yang's "Yi Yi" and Wong Kar-Wai's "In the Mood for Love" -- to say nothing of the blockbuster success of Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" -- will sharpen the curiosity of moviegoers and the resolve of distributors to embrace Chinese-language films. 
 In spite of the time lag, the moment seems right: as the American economy slides from exuberance to anxiety, we may be more receptive to the melancholy images of life in the wired, hectic city of Taipei that filter through "Yi Yi"; Mr. Hou's new film, "Millennium Mambo"; and "The River," Mr. Tsai's third feature, completed in 1996 and receiving its belated American opening today, at the Cinema Village. 
Whether or not "The River" is, as some critics have claimed, Mr. Tsai's masterpiece, it is an excellent introduction to his oblique narrative style, his favored themes and his careful, lyrical visual sensibility. The story emerges slowly, with virtually no exposition and minimal dialogue -- for long stretches "The River" resembles a silent film with ambient street noise instead of piano music -- through a series of long shots that are at once naturalistic and meticulously composed. You feel that Mr. Tsai is not staging the action so much as observing it, allowing small gestures and funny-sad coincidences to resonate like the words in a poem. 
The emotions that circulate through the film are as familiar as they are difficult to name. Mr. Tsai presents a tableau of three lonely people who turn out, as if unbeknownst to themselves, to be related -- a mother (Lu Hsiao-ling), a father (Miao Tien), and their son Xiao-kang (Lee Kang-sheng).
The father, when he is not trying to cope with the water that mysteriously floods into his room from the apartment upstairs, seeks out anonymous sex with young men in the city's gay bathhouses. The mother pursues a desultory affair with a pornographer. Their aimless son, after a brief, accidental film career (he plays a drowned corpse floating face down in the river), develops a crippling pain in his neck, which has no apparent cause, and no cure.
His infirmity, like everything else in "The River," wears an aura of metaphor: it might be an Eastern variant of the malaise that Julianne Moore's character suffered in Todd Haynes's "Safe." But though Mr. Tsai's characters are to some extent representative figures drifting in the existential void, they are also odd, lonely individuals grounded in the noise and clutter of their particular place and time, facing predicaments more often comical than terrifying -- or in the manner of silent films, comical to us and terrifying to them.
The father's struggle with the fallibility of modern plumbing (something of a motif for Mr. Tsai: in his first film, "Rebels of the Neon God," the water came up through the floor) and Xiao-kang's attempt to steer his motor scooter in spite of his neck pain are recorded with stoical absurdism.
A strong sexual undercurrent flows through Mr. Tsai's films, breaking through the surface with a shocking intensity that comes not from the explicit display of bodies, but rather from the naked, desperate longing the characters suddenly betray. The sex scene that comes near the end of "The River" is a beautifully shot chiaroscuro of half-concealed limbs and damp bath-house shadows that resolves into one of the most devastating and unassimilable images in recent cinema. 
It's worth waiting for. The pace of "The River" is slow, and Mr. Tsai's minimal camera movement and deliberate editing may take some getting used to, especially in an era of hectic cutting and hand-held hyperactivity. But he is one of those filmmakers whose visions, once encountered, are hard to shake, a rare director who seems, even at this late date, to be reinventing the medium and rediscovering the world.

HEADLINE: Stocks Relapse As Japan Waits For Changes 

BYLINE:  By MIKI TANIKAWA 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 26 

 BODY:
Japan's stock market, which rallied in the spring on hope that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi would be able to pull the country out of a decade-long slump, has slipped to pre-election levels as the premier has failed to explain how he would handle nonperforming bank loans and as the global slowdown curbs corporate profit. 
 After Mr. Koizumi took office in April, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose from a low of 11,819 in March to this year's high of 14,529 in May. By Monday, the index had retreated to 11,609.63, the lowest point in 16 years. It closed at 11,858.56 today, down 33 points. 
 "The market does not believe the nonperforming loans can be cleaned up in just two to three years" as the prime minister has promised, said Naoya Orime, chief investment officer at Merrill Lynch Investment Managers in Tokyo.
"They have to show exactly how many bad loans there are," Mr. Orime said, "whether the government will inject capital into banks -- and if they do, what will they do about the management" to prevent the problem from recurring.
When Mr. Koizumi became prime minister, his maverick image and reformist talk fascinated people so much that his popularity ratings soared as high as 90 percent in some polls. Investors, particularly in Europe and the United States, were swept up in the enthusiasm. "Investors began to buy on expectations," Mr. Orime said.
But optimism waned, and the market fizzled, as the government failed to say specifically how it would clean up bad loans, analysts said. In recent months, those concerns were compounded by the slowdown of global demand for electronics and other consumer goods that underpin Japan's export-oriented economy.
Banks have been among the biggest losers. Mizuho Holdings, the world's largest bank by assets, is trading at about half the price at which it started trading last September after its creation by the merger of the Industrial Bank of Japan, Fuji Bank and Dai-Ichi Kangyo.
Analysts said that the parliamentary election on Sunday could reverse the tide if the Liberal Democratic Party wins by a wide enough margin to give Mr. Koizumi a mandate to pursue change.

HEADLINE: Alcatel Reports a Profit But Plans More Job Cuts 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 26 

 BODY:
Alcatel, joining other telecommunications-equipment makers worldwide, said today that it would pare its work force by about 18 percent this year to reduce operating costs, even as it posted an operating profit of 136 million euros, or about $120 million, in the second quarter.
 The company, which earlier this month outlined plans to shed 3,500 jobs, said it now intended to lay off 20,000 of its 110,000 workers by the end of the year. Alcatel said its goal was to reduce its operating expenses by one billion euros, or about $882 million. 
 The company, which failed in a bid to buy Lucent Technologies two months ago, also announced the resignation of Krish Prabhu, its American chief operating officer and the architect of its strategies in the United States. Mr. Prabhu, 46, who was considered a possible successor to the present chairman and chief executive, Serge Tchuruk, 63, said he was leaving to have more time for personal pursuits.
As expected, Alcatel reported a net loss of 3.1 billion euros in the quarter ($2.73 billion), most of it related to one-time reorganization charges, including the layoffs, and to write-downs of inventory. The write-downs were in response to a glut of installed fiber optic capacity in the United States and Europe and hundreds of millions of dollars of fiber optic equipment in warehouses that probably cannot be sold.
The operating profit, which focuses on regular business activities, declined from 592 million euros a year ago ($521 million). The figures did not include those of a cable affiliate, Nexans, which Alcatel floated on the stock market in June. Alcatel, based in Paris, said revenue in the quarter fell to 6.7 billion euros, about $5.9 billion, from 7.6 billion euros, or about $6.70 billion, a year ago. 
The announcements are the latest examples of the turmoil shaking telecommunications. A drop in spending by telephone companies and data-transmission services has recently hammered the stocks of companies like Alcatel that supply equipment to the industry. Shares of Alcatel rose 4.6 percent today, to close at 17.70 euros in Paris, but the company's stock has fallen 70 percent in value since the first of the year.
On Wednesday, the big German electrical and electronics group, Siemens, pledged cutbacks and fired the head of it telephone networks unit, after reporting a loss in its fiscal third quarter.
At Alcatel, Mr. Tchuruk said the company, whose main North American site is in Plano, Tex., is scrambling to cope with the industrywide slump. 
"Due to the effects of reorganization programs that are under way and will have an effect, particularly in the fourth quarter," he said, "Alcatel expects to make an operating profit in the full year."
Mr. Tchuruk (pronounced CHOO-rook) played down the departure of Mr. Prabhu, saying that he would retain a seat on Alcatel's board and would continue to be the company's technology adviser. In recent newspaper articles in which he hinted that he might resign, Mr. Prabhu has said he will consider returning to Alcatel if the top job is offered.
Mr. Tchuruk said he did not expect to see any improvement in the United States economy before the end of the year, at the earliest. The slowdown in the United States, he said, risked spreading to parts of Europe, as is already the case in Britain.
He said the absence of a recovery in the United States meant that revenue in the third quarter would be weak, though he expected revenue for the year to be close to that of last year.

HEADLINE: Sony Posts Loss, Citing Weak Sales And a Recall 

BYLINE:  By MIKI TANIKAWA 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 26 

 BODY:
The Sony Corporation said today that weakening worldwide sales of electronics products and costs arising from a large recall of cellular handsets caused it to lose 30.1 billion yen, or $243 million, in the first quarter. It also cut its profit forecast for the year by 40 percent.
 "The business environment surrounding Sony in the first quarter was characterized by clear economic slowdown in such primary markets as the U.S., Europe, Japan and Asia," the company stated. 
 "It has become much more challenging as demand falls, supply builds up and price competition intensifies."
While group revenue for the three- month period rose 4.6 percent year on year, when measured in yen, the company acknowledged that the depreciating value of the Japanese currency artificially inflated the figure. Sales would have been 3 percent lower in local currency terms, Sony said.
Sales of electronics goods fell 15 percent in Europe compared with the quarter last year. Sales in the United States showed a decrease of 10 percent.
The game division, which makes the PlayStation console, lost 3.1 billion yen on an operating basis during the quarter as high operating costs more than offset rising sales of its PlayStation 2 hardware and software.
Adding to earnings troubles was the decision to recall more than one million faulty mobile handsets in Japan between May and July. Sony took a charge of 13.1 billion yen during the quarter for the recall.
The company is now bracing for gloomy results for the coming fiscal year. Where it forecast 150 billion yen in group net profit for the fiscal year 2001 as of April this year, it now foresees a net profit of 90 billion yen. And where it predicted 8 trillion yen in group net sales, it now expects 7.7 trillion yen in revenue.
"In many product categories, sales during the quarter were below our projections as of April because of slower demand and price falls in major markets," the company's statement said.
In New York trading, shares in Sony fell $5.95, or more than 10 percent, to close at $51.86.
In the last two months, the stock has fallen more than 35 percent. The earnings were released after markets in Japan had closed.

HEADLINE: Conspiracy Indictment Over Construction Bids 

BYLINE:  By KURT EICHENWALD 

 BODY:
A big American construction company and an affiliate were indicted yesterday on charges of participating in a vast criminal conspiracy to cheat the government out of tens of millions of dollars for Egyptian water projects undertaken as part of the Camp David peace accords.
 The indictment, filed in Federal District Court in Birmingham, Ala., accuses Bill Harbert International, which is based there, and a foreign affiliate, Bilhar International Establishment, of participating in the scheme with an array of other companies. Also charged were the former president of Bilhar, Elmore Roy Anderson, and Peter W. Schmidt, a former official with Philipp Holzmann A.G. of Frankfurt. Philipp Holzmann pleaded guilty to a criminal complaint last year. 
 According to the indictment, the conspiracy lasted more than eight years and involved the rigging of contract bids submitted in the late 1980's and early 1990's to the Agency for International Development, which was financing Egyptian water projects that resulted from the Middle East peace accords reached during the Carter administration.
Contracts were supposed to be awarded through competitive bidding. But the companies subverted the process through payments of bribes and kickbacks to other possible bidders, fraudulent billings to the government and the laundering of cash through Swiss bank accounts, court records show.
The conspirators included at least six international construction companies, which collectively referred to themselves as the Frankfurt Group, according to people briefed on the case. The companies were either American or American subsidiaries of European concerns.
David Rubinger, a spokesman for Harbert, said that the company's lawyers were still reviewing the legal documents and had no immediate comment. Dr. Ralf Neubauer, an executive at Holzmann in Germany, said that Mr. Schmidt had resigned from the company several years ago and that the company did not have a telephone number for him.
Charles Murphy, a lawyer who represents Mr. Anderson, said that his client planned to plead not guilty to the charges. Mr. Murphy said he had not yet read the indictment and could not discuss it in detail.
He said Mr. Anderson, 74, had retired in 1996. "This investigation has been going on for six years," Mr. Murphy said. "Mr. Anderson is anxious to get this matter behind him and clear his name." 
The investigation has already resulted in three other guilty pleas, including one from a division of ABB Ltd., the Swiss engineering giant, which agreed to pay $63 million in fines and restitution.
At the center of the scheme, as described in the indictment and related court records, was an unincorporated joint venture between Harbert and the J. A. Jones Construction Company, a subsidiary of Holzmann in Charlotte, N.C. The Harbert-Jones joint venture submitted some of the winning bids for the contracts and paid other participants to inflate their proposals, the records show.
The indictment describes illegal bid-rigging on three water projects, known as Contracts 20A, 29 and 7. The defendants began their participation, the indictment says, about May 1988, when they flew to Frankfurt to meet with Holzmann executives for the purpose of discussing bid-rigging on the contracts. Over the next few months, Holzmann held discussions with other companies, agreeing to pay them for inflating their bids on the project or for not bidding at all. 
According to court records, companies involved in the conspiracy were able to obtain profits of as much as 60 percent on the Egyptian water projects -- a return that would be almost certainly impossible to obtain under competitive bidding. Indeed, some of the companies went to great lengths to hide their profits, charging fictitious expenses from related companies to decrease the returns shown on their books. 
The investigation began almost six years ago after a top financial officer at one company noticed improper wire transfers and other transactions. That executive then brought those matters to the attention of the Justice Department.

HEADLINE: Powell, in Hanoi, Pauses To Put the Past to Rest 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, July 26 

 BODY:
From the moment his plane first flew over Vietnam on Tuesday to his performance at a foreign ministers' cabaret tonight in the last hours of his visit, memories of fighting a war here more than 30 years ago have crowded in on Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.
 As his official Boeing 757 descended into the airfield here, he said today, he moved into the cockpit to watch the familiar landscape and hear the echo of voices he once knew well. 
 "We came over Thunder Ridge, which is well known to all of our Air Force pilots," he told reporters, referring to a craggy peak that poked dark and tall through white clouds. "And then to hear the voice of the air traffic controller in the tower, greeting our pilot and giving him instructions and to hear that voice, that accent, brought back lots of memories from years ago." 
Secretary Powell had returned to Vietnam as part of a five-country tour of the region, to attend the annual foreign ministers' conference of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. On Friday, he travels to South Korea, before proceeding to China.
But this morning, on the last full day of his visit here, he found himself attending to matters touching on his years in the Vietnam War. The secretary drove through the steaming streets of the capital, his black Chevrolet Suburban slicing a path through the motorcycle rush hour, to preside over a ceremony commemorating United States efforts to recover the remains of American soldiers missing in action.
While chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Powell helped create the group that has been conducting the searches for eight years.
His duty this morning was particularly haunting, because it was to honor seven Americans and nine Vietnamese who died in an air crash this year while searching territory where Americans were believed to have been killed many years ago.
"All of my buddies came home," the secretary said, after placing two incense sticks at the base of a marble plaque engraved with the 16 names. "Even those who died, we got the remains. But for the ones who did not, there is a longing in the hearts of their family members, their fellow veterans."
The most recent losses served to illustrate, he said, that the "casualties of the war continue to be legion." 
On a lighter note, the secretary broke away from the Asean conference this afternoon to stroll through Hanoi.
"It reminded me of my days in Hue and Quang Tri," he said, referring to cities in the former South Vietnam. "Same kinds of shops -- smiling people, happy people."
Had he not been trailed by cameras and pressed by diplomatic matters, the secretary said, he would have liked to sit down somewhere and have a cup of tea or a swig of what he called "ba-ba-ba," the Vietnamese beer brand 333. 
Even with his limited exposure, the secretary seemed to catch the essence of this humming city, where from dawn well into the night, trade, manufacturing, eating and socializing spill out into the streets.
"Just the movement and the shops and the sense of small entrepreneurial activity is pretty exciting," he said.
A stage show of foreign ministers performing for their peers has become something of a ritual at the closing Asean dinner. Tonight, the secretary found himself once again drawing on his Vietnam experiences.
In his first tour in the early 60's, Captain Powell entertained his Vietnamese colleagues with his rendition of the country-and-western song "El Paso." 
On stage this evening, accompanied by a chorus of what were billed as "eight unnamed senior officials," the secretary sang the song again. Clad in a blue shirt and a red bandana, he played the role of the cowboy who falls in love with a Mexican girl. Keeping to the song's story line, General Powell the cowboy was challenged in his love by a wild young man who moves in on his girl, called Makiko tonight because she was played by Foreign Minister Makiko Tanaka of Japan.
The show was off limits to reporters. But according to a description provided afterward by one of the unnamed senior officials, the secretary, who in real life can be a bit of a ham, did a mean job of the cowboy, wielding a gun and shooting the interloper. The unnamed officials formed a posse that stormed on stage to hunt and shoot him down. As he fell to his knees, Secretary Powell was blessed with a last kiss from the Japanese foreign minister. There was much applause, an official from the chorus said. 
Asked how the secretary performed as a singer, the official replied, "O.K., but there is no danger of him losing his day job." 
The secretary faced stiff competition from other countries' representatives. A highly rehearsed Australian delegation, outfitted with a surfboard, roared on stage with a boisterous rendition of the Beach Boys' tune "Kokimo," with new lines sending up the audience. The Russians, with Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov playing a czar on his way to Hanoi, were apparently an especially big hit.
At one point, Czar Ivanov received a telephone call from Washington. The caller? "Mad, but all right," said a voice, playing on the name of former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who reveled in performing at Asean galas. 
Her message to the czar? "Colin Powell will not have the guts to go on stage."

Stocks rose yesterday, as traders and investors looked past bad news from Compaq Computer and Hewlett-Packard, hoping that tax refund checks, on top of the six interest rate cuts, would spur economic growth and corporate profits.
 "Some are pessimistic about earnings two quarters out, but they're probably taking a naive stance," said Dan Rivera, chief investment officer at the large-capitalization growth division of American Express Asset Management. "We've got interest rates and fiscal policy on our side." 
 Some traders said that yesterday's rise in stock prices in the face of sour earnings reports suggested that sellers might be moving aside. "The market continues to shake off the newest developments," said Keith Gertson, head of Nasdaq trading for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. "Every day the resistance continues, it builds conviction that the market is building a base. Most people anticipate a rally of 3 to 5 percent because the market has absorbed the bad news so well." 
All three main market indexes rose yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial average erased an early decline to close up 49.96 points, or 0.48 percent, at 10,455.63. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 12.44 points, or 1.04 percent, to 1,202.93. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite gained 38.64 points, or nearly 2 percent, to 2,022.96. Market breadth was positive.
Seven of the 10 most active Nasdaq stocks rose, including Cisco Systems, up 68 cents, to $19.38.
Wall Street economists and analysts today will be watching a vital indicator of the economy's health, when the government provides an initial reading of gross domestic product figures for the second quarter. Economists polled by Reuters forecast growth of 0.9 percent.
Despite negative earnings reports and projections, some on Wall Street are betting that technical indicators point to a rebound in stocks. Lance Zipper, managing director of equity trading at Brean Murray & Company, saw "some bottom-fishing, some short covering" yesterday.
"People are beginning to feel the worst is behind us," Mr. Zipper said.
Trading was active with 1.21 billion shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, slightly more than June's average volume.
Compaq erased an early loss to gain 38 cents, closing at $14.50. The Houston-based company, a leading producer of personal computers, reported sharply lower profit late Wednesday and also said that revenue would keep sliding.
A sales warning and job cuts from Hewlett-Packard limited the Dow's gain, after the company, a leading printer and computer maker, forecast yesterday that revenue for the current quarter would fall 14 percent to 16 percent from the period a year earlier. Hewlett said it would cut 6,000 jobs. Its shares slumped $1.68, to $24, a 52-week closing low.
Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer at New Amsterdam Partners, noted that the market "sells off when the reports hit the tape, so I would expect things to stay fairly sloppy for a while."
In regular-session trading, before an announcement by JDS Uniphase of a damaging restatement of earnings, stocks of optical networking companies and data storage manufacturers, two badly battered sectors, were having a strong day. Big movers included Corning, up $1.79, to $15.56, and Brocade Communications Systems, which surged $3.80, to $32.70. --------------------

Treasuries Are Higher
By The Associated Press
Bond prices rallied yesterday, spurred by data showing a drop in orders for durable goods. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 11/32, to a price of 99 2/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.13 percent from 5.17 percent on Wednesday. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/32, to 97 4/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.57 percent from 5.59 percent on Wednesday.

PERSON: Robert O. Lowery 

HEADLINE: Robert Lowery, First Black Fire Commissioner, Dies at 85 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Robert O. Lowery, the city's first black fire commissioner who served at a time when arson-fueled blazes raged through the city's minority neighborhoods, died on Tuesday in Manhattan.
 He was 85 and had homes in Washington Heights and on the island of St. Vincent, his daughter Trudy Erwin said. 
 Mr. Lowery, the first black to head the fire department of a major American city, was also the first commissioner appointed by Mayor John V. Lindsay after his election in 1965. "It was a huge appointment," said Charles J. Hynes, who was fire commissioner in the Koch administration and is now the district attorney in Brooklyn. 
Former Mayor David N. Dinkins, the city's first black mayor, said, "He opened doors for all of us."
Mr. Lowery said that Mayor Lindsay "put it on the line" with his appointment. "Let's face it," he said in a 1965 interview with The New York Post several weeks before taking office, "there will be people watching, both white and Negro, simply because I'm a Negro."
Mr. Hynes said the Fire Department had a history of "the most vile kind of segregation." When Mr. Lowery joined the department as a firefighter in 1941, blacks were not allowed to use the kitchen utensils and had to sleep in separate areas.
Despite Mr. Lowery's persistent efforts to improve race relations, he said in a 1970 interview with The New York Times that the bitter racial tensions that persisted in the newly integrated environment might have been worse than under the earlier segregation.
"I think maybe we should go back to the old ways," he said, arguing that putting out fires, his pre-eminent concern, had been easier before integration.
Three years later, when Mr. Lowery resigned, his friend Percy Sutton, the former Manhattan Borough President, charged that he was forced out of office because "John Lindsay never really shared any meaningful power with black people." Mr. Lowery immediately endorsed Comptroller Abraham D. Beame, the Democrat who succeeded Mr. Lindsay as mayor.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Sutton specified that the "hostile environment" Mr. Lowery confronted was not the fault of Mr. Lindsay, who died last December, "but the people he worked with." 
Mr. Sutton said the first minority or woman to serve in a major post is often "a lonely person." He said, "He just got tired of it."
It might have made anybody tired. During his time as commissioner, Mr. Lowery had to deal with an epidemic of false alarms, labor disputes and an increase in deadly fires, many as a result of arson.
An alarming problem was the attack on firefighters with bricks and other weapons, by residents who saw the presence of the mostly white firefighters as an intrusion, as they battled fires in black and Hispanic neighborhoods. The firefighters then began to carry blackjacks, according to articles in The New York Times in 1968.
In interviews, Mr. Lowery professed not to know about the blackjacks, but strongly criticized those who attacked his men. "If we can't get better cooperation from the citizenry in the areas where we're having these problems," he warned, "there is the possibility that fire service there and the protection will diminish."
Robert Oliver Lowery was born on April 20, 1916, in Buffalo, and moved to Harlem when he was 9. He started courses at the City College of New York hoping to become a lawyer, but economic hardship forced him to take a job in 1934 as an usher at the Alhambra Theater in Harlem for $10 a week. He stayed six years, becoming head usher for $17 a week.
After he passed several civil service exams, he worked as a subway conductor for a year before the Fire Department offered him a job. "Had the police department called first, I am sure I would have become a cop," he said.
There were only 50 blacks in the department then, and he quickly became a protege of Wesley Williams, one of the first black fire chiefs. Through Mr. Williams, he became active in the Vulcan Society, an organization of black firefighters.
He was promoted to fire marshal in 1946, and that same year won commendation for arresting a man for 30 acts of arson and burglary. In 1960, he was cited for capturing an armed arsonist, and the next year became an acting lieutenant in the Bureau of Fire Investigation.
In 1963, he was appointed Deputy Fire Commissioner. When Mr. Lindsay later called to interview him about fires, and he made a strong case for forceful fire prevention, but his only ambition was to be retained as deputy commissioner.
The announcement of his appointment to commissioner, as the Republican mayor's first appointment, startled many besides Mr. Lowery, a lifelong Democrat, and went well beyond extending a hand across party lines.
"New York had known commissioners who were persons of color before Lowery, but their chances had been limited to departments like welfare, where the majority of those they served were persons of color, too," Murray Kempton wrote in Newsday in 1991. "A black fire commissioner had been heretofore inconceivable."
He suddenly headed a department of 13,500 of whom 600 were blacks. He addressed the racial issue straightforwardly, striving to increase the proportion of blacks and the sensitivity of whites. He also raised the number of black firefighters assigned to black neighborhoods, as well as the number of blacks in leadership roles.
At the same time, the city's own investigation commissioner was looking into a rumor campaign against Mr. Lowery that turned out to consist of unsubstantiated claims that he sold narcotics and answers to promotion exams to black firefighters. Mr. Lowery contended that the rumors were circulated by a small minority of firefighters of "John Birch or Minutemen philosophy."
His overwhelming concern, however, was dealing with the city's epidemic of fire. "He lived and breathed it 24 hours a day," said Ms. Erwin, who remembers ceaseless fire alarms sounding in the family's apartment. "It was life and death."
After retirement he stayed active in civil rights causes. In 1991, he wrote a letter to Newsday strongly protesting a cartoon depicting Clarence Thomas, whose nomination to the Supreme Court he opposed, as a shoeshine boy. 
Mr. Lowery is survived by his wife, Viviane; daughters Ms. Erwin and Leslie Lowery, both of Washington Heights; a sister, Florence Washington of Baltimore; and a granddaughter.
He once summed up his philosophy in a speech to the Vulcan Society. "Always remember that America -- including many white firefighters -- will never let you forget that your recognizable ancestors were brought to this country in chains and that they believe you are inferior," he said.
"It is up to you to keep proving over and over again that they were wrong."

HEADLINE: New York's Sewage Was a Texas Town's Gold 

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: SIERRA BLANCA, Tex. 

 BODY:
There is not much here anymore, if there was ever much of anything to begin with. The town's main street is coated in dust, and the old movie house is long shuttered. The one sign of activity -- the traffic moving along elevated Interstate 10 -- is a reminder that the modern world rarely stops here.
 The other reminder can be found on the outskirts of this tiny town, where freight cars are being unloaded for the last time. The last sludge train from New York City arrived this month, leaving its last shipment of what officials describe as "bio-solids" but what others call treated sewage. 
 The dump in Sierra Blanca, one of the biggest sludge dumps in the world, is going out of business. 
"We've survived before without it, and I'm sure we still will," said James A. Peace, the Hudspeth County judge and the area's highest elected official.
The news came unexpectedly in June and was greeted with a mixed response in this town of 600 people in the vast, empty country about 90 miles southeast of El Paso. For local critics and environmentalists who have fought the sludge operation and recent efforts to build a nuclear waste dump here, it is a long-awaited victory. For others, it is an economic blow, resulting in the loss of 40 jobs and the planned closing of the town's biggest private employer.
"A lot of people are going to be hunting jobs," said Kay Scarbrough, the county tax assessor, "and there are not any jobs here."
It is hard to imagine places more different than New York and Sierra Blanca, and the contrast has always underscored the mercenary marriage between the nation's largest city and the small town where it has dumped its sewage since 1992. That year, after Congress had prohibited the city from dumping its sludge in the Atlantic Ocean, New York signed contracts with several companies to treat and transport its sewage. One of them was a Long Island joint venture, which began shipping up to 250 tons every day on the 2,065-mile journey to West Texas. The Texas Observer, the political journal, recently called it "the poo-poo choo-choo."
The Long Island company, Merco, had first sought a site in Oklahoma, but after meeting resistance there learned about a failed resort called the Mile High Ranch in Sierra Blanca. The company purchased the 81,000-acre area so that the treated sludge could be spread on "application areas" as if it were fertilizer. The company rotates the areas of land chosen to absorb the sludge.
Environmentalists and critics immediately accused Texas officials of ramming the project through approval. They have long argued that the sludge has exposed the area to health risks and other problems. Texas Tech University has studied the project and has found no evidence of contamination.
"If there was ever a case of environmental injustice, Sierra Blanca was it," said Bill Addington, an outspoken critic who also runs a general store in town. Two years ago, Mr. Addington helped fight plans to build a nuclear waste dump in Sierra Blanca, and he considered the closing of the Merco operation a bittersweet victory. "This material has polluted a very large area that used to be pristine," Mr. Addington said.
But Tom Gillane, Merco's local operations manager, said all the sludge shipments had been carefully tested to prevent contamination and had met environmental standards under New York law. He dismissed the local stories of three-legged deer as the rural equivalents of urban legends and even said the project had helped the environment.
"We're enhancing the natural grass growth," Mr. Gillane said. He added that two nearby ranches leased parts of the land so that cattle could graze on the grass. "The majority of the people are very proud that this operation is here."
There is an odor, although exactly how bad is a matter of interpretation. "If we get a little rain and then a north breeze, then you can smell it here in town," Ms. Scarbrough said. "It smells like a hog farm." 
Wayne West, who once shipped livestock for a living and now runs a local garage, was more charitable."You're asking somebody who's been in the livestock transportation business all his life," Mr. West said, "so to me it smells like money."
No one in Sierra Blanca had any warning that after so many years and so much controversy, the sludge train would soon make its last stop.
Geoffrey Ryan, spokesman for the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, said the decision was based on economics and would save the city about $3 million a year. He said the city had exercised an option to cancel the Merco contract because New York could not generate enough sludge for all five of the companies that were contracted to handle its sludge. Merco, he said, was tied for the most expensive rate.
"It is simply a case where maintaining the five contracts was costing us $2 million to $3 million a year," Mr. Ryan said.
Merco will shut down in Sierra Blanca on Tuesday. Mr. Addington worried that the company could win another contract to store another city's sludge, but Mr. Gillane, the Merco manager, was skeptical.
Mr. Peace, the county judge, said the local school may lose 14 of its 120 students. He went to New York once and found it too big for his liking. But it speaks to the economic desperation of small, rural towns like Sierra Blanca that he would not mind if the sludge train kept coming.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Amid Jingles And Slogans, A Sober Mood

BYLINE:  By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
Hear that plaintive noise emanating from Madison Avenue? That is the sound of the national advertising economy still bumping along the bottom far longer than industry executives had feared.
 When the economy suddenly slowed late last year, most advertisers, advertising agencies and media companies took it in stride, estimating that a recovery would begin by the second half of 2001, or right about now. Certainly by the fourth quarter. 
 But now, after repeatedly scaling back their expectations, even the optimists do not expect a comeback in the advertising business until the second quarter of 2002 -- or maybe the second half.
Some pessimists do not anticipate a return to normal growth and spending until -- brace yourself -- 2003. 
"That's a long way away," said Susan Friedman, president of her own executive recruiting firm for agencies.
The implications go well beyond Madison Avenue. Advertising spending in the United States, which set a record last year at $243.7 billion, has not declined from one year to the next since 1991, when spending fell 1.2 percent from 1990. But now, with estimates that spending by marketers in 2001 will decline 2 percent to 3 percent from 2000, that means about $4.8 billion to $7.3 billion less. And even though this year should still turn out to be the second best on record, well above 1999, that shortfall from the pace set in 2000 is likely to have significant consequences.
For instance, many favorite consumer brands and stores may disappear as marketers and retailers consolidate or go out of business. More advertising agencies could close, and those remaining could lay off more employees in addition to the thousands already let go.
Television networks could cut back production of series pilots for coming seasons, potentially jeopardizing their appeal to viewers. More magazines and newspapers may close or reduce the resources devoted to editorial content, potentially weakening their appeal to readers.
"Everybody has been somewhat blindsided by how quickly things fell apart and how long it's continuing," said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of the American Association of Advertising Agencies in New York, the industry trade organization.
"We're not seeing a lot of optimism out there," Mr. Drake added. That is a sobering note from a field where an optimistic outlook was once standard issue along with a gray flannel suit.
Already, the industry's bible, Advertising Age, declared in its July 2 issue that this year has turned into "a bust" with no relief in sight until "well into" 2002.
"We're all shaken by the steepness of the decline," said Steven T. Florio, president and chief executive at Conde Nast Publications in New York, the unit of Advance Publications that owns familiar magazines from A (Allure) to V (Vogue).
"It's very difficult to keep everyone focused and innovative and to have the same level of tenacity," Mr. Florio added, "when you go into a publisher's meeting and someone holds up Advertising Age and the cover says 'Write It Off.' " 
Michael J. Russell Jr., an analyst who follows the advertising industry for Morgan Stanley in New York, turned to a twist on a familiar metaphor to describe the current mood.
"The problem is, there's no light at the end of the tunnel, just a belief the tunnel can't go on forever," Mr. Russell said. And when the tunnel's terminus actually comes into view, he added, "it's likely we'll get a muted recovery, rather than leaping back." 
That is because consumers, who have kept their wallets and purses relatively open even as corporate America hunkered down, are likely to be more cautious in their spending.
"People are holding their breath at what consumers will do," said Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst who follows Madison Avenue for Merrill Lynch in New York. But the pessimism within the advertising and marketing world could also become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
"If advertising is at a tepid level," she added, meaning that major marketers decide to trim their ad budgets or keep them flat, "the result is a fairly modest recovery instead of a robust recovery" because the stimulus to encourage consumers to spend will be muted.
In a survey last month by Myers Reports in New York, the most frequent estimate of when the recovery would arrive was mid-2002. Just three months earlier, respondents in a similar study pegged the recovery's arrival at early next year.
"If anything, you could argue we're not being conservative enough" in pushing back the arrival of the upturn, said Jack Myers, chief economist at Myers Reports, which publishes media and research newsletters. "I think there will be no real improvement, no real growth, in the market until 2003, maybe 2004, when the Summer Olympics, the presidential election and a recovery in technology and new media will all be factors."
Putting aside the differing views of when advertising will stop bouncing along the bottom, everyone agrees on one point: Though the current economy is not technically in a recession -- generally considered two consecutive quarters in which the overall economy declines -- it is affecting everybody very much like one.
"What's surprised me is how uniform the downturn is," said David McMurry, an analyst who follows the advertising industry for Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. "There's really no part of the business that is less susceptible to it or hasn't been affected."
One reason for that, Mr. McMurry said, is that "since the recession, the fantastic 10-year period of growth we enjoyed was driven not so much by Procter & Gamble and Coca-Cola and General Motors increasing ad spending but by new categories of marketers like financial services, telecommunications, technology, pharmaceuticals that weren't advertising much or at all 10 years ago."
But now, he added, "they're slashing ad spending, sometimes by 75 percent, and when they're such drivers of the growth, their putting on the brakes really slows everything down." 
So, Mr. McMurry has already reduced his 2002 earnings estimates for three giant worldwide agency holding companies, Havas Advertising and the Publicis Groupe, both in Paris, and the WPP Group in London.
Another reason Madison Avenue and the media world feel like they are in a recession is the large number of layoffs and closings affecting thousands of workers.
Agencies shutting their doors include three in New York -- Dweck; Favara & Raffle Advertising; and Warwick Baker O'Neill -- and one in Middletown, Conn. -- KGA Advertising. In addition, agencies are closing offices; among them are the Boston office of Deutsch, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, and the San Francisco offices of Lowe Lintas & Partners, also owned by Interpublic, and Saatchi & Saatchi, part of Publicis. Publications being closed or absorbed into others include Business 2.0, Family PC, Institutional Investor, Jump and Walking magazines.
More agencies "are owned by holding companies" than a decade ago, Mr. Drake of the agency association said. They are more likely to be publicly traded and run by executives who tend "not to put up with income shortfalls very long" because Wall Street expects them to react rapidly in an effort to restore profit growth.
By comparison, "privately held agencies could try to ride things out," he added, without making so many layoffs so quickly.
That was evident yesterday when Interpublic, the publicly held agency company that is the world's largest, reported a second-quarter loss of $110.2 million. "Aggressive cost cuts" are required, said Sean F. Orr, chief financial officer at Interpublic in New York, including the closing or merging of about 75 facilities.
Then, too, there has not been a slowdown or downturn for a decade, meaning that many top managers are used to only good times and were not around -- in any capacity -- during the last squeeze.
"It doesn't have to be bad," Ms. Friedman, the executive recruiter said, "to be bad."
By the same token, Madison Avenue is not waiting until it gets good to try to make it good. Agencies and media companies are moving to remind marketers that they ought to keep advertising in tough times to prepare for the inevitable recovery -- whenever it may arrive.
Right after the Ad Age headline, "Write It Off," Mr. Florio at Conde Nast said, "I wrote a memo to all my people that we will not throw in the towel in the middle of the year."
"While certainly being sober about the business realities," he added, "we need to continue to work hard."
The Magazine Publishers of America, the magazine industry trade association, sponsored a seminar in New York for members on "Advertising in a Soft Economy," which may be repeated in other cities.
"Brands that continue to spend do better in the long haul," said Nina B. Link, president and chief executive at the magazine association. "This is the time we're really pushing that."
The newspaper trade group, the Newspaper Association of America, is taking steps that include a partnership with the Zyman Marketing Group in Atlanta to introduce a marketing initiative to help increase advertising revenue.
"We're hopeful we've bottomed out," said John F. Sturm, president and chief executive at the newspaper association in Vienna, Va., "but at our annual marketing conference this week in Washington, our whole focus was on revenue-generating ideas like special programs to package advertising to make it more attractive to smaller advertisers."
Can all those moves help turn the tide? Well, the industry can certainly hope so.
"Just as nobody saw the rapidity of the slowdown, and it slowed down very quickly, it can turn around very, very quickly," said Alan J. Gottesman, an analyst at West End Communications/Consulting in New York.
After all, "companies that sell goods and services have to keep telling consumers why they need to keep buying those goods and services," he added. "That isn't going to change."

HEADLINE: Freed Chinese Scholar, Still Defiant, Returns to the U.S. 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND BONNER

DATELINE: STERLING, Va., July 26 

 BODY:
After five months in a Beijing jail, an American-based Chinese scholar returned to the United States today and promptly defied the very Chinese authorities who had convicted her of spying and sentenced her to 10 years in prison two days ago.
 "Before I departed Beijing, I was warned not to talk about anything, not to talk about my time, my experience, in China in any form, which includes meeting with you guys here, writing articles, writing books in the future," the scholar, Gao Zhan, said at a news conference upon arriving at Dulles International Airport. "But with America standing behind me, with these fine people standing behind me, I'm not scared." 
 Ms. Gao, a sociologist and a fellow at the School for International Service at American University in Washington, was arrested by the Chinese authorities in February and held in isolation for several months. She was not allowed to meet with her lawyer until July 10, two weeks before her trial on charges of collecting intelligence materials for Taiwan. 
Flanked by her husband, Xue Donghua, and Senator George F. Allen, a Virginia Republican, who was on hand to welcome home the resident of his state, Ms. Gao said that, despite the Chinese authorities' prohibition on discussing any aspects of her time in custody, "I believe that you will see my story in my article or my book." Today, however, she sidestepped some politically sensitive questions on the advice of her husband and Senator Allen.
She was also reunited with her 5-year-old son, Andrew.
"It broke my heart when I was thinking that I couldn't tell a bedtime story to my son every night when I went to sleep," she said about her time in detention. "It broke my heart."
Ms. Gao, a Chinese citizen who has permanent resident status in the United States, was released after intense pressure from Washington, including a telephone call from President Bush to China's president, Jiang Zemin. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who is in Vietnam for the annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, took up the matter with Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan of China. 
Ms. Gao's release comes two days before Secretary Powell is scheduled to arrive in Beijing.
Speaking in Hanoi today, the secretary said human rights would be high on his agenda when he meets with Chinese leaders on Saturday.
While clearly happy over the release of Ms. Gao and Qin Guangguang, another Chinese with United States residency who was convicted at the same time, Secretary Powell said the focus should be on the political conditions that led to the arrests.
"It is not so much individual cases that should be our principal focus and concern, but the system, the system that occasionally might go after people who perhaps should not be gone after, or who are not being given the full protection of law, and their universal human rights might be trampled upon," he said. 
Mr. Bush was asked today why he thought China had released Ms. Gao and Mr. Qin. Both had been granted medical parole, though Mr. Qin is thought to still be in Beijing, where he works for an American pharmaceuticals company.
"Perhaps," Mr. Bush said, "China is beginning to realize that as she begins to deal with Western nations, she's going to have to make better decisions on human rights."
At her brief news conference, Ms. Gao was asked what she felt about Beijing's being awarded the 2008 Olympics. She paused, and appeared to be searching for the answer, when her husband said: "We don't want to talk about political issues here. This is our family reunion."
A moment later, however, Ms. Gao came back to the question.
"That day was very special day for myself also," she said. "At 10 o'clock, I was called out, out of my cell, and on that moment, right at the announcement of Beijing's sponsorship for the Olympic Games, I was formally accused of being a spy for Taiwan."
When she was asked how she had been treated during her detention, Senator Allen stepped in.
"First of all," he said to Ms. Gao, "I'm glad you're violating your rules of parole right off the bat and meeting with a free press, something that is missing in China."
He added that he, too, wanted to know the answer to that question. But now was not the time, he said, because Ms. Gao and Mr. Xue have relatives back in China.
"I'm very concerned about my family back there," Ms. Gao said. "So I've been very careful in selecting the words that I'm using."

HEADLINE: Ford Gives Its Chairman A Bigger Role 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company tweaked the delicate relationship between its chief executive and president, Jacques A. Nasser, and its chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., with a move intended to increase Mr. Ford's formal role in decision making.
 Even with the new bureaucratic wrinkle -- the establishment of an office of the chairman and chief executive -- Mr. Nasser will retain his titles and remain in charge of all day-to-day decisions. Mr. Ford will still be referred to as a nonexecutive chairman. The move comes as Ford struggles with a host of challenges. 
 "Jac and Bill discussed this jointly and brought it to the board," said James Vella, a Ford spokesman.
"The timing makes sense because the competition is strengthening and the economy is weakening," Mr. Vella added. "It's increased the pressure on decision making."
Yesterday, Ford stock slipped 41 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $25.09. The shares are down 6.2 percent over the last 52 weeks.
Under the current management structure, Mr. Ford, 44, presides over the board while Mr. Nasser, 53, runs the company, with 14 senior Ford executives reporting to him. Mr. Ford has sought a more active role, however, as the company attends to pressing matters, chiefly lagging auto sales and the continuing fallout from the dispute with the Bridgestone/Firestone Company over the failure of tires on the Ford Explorer.
Under the new arrangement, effective immediately, the senior executives will continue to report to Mr. Nasser but will periodically brief both him and Mr. Ford on a range of issues, with employee, dealer and supplier relations of particular interest to Mr. Ford. Though the move is expected to increase Mr. Ford's role in decision-making discussions, how great a change there will be is not clear.
The two men ascended to their current positions together in 1999, and have presented a unified front. But Mr. Nasser has both set the company's agenda and been its public face while Mr. Ford has kept a low profile.
Many analysts and management experts say the development underscores an already existing ambiguity in the relationship of the two men at the top of the world's largest family-controlled company. But they differed on whether the arrangement was good or bad for Ford.
Power-sharing arrangements "are fragile things and a sign of weakness," said Gerald C. Meyers, a University of Michigan professor specializing in management issues and a former chairman of the American Motors Corporation, now a part of DaimlerChrysler.
"Ordinarily," he added, "it means a company doesn't know what to do."
Mr. Meyers pointed to Citigroup's co-chief executive experiment between Sanford I. Weill and John S. Reed, which ended with Mr. Reed's departure.
"It indicates an unhappiness with what is, without coming up with a clear-cut answer," he said.
John Casesa, a Merrill Lynch analyst, said in a research note that "these changes increase the potential for management distraction at a bad time for Ford."
In his research note, Stephen J. Girsky, the auto analyst at Morgan Stanley, called the move positive. "It will allow Nasser to focus on developing, building and marketing cars, something he is very good at," Mr. Girsky wrote, adding that "the net result will be that Ford will be more involved in the business but Nasser will still be running it."
David A. Nadler, chairman of Mercer Delta Consulting, which specializes in management issues, said that because the arrangement did not mean a sharing of the chief executive role, it could work.
"The theory is that if you have two guys with different strengths, one plus one can equal more than two," Mr. Nadler said. "But if they can't work well together, then it can lead to chaos. It will be interesting to watch how it is executed."
The arrangement comes on the heels of a series of high-level personnel changes after a board meeting two weeks ago. Nicholas V. Scheele, chairman of Ford Europe, was named head of the huge North American operations, and I. Martin Inglis was named chief financial officer.
Many analysts say those changes, which become effective next Wednesday, and the latest development, are aimed at increasing the support around Mr. Nasser, who has had too many responsibilities and has lacked a strong No. 2.
"It looks to me like Nasser's gotten his wings clipped a bit," said David B. Healy of Burnham Securities. "My guess is that it will work. Nasser was spread thin."
Besides the Firestone dispute, Ford faces an aggressive move by foreign automakers, including Toyota Motor and Honda Motor, into the sport utility vehicle market that has contributed to overall erosion in vehicle sales for Ford, as well as weakening economic conditions and some quality and productivity concerns.
Mr. Ford is the great-grandson of Henry Ford, the company's founder, and also, through his mother's side, the great-grandson of Firestone's founder, Harvey S. Firestone. When he assumed his current title, it was the first time since 1979 -- when Mr. Ford's uncle, Henry Ford II, stepped down as chairman and chief executive -- that a Ford held the post of chairman.
Mr. Ford and Mr. Nasser declined to be interviewed yesterday. But in a statement, Mr. Ford said that "we face challenging times and this new structure allows both Jacques and me to work hand-in-hand to lead the company forward and meet these challenges."
And Mr. Nasser said in a statement that "this new office strengthens our working relationship and allows us to react even more quickly to address the key issues facing the business."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
Prices Up in Manhattan, But Fewer Co-ops Sell

BYLINE:  By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
The economy may be on a bumpy trail these days, but the Manhattan residential real estate market appears to be on solid footing, even as it sends out some mixed signals.
 According to two new statistical reports, prices fetched by co-ops and condominiums rose in this year's second quarter, but sales declined compared with the same period last year. The number of days properties remained on the market dropped slightly from the first quarter but remained higher than a year ago. 
 In both reports, the gap between asking and selling prices grew over the year. And even if there were fewer prospective buyers, brokers across the board lamented the lack of inventory. 
The Real Estate Board of New York prepared the data used in the quarterly findings on co-op sales it will distribute next week. Gregory J. Heym, vice president and chief economist for the board, said the data were inconsistent in some aspects.
"Layoffs are continuing to mount, with companies announcing them on a weekly basis, but the unemployment rate is still low enough so that at least here, we think the economy is O.K.," he said. "Real estate has held its value slightly better than most other investments, especially prewar buildings that are still very much in demand. 
"A lot of new home buyers are still entering the market, people whose incomes have risen dramatically in the last few years."
Compiled from figures provided by 26 firms belonging to the Real Estate Board, the report was based on data about 469 co-ops that changed hands in April, May and June, up from 441 in the first quarter but distinctly down from the 618 sold in the second quarter of 2000.
The median sales price for apartments increased in the second quarter, going to $475,000 from $440,000, but remained lower than the $530,000 reached in the third quarter of 2000.
Pointing out that sales of a handful of high-end luxury apartments could skew the totals, Mr. Heym said that prices per room were a more accurate barometer. In the second quarter, studio and one-bedroom apartments commanded a median price of $105,000 per room, up from $90,750 a year earlier; two bedrooms, $158,500 a room, up from $154,250 last year; and three bedrooms, $252,500, up from $227,273. Only in the small category of four or more bedrooms did prices fall, to $335,476 per room from $352,361 last year.
The same trends -- higher selling prices paid by fewer buyers -- surfaced in the Manhattan Market Overview released last week by Douglas Elliman and prepared by Miller Samuel, a residential appraisal company. Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, said the findings showed that the market had resiliency, although he noted that it tended to be a lagging economic indicator.
For co-ops, the median was $417,000, a 14 percent increase over the same period last year, Mr. Miller said. The median price was $365,000 in the first quarter.
In the market for condominiums, which tend to be more expensive, he said the median price was $701,500, up 11 percent from $630,000 in the previous three months and almost 10 percent more than in the same quarter last year, when the median was $640,000. "But," Mr. Miller added, "I believe the median somewhat overstates the size of the increase, since we had a falloff in the sale of smaller apartments. For the first time in the 11 years we've been tracking this, two-bedroom co-ops and condominiums comprise more than 50 percent of total sales at the expense of smaller apartments."
Mr. Miller said the most important change of the quarter was a significant drop in the number of sales, a 19 percent drop, to 1,829 apartments, from 2,257 a year earlier. Sales dropped 10 percent from the first quarter, when 2,039 apartments were sold. The figures combined both co-op and condominium sales and drew from a larger pool of data than the Real Estate Board study.
Both studies detected a tendency toward more negotiation between sellers and buyers. The average discount doubled to 4.1 percent compared with this time last year, Mr. Miller said. "But during the recession of the early 1990's," he said, "the average discount was between 15 and 20 percent, so we consider this normal."

HEADLINE: Ferrer Defines the 'Other New York,' and He Discusses His Plans to Help It 

 BODY:
 Here are excerpts of an interview with Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president and a Democratic candidate for mayor, conducted by several editors and reporters of The New York Times. The Times plans to hold similar sessions with each of the other major candidates.

Q. You've defined your constituency as something you've called "the other New York." I wonder if you would talk more about what the other New York is: Who is "the other New York"? And how is it defined? Is it defined geographically? By ethnic group? By income? By attitude?

A. In fact it's all of them. And I really appreciate the question. Because there are so many who would define "the other New York" only in terms of color. Or only in terms of class. Or only in terms of geography. In fact, it's a place where all of those things intersect. So, for example, people who find themselves unable to find a decent place to live in this city at a price they can afford live everywhere. They live in Woodside. They live on the West Side of Manhattan. They live in Throgs Neck. They live everywhere. One-point-one million children in the school system. They are not exclusively of one color, of one class. And too many of them of all colors and classes and boroughs and communities are trapped in schools that can't work, for a host of reasons. One out of four New Yorkers doesn't have health insurance, therefore no reliable access to regular health care, live everywhere. Most of them are working. They are largely white New Yorkers.
And when fear really is the defining element of the relationship between people and the police in too many places with too many people, the impact of that is widespread. It is frightening how many jurors disqualify themselves when asked the question: Do you believe police testimony? More frightening: how many jurors still harbor grave doubts but remain silent and seated and end up exonerating people who may well be legitimately bad people and should have been convicted. 
So we're paying a price for this all the way through. 

Q. You've defined this often in terms of Giuliani. And people who do not like him or do not think that he has solved their problems, addressed their needs. He won the last election by a large margin. It sounds as though you are addressing a constituency that almost by definition is a minority. Clearly you don't think so or you wouldn't be running. Would you address that?

A. Sure. If this is a tactical discussion, I'm the wrong guy to talk to about this. I can only say it from the vantage point of what I believe. So that, one, the discussion of the policies as we find them and exist now, today, can only be discussed, I think, in the context of the policymaker for the last eight years. Much in the same way that Giuliani discussed the policies of the four years that preceded him. Much in the same way that Dinkins discussed the policies of the 12 years that preceded him. And much in the same way that Koch discussed, not really the policies of the four years that preceded him but the eight years that preceded the four years. That does set the table for at least a discussion.

Q. Do you think jurors are right to distrust police testimony?

A. In some cases I think they have ample justification. Because there has been ample reason to be skeptical. And in other cases, I'm not equipped to evaluate. But I do know this: The skepticism exists. And that is undeniable. I mean that is beyond debate. That it exists is a fact. That it exists in an almost widespread way today is a fact.

Q. But do you think police routinely perjure in the cases?

A. No.

Q. What is the other side of the other New York? In other words, not, in your view, the other New York? Is it Giuliani supporters or who?

A. No, I don't define them that way. There's a New York that works very well and it exists everywhere too. No, this works for me. I have health insurance, my child is getting a great education either in a public school or in a private school, I can pay the rent, I can pay the mortgage.

Q. I think you suggested . . . raises, you want to have after-school programs. . . How do you -- it seems that what you're hinting at is to make life better for the other New York, you're going to tax the other-other New York.

A. I'm not hinting that. And ----

Q. Well, then how else do you pay for it?

A. Well, that's a good question that I hope you will ask everyone because I haven't proposed any initiatives -- any -- where I haven't said where this money will come from. I have not said, for example, I will do this. And how will you pay for it? I'll find the money. That's trying to have it both ways and I think that's -- that's simply singularly lacking in candor. So that, for example, when I propose an after-school program I would tell people how I'd pay for it. When I propose a radical change in negotiating the teacher contract, which includes three essential principles: One, The reform of due process such that the system now and its supervisory personnel may say goodbye to unfit and unqualified teachers, two ----

Q. I don't understand that. You want to make it easier to do that?

A. Oh yes, absolutely. Immediately.

Q. How could you justify taking out 30 percent for however much is needed to raise salaries?

A. Well, it's not the whole 30 percent out of that budget. But I've -- here's where I think Giuliani is more than partially right. There are enormous opportunities for savings in the central administration and in the administration of community school districts. I, for example, have proposed for 18 years the elimination of community school boards. That is truly redundant.

Q. But to send teachers to school during the summer and to give them 30 percent raises, do you have a cost estimate of how much that's --

A. Yes. We laid it out at about $1.1 billion.

Q. Do you think over a billion, or how much of that, do you think, could come from savings in the central administration.

A. In fact, I've laid that out. I believe that there are opportunities in the central administration to pull out about 250 or even more million dollars. Now, in conversations with people at the board, their budget and number and program people, since I made that speech, all of them privately admit to me, you're not wrong. But I know their budget. And in fact, it has bloated.
I believe the mayor also has to be a leader in securing funds, more state aid as a result of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity lawsuit. That's why I was a party to the lawsuit. It didn't strike me as a shock that our system's been cheated over 20 years. We have known that. And in fact, when you compare our system to suburban systems, the facts are pretty clear even though they are widely deniable, but they are clear. They're demonstrable and they're beyond dispute, really.
And then finally, there are economies we have to wring out of this budget. Now, let me give you an example of -- and I put the economies systemwide to over -- a little over $300 million, and here's where I would get it from: from personnel as well as from contracts for service. It would be zero-based. A complete bottom-to-top evaluation of every contract for service. 

Q. You used the word radical ----

A. Yes.

Q. ---- to describe your ideas about schools. But listening to you they sound quite modest compared to proposals that are around elsewhere, and I mean from other candidates.

A. Is reforming due process for teachers not radical?

Q. Well, sure, I don't think so. I think it's an adjustment ----

A. Oh, good, why hasn't it been done?

Q. Well, that's a fair question. But many more radical things are in the air in the national education debate: vouchers ----

A. I'm glad to talk about those things as well.

Q. Tell us where the radicalism is in your -- --

A. I tried. Maybe it's not -- maybe it's not -- maybe it is not radical to reform due process for teachers, to impose teacher accountability, to extend the year, to really make sure that we get qualified and trained -- a consistently trained teacher. Maybe it's not. But if it is not and if it's pretty commonplace and hackneyed, it certainly hasn't been done in this city before.

Q. Merit pay.

A. Yeah, merit pay. Well let's examine merit pay for a second. I'm very happy to do that. You know, it sounds good and everybody tells me: merit pay. Oh, yeah, that's intuitive, isn't it. Except for one thing: it presupposes the retention of poor performers. So what do you do about the poor performers? Oh, we reward the big performers. It's an economic free market incentive here. Huh? Well, no. What do you do about the poor performers? Well the poor performers will get the idea and then leave. O.K., what happens, then, to the truly marginal who were in front of class after class of New York City public-school children? What happens to those kids? That's not radical. That's dumb.

Q. Freddy, what about housing? You've said that in 10 years . . . 150,000 new units of housing are built. Which would be revolutionary if you were to manage that. I mean, where do you find the money to do that and isn't that billions and billions of dollars?

A. I think we are going to need a 10-year program with a payout of a lot less than that in order to give our capital budget some degree of credibility and so that we can continue to respond to capital needs in this city over the longer term. So here's what I believe is necessary. I got the original agreement between Cuomo and Koch on the Battery Park City proceeds. That has to be redirected toward housing. And everybody else has come up with the same thing about the property tax anticipated revenues in the sale of the World Trade Center. And I think that has to be segregated toward housing. And there are other things that I have proposed as well. But those two together make for over a billion dollars in working capital on an annual basis, pay for administration of the program. And this is very serious stuff that it leverages. And it also gives us the ability to re-stream revenue that generates from this back, keep it in housing, to bring down, to prepay principal and interest. So this is not a 10-year production program with a 40-year price tag.

Q. How is it that you're going to be able to do what you want to do with the Board of Education, with housing at a time when city revenues appear to be slightly declining or at least flat, and you potentially would become a mayor at a time when there's retrenchment and sort of what Giuliani first inherited? I mean, are you prepared for that kind of a potential situation?

A. Of course, the Financial Control Board has warned of that. They have said, at the risk of introducing yet a new theater in this operation, the Financial Control Board has warned that as we're shrinking in revenue, for two reasons -- one, we're cutting it ourselves, but the other reason is the market simply will not generate all of this excess revenue to the city.
Then we're going to be faced with interesting choices. That's why I said almost at the outset of this conversation that if someone's going to propose an initiative, you've got to say how you're going to pay for it. And if the choice is going to be raising taxes or cutting services, you better say which. Now, I have in every initiative that I've discussed with you. Now, some might say, oh, that's irresponsible to say that. Well, then what do you want? Do you want somebody to say, yes, I believe in this and I'm for it, but I'm not going to tell you how to pay for it, trust me.

Q. Do you support a tax increase for either your education initiative, the $1.1 billion, or for the housing . . . we're talking about?

A. I don't think it is necessary.

Q. You ruling it out?

A. I don't think it is necessary. And The Times story got it right about what I was proposing for the personal income tax surcharge. It's a one-and-a-half-point reduction in the surcharge, easy to figure out what it means to a family in a certain income group, and easy to figure out -- this is -- and by the way, I've been saying it for months, since the mayor proposed it, as you know. All of you have heard me say it at mayoral forums, this is not new. I said it ----

Q. Go ahead.

A. ---- I said it at the Crain's breakfast. So when I said it at Wall Street everybody was reaching for oxygen. You know, I mean, excuse me? I've been consistent in my criticism of that tax reduction: One, it is trivial. If someone's going to make the case to me that four pennies a day for the average working family is really going to stimulate the economy, I have yet to hear the argument. Although, four cents a day, and then going up the scale -- I mean, if you make a half a million dollars a year, it's $1.47 a day -- will more than twice over pay for an afterschool initiative. And I believe in asking people, what would you rather have? And people overwhelmingly tell me, whether they're parents with kids in the schools or not, I'd rather have after-school programs in this city.

Q. Could you give us, to ask a question another way, some insights into what your priorities would be for cuts if, in fact, the economy dictated that you either had to raise taxes or cut, or maybe a combination of both? You don't want to talk about raising taxes so tell us what your priorities would be if you had to do what Ed Koch had to do and what David Dinkins had to do, you had to come out with a budget proposal and say, all right, here's what we're going to cut.

A. I think a --

Q. It could happen.

A. Yes, it could and I've been around for a few of those. One, you cut contracts for service, you begin to look at all of them. Zero-based. What services are we contracting out for? What can we do in-house? What should we be doing in-house? What contracts for service are absolutely necessary?

Q. Give us an idea.

A. Yeah, I was going to do that. From agency to agency and the Human Resources Administration do we really need a $300- or $400-million contract to tell us how to train people leaving welfare and trying to enter the world of work, or should we just train them?

Q. May I ask a political question here? You had sort of an interesting and rocky time four years ago when you were running. I'm wondering what lessons you learned from that and whether or not you're paying a price for your withdrawal from that race in this year's race, politically speaking.

A. Well, the lesson I learned from it is you can't run for mayor without raising all the money you need. That's the essential lesson. Other than that, the conditions are pretty much as they are. I had, I think, the money to take me to the final stages of the primary, but not to the finish line. And I would have been completely broke for the main event. And, as you know, people were just not coming across with the kinds of resources that you needed to run, especially to face a refreshed Republican incumbent who was sitting on $11 million. We didn't have a campaign finance law in place then that evened the playing field. This one does. I like it.

HEADLINE: Council Approves a Zoning Plan To Revitalize Long Island City 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
The City Council approved a rezoning plan for Long Island City yesterday to allow high-rise development within a 37-block area of low-slung buildings and to attract commercial tenants that might otherwise be tempted to move their back offices to Jersey City.
 The central business district proposal, passed on a vote of 31 to 0 with 10 abstaining, drew opposition from manufacturers that fear being squeezed out by rising real estate values. As a compromise, city officials agreed to come up with a program to help preserve Long Island City's 17,000 manufacturing jobs. 
 Joseph B. Rose, the director of the Department of City Planning, said the rezoning plan was carefully drawn so as to have a minimal effect on existing manufacturing operations. To protect manufacturers, the city turned down a number of property owners who wanted their buildings to be in the new district, he said.
The new district, which would allow a mix of commercial, residential, community and light manufacturing uses, is in western Queens. It is bounded roughly by the Sunnyside railroad yards on the east, 23rd and 21st Streets on the west and 41st Avenue on the north. The Planning Commission said that as much as five million square feet of new space could be created. The city recently began offering incentives to companies moving there from Manhattan.
One company that is considering moving most of its Manhattan employees to Long Island City is the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, which is negotiating for the site of a former automobile factory at 27-01 Bridge Plaza North. Also ripe for development are a municipal garage at Jackson Avenue and Queens Plaza South and a large vacant warehouse at 23rd Street and Jackson Avenue, said Walter L. McCaffrey, a City Council member from Queens and the chairman of the subcommittee on zoning and franchises.
Mr. McCaffrey said that only about 1,000 manufacturing jobs fall within the newly rezoned area. He said that the manufacturers had been assured that they would get some form of aid. The program for the manufacturers will be included in the October modifications to the city budget, said Mr. McCaffrey, who would not disclose how much it was likely to cost.
Dakota Jackson, a manufacturer of upscale furniture who has operated a plant within the new district since 1977, said that the rezoning would not affect him because he has a 10-year lease. But he said that his company had had good relationships with small subcontractors in the neighborhood that it called on for everything from metalwork to wood supplies.
"A lot of these companies are going to go out of business," he said. "We'll be forced to deal with companies in other places, where these types of relationships won't be in play."

HEADLINE: THEATER GUIDE

Broadway

++ "42ND STREET" (Tony Award for best revival of a musical). There's nothing like precision tap-dancing to turn an audience into a lab full of case studies for Dr. Pavlov. Witness this opulent revival, directed by Mark Bramble and choreographed by Randy Skinner, in which every other production number has us beating our flippers together like the seals at feeding time. A largely labored resurrection of the last musical staged by the fabled Gower Champion, inspired by the classic 1933 movie, the show features Harry Warren and Al Dubin's priceless Depression-era songs, Michael Cumpsty as a tyrannical director, and an extremely enjoyable Christine Ebersole (Tony winner for best actress in a musical) as his tyrannical star. Otherwise the evening's charms are largely limited to its full-strength tapping. Those seeking a backstage musical that wears its personality above its ankles may want to revisit "Kiss Me, Kate" (2:30). Ford, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $90 (Ben Brantley).

* "MAJOR BARBARA." The Roundabout Theater Company's elegant, eloquent and very funny production of Shaw's 1905 play sending up the societal worship of money -- and the convolutions of logic that defend it -- is less of an interpretation than a celebration of the playwright's winking, topsy-turvy didactics on the subjects of politics, poverty and faith. In a world where spin-doctoring has become the rule in public discourse, inoffensiveness is prized and forthrightness has become suspicious, Shaw's notion that the rhetoric that protects a system of Darwinian economics is a hypocrisy has only gained in relevance. And the director Daniel Sullivan, whose strength is in crystallizing the dramatic voice of the playwright, has made Shaw's tasty ironies crystal clear, so that with a first-rate cast led by Cherry Jones, Dana Ivey and the British actor David Warner, making his American stage debut, the star of the show is the playwright himself (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $65 (Bruce Weber).

* "THE PRODUCERS" (winner of 12 Tony Awards). How do you single out highlights in a bonfire? Anyone who sees this sublimely ridiculous show is going to be hard pressed to name a favorite moment. (Is it the singing pigeons? Adolf Hitler doing Judy Garland?) Mel Brooks's wildly energetic stage adaptation of his 1968 cult movie is as full of gags, gadgets and gimmicks as a master vaudevillian's trunk. But the production is so much more than the sum of its gorgeously silly parts. It is, to put it simply, the real thing: a big Broadway book musical so ecstatically drunk on its powers to entertain that it leaves you delirious, too. With the assistance of the director and choreographer Susan Stroman and the happiest cast in town, led by Nathan Lane (Tony winner for best actor in a musical) and Matthew Broderick in the performances of their careers, Mr. Brooks has put on a show that is a valentine to every show there is, good and bad, about putting on a show (2:45). St. James, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $30 to $100; extremely limited (Brantley).

* "PROOF" (Tonys for best play and direction of a play). An exhilarating, assured new play by David Auburn that turns the esoteric world of higher mathematics literally into a back-porch drama, as accessible and compelling as a detective story. A mystery about the authorship of a particularly important proof, it is also about twin enigmas: genius and love. Without any baffling erudition, the play presents mathematicians as both blessed and bedeviled by the gift for abstraction that ties them achingly to one another and separates them, also achingly, from concrete-minded folks like you and me. Perhaps most satisfying, it does so without a moment of meanness. Directed by Daniel Sullivan with the pace of a psychological thriller and performed by an exemplary cast, most notably Mary-Louise Parker (Tony winner for best actress in a play), the play reaches into the most competitive and difficult intellectual terrain and finds -- guess what? -- good people (2:00). Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets, $19 to $69 (Weber).

+ "STONES IN HIS POCKETS." Watching Sean Campion or Conleth Hill take a step forward is an exercise in suspense: when his foot touches the floor, it is entirely possible that he will no longer be the sex, age or nationality that he was a second before. These two human Etch-a-Sketches, the entire cast of Marie Jones's play about an American film crew in an Irish village, offer overwhelming evidence that there are special effects the movies will never do better than the theater does. It should be noted, however, that the pleasures of "Stones" are less literary than kinetic. Its satire of those superficial, egomaniacal folk who make movies is awfully familiar stuff. And Ms. Jones burdens an essentially comic play with a thudding tragic center. The evening's joys come from its two actors splitting like amoebas into different personalities (2:20). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $30 to $70 (Brantley).

+ "A THOUSAND CLOWNS." Herb Gardner's comedy about Murray Burns, an eccentric in rebellion against the social conformity bred in the Eisenhower 50's, is a painfully dated work. But that is not the only reason this revival is very nearly unendurable. Directed with a surprising paucity of invention by the gifted and ordinarily energetic John Rando ("The Dinner Party," "Urinetown"), this is a by-the-numbers production paced at a dogged slog. Usually these are characteristics of a show constrained by inexperience, and the guess here is that Mr. Rando is a victim of the problem he was saddled with: what to do with Tom Selleck, the once-hunky, once-mustached television detective making his stage debut at age 56, wildly miscast and out of his league in the central role (2:30). Longacre, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 and $77.50 (Weber).

Off Broadway

*+ "BLUE WINDOW." A discomfiting but finally touching revival of Craig Lucas's 1984 play, an achy comedy that considers the notion that the deepest kind of loneliness may well be inescapable because it has a lot to do with bad luck and bad timing. A well-acted ensemble piece, it has at its center a disastrous dinner party, the sort of oil-and-water gathering that many New Yorkers will recognize and hope never to attend again. Most of the guests don't know one another, everybody's social timing is off and all the individual temperaments run askew. In the scene that sets the tone of the show, just before the guests arrive, Libby, the hostess, suffers a misfortune that is as hilarious as it is humiliating, and watching her cope with it during the party makes you giggle with heartbreak. The result for the audience is a "there but for the grace -of God" experience (1:30). 28th Street Theater, 120 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-1515. Mondays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m. Tickets, $40 (Weber).

* "FOUR." Despite its rap as the hottest of the deadly sins, lust can be a chillingly lonely feeling. Like the randy teenagers of summer make-out movies, the quartet of likable, confused people in this short, pungently acted drama by Christopher Shinn are all out to score on one steamy Fourth of July. They all, as the phrase goes, get lucky, though lucky is clearly not how they're feeling as the evening ends. Mr. Shinn was just 23 when "Four" first opened at the Royal Court Theater in London several years ago, and the work throbs with an adolescent anguish and self-consciousness. But it is also tempered by a sober, precocious empathy that can embrace a varied scope of humanity without turning characters into types. "Four," a Worth Street Company production directed by Jeff Cohen, has its raw spots. But Mr. Shinn, an American whose work has been lauded in London but rarely seen in New York, has a confident hand for pattern and structure that doesn't smother spontaneity (1:30). TriBeCa Playhouse, 111 Reade Street, (212) 206-1515. Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 5 p.m. Tickets, $45 (Brantley).

"A LIFE." When people are driven to describe Desmond Drumm, they call this severely repressed lifelong Irish civil servant things like "a bitter old pill." In Hugh Leonard's comic drama "A Life," Drumm has a habit of correcting people and telling them exactly what he thinks of them. That, he tells himself, is because he is honest, unhypocritical, a man of superior intelligence who maintains standards. But as this wisely entertaining play by the author of "Da" begins at the Irish Repertory Theater, Drumm, played by Fritz Weaver, leading an excellent cast, has reason to reassess his life. He has just been told that cancer has condemned him to six months to live. Drumm may be a man who tends to alienate all around him, but amid the colorful characters and wit in "A Life," he is the catalyst for an enjoyable evening of theater (2:15). Irish Repertory, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 and $40 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

* "MUSIC FROM A SPARKLING PLANET." Watching Douglas Carter Beane's nimble escapist comedy about escapism is like sinking into a frozen margarita. This sentimental satire about three aging young men in search of a television star from their childhood is sweet and mildly inebriating. If you find that it eventually turns to mush, that probably won't stop you from enjoying it until the last syrupy drop. "Planet," a Drama Dept. production, reunites the key players from Mr. Beane's popular "As Bees in Honey Drown," including the director, Mark Brokaw, and its delightful star, J. Smith-Cameron. The evening's chief pleasures are its fine-tuned pacing and its verbal agility. Scratch the surface, and you may find something like a heart-tugging sitcom episode beneath. But hey, it's high summer, a time when the scratching of surfaces, especially as attractive as this one, is unwonted labor (2:00). Greenwich House, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $35 (Brantley).

+ "TICK, TICK . . . BOOM!" Two round numbers, 30 and 90, glare ominously in this chamber piece from Jonathan Larson, the creator of the rock musical "Rent." Mr. Larson turned 30 in 1990, and in this self-conscious self-portrait in song he gave vent to his concern that time was running out on him. Given that the composer died of an aortic aneurysm at 35, you might expect a slightly prurient morbidity. As directed by Scott Schwartz and performed by Raul Esparza, Amy Spanger and Jerry Dixon, the show emerges as an amiable public exercise in soul searching. Compared with "Rent," it feels small and conventional. But if you look at it as a sort of sketchbook for that Broadway hit, "Tick" has its gentle fascination, while reminding us of what an infectiously tuneful composer Larson could be (1:30). Jane Street Theater, 113 Jane Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sundays at 7 p.m. Tickets, $30 to $50 (Brantley).

Last Chance

+ "CHAUCER IN ROME." Portraying a pair of guilt-crippled American tourists in Rome in John Guare's new play, Polly Holliday and Dick Latessa give off the harsh clarity of certain black-and-white photographs. (Think of Walker Evans's Depression-era portraits filtered through Diane Arbus's eye for the inner freak.) What surrounds these sharp characterizations, however, feels like a disproportionately large, garish frame, the kind made out of shellacked seashells, perhaps. Unless you look closely, you can't see the pictures, which are truly haunting, for the gaudiness. Much of "Chaucer" is a flashy, lazy satire on the contemporary art world. And though the production has been staged with elegance and efficiency by Nicholas Martin, there's the unmistakable feeling of old circus tricks being dragged out by its author. Jon Tenney, Carrie Preston and Bruce Norris make the best of the sketchily drawn central roles (1:45). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Through Sunday. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets, $55 (Brantley).

+++ "ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST" (Tony for best revival of a play). Resurrecting this adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel about wild and crazy guys cutting up in a mental institution would seem perfect for Steppenwolf, the Chicago-based theater company with the kick of a triple espresso. Yet despite a full-throttle performance from its leading man, Gary Sinise, this show mostly feels just cute instead of confrontational. It painstakingly restores the fablelike, schematic simplicity of Dale Wasserman's script, an aspect largely erased from Milos Forman's 1975 film version. And under Terry Kinney's direction, the assorted inmates are as cozy a coterie of eccentrics as the barflies of "Cheers." The talented Amy Morton has the thankless role of the emasculating Nurse Ratchet, while Mr. Sinise becomes a white-hot perpetual-motion machine as McMurphy, the anarchic role model for adolescent boys of all ages (2:35). Royale, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Through Sunday. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $30 to $75 (Brantley).

+ "WORLD OF MIRTH." Sweeney the clown, the central figure in Murphy Guyer's vinegary melodrama, belongs to one of storytelling's time-honored tribes. Presiding over the midway of a run-down carnival, he's a bitter Bozo, a compulsively condescending philosopher drunk, with a bilious wit and a strychnine laugh. The carnival is known as Kaspar Kelly's World of Mirth, and all the unsubtle ironies apply. The workers are desperate, the management is corrupt and the business itself is besieged with problems, not the least of which is that one of its employees and attractions has just drowned himself. The circumstances of the death are fraught with perverse hilarity, and so, at its best, is this play, which is, alas, more often concerned with proving a self-evident dictum: life is not a carnival (2:20). Theater Four, 424 West 55th Street, (212) 239-6200. Through Sunday. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets, $50 (Weber).

HEADLINE: Moody's Lowers Argentina's Credit Ratings 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, July 26 

 BODY:
Argentina's credit ratings were lowered for a second time this month by Moody's Investors Service on concern that the country will not be able to erase its budget deficit to help ensure debt payments. 
 Moody's reduced Argentina's foreign and local currency debt ratings to Caa1, seven levels below investment grade and the same as Pakistan and Moldova. 
 The downgrade is the latest setback to the efforts of the economy minister, Domingo Cavallo, to restore investor confidence that the country can meet payments on its $130 billion debt by balancing the budget. The government's plan to shore up finances through salary and pension cuts has met opposition from legislators and union workers. 
"The measures put in place so far by the government are all temporary," said David Rossmiller, head of global fixed income at the Bankers Trust Company in New York. "Default and devaluation is the most likely scenario." 
The Senate delayed a vote Wednesday night on the spending cut plan until Tuesday, renewing concerns that the government lacks the support to pass the cuts into law. The benchmark stock index fell 8.2 points, or 2.5 percent, to a one-week low of 322.08.

HEADLINE: Philip Morris Issues Apology For Czech Study on Smoking 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Philip Morris Companies officially apologized yesterday for a study commissioned last month by an international affiliate that found that the Czech Republic benefited financially from the premature deaths of smokers.
 "For one of our tobacco companies to commission this study was not just a terrible mistake, it was wrong," Philip Morris said in a statement. "All of us at Philip Morris, no matter where we work, are extremely sorry for this. No one benefits from the very real, serious and significant diseases caused by smoking." 
 Last month, company officials distributed an economic analysis in the Czech Republic that concluded that cigarettes were not a drain on the country's budget, in part because the government saved money on health care, pensions and housing when smokers died prematurely. The study was prepared by Arthur D. Little International.
Though the report has been met with outrage in the United States, reaction in the Czech Republic was nonchalant.
Philip Morris, based in New York, has sent a letter of apology to the Czech Republic's health minister and to the head of Parliament, a company spokeswoman said yesterday.
The report, which was commissioned to examine the economics associated with excise taxes, continues to garner public attention. An ad speaking out against the report, sponsored by a Washington-based anti-smoking group, the American Legacy Foundation, has appeared in newspapers across the country.
The ad depicts the foot of a cadaver with a toe tag that reads: "$1,227 -- That's how much a study sponsored by Philip Morris said the Czech Republic saves on health care, pensions and housing every time a smoker dies."
Matthew Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a statement, "Without action to back up its words, one has to question what Philip Morris really regrets: the report's callous conclusions or the damage done to Philip Morris's efforts to portray itself as a reformed, responsible company."
Philip Morris said that it sincerely regretted the report and that the financing and release of the study "exhibited terrible judgment as well as a complete and unacceptable disregard of basic human values."
Similar studies were done in Europe about 10 years ago, but other studies in the planning stages have been stopped.
"This is not something that we should be doing, and we won't do it again," the spokeswoman said.
The study was commissioned by the Czech affiliate of Philip Morris International. Philip Morris International and Philip Morris U.S.A. have said that their headquarters were not notified of the report.
The spokeswoman said that the president of Philip Morris International, John R. Nelson, planned to communicate formally with his management team on the issue.
"I regret this mistake and I ask our entire management team to be more vigilant on these issues in the future," Mr. Nelson said in a memorandum issued to the unit's employees at the end of last week.
Shares of Philip Morris ended yesterday down 48 cents, at $44.20, after dipping as low as $43.25 earlier. The shares have fallen less than 1 percent since news of the report first appeared on July 16.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Requires Prudential To Refund $25 Million to Drivers 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, July 26 

 BODY:
The Prudential Group, which insures just under 325,000 vehicles in New Jersey, has been ordered by the state to mail $25.1 million in refunds this fall to its policyholders. An audit of the company's returns showed that it had exceeded the state's 6 percent profit cap for 1998, 1999 and 2000. 
 The refund proved that the complaints of many insurers that they cannot make money under state regulations are unfounded, said Karen L. Suter, the state commissioner of banking and insurance, in a statement announcing the refunds on Wednesday. 
 "What we are seeing is the reflection of renewed competition among insurers, where some are winners and some are losers," Ms. Suter said. "Insurers point to losers as evidence that the market is failing and, through fear tactics, they hope to cut back on the protection designed to help consumers find insurance."
A Prudential spokeswoman said the company did not dispute that it had exceeded state-set profit limits, which require that a company's combined margin over three consecutive years not exceed an average of 6 percent.
"We consider the excess-profit regulation to be part of doing business in New Jersey," Laurita Warner, the spokeswoman, said today. "We are here, we are committed to staying here, so we are getting ready to send out those refunds." 
The refunds will be mailed out in September, Ms. Warner said, and will average $77.
Prudential's acquiescence to the state rules, and its commitment to remaining in the state, stand in contrast to the experience of the State Farm Indemnity Company. According to a spokesman for the Department of Banking and Insurance, Peter Hartt, State Farm repaid $41 million in excess profits in 1997 and $38 million in 1998. Shortly afterward the company began negotiating with the state for a rate increase. The talks ended in June with the company announcing that it would stop writing policies in New Jersey. 
The company's Web site criticizes New Jersey's heavily regulated market and includes a quotation from a 1991 book on auto insurance reform that said of New Jersey's system: "Even the Soviet Union would be hard pressed to match this economic disaster."

HEADLINE: A Senator's Own Brand Of Seven-League Boots 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
His daughter Jessica tells him not to get hit by any cars. His wife, Iris Weinshall, perhaps out of love and perhaps because she is the New York City Commissioner of Transportation, orders him to put on his safety helmet.
 With a smile as big as Brooklyn, Senator Charles E. Schumer wheels his bicycle from its home in the family living room. He is on one of his almost-weekly adventures: tooling around the city he loves, turning left when he sees something in one direction, right when something else catches his eye, going straight ahead just to feel the sun and wind on his face. He wheels through neighborhoods and boroughs, seldom glancing at his crumpled map -- not that he doesn't need it. 
 But in this he follows a hallowed Brooklyn tradition. In his short story "Only the Dead Know Brooklyn," Thomas Wolfe wrote: " 'Map or no map,' I says, 'you ain't gonna get to know Brooklyn with no map.' " 
In Mr. Schumer's home, an expansive apartment on Prospect Park West in a building where former Gov. Hugh L. Carey once lived, bicycles occupy the most prominent spot, the living room. It is used almost solely as a parking lot for the family's four bikes.
The senator's is a handsome, shining blue mountain bike with an imperfection or two: he picked it up for $75 four years ago at Toys "R" Us. Who cares if there is no water bottle holder or a gauge to tell what gear you're in?
"This is a reject," he said with the pride of a New Yorker who thinks he got a deal. (Mind you, this is a man known to cut his own hair to save money and time.)
Bicycle riding has become the middle-aged passion of the 50-year-old senator, who, except for attending Harvard and working in Washington, has lived his whole life in Brooklyn. He measures the stages of his youth by the sizes of his bikes, and counts the English bicycle that he was given in the fifth grade as one of his life's true blessings.
Bikes continued to be his chosen mode of transportation in college, but then he kind of forgot them ("I guess when I got married and had kids"). He switched to basketball for exercise. But then his knees started hurting. He tried to jog, but that hurt even more. A couple of years before he was elected to the Senate, in 1998, he began venturing into Prospect Park to do some loops around the main drive. Felt good.
Mr. Schumer next rode his bike over the Brooklyn Bridge, something he had always wanted to do ("Exhilarating!").
Next he rode down the bikeway on Ocean Parkway, the oldest urban path in the nation built expressly for bicycles, to Coney Island. Then he almost doubled that 13-mile round trip by returning on the bikeway adjacent to Shore Parkway along Upper and Lower New York Bay, loving the salty air.
It was good exercise, though his enthusiasm for finding perfect hot dogs and hoagies balanced any possible weight reduction. It was a way to talk with people -- read "voters" -- although he quickly realized he would need to bicycle hundreds of miles to meet the number of people he could address at a single event.
This tireless self-promoter may still regret not campaigning as he cycles. But he found something even more important. "This is my island of peace," he pronounced.
A couple of Sundays ago, Mr. Schumer set off on his favorite kind of ride, one where he picks a neighborhood or two and selects a general direction. A cardinal rule is never to set a rigid time frame in advance. "You'll ruin it if you try to do it in 45 minutes or an hour and a half," he said.
It is an approach he learned inadvertently as he rode to see his parents, who live in Glen Oaks, Queens, near the Nassau County border. He got lucky and got lost. He discovered he loved cruising through neighborhoods he had never seen. Other times, when exercise is the main thing, he will choose a destination and just ride and ride. Not uncommonly, the goal is food: the destination of his rides to Breezy Point, on the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, is invariably Kennedy's, a seaside restaurant.

Well-Worn Tire Tracks
Mr. Schumer has actually latched on to a great New York tradition. The velocipede, an early bicycle with a large front wheel, was the fad of 1886, and in the 1890's biking was so popular that 53 bicycle clubs sprouted. In the Depression, affordable two-wheeled vehicles returned to Park Avenue for the first time since the 90's.
But gradually and all too relentlessly, the conditions for biking deteriorated, and by the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, the city could not even afford to fill potholes, much less promote new bike lanes. In 1990 Bicycling magazine named New York one of the nation's three worst cycling cities.
But this summer may bring a rebirth of the bike. Bike lanes now makes it possible for people to ride from the tip of Manhattan to the George Washington Bridge, a dazzling ride that Mr. Schumer has already taken a half-dozen times. Bike paths have been built or repaved from the Bronx to Jamaica Bay: 126.5 miles are being added to the existing 51.5 miles of trails exclusively for bikes.
Moreover, the city's vast subway system allows cyclists to return from their trips for the price of a $1.50 token. Mr. Schumer likes to ride north on Broadway through Harlem to 207th Street in Inwood and take the A train home. The wonderful bottom line is that riding a bike is becoming one of a tough city's real treats.

The Lure of a Sandwich
As the senator set out for northern Brooklyn the other day, he had only one specific destination, Mamma Maria's Salumeria, a superb Italian deli in Williamsburg. Jessica had begged him to pick up her favorite, a prosciutto hero. While we were wheeling our bikes to the street, a woman scurried up. She had recognized the senator and immediately launched into a sad story about the bad care her father is receiving in a veterans' hospital.
He was appropriately sympathetic, but afterward insisted that he was grateful that many people did not recognize him in his helmet. Sometimes, the politician further insisted, he did not even identify himself. On one occasion a few miles down the road, when he asked directions of a pedestrian, this was proved true. 
Mr. Schumer proceeded down the Eastern Parkway bike path, which was rebuilt about five years ago and is characterized by beautiful shade trees. He turned left on Bedford Avenue, heading north through Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Just as the senator was saying how much he liked dropping in uninvited at black church services, exuberant gospel music exploded into the sunshine. The Church of the Nazarene, at the intersection of Bedford Avenue and Madison Street, was having an outdoor tent revival across the street. He stopped to watch the arm-waving, swaying, joyous worshippers.
"I spend more time in black churches than I do in synagogues," he said happily.
Soon, a woman emerged to shake his hand. Upon figuring out who he was, she mentioned that the church needed a new basement. "We used to have a soup kitchen there, and we can't have it anymore," she said.
Her elected representative promised to get on the case. Everybody hugged him. "Let's roll," the senator said.
"Isn't this great?" he said as we again glided along. "This is what I love to do."

On Familiar Ground
He spoke about politics, his beloved Yankees and his two daughters. (Jessica is 16 and Alison 12.) He talked about the time he played former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in basketball and won, an assertion guaranteed to be disputed. At Park Place, he pointed to Jack Prezant's auto repair shop and said that was where his dad had his car fixed. He said he had forgotten to point out his father's own office a few blocks back, one of many geographic touchstones to his life that he often passes by bike.
That brought up his reason for going into politics. His father, Abe, had hated his job as an exterminator. Sunday nights would find him in a nervous sweat as he dreaded going to work the next day. Mr. Schumer said he felt a similar squeamishness after accepting a job as a corporate lawyer upon finishing Harvard Law School. So he went into politics, which he correctly predicted he would love.
"I have two great things in my life," he said. "I love going to work on Monday, and I love coming home on Friday."
But during his workaday life in Washington, he doesn't bicycle, though he is thinking he might start. If he can find another $75 bargain bike, he suspects that it might hasten the process.
But Washington will never be like this. We are now going through the heart of Williamsburg's Hasidic community, made up largely of members of the Satmar group who fled Eastern Europe after the Holocaust. Just three blocks earlier, the neighborhood was African-American; for six more it will be Hasidic, and then it will be Spanish and then Polish.
"The enormity of the city is amazing," Mr. Schumer said.

Even Room for Yuppies
We went in circles under the Williamsburg Bridge, then passed the Peter Luger restaurant, which Mr. Schumer says makes the planet's best steaks, bar none. He wavered, but decided to press onward to Mamma Mia's, recalling Jessica's hero need. He delightedly spots well-dressed young people out for a stroll.
"Hasidim, Hispanic and now this," he exclaimed. "Yuppies!"
For a long while, he circled around the tree-lined blocks of Williamsburg. Could he be lost? He spotted people standing in the middle of the street and correctly assumed it was a block party. It turned out to be people celebrating the last day of the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and the Feast of St. Paulinus of Nola.
These occasions have become famous because of the 80-foot-tall giglio that participants carry through the streets. Mr. Schumer announced his arrival by saying, "I'm just biking around north Brooklyn today."
Msgr. David Cassalo answered, "God bless you."
The participants ate sandwiches, sipped wine and seemed happy. Benny, known as Capo No. 1 for his role as chief organizer, held the stub of a cigar and was in charge. He thought it was a good idea for the senator to eat a sandwich. He did.
"The feast has held the neighborhood very strong," Benny said.
Mr. Schumer answered, "You bet."

To the Deli at Last
Armed with directions, he rolled directly to Mamma Maria's at 357 Graham Avenue, at Conselyea Street. He was known to one and all even before he took off his helmet, which he is somehow convinced does not make him look like Michael Dukakis driving a tank. The guy behind the counter handed him a sliver of Genoa salami.
He is named Cono, as is almost everybody in the immediate neighborhood, for reasons both geographic and obscure. Some people spoke Italian. A picture of the 1990 Italian soccer team was on the wall. A woman asked Mr. Schumer to say hello for her to Trent Lott, the Senate Minority Leader.
"Trent is a lovely guy," he answered.
They gave him his sandwich for nothing, so he thrust a handful of bills into the counterman's hand, insisting that they be given to a Catholic charity.
The heroes were truly enormous. "They ask me why I don't lose weight on this job," he said. "I'd have to bike 5,000 miles in a week to lose weight."
He was back on the street, half trying. Williamsburg turns into Greenpoint, which spurred the senator to recall his efforts to aid immigration. "Probably none of them know I'm responsible," he said regretfully, referring to the streets chock full of Polish immigrants. Combined with the tenements, the visual effect of being on Manhattan Avenue is like seeing a movie set of 19th-century New York.
Mr. Schumer was clearly having a ball. "I never saw this church," he said. "I never saw that park. Look at this little street."
The sheer size of the new Polish community became apparent at Greenpoint's largest church, St. Stanislaus Kostka, at Humboldt Street and Driggs Avenue -- also known as Pope John Paul II Square. The doors of the church were all open so the scores of people on the street could hear the priest's prayers. Even across the street, people, most quite young, were kneeling.
An altar boy came outside to pass the basket.
"Most of these people probably don't know it, but they're here because of the Schumer visas," the senator said, hitting on what politicians call "the talking point."

Getting Happily Lost
The subject changed, most likely because we were again lost. It made absolutely no difference. We curled through the streets and checked out the debris left from the implosion of Keyspan Energy's two mammoth gas tanks from Maspeth Avenue.
Mr. Schumer suggested the once-Irish neighborhood was the birthplace of the celebrated New York accent in which tree is the number between two and four. Jeintz as the name of the pro football team is also, for good or ill, a Greenpernt legacy, by senatorial theory.
We found ourselves on Metropolitan Avenue crossing Maspeth Creek into Queens. This was a long straight route of long blocks filled with industrial buildings. The sun was hot. Finally, the senator stopped at the intersection of Metropolitan Avenue and Fresh Pond Road. He said this was an important place. Four Queens neighborhoods converged.
To the immediate southwest was Ridgewood, to the southeast Glendale, to the northwest Maspeth and to the northeast Middle Village. He likened the intersection to the point where four Southwestern states -- Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona -- come together.
He said each member of the Schumer family stood in a different state and held hands during a vacation. He considered the possibilities of doing the same thing here. After studying the whizzing traffic, he concluded, "You would probably have to do it at midnight."
It wasn't midnight and there were no other Schumers around, so he led the way to Glendale, a neighborhood of yellow brick buildings and luxuriant trees. "This was the place where the old German fraus would sweep the street," he said. "Not the sidewalks, but the actual streets."
He pointed to a couple of big, strong, sensibly dressed older women who might not ever have stopped. But the neighborhood is clearly now more than just German-Americans. A Lutheran church on Catalpa Avenue shares its space with a Romanian Orthodox Church and a Hispanic Methodist Church.
He stopped at St. Matthias, a Roman Catholic church at 38-15 Catalpa Avenue. He had never been there before. There were breathtaking stained glass windows, powerful columns and one woman praying.
"This is nothing that I knew of," said Mr. Schumer, who used to represent the adjacent congressional district. "It's just a beautiful church."
Lunchtime was long past, and we were carrying around those fabulous Italian sandwiches. Angling back to Brooklyn, heading south on Bushwick Avenue, we happened upon Maria Hernandez Park in Bushwick. It is named for a woman who had been a strong advocate against neighborhood violence and then was killed by what was apparently a stray bullet as she sat in her own home.
The park is one of hundreds of medium-size refuges throughout the city. Hundreds of people played different kinds of ball games, conversed or just sat outside on a pleasant afternoon.
Bushwick has become much safer, a resident said. The men's room in the park was open.

Picturesque! Who Knew?
Mr. Schumer looked admiringly at the surrounding row houses. "If this were in England, they'd be writing a brochure about it," he said. "Notice the arched windows."
The ride back was pretty much a straight shot going west on De Kalb Avenue. Not much traffic. After almost veering into a mammoth pothole, the senator called his wife, the transportation commissioner, to report it. "Hi, my dear," be began.
The ride might have been 20 miles, Mr. Schumer suggested. Or, he thought again, maybe 30. In any case, it was not one of the really long ones on which he carries the music tape, with selections ranging from Chopin to the Jefferson Starship, that Jessica makes for him each Father's Day.
"What I like about these rides," Mr. Schumer said, "is that you never know where you'll end up."
This day had not been a Tour de Brooklyn, much less de Greater New York. It had been a delightful dance with serendipity.

HEADLINE: U.S. Offers Russia a Blueprint for Talks on Nuclear Weapons 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 26 

 BODY:
Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, offered President Vladimir V. Putin an American blueprint today for talks on building a new nuclear-weapons framework, a process she cast as part of a broader White House plan for "transforming" the relationship between Washington and Moscow.
 Ms. Rice said that President Bush hoped to meet Mr. Putin twice this fall, in Shanghai and in Washington, and that members of Mr. Bush's cabinet were planning trips here in the coming months. Two of them -- Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans -- were in Moscow today, meeting with Mr. Putin and other senior officials. 
 "What we are trying to do is to change the nature of the strategic relationship, but also to change the nature of the political and economic relationships," Ms. Rice said. 
Russian enthusiasm for the American embrace was mixed. Mr. Putin, who met with Mr. Bush last weekend at the summit meeting of industrial nations in Genoa, Italy, expressed hope that the talks would imbue the two nations' relations "with new content free from the problems inherited from the past." In Hanoi, Vietnam, where he was meeting with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other Asia-Pacific foreign ministers, Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov solidly endorsed the new dialogue.
But the Kremlin's chief arms negotiator reacted coolly, saying Russian opposition to upsetting the existing arms-control framework was unchanged. And unidentified Russian officials told Russian news agencies that the meetings produced nothing new.
Ms. Rice said that in meetings with Mr. Putin and his top security aides, she discussed a schedule for talks on winnowing stockpiles of nuclear weapons and developing limited defenses against nuclear missiles.
Mr. Putin and Mr. Bush agreed last weekend to link the two issues while seeking a new basis for strategic relations between Moscow and Washington. Russian officials said the Kremlin expected to receive the first substantive proposals from American experts next month.
Ms. Rice said today's meetings dealt far more with missile-defense issues than with the Russians' principal concern -- reducing nuclear arms. The Kremlin has long proposed cutting the number of warheads held by each side to 1,500 from the current level of about 6,000.
Ms. Rice said the Joint Chiefs of Staff were still preparing a report for Mr. Bush on how few nuclear warheads the United States could hold and still maintain a deterrent. 
In a news conference, she was alternately tough and flexible in laying out the United States' hopes for a new partnership with Russia.
Ms. Rice said the White House's central demand in any weapons talks was all but nonnegotiable: the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which effectively prevents the United States from building a limited defense against missiles, must be scrapped. She called the treaty a cold-war artifact, an accord drafted in an era when "the only thing the two sides had in common was a desire not to blow each other apart."
"The U.S.-Russian relationship is considerably different now," she said. "We are not strategic adversaries."
But the treaty remains so restrictive, she argued, that it has become a hindrance rather than an aid to security in a post-Soviet world.
The White House insists that a limited ability to knock down incoming ballistic missiles will not upset the balance of nuclear power among major nations, but that it is essential to counter emerging threats from terrorists or rogue states and to protect against accidental missile launchings by other nations. Russia and China have strongly opposed those plans, accusing the Bush administration of dragging the world headlong into a new arms race.
Today, Ms. Rice said those fears were overblown. While the Pentagon has reported that its research program is just months away from technically violating the ABM treaty, the terms of the accord make almost any work on a missile defense a potential breach, she said. 
Whatever the legalities, she argued, a workable defense system remains many years away, and there is ample time for the world's nuclear powers to agree on its specifics. "At this stage, we are just talking about a robust testing and evaluation" of a defense system, she said. "There is no system that the United States can just pull off the shelf and deploy."
In an era when superpowers suspected each other of plotting surprise attacks, Ms. Rice said, suspicion of a missile-defense plan like the one offered by Mr. Bush might have been justified. But today, when neither Moscow nor Washington considers a nuclear attack to be a likely prospect, such fears only block a basic restructuring of the American-Russian partnership, she said.
Ms. Rice said that despite the Kremlin's remarks against changes in the arms-control framework, Russia was moving closer to that view. "There is a recognition that the United States intends to move forward with missile defense," she said. "You've got a discussion now about how you move forward, not if you move forward. That's considerable progress in the last several months."

Panel Tones Down Report On Auto Fuel Economy
A National Academy of Sciences panel has toned down a report on automobile fuel economy, suggesting that big increases in the gas mileage of cars and light trucks may be somewhat harder to achieve than an earlier draft had stated. But most of the report's technical analysis remains intact.
 The panel is putting the finishing touches on the report and plans to release it next week, the academy said. Page A17.

HEADLINE: Bush to Speak Freely on Dollar 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26 

 BODY:
The White House said today that although the Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, has jurisdiction over the nation's dollar policy, President Bush will feel free to speak out on the dollar as he sees fit.
 The comments by Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, were the latest in the "who speaks for the dollar?" question that began when Mr. 
Bush confused traders last week by saying that markets should determine the dollar's value. 
 Mr. O'Neill restated the strong-dollar policy in London on Monday and said he was the one who should be listened to when currency policy was discussed. Government officials insisted afterward that he was not referring to the president.
"I think what the secretary is saying is accurate, that the Department of Treasury has jurisdiction over matters monetary about the dollar," Mr. Fleischer said. "But obviously the secretary is not speaking for the president when he says there is only one spokesman."
"It's a given in everybody's eyes" that the president can speak out as he wishes, he said. "But it's clear that the Department of Treasury is the cabinet-level agency that has jurisdiction over the dollar."
Some experts believe that the dollar is too strong and that the United States should relax its policy in support of a strong dollar and allow it to weaken to make exports to Europe cheaper and help American businesses through the sluggish economy.
Currency traders have said that the persistent headlines over the direction of dollar policy keep alive suspicions that a subtle shift may be under way to abandon the strong-dollar policy to help United States industry. Analysts said they had not been reassured by Mr. O'Neill's comments.

HEADLINE: Members of Congress Begin Effort to Get U.S. to Join in Fighting Global Warming 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26 

 BODY:
With the United States now alone in the world in opposing the treaty to combat global warming, some lawmakers are pressing for Congress to take the lead toward reducing emissions of so-called greenhouse gases, the issue on which the Bush administration has so far kept to the sidelines.
 Both Democratic and Republican Congressional aides say it is now likely that Congress will pass one or more measures this year calling for cuts in emissions of carbon dioxide, a main provision of the Kyoto global-warming treaty. But it is less clear whether majorities would back the mandatory restrictions spelled out in the treaty and rejected by the administration, or whether they would favor a voluntary approach. 
 Still, when Christie Whitman, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, arrived on Capitol Hill this morning, she heard calls for Congress to make up for the administration's inaction this week in Bonn, where the United States opted out of an agreement on the Kyoto treaty that was backed by more than 180 countries. 
"The administration can refuse to commit the United States to the Kyoto accord; that is their choice," Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont told Mrs. Whitman at a hearing on power plant emissions that was his debut as chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, a job he won in May by shifting his party affiliation to independent from Republican.
"But this Congress, this Senate, and especially this committee will not let our international partners down," Mr. Jeffords said. "We plan to take steps to reduce our nation's contribution to this growing problem by working with industry to reduce carbon emissions." 
The White House has criticized the Kyoto treaty as "fatally flawed," saying its provisions are unfair to the United States. This morning, Mrs. Whitman defended the administration's go-slow approach in offering any alternative to the treaty, saying it would be premature to present any plan for carbon dioxide reductions until further studies are completed.
"We're still a long way from knowing how to solve the problem," she said.
Emissions of carbon dioxide are widely regarded as the main contributor to global warming, and the United States is the world's largest source of that gas, about one-third of which comes from old coal-burning power plants.
The Bush administration's refusal to adopt mandatory limits on carbon dioxide has put it at odds not only with Europe and Japan, but also with senators like Mr. Jeffords, who has introduced a bill requiring power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The bill is also sponsored by 2 Republican senators from Maine, Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe, and 12 Democrats.
Other measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions are also floating around Congress, including some, like one that Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, is expected to introduce next week, that would stop short of mandatory restrictions in favor of voluntary measures.
Even as the administration scrambles to come up with its own stand on the issue, the Congressional aides and several senators said, the pressures of public opinion and concern over international fallout appear to have added to a view that Congress would be irresponsible to do nothing.
"Very few of us up here want to have America seen as not participating in something that's important," Mr. Hagel said in a telephone interview. He said that what happened in Bonn had redoubled a sense of broad support for doing something.
Senator Jeff Bingaman, the New Mexico Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said, "I certainly feel that leadership's got to come from somewhere. It's not coming from the administration." 
"And I think it would be a failure for us," Mr. Bingaman said, "to just sit by idly and let the rest of the world work on this problem while our scientists tell us that the problem is very real."
Today's hearings on the subject were the first since the breakup of the Bonn meetings, and a sense of frustration over the administration not offering an alternative was evident even among Republicans who have been supportive of the White House position. Their comments may have reflected recent opinion polls showing that increasing numbers of Americans see the problem as serious.
In the months before the Kyoto treaty was framed in 1997, the Senate voted 95 to 0 for a resolution opposing any treaty that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions unless developing countries were also made subject to the rules that would bind industrialized countries like the United States. 
The Bush administration has often pointed to that vote as an indication that a treaty requiring mandatory cuts in carbon dioxide emissions could never win Senate ratification. But supporters of mandatory measures point out that the mounting evidence of the scope and potential severity of climate change problems that has emerged in the last four years has significantly altered both the political and the scientific debates.
Senator George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, told Mrs. Whitman, "The fact of the matter is that we need to deal with the carbon issue, substantively and politically." 
In a telephone interview, Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts and a leading critic of the administration's policy, was more explicit, saying: "What happened in Bonn has reinvigorated the notion that the United States is in a very unfortunate position, which encourages many here to think that we've got to take some steps to respond domestically, to put the United States in better graces."
President Bush has said that his administration takes the problem of climate change seriously and is determined to address it. But he has criticized the Kyoto treaty because it does not require immediate action from developing countries and because, he has argued, the steep cuts it would require in carbon dioxide emissions would exact a heavy cost to the American economy.
The administration has said little about its plans since last month when Mr. Bush promised more money for research into causes and possible solutions to global warming.
Administration officials now say that the White House hopes to come up with an alternative to the Kyoto plan in time for the next meeting of the Kyoto group, in October. 
Today's hearing focused on emissions from power plants. Mr. Jeffords, whose bill would rein in power-plant emissions of four problem-causing gases said it was wisest to address all four of the gases at once.
But Mrs. Whitman, advocating the administration's three-pollutant approach, said it would be more prudent to move now to tighten restrictions on three undisputed public health problems -- nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and mercury -- while deferring action on carbon dioxide until its role in global warming was better understood.
"It would be a shame to deny people an important public health goal while we await consensus on carbon dioxide emissions," she said.

HEADLINE: Ferrer Envisions a New Era Of Activism by Government 

BYLINE:  By DEXTER FILKINS

 BODY:
Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president who wants to be mayor, is waging a campaign to revive what he says is a tradition of activist government abandoned by Rudolph W. Giuliani and bolster "the other New York" left out of the city's economic boom. 
 Mr. Ferrer, a Democrat, sketched the broad outlines of his mayoral vision yesterday, including an array of expensive government programs the size and cost of which recall another era in the city's politics. Mr. Ferrer said that he hoped to pay for most of his new programs with taxes already collected and requests for more state aid, and by weeding out fraud and abuse. He said he did not think raising taxes would be necessary to cover expansion of programs and services, but favored reinstating an income tax surcharge that was recently rolled back by Mr. Giuliani and the City Council. 
 Mr. Ferrer also signaled that he would be more likely to discipline police officers, too many of whom, he said, have lost the trust of New Yorkers. 
Among the many proposals Mr. Ferrer outlined yesterday in a 90-minute interview with reporters and editors of The New York Times, those that he highlighted have been part of his campaign. Mr. Ferrer said that if elected mayor, he would raise teacher pay by 30 percent, oversee the construction of 150,000 units of housing and ban the practice of racial profiling by the police. Excerpts, Page B6. 
In carrying out his agenda, Mr. Ferrer would be reasserting the role of the city government in areas where it has pulled back in recent years. Mr. Ferrer promises to use the government to help the millions of New Yorkers who, he said, have scarcely benefited from the robust economic growth of recent years. 
"Not everything has gone well," he said. "Not everything has been addressed appropriately. There are real mortgages on the future of this city that someone has to talk about. We've got to acknowledge some harsh truths about this in order to deal with it." 
Mr. Ferrer, a 51-year-old native of the Bronx and its borough president since 1987, is hoping that his call for renewed government activism will propel him past his three major rivals for the Democratic nomination: Mark Green, the city's public advocate; Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller; and Peter F. Vallone, the speaker of the City Council. 
Mr. Ferrer's calls for increased support for education and housing contrasts sharply with the administration of Mr. Giuliani, who came into office almost eight years ago on a message of austerity as he faced deficits. Though the city's brisk economy has since helped fuel new spending by City Hall, Mr. Giuliani began his first term by cutting spending for housing and social services -- some of the same areas where Mr. Ferrer is now pushing for increases. In his first term, Mr. Giuliani also privatized some services. After cutting the payroll by more than 15,000, the mayor has invested the growing revenues into rebuilding the city's payroll, especially in police and teacher ranks, to the point where personnel has reached an all-time high.
As an example of how agency responsibility should be restored, Mr. Ferrer said he did not understand why people moving off welfare were being trained by private companies rather than by employees at the Human Resources Administration. He said he would restore the agency's role, which he contended would save money because the contracts to private companies for job training and placement amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. But he did not say whether employees would need to be added to accomplish the same goals. 
While some of Mr. Ferrer's rivals for the Democratic nomination have been quick to praise the Republican mayor, Mr. Ferrer has consistently billed himself as an "anti-Rudy" -- both personally and politically. In his interview, Mr. Ferrer described his relationship with Mr. Giuliani as "famously nonexistent" and said the two men had rarely spoken in the last several years. 
"The only instance of that was when he was having his existential moment over a year ago, when he called me up," Mr. Ferrer said, referring to the time last spring when Mr. Giuliani, facing a deteriorating marriage and treatment for prostate cancer, quit his United States Senate campaign and briefly tried to make peace with his political enemies. 
Mr. Ferrer said they had a pleasant discussion, about health insurance and other matters.
Mr. Ferrer asserted that he stood alone among the four Democrats seeking their party's nomination in enumerating how he would pay for each of the new programs he has promised to deliver. As an example, Mr. Ferrer offered his plan to set up after-school and weekend programs in middle schools across the city. He said he would pay for the program with the $800 million gained from restoring the city's income tax surcharge. 
"I haven't proposed any initiatives -- any -- where I haven't said where this money will come from," Mr. Ferrer said. "So that, for example, when I propose an after-school program I would tell people how I'd pay for it."
Yet aside from the after-school program, Mr. Ferrer was distinctly less specific on his plans for paying for the other programs he is proposing. Apart from restoring the income tax surcharge, Mr. Ferrer is not advocating any new taxes, and says that most of his new proposals can be paid for by squeezing waste from existing programs or redeploying taxes already collected. He said he was confident that he could pursue his agenda despite a slowing New York economy. 
In one of his most ambitious proposals, Mr. Ferrer advocated giving all of the city's 80,000 teachers a 30 percent raise, which he said would help ultimately improve the quality of teaching. "If we acknowledge that the important relationship in a school takes place in a classroom between teacher and student," Mr. Ferrer said, "how can we say we want our kids to do better but throw our hands up on the ways to make that happen?" 
Mr. Ferrer says his proposal would cost about $1.1 billion a year. In return, he says, he will insist on speeding up the process by which teachers can be fired, and will require that all teachers take courses during the month of July. He says he will also require that certain teachers -- new recruits, for example -- teach summer school. 
Mr. Ferrer provided few details on how he reached the $1.1 billion figure. Later in the day, his spokesman, John Del Cecato, said that Mr. Ferrer had arrived at $1.1 billion by using the average teacher's salary of $47,000. Other estimates have put the cost of a 20 percent raise at $1 billion. Mr. Ferrer provided few details on how he would pay for his plan. He said the $1.1 billion pay increase could be financed almost entirely through the existing Board of Education budget. Mr. Ferrer said that substantial savings could be realized -- as much as $300 million -- by cutting back on contracts for outside services. As much as $150 million, he said, could gained by tapping the state treasury. "We've got to find ways to make this happen," he said. 
Mr. Ferrer also provided the outline of a plan to build 150,000 units of housing, which, if realized, would make it the city's most ambitious housing program in more than a decade. Again, the sweeping nature of his proposal suggests a return to a city that took more of an active role in providing for its citizens, in this case, homes.
In his interview, Mr. Ferrer said he was taking a page from the administration of Edward I. Koch, who set aside billions of dollars to rebuild the city's dilapidated housing stock in the late 1980's. Mr. Ferrer said he wanted to alleviate a housing shortage for thousands of New Yorkers, particularly those in the poorer precincts. 
"It made the biggest difference in people's lives, individually and broadly, by changing their neighborhoods and their neighborhood circumstances," Mr. Ferrer said of the Koch program. "We have added value by ramping up neighborhoods all over the city." 
Mr. Ferrer provided few details of how he would pay for and carry out his housing plan, which he estimated at $13 billion over the next 10 years. Later in the day, his aide, Mr. Del Cecato, provided a brief list of revenue sources. Under the plan, the bulk of the financing -- about $150 million a year -- would be paid for over time from the rents and mortgages on the buildings themselves.
Mr. Ferrer reserved some of his most caustic criticisms for Mr. Giuliani in his stewardship of the police. While he conceded that the current administration had succeeded in drastically lowering the crime rate, Mr. Ferrer suggested that that victory had come at the price of the public trust and confidence in the police. 
Mr. Ferrer said, "Fear is the defining element of the relationship between people and the police in too many places with too many people." 
Mr. Ferrer suggested yesterday that he would put stricter controls on the police. Later in the day, he offered a specific proposal to ensure that. At Police Headquarters downtown, Mr. Ferrer outlined legislation to ban racial profiling and punish officers who engage in it. "I want the pendulum to swing back to the middle," he said.

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
With many dot-coms blowing up, it is now fashionable to dismiss the Internet as just another tulip mania. That Internet stocks were a classic bubble is without question. But the Internet isn't just tulips, and if you think it is, well, let's talk in five years. By then it will be clear that the Internet is a business evolution -- reshaping how businesses communicate, educate and purchase materials; a social revolution -- connecting people who have never been connected before; and, for both of these reasons, a strategic dilemma that we are just beginning to understand.
 Recently I wrote a memo that the Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden might have written to his men, after the Bush team hastily withdrew a contingent of Marines exercising in Jordan following death threats from the bin Laden gang. One day after the column appeared in The Times and on its Web site, I received e-mails from two Marines who had been part of the exercise in Jordan. They were upset about what I had written and they e-mailed me from their ship, the U.S.S. Harpers Ferry, as it sailed away from Jordan, to scold me for suggesting that they were retreating. 
 As one of them, a lance corporal, wrote: "We have not been driven out of the Middle East. We are not in port, but believe me, we are here. . . . Marines do not retreat, Mr. Friedman. . . . Semper Fidelis. @harpers-ferry.usmc .mil."
That's the Internet social revolution, connecting people who have never been connected. In 2001, the use of the Internet by companies to reach customers, suppliers and employers will triple to about $260 billion worth of business worldwide. That's the Internet business evolution.
The strategic dilemma flows from both: the more tightly connected we become, socially and financially, the more vulnerable we are to any breakdown in the system. Did you see that train tunnel fire in Baltimore last week? It burned some key network cables that used the same tunnel, which knocked out part of the Internet in Baltimore and slowed Internet service in regions across the U.S.
In five years, with the Internet being used to run more and more systems, if someone is able to knock out the handful of key Internet switching and addressing centers in the U.S. (until recently, a quarter of all Internet traffic passed through one building in Tyson's Corner, Va., next to Morton's steak house), here's what happens: many trains will stop running, much air traffic will grind to a halt, power supplies will not be able to be shifted from one region to another, there will be no e-mail and your doctor's CAT scanner, which is now monitored over the Internet by its manufacturer, won't work if it breaks.
Why? Because corporate data, telephone calls and e-mail, which 10 years ago ran on separate networks, are now all running together on the same fiber-optic cables through the same routers. This is called the "I.T. cloud" -- a huge complex web of lines and routers, where, like a cloud, you see your voice, data or e-mail going in one side and coming out the other, but never quite know how it works in between.
The Bush missile defense plan is geared to defending the country from a rogue who might fire a missile over our walls. But the more likely threat is from a cyberterrorist who tries to sabotage our webs. The more tightly we get woven together, the more we become dependent on networks, the more a single act of terrorism can unleash serious chaos.
What compounds this Internet strategic dilemma is that the web is largely in the hands of the private sector. The U.S. Army can't protect our webs as easily as our walls. What the government can do is to cajole every industry in the private sector to improve its network security, backups and information about cyberattacks to make our relentless integration less vulnerable to a systemic failure.
To his credit, President Bush will soon unveil an upgraded program to defend against cyberterrorism. But so far, the U.S. government spends only $1.8 billion a year to protect our webs, which, the F.B.I. will tell you, are already under daily hack attack by cyberterrorists. Meanwhile, we are considering spending $100 billion on a missile shield to defend our walls from missiles that terrorists don't yet possess and may never use. It will probably take a cyberattack that causes real chaos for us to see that our big threat is not a mushroom cloud but the I.T. cloud, and that threat will come up the web, not over a wall.

HEADLINE: A Financial Push for Peace in Ireland 

BYLINE:  By Richard Freeman; Richard Freeman is a professor of economics at Harvard and co-director of the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
The major deterrent to making the Northern Ireland Good Friday peace agreement effective has been the unwillingness of the Irish Republican Army to decommission its weapons. Is there a way to make decommissioning more palatable to the I.R.A. and more certain for the Unionists who demand the relinquishing of the I.R.A.'s arms as a part of the peace?
 There may be an economic solution: Pay for each weapon that the I.R.A. and Protestant paramilitary groups turn over to authorities, giving the money not to the paramilitaries themselves, but to a special development fund to implement the peace agreement and to invest in the well-being of the people of Northern Ireland. 
 Far from being a sign of defeat, this sort of decommissioning would be a way for the I.R.A. and other armed groups to turn their weapons into resources that would benefit their communities. The money to buy the arms could come from three sources: the British government, which could finance the initiative in part from reduced spending on military forces in Northern Ireland; the Irish government; and the Irish abroad who want to see peace in the old country. 
As in any bargain where money is involved, the parties would have to bargain over the price of each decommissioned weapon. The Catholic and Protestant communities in Northern Ireland would have the same goal -- to obtain a high price for weapons -- while the two governments and the overseas Irish communities would want to pay a lower price.
The parties to this exchange would also have to agree on the purposes for which the money could be spent -- perhaps for schools, hospitals and funds for families that have suffered from the violence. Money for I.R.A. decommissioning could be spent primarily on projects that would benefit the Catholic community while money for Protestant paramilitary decommissioning could go to the Protestant community. Better yet, all the money might go into a single fund and be allocated jointly by the political leaders of both communities.
Paying people to turn over guns has been tried with limited success in the United States and Australia. But the money has typically gone to the individual gun owners, who could use it to buy new guns, legally or illegally. Putting the money into a fund for communities would prevent its being used to buy new guns. The American and Australian schemes did not greatly reduce the number of guns held by people. Similarly, an Irish buyback would probably leave considerable weaponry in the hands of the I.R.A. and paramilitaries, as well as in the hands of other citizens. The value of the scheme would not be in removing all weaponry from Northern Ireland, but in giving the Catholic and Protestant communities a new and different stake in getting the guns decommissioned. For the first time, the paramilitary groups would be able to make an immediate contribution to the well-being of their communities -- alleviating poverty, improving economic opportunities and helping the families of victims of violence.
Would the I.R.A. and Protestant paramilitary groups accept an offer like this?
They would face a stark choice: Keep the arms or help their communities. At a sufficiently high price for the weapons, it is difficult to see how the paramilitaries could turn down the money-for-guns plan. Local communities would place pressure on them to give up their weapons when failure to do so would have a real financial cost. At a low price, the paramilitaries might continue to view the risks of decommissioning as exceeding the benefits. The task for both sides would be to find a price that can support a satisfactory agreement. The virtue of economic solutions is that money can be bargained over to the last pound: a little more spent for good purposes can help move people in the right direction.
Economists, some say, know the price of everything and the value of nothing. They can monetize all sorts of things -- life, love, honor -- with little concern for moral judgments. But in this case, price and moral value move together. Paying for decommissioning arms by putting money into a development fund may help dissolve the impasse. Offering the parties in Northern Ireland a way to link the turning over of weapons to tangible benefits for the communities could be just the extra push that will salvage the Good Friday agreement.

HEADLINE: Niagara Mohawk Plans Deal to Curb Prices 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Niagara Mohawk Holdings, which is selling its power plants to focus on distributing electricity, announced a plan yesterday that is meant to prevent widespread spikes in consumer bills upstate.
 The company, which distributes power to 1.5 million customers across 24,000 square miles of upstate New York, has signed a tentative agreement that will lock in prices for more than 90 percent of the power it transmits annually to residential and small-business consumers. 
 The deal, which needs approval from New York State Public Service Commission, calls for the company to buy 35,000 to 36,000 gigawatt hours each year from Tractebel Energy Marketing, a Houston-based subsidiary of Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux, a Paris utility that is among the largest in the world. 
Under the deal, Tractebel will assume Niagara Mohawk's approximately 100 existing contracts with power generators and then sell most of the power to Niagara Mohawk.
The prices that Tractebel could charge Niagara Mohawk would be fixed from 2001 to 2003, and capped for the following three years. 
The agreement comes at a time when many are concerned about electricity price spikes in New York State. 
In California, several power distributors were driven to financial collapse this year as electricity prices rose and they were barred from passing on the costs to consumers. In New York State, many are concerned that there could be sharp price increases because the number of new power plants being built will not accommodate demand. Unlike California's, New York State's regulators allow the power distributors to pass on the full cost increases to consumers.
"What we tried to do was reduce the risk that our customers would face in the open market," Michael J. Kelleher, the vice president for financial planning at Niagara Mohawk, said in an interview yesterday. "And we think we were able to do that at a price that is lower than what we forecast we would have paid on the open market."
In the New York City area, customers of Consolidated Edison, which has bought power on the open market for the past two years, have had their summer bills jump as much as 40 percent per kilowatt hour.
In 1988, Niagara Mohawk agreed to sell all of its fossil, hydraulic and nuclear plants as a part of deregulation the company shifted its focus from creating and transmitting power to just sending it to consumer's doors. Con Ed made the same shift.
Last September, Niagara Mohawk officials announced an agreement for the company to be acquired by National Grid Group, a power company, in a deal valued at $8.36 billion. That deal is still awaiting regulatory approval.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Jaded Wall St. Barely Budges on Poor Economic News

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street mostly held still yesterday, with just a smattering of selling on news that the economy grew at its weakest pace in eight years and on worse-than-expected results at JDS Uniphase.
 Analysts said the muted response reflected how accustomed investors have become to bad news, given the dismal second-quarter earnings of recent weeks. They also said the market was reassured by indications that the outlook for semiconductor stocks could be improving. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average declined 38.96 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 10,416.67. Broader stock indicators advanced. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.89 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,205.82, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 6.11 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,029.07.
For the week, the three indexes made little progress, despite a huge sell-off Monday and Tuesday that sent the Dow down 335 points. The Dow ended the week off about 1.5 percent, while the other two indicators fell less than 1 percent.
"There's no catalyst on the earnings side short term to give us a strong headwind, so we're stuck," said Robert Harrington, co-head of listed block trading at UBS Warburg. "The only good thing I can say is that the negative news is not bringing the whole market down."
Investors continued to pore over earnings reports, looking for indications of where business was headed. JDS Uniphase was pummeled, falling 95 cents, or 10 percent, to $8.55, after reporting a wider-than-expected quarterly loss and warning of revenue shortfalls ahead. The company, a maker of optical network components, also announced 7,000 more job cuts, bringing the total for the year to 16,000, or more than half of its staff.
The Dow's losses came from a handful of stocks, including the technology bellwethers Intel, which fell 61 cents, to $29.22, and Microsoft, which was down $1.14 at $65.47. DuPont, which released disappointing results early in the week, also suffered, falling $1.06, to $42.13.
The news was better in semiconductors, a technology subsector whose recovery is considered a precursor to any technology turnaround. Investors sent LSI Logic up $1.70, to $20.85, after the company said it expected business to bottom out in the current quarter.
But Wall Street had little reaction to a Commerce Department report that showed the economy's growth slowed to 0.7 percent this spring, its worst performance in eight years, as businesses cut investment spending by the largest amount in nearly two decades.
"There was some relief that the number wasn't negative, that we're not in a recession, and we're closer every day to interest rate cuts helping the economy," said Barry Hyman, chief investment strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum.
Still, most companies are unable to say when business will improve. That inability has translated into uncertainty on Wall Street that has kept many investors away. The three major stock indexes -- the Dow, Nasdaq and S.& P. 500 -- have all made little progress since mid-April.
Treasury debt prices rose yesterday, with the 10-year note up 9/32, to a price of 99 11/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.09 percent from 5.13 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 16/32, to 97 20/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.54 percent from 5.57 percent on Thursday.

Soccer Provides a Tonic For Nation's Glum Mood

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, July 27 

 BODY:
Many said the Copa America the premier soccer event in the Americas, a tournament that leads storekeepers to shutter their shops and lures tens of millions of fans to their television sets -- would be a bust.
 After all, the 12-nation tournament, due to be held in this nation of strife, was nearly suspended when a Colombian soccer official was kidnapped by leftist rebels in June. 
 Then, after South American soccer officials ruled that Colombia would remain the host as planned, Argentina promptly dropped out over concerns that its powerhouse team could be placed in danger. Canada also canceled. And some of Brazil's top players, fearing the worst, stayed home. 
Some commentators wondered if it had not been irresponsible for Copa in Colombia -- the most prominent of them the president, Andres Pastrana -- to lobby for a tournament to be staged in a country where terrorism is a part of life.
But now, with the finals to be played on Sunday in this Andean capital after 15 games in 18 days of play, Colombians are rejoicing. First, their team is in the finals. Second, the tournament went off without incident, and third, presented the world with memorable, even spectacular play. 
And that is sometimes all that people ask in a region of the world where no matter how bad things get, soccer is always there to provide relief.
"This has been spectacular, since no one gave Colombia a peso's worth of credit," Victor Perez, 57, a civil engineer, said late Thursday night on a Bogota intersection swamped with fans celebrating the latest Colombian victory.
"We have shown the world that although we have plenty of problems, we are capable of achieving big things," Mr. Perez said. "I know and we all know soccer does not fix all that is happening, but it is so good for us Colombians to enjoy ourselves.
The world is left with the image of a nation bigger than its problems."
The Copa, played in seven cities, was indeed filled with lasting images.
Small countries like Costa Rica, which depended on a bruising star named Paulo Cesar Wanchope, made it to the quarterfinals on the strength of his five goals. Honduras, which replaced Argentina and is not known for soccer prowess, knocked off normally mighty Brazil. Other surprises abounded, like Chile's victory over an Ecuadorean squad that had been expected to advance.
And perhaps the sweetest gift for Colombians is that their team, an untested collection of young players, dominated all five of its games and is now playing for the championship on Sunday against Mexico.
Colombians had become accustomed to unpleasant surprises when it came to their team. In a World Cup match in Los Angeles in 1994, a heavily favored Colombian squad lost to the underdog United States team. Colombian defender Andres Escobar, who inadvertently scored a goal for the Americans, was later shot dead on his return home.
But the only surprise in this Copa has been the Colombians' dominance. The Colombians, in fact, have not given up a single goal, a rarity in the Copa's 85-year history.
For Colombians, weary of a worsening conflict and mired in a four-year recession and 20 percent unemployment, the tournament was a chance to put the country's myriad problems behind them, at least for a bit.
"We can forget a little about such much conflict, about all the differences that divide us, about all the craziness in the streets," said Gabriel Moyano, 47, a vendor, as he watched Colombia beat Honduras 2-0 on Thursday night to reach the finals. "Colombia, at least, will be in the championship. That fills us with emotion. You want that. You want a little happiness in your life, not sadness, not hostility."
Colombia, which last played host to a Copa in 1947, seemed to be an odd choice for a tournament, given the deteriorating conditions here. A conflict with leftist guerrillas, who have been waging war for nearly four decades, continues to intensify. 
The media recently reported that two and a half years of peace negotiations with rebels had gone worse than believed. Paramilitary gunmen, fiercely opposed to the rebels, have killed nearly 1,300 people in massacres this year.
Then, in the weeks leading up to the tournament, a series of car bombs in Colombian cities raised fears that players or fans would be attacked. The bad news was capped off with the June kidnapping of Hernan Mejia, vice president of the Colombian Soccer Federation.
It looked as though Colombia had lost the tournament, but then Mr. Mejia was released and a fierce lobbying effort by Copa sponsors and Colombian officials began. Soccer officials relented.
Mr. Pastrana, who has been criticized for making little progress in peace talks, said the tournament would showcase Colombia not as a land of war, but one where most people are warm and hospitable. He started calling the tournament the "Peace Cup." And Colombians, elated with the good news on the field of play, began to feel giddy.
"I dedicate the goal to this beautiful country we have," Victor Aristizabal, the Copa's leading scorer, said after his sixth goal of the tournament helped knock out Honduras. "We had never experienced this. I dedicate it to a happy people that could be one of the best countries in the world."
At the Parque Nacional, Bogota's most venerable park, on the edge of the mountains that ring this city, fans gathered on Thursday night for the match against Honduras on a 20-by-20-foot screen, one of several set up around the city so people could watch outside.
Dressed in the yellow, blue and red of the Colombian flag, the fans rejoiced with each goal and with each save by Colombia's dominating goalie, Oscar Cordoba. 
The fervor for their team was so pitched that even when the screen went blank, because of mechanical problems, the cheering and horn blowing continued.
"This has been a chance for us to have a fiesta," said Raul Angulo, 28, an actor and stage director. "Here, there is no difference in race, no difference in culture. Nothing else that divides us. We are all just one country now."

HEADLINE: Duane Reade Registers a 16% Profit Gain 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
The regional drugstore chain Duane Reade Inc. posted a 16 percent rise for second-quarter profit, in line with Wall Street's estimates, helped by strong sales of items like skin-care creams, vitamins, toothpaste and dietary products. 
 The company, based in New York, said earnings in the three-month period ended June 30 rose to $5.7 million, or 30 cents a diluted share, from $5 million, or 27 cents a diluted share, in the period a year earlier. 
Sales increased 20 percent, to $292 million. 
 Excluding a one-time charge for retiring debt, the company earned $7.2 million, or 36 cents a diluted share.
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call expected the company to earn 35 cents a share; its stock rose $2.51, to $34.64, on the New York Stock Exchange.
"We continued to achieve industry-leading same-store-sales growth in both the front-end and pharmacy portions of our business, reflecting the successful execution of our strategies to drive top line growth," the chairman, Anthony Cuti, said in a statement. 
Mr. Cuti said Duane Reade's New York focus was shielding it from increasing competitive pricing pressure from food and drug mass merchandisers. Those retailers are cutting general merchandise prices to go head-to-head with national drug chains as the economy slows. 
Mr. Cuti said Duane Reade's results also benefited from increased cost savings from its central prescription filling operation, which he said was helping the company withstand the rising shortage of pharmacists faced by the drug retailing industry. 
Duane Reade said sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales -- a leading measure of retailing performance -- rose 8.6 percent, and comparable pharmacy sales rose 19.1 percent. Sales in the general merchandise category, were up 3 percent.

Economic Growth Slows To 0.7% Rate in Quarter
Economic growth nearly halted in the second quarter, as businesses made severe cuts in investment and consumer spending grew less quickly than it had at the start of the year, the government said.
 The economy grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 0.7 percent, the Commerce Department said, leaving it in its weakest condition in a decade. Page A1. 

Dow Jones Declined 1.5% This Week
Wall Street held steady, despite light selling on the government's weak gross domestic product report. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 38.96 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,416.67. The Dow ended the week down 1.5 percent, even after a sell-off on Monday and Tuesday when the index lost 335 points. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.89 points, to 1,205.82, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 6.11 points, to 2,029.07. For the week, the two gauges lost less than a percent. C4.

E.P.A. Rules Against Modified Corn
The Environmental Protection Agency has decided not to let even trace amounts of genetically modified StarLink corn into human food, officials said. An agency advisory panel concluded on Thursday that there was not enough evidence to rule out possible allergic reactions, even from small amounts. C4.

House Bars Easing of Water Rules
The House voted 218 to 189 to bar the Bush administration from easing rules on the amount of arsenic allowed in drinking water beyond those set under President Clinton. A1.

The Bush administration wants Congress to collapse several of the most contentious air pollution control programs into a more flexible and less intrusive system strongly favored by leading electric utilities. A8.

Regulators Close Superior Bank
Federal regulators have closed Superior Bank, a Chicago-area savings and loan that has had huge losses on loans to high-risk borrowers. The institution, half-owned by the Pritzker family, is expected to cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation $500 million. C14.

Thailand Ponders Time Zone Change
The government of Thailand is considering whether to set clocks ahead. By doing so, financial markets in Bangkok would operate in closer harmony with larger markets in Singapore, Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur, attracting more foreign investment. C3.

HEADLINE: Badillo Outlines Plans to Resolve Shortcomings With Police and Schools 

 BODY:
 Here are excerpts from an interview with Herman Badillo, a Republican who is making his fourth attempt to become mayor of New York City. The interview was conducted by reporters and editors from The New York Times, and is the second in a planned series of interviews with each of the major candidates.

Q. What, in your view, are the stakes in this election? What is this election about?

A. This election is about whether we want to continue the progress that the city has made under Giuliani or whether we want to go back to the situation as it was in 1992, and those are very high stakes. Because I campaigned with Rudy, 1993 I ran for comptroller with him. People were telling us that it was essential for Rudy to be elected if they were to stay in the city. And Rudy has proven that the city is manageable. Rudy has proven that standards can be changed. And I've proven that we can have standards at the City University.

Q. And what's the unfinished work?

A. The unfinished work is to, first, to continue what has happened so we don't go backwards. Want to continue having standards at the City University, continue having the enforcement of the law at the Police Department and then to bring about the same changes that I brought at the City University to the Board of Education. . . . We can make sure that children begin to get help at age 4, when they're in preschool, and that they get their standards evaluated at every grade. . . .

Q. Is there anything that, in your opinion, was wrong about the past eight years, things that the mayor did wrong, that you weren't happy with?

A. Well, yeah, but, you know, he has a different style than I do and it's a question of style. I think that the people of New York City give him overwhelming approval on his job performance. They don't necessarily give him overwhelming approval on his style of doing things, but everybody has a different style.

Q. There's no policy difference that you can think of between a Badillo administration and a Giuliani administration?

A. There aren't significant policy differences, carrying out the policy differences, but the policies themselves, which require performance by every department.

Q. What is your view of bilingual education?

A. My view is that it's good if done the way I wrote the bill. The bill was for bilingual education for a limited period of time, maybe two years, in some cases even three.

Q. What is the default position if a parent does nothing? Does the kid then go in or not go in?

A. Then the child should be evaluated. I mean, many of the kids you can tell by talking to them whether they need bilingual education or not. When I came here I couldn't speak English at all. That's not a big test. But there are some kids who do speak English fluently and really only speak what we call household Spanish, to give you an example, which is a very limited thing. . . .

Q. But when you came here there was no bilingual education.

A. Naturally. That's why I supported bilingual education, you see, because I came here, I came to live in East Harlem. I was looking at the teacher, the teacher was looking at me and we looked at each other for a few months. And I was able to move ahead. . . . But a lot of my colleagues dropped out of school because they couldn't move as fast.

Q. Do you believe that there's racial profiling going on in New York by the New York City Police Department?

A. It has not been proved. I know that the Justice Department conducted a very extensive study; they found no evidence of it. . . . And racial profiling is illegal and unconstitutional, and I would certainly want nothing to do with it.
 But I support the idea of having what the Police Department does be verified. . . .

Q. Could you foresee any policy changes that you would push in the Police Department?

A. Policy changes are as follows: Police need better training and we have to move to change the racial composition of the city. We have developed, at the City University, a program in sensitivity training. . . . So far 5,000 policemen have participated in that course. As mayor, I would require every single one of the 40,000 policemen to take that course and I would pay for it, it would be free of charge to them.
 But in addition to that, I obviously would like it if Albany would pass a bill to have the policemen live in the city, but they're never going to do it.
 So what I would do is I would expand the program, which we also developed at John Jay . . . and there would be several advantages to that. That program I would expand to 3,000 police cadets a year. Because the people who go to CUNY are overwhelmingly black, Hispanic and Asian, and a majority is women, you automatically have out of the graduating class a large number of blacks, Latinos, Asians and women, which would begin to change the racial composition.

Q. Are you saying that the tension between the police and the community has little to do with police behavior and a lot to do with the racial composition?

A. Oh no. It has to do with police behavior. But it also has to do with racial composition.

Q. Has that gap between the neighborhood and the police grown over the past eight years or has it always been the same since the days . . .

A. That gap is huge. And it's come more to the attention of the public because of the problems with Amadou Diallo and Abner Louima . . . But those of us who know these neighborhoods know that those problems exist. And, you know, cops are people like everybody else.

Q. So many of your accomplishments have been as a Democrat.

A. Yeah.

Q. I'm wondering -- your view on that party now, I mean, looking at it from all the years that you've been affiliated now with the Republican Party after running with Mayor Giuliani . . .

A. Yeah.

Q. What's wrong with the Democratic Party?

A. What's wrong with the Democratic Party is that a lot of the programs that we supported in the 60's and 70's did not work, unfortunately for me. I said then that they did not work. And I tried to change them. And my Democratic colleagues would not agree to any changes.

Q. What are your thoughts on the teachers' contracts and what would your top priorities be when negotiating that? What would you ask for?

A. Well, Randi Weingarten and the teachers agree with me on the need for standards. And then, as I said, I agree that we have to reduce class sizes. For example, I'm a C.P.A. . . . but you don't have to figure out -- be a C.P.A. -- to figure out something doesn't count properly, because if there are 1,100,000 students in the schools and 80,000 teachers and you divide that it comes to about 14 students per teacher. So how come my wife and all the other teachers in the school have 36 kids? Somewhere teachers are not in the classroom. I would require that there be a written explanation to the mayor and the City Council for every teacher who is not in the classroom. . . .

Q. Would you also require summer school starting in first grade instead of waiting until third?

A. If the individuals are not able to perform, instead they have a choice of going to summer school or taking the course -- back, which is what I said up at CUNY. We have the largest summer school program in the City University today, which no one has reported on. And it works and a lot of the kids pass and go ahead. But if they don't pass, they don't get promoted. In other words, there has to be a reality to the enforcement of standards, which Chancellor Levy has not done.

Q. You've identified public safety as the most important thing. Maybe by implication, education is the second most important. Tell us third, fourth and fifth. And what you want to . . .

A. Well, health is a huge problem. Including health, by the way, for immigrants. Because we have one-quarter of the city that has no health insurance. And that's because they're too young for Medicare. And they work, so they don't qualify for Medicaid. But they work in little jobs -- in bodegas, restaurants and other places where there's no program for insurance. So we have to maintain the city hospitals. We have to expand the Child Health Plus programs. We have to take advantage of the new program that Governor Pataki just got implemented: Family Health Plus.
 Because look at what's going on in the city today. My father and mother died of tuberculosis when I was a child in Puerto Rico. My father, when I was 1; my mother when I was 5. But in those days tuberculosis was incurable -- it was an epidemic. We are in danger of having an epidemic of tuberculosis in New York City when tuberculosis is curable because the people don't have access to medical care. That's outrageous. . . . It's important that everyone get adequate health care because many of these diseases are contagious and they're a danger to all of us. And so health care, to me, is an equally urgent priority because of the need. And it's not difficult to give it a priority because basically it should be the school system -- I mean every child should be enrolled in Child Health Plus and the chancellor and the principals and the superintendents should ensure that every child in the district is enrolled because if they have no money they don't have to pay.

Q. The city's been losing jobs in the last couple of months, revenues are now looking like they're not going to be so robust. How serious a problem do you think this is going to be? And what do you do, cut programs, raise taxes?

A. No, you don't raise taxes because you raise taxes, you lose jobs. That's what happened under Dinkins where we lost 400,000 jobs which now have been restored. You lower taxes. The best example is the hotel tax where the hotel tax was lowered, you had more people coming into New York because New York City was no longer blacklisted by hotel associations. And the result was more people in hotels, more income for hotels.
 We should lower the sales tax. We should get rid of the commercial rent tax.

Q. How do you pay for ----

A. I was saying -- no, you can't pay for it. I just told you, get more revenue. See, we have to encourage the development of jobs for people who are in the city.

Q. ...if you're not going to raise taxes, give us an idea of what your priorities are for cuts. What goes first?

A. Well, I told you, I'm a C.P.A., I also told you I was deputy mayor. When I came in as deputy mayor with Ed Koch, all the projections for the next 20 years were even worse than they are today, because it always is that way. The next year budget is always a deficit. But you find, if you look at it, that somehow that's met. Why? Because without giving away too many secrets, there's always some money stored away, there's always a rainy-day balance. When there is a problem, as we had with Koch, you reduce the budget of every department by 5 or 10 percent, you provide for early retirement. You do a number of things ----

Q. You would do that across the board?

A. Yeah, you do it ----

Q. Including the Police Department?

A. Well, it depends. Some more, some less, depending on the department.

Q. Would you be O.K. with the level of police going down?

A. It depends -- it's like negotiating raises, depends. You call in each commissioner -- which Ed Koch did, he met with every commissioner -- and you evaluate how much you're going to cut. You ask the commissioner, what harm is this going to do you?

Q. I'm looking for specifics here. You've already mentioned that you admired or at least liked some of the things in the Giuliani administration. But how, specifically, your administration will be different from that of the Giuliani administration. And similar to it.

A. Well, I've given you very clear specifics. I mean, on education I said I would do what I did when I was deputy mayor, change the system. I told you what I did at CUNY. I told you about health care. I mean, there's a whole new approach and more aggressive strategy to bring about changes, but it's not having more government, it's bringing about less government and bringing about more benefits to the people. . . .
 And I want to say on housing . . . We know that middle-income housing works because people own their housing. I believe in low-income housing being owned by the people.

Q. The Giuliani administration has been criticized for having an economic development policy -- to the extent they have one -- that favors subsidies to large corporations -- the New York Stock Exchange and possibly building a stadium. Would you continue on that line? Would you do something different?

A. Oh, I would do something different. For example, I think it is outrageous that Michael Bloomberg, to this day, insists that he wants $14 million to enable him to stay in the city as he moves from 59th Street and Park Avenue to 58th Street and Third Avenue. Does anyone believe that Michael Bloomberg is going to leave the city? I mean, that's a rip-off. But he says "Oh, I took advantage of the benefit. And then he says I'm not going to give it up until I'm elected because if I'm not elected, I'm going to keep the benefit." A guy with $4 1/2 billion still grasping at $14 million. I mean that's greedy. . . . I think that's just an example of the kind of thing that I would be against. There are legitimate situations where you have a stock exchange which needs to expand. And you've got to help them because that's important to the life of the city.
 But stadiums are something that is not urgent.

Q. On the subject of Bloomberg, before you get to November you have to make it through September. Why do you think the Republican establishment hasn't been warming up to your campaign?

A. Well, it's only part of the Republican establishment. It's simple: money, money. After all, he gave $150,000 to the state Republican Party. He gave $30,000 to Sal Fontese. I don't know and I don't care how much money he gave to the others. Some of the Republican leaders love money.

Q. Are there any commissioners in the Giuliani administration that you would keep on?

A. Yeah. I would keep Scoppetta -- Nick Scoppetta. I think he's doing a great job. Because he has lived through the experience of the kids he deals with there.
 I would keep Bernie Kerik because Kerik, I know from the Department of Correction, did a wonderful job.

Q. Would you keep Chancellor Harold O. Levy in some role?

A. No. I would abolish the Board of Education and bring in a new commissioner. . . . I have a problem with Chancellor Levy, as I told you. Because I believe in real social promotion and I don't see it. In today's papers, about the Moreland Commission . . . I agree with the newspapers that a capital budget overrun of almost $2 billion is outrageous. Because that could be a hell of a lot of schools that are not being built. And Chancellor Levy says he knew about this. It is unconscionable to do that. I would have private enterprise build the schools with the same penalties that private enterprise exercises.

HEADLINE: For Albany, the One Constant Is a Late Budget 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
You would think no one had ever enacted a state budget before.
 Over the last several years, Gov. George E. Pataki of New York and legislative leaders have repeatedly put new obstacles in the path to budget deals, found new reasons to jettison the way things were done before, and set records for lateness. The result is an annual, fruitless search for a new approach they all can live with. 
 "I've started saying lately that New York State does not have a budget process, because whatever you think the process is, next year you're wrong," said Frank J. Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy Group, which studies state finances.
The latest twist was this week's announcement by Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Assembly speaker, and Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican Senate majority leader, that the Legislature will pass a budget next week that is stripped to the bone. They plan to leave out most everything they and the Republican governor care deeply about -- increased aid to schools, tax cuts, money for toxic-waste cleanups, pork-barrel projects. All of that would be decided later, in a supplemental budget.
Will that supplement be negotiated with the governor? Will it be one bill or many? Will lawmakers wait until after September's quarterly revenue report? All involved admit wearily that they do not know, raising the prospect that this fight could still be under way when the maple trees around the Capitol lose their leaves.
"It gets more convoluted each time," said Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission. "It's like they come up with new ways each year to mess it up, and then they need to come up with some new trick or threat each year to force themselves to make a budget."
Though the state is on a 17-year streak of late budgets, the national record by far, it was not until the mid-1990's that the process spun out of control. Lawmakers set a new state record for being dilatory in 1994, completing the budget on June 8; the next year they went to June 7.
In 1996, Mr. Pataki became the first governor in memory to hold up a budget over a nonbudget issue -- reform of worker's compensation insurance -- and a new record was set, July 13. In 1997, Mr. Silver held up the budget to win renewal of rent control laws, producing another record: Aug. 4, 126 days late, by far the tardiest any state has been since the Depression, if not longer.
In 1998, for the first time, the Senate and Assembly met in conference committees to work out a budget publicly. They largely ignored the governor, increasing spending far more than he wanted to, and Mr. Pataki retaliated with more than 1,000 line-item vetoes. Ever since, Mr. Silver has insisted that the governor take part in budget talks.
In 1999, Mr. Pataki said his work was done when he proposed his budget in January, and he refused to negotiate with the Legislature, another departure from tradition. He eventually relented, but lawmakers still managed to tie the Aug. 4 record. Of the last eight years, only last year produced a relatively rancor-free budget, completed on May 5.
This year, Mr. Pataki has again said that he would not negotiate, this time holding fast to that position. The Assembly Democrats, who want to exceed the governor's plan by more than $2 billion, refuse to convene conference committees without reassurances that the governor will use his veto power sparingly. Legislators concluded this week that they faced the prospect of no budget at all, only a series of stopgap spending bills.
The budget follies are an extension of New York's unique, long-running brand of government dysfunction, where deep partisan divisions and personal animosities between governors and legislative leaders have been taken for granted since the 1970's. And there, some observers think, lies the problem.
For 26 years, the Democrats have controlled the Assembly, while the Republicans have held the Senate. No state has ever had divided control of its Legislature for so long.
"In most states, you'll see divided control when a dominant party temporarily loses one house, or because there's a gradual transition from one party dominating to another," said Robert Kurtter, vice president for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service. "Only in New York is this a permanent condition. That has allowed them to become more and more entrenched in their positions."
But what has changed is the way governors interact with the Legislature, partly because of conference committees and Mr. Pataki's insistence on standing outside the process. Until the 1970's, legislative leaders tended to be more deferential to the governor. But under Govs. Hugh L. Carey and Mario M. Cuomo, Democratic Assembly speakers often made common cause with the Senate and defied governors of their own party. Mr. Bruno, though sometimes tempted, has not turned his back on Mr. Pataki in that way.
Practical considerations have added to New York's woes. Democrats and Republicans are, in fact, far apart on spending for schools and health care. And budget analysts point to structural safeguards that some other states have, like requiring the comptroller to set the official revenue estimate when the governor and Legislature cannot agree.
"But if you think those kinds of things are the problem, you're fooling yourself," Ms. Fortuna said. "There's obviously something deeper that's wrong here. I mean, 49 other states manage to pull it off without making such a spectacle of themselves."

HEADLINE: U.S. ECONOMY GREW AT A SNAIL'S PACE IN SPRING QUARTER 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27 

 BODY:
Economic growth nearly halted in the second quarter, as businesses made severe cuts in investment and consumer spending grew less quickly than it had at the start of the year, the government said today.
 The economy is now in its weakest condition since early 1993, although most economists say that companies' swift responses to the slowdown, combined with a tax cut and declining interest rates, have made an improvement likely in the coming months. 
 The economy grew at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 0.7 percent in the three months that ended on June 30, the Department of Commerce reported in its initial estimate of the quarter's economic activity. Overall spending by businesses and consumers actually fell slightly, but a surge in spending by state and local governments allowed the nation's longest recorded expansion to extend into its 11th year.
Still, from the middle of 2000 to the middle of this year, the economy grew just 1.3 percent, less than a third the rate of the late 1990's and the slowest 12-month pace in nearly 10 years. 
"The economy is puttering along -- it's not nearly as strong as it should be," President Bush told members of the Future Farmers of America today, adding his expectation that the tax cut he championed would provide "an incredibly important boost to economic vitality and economic growth."
Stocks fell slightly today, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 38.96 points, to 10,416.67, on moderate trading. Bond prices rose slightly, as analysts said the new data further increased the chance that the Federal Reserve would encourage more borrowing and spending by lowering its benchmark interest rate at least once more this year.
The most encouraging sign in today's report, analysts said, was a decline in business inventories of $26.9 billion, or roughly 0.5 percent, nearly the same size as the first-quarter decrease. Having cut prices to sell the excess goods that began piling up last year, many companies will soon be able to increase production again, economists said. 
"Companies have been pretty aggressive, getting rid of inventory, cutting back on capital spending and firing people by the bucketful," said Ian Shepherdson, the chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. "It's not a process that's finished, though I think it will slow."
The current slowdown began last year amid rising energy prices and interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve to ward off inflation. Many executives and investors, meanwhile, had decided that they were overly optimistic about the profits that the Internet could bring. Their newfound pessimism caused stocks to fall, hurting consumers' balance sheets, and led companies to halt new investments almost immediately.
From December to March, business investment in new buildings, equipment and software fell slightly, but it plummeted in the latest quarter, falling at an annual rate of 13.6 percent. As recently as a year earlier, it had grown more than 10 percent, as it did for much of the late 90's.
But the country appears to have avoided a recession so far, largely because consumers continue to increase their spending on new homes, cars and other items even as companies eliminate thousands of jobs. The long shopping spree has been financed by growing incomes, rising levels of household debt and housing values and stock prices that on the whole remain significantly higher than in the late 90's.
A separate report published today by the Commerce Department showed that new-home sales rose 1.7 percent in June, to 922,000 units at an annualized rate. 
Overall consumer spending increased 2.1 percent in the second quarter, down from 3 percent in the first quarter; that was the smallest rise since 1997, the Commerce Department said. But because consumer purchases account for more than two-thirds of the gross domestic product, the small increase nearly canceled out the corporate cutbacks. The rise in government spending -- a result of projects started in headier times -- enabled the economy to grow slightly.
Most economists on Wall Street and at the Fed expect the second quarter to be an economic low point. This month, the government started mailing nearly $40 billion in tax refund checks, and it has also started taking less money out of the paychecks of many Americans, particularly those with high-paying jobs. In addition, energy prices have fallen in recent weeks, and the Fed has lowered a crucial interest rate by 2.75 percentage points since January.
As a result, consumers should be able to continue increasing their spending even as unemployment rises in the coming months, most economists say. The economy will grow at an annual rate of about 3 percent over the next year and a half, according to a survey by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter based in Kansas City, Mo.
For now, though, there are few signs of strength, and analysts said that further slowing remained a significant risk. 
The 13.6 percent decline in business spending was the largest since 1982 and has become more broad based than it was earlier in the slowdown. In addition to reducing their spending on new equipment and software for the third straight quarter, companies cut spending on new warehouses, factories and other structures by 11.2 percent. In the first quarter, such spending rose 12.3 percent. 
While old-line manufacturers have grown somewhat more optimistic in recent weeks, technology companies continue to announce cutbacks, and their executives say they still do not know when business will improve. This week, Alcatel, Hewlett-Packard and Lucent Technologies announced more layoffs.
If job reductions do not begin to slow in coming months, consumer spending could decline as it did in 1991, rather than merely grow slowly, as it has in recent months. Further stock market declines are another risk, analysts said.
Today's Commerce Department report also included the government's annual revisions to earlier data, and they showed that the economy actually grew 4.1 percent, not 5 percent, last year. Corporate profits grew 6.2 percent, not 10.5 percent, during the year.
Based on the new numbers, said Dean Baker, the co-director of the Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington, "price-to-earnings ratios in the stock market are still close to double their historical level, even after the decline of the last 15 months."
A survey released today suggested that consumers remained wary of the economy's health, though they were more upbeat than they had been in the spring. Conducted by the University of Michigan, the poll showed that its index of consumer sentiment -- which is calculated from answers to questions about the economy's current state and expectations for the future -- fell slightly, to 92.4 this month, from 92.6 in June. 
The 49-year-old index reached a record high of 112 in January of 2000 and dropped to a low of 88.4 in April of this year. 
The Commerce Department report also showed that a broad measure of inflation -- one that the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, has called important -- fell to 1.5 percent in the second quarter, from 2.7 percent in the first three months of the year. Exports fell 9.9 percent, compared with a 1.2 percent drop in the first quarter; imports decreased 6.7 percent, down from a 5.0 fall.
As more detailed data arrives in government offices over the coming months, the Commerce Department will adjust the quarterly statistics, and the period could eventually show an overall economic decline. 
As it stands, the 0.7 percent growth rate was the lowest since the first quarter of 1993, when output fell 0.1 percent. That decline was too small and too brief to be considered an interruption of the current expansion, which began in early 1991 after three consecutive quarters of contraction.

China Feud Has New Risks For Taiwan

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, July 27 

 BODY:
In a sign that Taiwan's political standoff with China is starting to alienate its corporate customers, Dell Computer has criticized the reluctance of the authorities on Taiwan to establish direct trade and transportation ties with the Chinese mainland.
 Max Fang, Dell's senior representative in Taipei, the island's capital, said he told senior economic and trade officials last week, "How can you expect to be an Asia-Pacific procurement center if you are isolated from the biggest market in the region?" 
 The president of Taiwan, Chen Shui-bian, has been under increasing pressure from industrialists there to establish direct links with China. But this is the first time that a foreign company has joined in the call. 
Dell, based in Austin, Tex., is no ordinary foreign company. It is the largest buyer of laptop computers from Taiwan's suppliers, ordering 3.5 million to 4 million machines this year.
Taiwan has built its economy over the last two decades by becoming the subcontractor of choice for the global computer industry. Companies there make 53 percent of the world's laptops and 25 percent of desktop PC's. Most are sold under American brand names like Compaq, Gateway and Dell.
"Dell is just looking for the best way to do business," said Horace Tsiang, chief executive of First International Computer, a PC maker in Taipei. "They've been the price leader; they want to stay the price leader."
As if to underline its point, Dell moved its top procurement executive to Hong Kong earlier this year. The executive, Robert Shanks, said he wanted to be closer to plants on the Chinese mainland, most of them owned by Taiwan companies, that manufacture Dell desktop and laptop computers.
"The lack of a direct flight between Taipei and Shanghai is a big disadvantage," said Mr. Shanks, who scouted Taipei before settling here. "They will lose out over time if they don't change the situation."
The political gulf between Taipei and Beijing means that travelers from Taiwan to mainland China must go through Hong Kong. That turns a 90-minute hop into all-day travel. Similarly, components made in factories in China must be routed through Hong Kong, on their way to Taiwan.
Officials in Taipei acknowledge that direct trade and transportation links with China are inevitable. The question is when, and the answer depends on political rather than economic calculations.
China is eager for such links, expecting that this will stimulate its economy and accelerate the integration of Taiwan and the mainland. But the Chinese leaders, who call Taiwan a renegade province, insist that Mr. Chen recognize a single China, governed in Beijing.
In January, when Mr. Chen authorized trade and transportation between the mainland and two outlying islands -- Kinmen, known in cold war times as Quemoy, and Matsu -- Beijing dismissed this as an empty gesture. Mr. Chen is reluctant to make a grander gesture to Beijing, feeling that the Communist officials have scarcely acknowledged his existence.
"If the P.R.C. is willing to talk to us, the links can happen," said John C. C. Deng, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council of Taiwan. "If they stick to their current position, they won't happen."
For the last few months, Mr. Deng has been making the rounds of Taiwan and foreign technology companies, listening to their concerns about relations across the Taiwan Strait. Today, he had lunch with Mr. Fang of Dell.
"Dell is our customer and we treasure that relationship," Mr. Deng said. "But on the issue of direct links, I think we recognize that there are some things we can control, and other things we cannot control."
Within two weeks, Mr. Deng said, Taiwan will relax its restrictions on trade with the mainland to allow cargo shipped from the south China city of Xiamen to be unloaded in southern Taiwan, transferred to the Taipei airport, and exported to the United States or Europe by plane.
The rules are aimed at foreign computer companies, which use air shipments for components that are needed quickly in their home markets. Mr. Deng said routing air cargo through Taipei instead of mainland airports would save two days.
Direct flights are a thornier issue, he said, because they involve granting landing rights to flag carriers. That raises the dispute over sovereignty involving Taipei and Beijing, separated since Mao Zedong's victory over the Chinese Nationalists in 1949.
Dell executives show little patience for the diplomatic nuances. They are laboring in a fiercely competitive industry, during an economic downturn, when extracting the lowest prices from contractors is critical.
"Nobody talks about Communism versus capitalism," Mr. Tsiang of First International Computer said. "They just think of where they can get the lowest cost."
The risk for Taiwan, he said, is that it will lose not just low-end manufacturing, which is gravitating toward the cheap labor market in China, but research and development. Companies might prefer to keep such operations on Taiwan, but their bosses are put off by the roundabout trip across the Taiwan Strait.
Mr. Shanks of Dell would not say how much of the company's manufacturing is done in mainland Chinese factories. But companies like First International are building plants near Shanghai to produce laptop computers. Already, the bulk of scanners, and half the disk drives, sold by Taiwan companies are made in China.
"We're migrating more and more to China," Mr. Shanks said. "The soft economy may be accelerating that."
Dell's decision to put its procurement headquarters in Hong Kong is a little triumph for the city, a special administrative region of China and until 1997 a British crown colony.
But it may be a fleeting one. Mr. Shanks said that Dell had set up offices in other cities, including Shanghai, where much of the investment in technology is flowing. As Shanghai becomes even more of a technology magnet, Mr. Shanks said he could foresee relocating from Hong Kong.
"This is business, so we don't let emotion get in the way," he said.

HEADLINE: Antitrust Challenge Stops United Merger With US Airways 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
United Airlines' $4.3 billion bid to acquire US Airways died yesterday after the Justice Department said it would go to court to block the deal. The government asserted that the proposed takeover would "reduce competition, raise fares and harm consumers" on airline routes across the country.
 Shortly after the government's announcement, US Airways, a unit of the US Airways Group, said it would no longer pursue the transaction. 
 "While disappointed that the merger with United will not go forward, we nevertheless must respect the Justice Department's decision," a US Airways statement said. 
United's parent, the UAL Corporation, also issued a statement, saying, "UAL Corporation and US Airways have terminated their merger agreement."
The government's opposition to the deal did not come as a surprise, and analysts said it seemed to indicate antitrust enforcement in the Bush administration would not differ much from the approach taken by the Justice Department under President Bill Clinton.
"There was a naive sense on the part of people who don't pay attention to antitrust that Republicans would differ a lot from Democrats when it came to enforcing antitrust laws," said Jeff Eisenach, president of the Progress and Freedom Foundation, a free-market research organization based in Washington.
"The challenge in the US Airways case was to see whether there was a way around some fairly substantial market power issues," he added. "What this indicates is, first, that those attempts were not successful and second, just any old merger won't fly under the Bush administration." 
Steven C. Sunshine, who from 1993 to 1995 served as the Justice Department's deputy assistant attorney general for merger enforcement, said: "I don't think this administration will be as aggressive on all fronts as its predecessor. But in mainstream merger cases they are going to continue to bring cases."
Wall Street analysts said the collapse of the proposed takeover removes what could have been a financial albatross for UAL, which along with much of the airline industry is suffering losses. And it once again raises questions about the strategy US Airways will pursue to remain viable.
Signs that the deal was in serious trouble had popped up repeatedly. Earlier this month, UAL tried to stop the merger, fearing regulators would block the deal. US Airways persuaded United to wait for a government announcement.
Had United pulled out of the merger before Aug. 1, when the offer was scheduled to terminate, US Airways could have sued UAL for reneging on the takeover agreement. Under the terms of the merger agreement, United is obligated to pay US Airways a $50 million breakup fee.
The proposed deal had faced fierce opposition from a wide swath of critics -- including consumer groups, competitors and members of Congress -- ever since the agreement was struck 14 months ago.
Essentially, the groups feared the anticompetitive effects of combining United, the nation's second-biggest airline, with No. 6 US Airways.
"This merger would have led to a consolidated U.S. domestic aviation market of three megacarriers," said Representative Louise M. Slaughter, a Democrat who represents the Rochester area. "Fliers would have been forced to pay sky-high fares and with fewer planes in fewer markets."
The Justice Department essentially agreed with that assessment. 
"The acquisition would give United a monopoly or duopoly on nonstop service over 30 routes," the government said, "where consumers spend over $1.6 billion annually, and substantially limit the competition it faces on numerous other routes representing over $4 billion in revenues."
Robert Litan, vice president and director for economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said the "level of public hostility to the merger was larger than either of the parties anticipated at the outset."
"Congress doesn't tell Justice what to do, but it does provide strong background music," he continued.
When the deal was announced, United said the combination would allow millions of travelers in the Northeast, where US Airways is strong, to tap into its vast network of flights to the Midwest and West Coast and, on partner airlines, to Europe and Asia. The airline also pledged not to raise fares on some domestic routes for at least two years except for price increases needed to cover inflation and higher fuel costs.
But United, which would have assumed more than $7 billion in US Airways' debt along with paying out $4.3 billion in cash, would have been hard pressed to honor those promises. The company reported a loss of $292 million in the second quarter and analysts say it is on track to post the biggest annual loss in the industry's history. 
"A year is a long time in the airline business, and many things have changed since the merger was first proposed," said Samuel C. Buttrick, an airline analyst at UBS Warburg. "United's ability to finance a patently overpriced merger was increasingly questionable." 
In its statement, United said it would "continue to focus on its core business plan of restoring profitability, providing its customers with the highest levels of customer service and reliability and completing outstanding labor contracts." 
US Airways, which at various points suggested it could not survive as an independent carrier, said in its statement it would be "moving forward with a plan to address the competitive environment," adding that "details of that plan will be announced soon."
In the short term, analysts said the strategy would revolve around ways to save money.
"Like every other airline, US Airways has to conserve cash," said Glenn Engel, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. "That means they will probably eliminate service in nonhub cities. But there are no easy fixes for US Airways. Their markets are more under attack than most, both from low-fare airlines and the big ones that have more regional jets than they do." 
Michael J. Linenberg, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said: "US Airways now has to look very seriously at pursuing their long-term plan of becoming a global carrier. Carving up the company, as some have suggested, will not work. The airline faces a very challenging future."
Fallout from the collapse of the deal extended beyond United and US Airways.
In January, American Airlines, a unit of the AMR Corporation, said it would buy 20 percent of US Airways from United. In a statement issued yesterday, it said the failed agreement ended its plan to buy a piece of the airline. 
And the deal's termination ends the aviation career of Robert L. Johnson before it began. Mr. Johnson, the founder of the Black Entertainment Television, had planned to acquire US Airway's Washington business, forming a new carrier, D.C. Air. 
Shares of UAL shares closed at $33.63, down 29 cents. US Airways fell 89 cents, to $17.26.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home; 
The Vision Thing

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY LEWIS 

 BODY:
In 1969 President Nixon renounced the development or use of biological weapons. It was an act of enlightened self-interest. He understood that the wealth and power of the United States could not protect us from weapons that are cheap to make and terrifyingly deadly, so safety lay in persuading the world to eschew them. He then led the way to a 1972 treaty banning the development, production or possession of biological weapons.
 This week President Bush wiped out eight years of effort on a protocol to enforce the 1972 treaty. At a negotiating session in Geneva, the American delegate rejected a draft text that all others had accepted. 
 The Bush administration could have called for further negotiations to improve the draft protocol. But the U.S. negotiator, Donald A. Mahley, said the administration did not think it could be fixed. That effectively killed the project.
The protocol called for limited international inspection of sites suspected of involvement in biological weaponry. The Bush administration made two arguments against it: that the system would not be effective, and that it would give foreigners too much access to U.S. bio-defense installations and pharmaceutical plants.
The second argument sent a dangerous signal to the rest of the world -- that despite American ratification of the 1972 treaty there are still people in the U.S. Defense Department working on ideas for biological warfare. That can only encourage others to think about new biological weapons.
Administration officials told correspondents that they were looking for other ways to strengthen the 1972 treaty. One idea they mentioned was to toughen export controls on the sale of sophisticated germ-producing equipment. But experts dismissed that notion as laughable, because toxins arise in nature and can be produced without sophisticated equipment.
In any event, there is no sign that the Bush administration is actually working on alternatives in a serious way. The attempt to make sure that the biological genie stays in the bottle is essentially dead for now. Without U.S. participation, nothing meaningful can happen.
That he is working on a better way of accomplishing the objective after denouncing an international agreement has become a familiar claim from Mr. Bush. He took exactly that line after rejecting the Kyoto agreement on global warming.
"Our nation will come up with a strategy," Mr. Bush said on the global warming issue last week. "We're in the process of developing one. I can't be any more sincere than I have been in saying that we need to reduce greenhouse gases, and we'll work on a plan to do so."
But in fact alternative ways of dealing with global warming are not under active study at the higher reaches of the Bush administration. Reports from Washington say there is no pressure from the top for urgent action.
Mr. Bush's position against the biological warfare protocol was familiar in another respect. Once again, under his presidency, the United States was all alone on a global issue. So it was, also, last week on an effort to negotiate limits on small-arms sales that feed civil wars and terrorism. On the Kyoto treaty, The New York Times headline nicely summed it up: "178 Nations Reach a Climate Accord; U.S. Only Looks On."
Underlying Mr. Bush's response on these matters there is a failure of vision. He takes a parochial view, driven by ideology and a narrow sense of where American interests lie. But in today's close-knit world our interests cannot be so easily separated from global needs.
Thus on global warming Mr. Bush says that he cannot accept controls that might burden the American economy. But it is the very nature of the problem that it cannot be solved unless the most productive economies reorder their use of energy and their emission of greenhouse gasses. An economy free of measures to reduce warming effects will not give us much joy, decades from now, if New York and Boston are under water.
On biological weapons, similarly, parochial interests of low-level Defense Department and pharmaceutical company officials were allowed to make the running. (Nor, to be fair, did President Clinton provide high-level leadership on the issue.) On sales of small arms, the Bush administration simply bowed to the National Rifle Association. There was no broader vision of our interests in a world less beset by AK-47's and their ilk.
"Where there is no vision," the Bible says, "the people perish." Perhaps literally.

HEADLINE: Badillo Says He'll Safeguard Progress of the Giuliani Era 

BYLINE:  By MIRTA OJITO 

 BODY:
Herman Badillo, a Republican mayoral candidate, said yesterday that he would govern New York almost exactly the way Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had to protect the "dramatic improvements that have taken place" in the last eight years.
 Mr. Badillo said there would be only stylistic differences between a Badillo and a Giuliani administration. He said he would keep at least two of Mr. Giuliani's commissioners, Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik and Nicholas Scoppetta, the commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services. 
 "Rudy has proven that the city is manageable. Rudy has proven that standards can be changed," Mr. Badillo said. 
"I think that the people of New York City give him overwhelming approval on his job performance," he added. "They don't necessarily give him overwhelming approval on his style of doing things, but everybody has a different style. So I don't think that's what counts. I think what counts is his performance, and that's what I would follow."
Without giving examples of how his style would differ, Mr. Badillo nevertheless said that he would reduce taxes, even if the economic slump threatened to reduce city revenues. He said that he would not give automatic tax breaks to businesses to keep them here.
He would change the police force's racial composition, which he identified as "the root cause of the tension" between the predominantly white force and many New Yorkers, especially Latinos and blacks. And he would require schoolchildren to take standardized tests beginning in first grade to make sure they can read and write. While some of these policies closely track those that Mr. Giuliani has pursued, others, such as the approach to tax breaks, suggest that Mr. Badillo would go in a different direction.
He also said he would favor abolishing the Board of Education and would ask for the resignation of Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, whom he accused of failing to enforce uniform standards for all public school children. He emphasized increasing the enrollment of children in public health insurance plans. 
Mr. Badillo described his vision of city government and his mayoral ambitions in a 90-minute interview with reporters and editors of The New York Times.
Mr. Badillo declared himself an unabashed fan of Mr. Giuliani. The mayor campaigned with him when Mr. Badillo was a candidate for comptroller on the mayor's fusion ticket in 1993 and appointed him his special counsel to oversee school finances. The other five candidates -- Michael R. Bloomberg, a Republican; and the four Democrats, Mark Green, the city's public advocate; Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller; Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president; and Peter F. Vallone, the speaker of the City Council -- have gone to different lengths to distance themselves from the mayor. 
In contrast to Mr. Ferrer, who was interviewed by The Times on Thursday, Mr. Badillo did not sketch out a laundry list of government programs. He wants City Hall to enforce standards in education, public safety and economic development that he said had worked in the past. A back-to-basics approach for him is one in which teachers and children are held accountable, police officers come from the same streets they patrol and everybody gets along just by following the cues from a mayor who is both an American and a Latino.
"I have one advantage because as a Puerto Rican, I cannot be accused of being a racist effectively," he said. "Because it's clear that since I went through all these things myself, I'm not out to hurt one group or another. And I want everyone to work together."
His ideas -- from education to housing to health -- are visceral. Mr. Badillo, who turns 72 in August, frequently culled incidents from every stage of his life and four-decade career as accountant, lawyer, housing commissioner, borough president, member of Congress, deputy mayor and, until recently, chairman of the board of trustees of the City University of New York.
When Mr. Badillo talked about providing health insurance for all, he mentioned that his parents died by the time he was 5, both victims of tuberculosis. When he talked about the need for bilingual education, he recalled his difficulties in understanding his teachers when he arrived in New York at age 11 as a Spanish-speaker. When he talked about reducing class sizes, eliminating social promotion and increasing teachers' salaries, he reached for the experiences of his wife, who teaches a class of 36 seventh graders at Robert F. Wagner Junior High School on the Upper East Side.
Mr. Badillo contrasted his vast experience with that of his opponent, Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire who has never held public office.
"He has ideas that are written down," Mr. Badillo said. "But you don't know what ideas he has until he debates me. I don't have anything in front of me. You see? No teleprompter, nothing. It's in here," he said, pointing to his head.
William Cunningham, an adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, said there would be debates between the two candidates before the Sept. 11 primary. But, he added, Mr. Bloomberg has been taking his ideas directly to the voters since he announced his candidacy.
Though Mr. Badillo spent much of his time talking about how he would reform the school system, he said public safety was his first priority, closely followed by education, health and housing issues.
Mr. Badillo said that he would work to keep crime down, as Mr. Giuliani had done, but that he would pay close attention to how the police were trained. He would require all 40,000 police officers to undergo sensitivity training paid by the city, he said.
On education, Mr. Badillo said he would require a written explanation for every teacher who was not working in the classroom so that he could find out why class sizes were so large and reduce them. He called social promotion immoral and described it as the root of many evils, including an overwhelming number of people on welfare, a lack of qualified workers and an overreliance on outsiders to fill job vacancies in the city. 
"In Puerto Rico, where I come from, you go to school, you do your work, you pass; if you don't, you flunk," he said. "In New York City, if you do your work, you pass. If you don't do your work, you pass.
"And they said this was because it was sociologically bad for a child to be left behind," he went on. "But I said then and I say now that it's sociologically worse for a child to be 17 years old and not be able to read and write and do arithmetic."
On the subject of balancing the city budget while reducing taxes, Mr. Badillo returned to the theme of educational reforms.
"More important than anything else is ensuring that our kids learn in school because if we don't get our population to go for jobs, then welfare increases," he said. "And then we have the same problems, so it's important to train the people so they can go to jobs so we can cut welfare, which is one of the departments that uses up a huge amount of our money."
But he also said that, if necessary, he would make cuts across the board, reducing the budget of every department by 5 or 10 percent in consultation with every commissioner. He did not rule out cuts in the Police Department and the schools.
To improve the housing situation, Mr. Badillo, not unlike the Democrats, said he would use city money to build homes. Asked how he would finance a housing boom, Mr. Badillo said that he would choose to use the revenues from the lease of the World Trade Center to build more housing.
"We have the money for bond issues," he said. "The choice always is: use it for business or use it for housing. In the past it's been used mostly for business because they figure it brings more jobs. But housing brings jobs too. And it also brings stability."
Unlike the Democrats, Mr. Badillo said the houses would be owned by the people who live in them, not by the city. Ownership, he contended, would help break a cycle of poverty and spur a desire to do better.
"So if I'm a Puerto Rican kid born at 113th Street and Lexington Avenue, I live in a society where everybody's poor. Why is everybody poor? Because only the poor can live in low-income housing," he said.
"And then everybody who has any authority -- policemen, firemen, bankers, teachers -- they're not Puerto Rican, so I get the impression that somehow we're not as good as anyone else," Mr. Badillo added.
He dismissed Mr. Ferrer's notion that there were two New Yorks, one that had benefited from Mr. Giuliani's tenure and one that had not. He stressed that, because crime had declined significantly, everyone had benefited, especially blacks and Latinos who tend to live in high-crime areas.
"I came here looking for opportunity with no parents, no money, no language, and I found it because the opportunity was there," he said. "And what irks me is that opportunity has diminished. That's not because there's another New York. It's because we have not ensured that the equal opportunity, which everyone should have, is provided. And that's what I would do."

HEADLINE: Contract Deal For Workers In Uniform 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration has agreed to a tentative contract that would give firefighters, sanitation workers and other uniformed city employees a raise of more than 10 percent over two-and-a-half years, a pact that is more generous than one recently negotiated with the city's civilian workers.
 The pact with the 50,000 members of the Uniformed Forces Coalition, announced yesterday by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, signals that the city and its unions are no longer adhering to their practice of pattern bargaining, in which all the unions get roughly the same deal. 
 The agreement, which also covers correction officers and high-ranking police officers, still leaves open the fate of contracts for teachers and city police officers whose rank is below detective. Talks with the teachers' union have proven the most sensitive, as it has been pushing for large wage increases to counter what the union says is an exodus of teachers. 
The agreement, reached Thursday night, covers a period of 30 months starting in August 2000 and provides 5 percent wage increases in each of two years, and then a 1.5 percent discretionary fund to finance specific benefits for the different unions, officials said.
The deal comes two months after District Council 37, the city's largest municipal labor union, ratified a contract that covers 27 months and provides two 4 percent increases. Union officials yesterday were careful to say that each organization had negotiated what its members needed.
Norman Seabrook, the president of the correction officers' union and the coalition's chairman, said that he had hoped the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which represents police officers, would join his organization in unified bargaining. But he said that Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the P.B.A., "feels that he has the best agenda for his members, and God bless him for that."
Negotiations between the Giuliani administration and the police union have been at a standstill. The P.B.A. has asked the state Public Employment Relations Board, known as PERB, to declare an impasse and begin to mediate the dispute, but the city has continued to challenge that body's jurisdiction over the negotiations. 
Labor officials said yesterday that the agreement could hurt the P.B.A. before the state board, because its fellow unions had already settled for an amount below the 39 percent increase over two years that it is seeking.
But Robert Linn, the chief negotiator for the P.B.A., rejected that view, saying that the other unions could not establish that their members were as underpaid as police officers.
And Mr. Lynch said, "The P.B.A. expects that, either at the bargaining table or through the PERB arbitration process, New York City police officers will achieve fair compensation that addresses the crucial recruitment and retention crisis." 
The agreement, which the mayor said would cost the city $100 million to $150 million more than the current budget allows, comes at a time when the administration is facing the possibility of receiving $200 million to $300 million less in state aid than expected and at a time when the economy is slowing. 
Fiscal monitors and observers said yesterday that the city could face difficulties if the P.B.A. did win a higher settlement because the other unions might well come back to the bargaining table next time with greater demands.
In announcing the deal, the mayor said that the city would institute $500 million in spending reductions and revenue enhancements to cover the cost of the agreement and to make up for an anticipated shortfall in state aid. The administration will send out letters next week asking the city's uniformed agencies to reduce their budgets by 4 percent and the other agencies to reduce theirs by 8 percent, but will not seek cuts from the Board of Education, said Adam L. Barsky, director of the city's office of management and budget.
Mr. Giuliani said that it was appropriate to pay the uniformed employees more than the civilians because they risked their lives and had been key to the city's turnaround. And he said that the budget program would allow the city to afford the labor agreement without leaving the next mayor in a fiscal bind.
"We're going to go ahead and we're going to save a lot more money than this program actually costs us," he said.
Mr. Giuliani, who has made merit pay a signature issue in his negotiations with the city's unions, said that he was pleased the administration had been able to get the "merit language that was so important to us" into the contract.
But union leaders played down the provision, with leaders of the police union covered in the new pact saying that there is already a form of merit pay in the department, known as special assignment money, that is given out in a discretionary manner to employees above the rank of officer. Officials at District Council 37 have also maintained that their merit pay agreement simply codified what was already in practice.
Mr. Seabrook said that the contract would be ratified by the members within about two weeks. If the contract is approved, he said, it would expire in the beginning of 2003.
"In no time at all," he said, "we'll be back in here negotiating a contract with the next mayor of the city of New York, and the coalition will stick together and we will try to obtain the best for them at that time."

HEADLINE: Powell Says U.S. Wants to Resume Talks With North Korea 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, July 27 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said today that United States officials were prepared to go anywhere at any time of North Korea's choosing to resume talks on a variety of issues, including ending North Korea's missile program and the heavy deployment of its conventional forces on the border with South Korea. 
 The offer, made as Secretary Powell stood next to South Korea's foreign minister, Han Seung Soo, emphasized that the Bush administration stood behind Seoul's policy of reconciliation with the North. 
 Relations between Washington and Seoul were strained early this year when the Bush administration signaled a harder line on North Korea and declined to pursue negotiations begun under the Clinton administration, pending a policy review.
But in June, President Bush announced that the United States was ready to restart talks, in hopes of inducing North Korea to renounce its production and export of missiles and of reducing tensions on the peninsula. North and South Korea technically have remained in a state of war since the armistice ending the 1950-53 Korean conflict. 
The secretary's statement made clear that Washington was eager to hear from the North Koreans, who have yet to give a formal reply to the administration's offer.
"We are waiting for the North Koreans' response to our overtures," Secretary Powell said at a news conference here. "We can meet at a time and a place" of North Korea's choice, he added. "We have no preconditions."
Mr. Bush's announcement in June was followed by two low-level meetings between representatives for the United States and North Korea in New York. But Bush administration officials here said today that North Korea appeared to be stalling over full-fledged talks because of disagreements over the agenda.
Secretary Powell arrived here today for a short visit before heading to Beijing for the most important stop on his five-country tour of the region. Secretary Powell arrived in Beijing early Saturday. 
He is the first cabinet-level official to come here since Mr. Bush took office.
The secretary also said that he hoped the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, would visit Seoul before the end of the year.
Last year, Mr. Kim promised to come to the South by June as part of an agreement he made when South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, made his unprecedented trip to the North. But so far, the North Korean leader has given no sign of reciprocating. This week, Kim Jong Il, who rarely travels, surprised Washington and South Korea by deciding to visit Russia.
Mr. Kim, whose official title is chairman of the North Korean National Defense Commission, is on a train headed for Moscow and is expected to arrive there by Aug. 4. With no response yet to the American invitation to resume talks and no indication that he is ready to visit the South, Secretary Powell essentially appealed today to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, to intervene. 
"I think it would be very useful if President Putin and the other Russian leaders would point out to Chairman Kim the importance of resuming discussions with the United States," Secretary Powell said, "and that his economy is in a very terrible state, and he has a variety of problems." 
The secretary suggested that Mr. Putin should warn Mr. Kim of the "dangers inherent in some of the actions that the North Korean regime has taken over the years with respect to the development of weapons of mass destruction and the proliferation of such equipment."
One reason South Korean officials are concerned that the North Korean leader has yet to come to Seoul is that President Kim, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in part for his efforts at reconciliation with North Korea, is fast assuming lame duck status. His term ends next year, and he cannot run for re-election.
Foreign Minister Han interpreted Kim Jong Il's trip to Moscow as a positive development.
"The chairman has been to China twice and now he is in Russia," Mr. Han said, "and we believe that this is an indication of the North Korean's willingness to open up." 
Despite this upbeat interpretation, it was clear that North Korea was taking its time in reaching out to the South as well as to the United States. 
Secretary Powell said this week that the United States would have to be patient while North Korea went through its usual deliberate decision-making. The State Department had expected the North Korean foreign minister, Paek Nam Sun, to turn up in Hanoi, Vietnam, this week for the conference of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
But Mr. Paek canceled, and the North Korean government sent a lower-level Foreign Ministry official, Ho Jong. 
Speaking at the Asean conference, Mr. Ho took a harsh tone on the prospects for talks with the United States, said officials who heard him in the closed sessions. Secretary Powell did not have any substantive conversation with Mr. Ho but greeted him in a receiving line, a State Department official said.

HEADLINE: New Leader Chosen for Census Bureau 

BYLINE:  By Eric Schmitt

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27 

 BODY:
President Bush today nominated C. Louis Kincannon, a career statistician with a broad background of demographic research in the United States and Europe, to be the next director of the Census Bureau.
 If confirmed by the Senate, which is considered all but certain, Mr. Kincannon would assume control of the federal government's most visible statistical agency, where he worked on and off from 1963 to 1992, and was twice acting director. 
 "This is a sound, professional choice," said Kenneth W. Prewitt, who was the Census Bureau director during the Clinton administration.
 Representative Dan Miller, a Florida Republican who heads the House Government Reform Committee's Subcommittee on the Census, said, "To find someone more qualified would be difficult."
 Mr. Kincannon, 60, would take over at a time when the agency is in the middle of a three-year process of releasing data from the 2000 census, and is embroiled in a political furor over whether statistically adjusted population data should be used to draw Congressional and other legislative districts and to redistribute $185 billion a year in federal money to states and localities.
 Most Democrats and civil rights groups claim that adjusted data offer a better count of minorities than the actual head count data available now.
 In March, Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans agreed with a bureau recommendation not to adjust the 2000 population tally to account for millions of people who were not counted or were counted twice. Mr. Evans's decision is expected to prompt a flurry of court challenges. The Census Bureau is part of the Commerce Department.
 With Congress scheduled to begin a monthlong recess soon, it was unclear today whether the Senate would act on Mr. Kincannon's nomination in time for him to participate in the decision to release adjusted data for federal aid. Census officials will make that decision by Oct. 15.
 Democrats used the announcement about Mr. Kincannon today as a platform to accuse the Bush administration of suppressing data that formed the basis for the bureau's decision not to disclose adjusted data for areas as small as city blocks for all 50 states.
 "Under President Bush's leadership, the Census Bureau has turned into the Censor Bureau," said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York. "I hope that Mr. Kincannon will take this post with an open mind and a willingness to let statistical experts do their jobs, without political interference."
 Mr. Kincannon is currently chief statistician for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, and census experts said they expected him to bring fresh ideas from the O.E.C.D., an economic research organization for big industrial European counties.
 "He knows where the Europeans are being innovative and where we're not," Mr. Prewitt said.
 Described by friends as pragmatically low-key and apolitical, Mr. Kincannon is expected to lobby Congress to replace the decennial long-form census questionaire with an ongoing survey that supporters say will collect important demographic and socio-economic data in a more timely way for program and planning purposes.
 "Lou will bring some stability to Census Bureau, which, in the change of administrations, has been unable to clearly articulate its vision for the future." said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a private census consultant and former staff director of the House Subcommittee on the Census.

HEADLINE: Marching Through Georgia 

BYLINE:  By Victor Davis Hanson; Victor Davis Hanson, the author, most recently, of "Carnage and Culture," wrote about Sherman, Patton and the Theban general Epaminondas in "The Soul of Battle."

 BODY:
 SHERMAN
A Soldier's Life.
By Lee Kennett.
Illustrated. 426 pp. New York:
HarperCollins Publishers. $35.
 Between mid-November 1864 and April 1865, William Tecumseh Sherman cut his supply lines and -- against standard military orthodoxy and the advice of the president, the secretary of war and General Grant -- set off with an army of over 60,000 Midwesterners into "the bowels of the Confederacy." "I can make Georgia howl," he promised his superiors at the outset of the anabasis that shattered the pretensions of the secessionists and ruined the soul of the South.
In his trek into Georgia, Sherman, master of strategy, tactics and logistics, outfoxed one Confederate general, Joe Johnston, and battered another, John Bell Hood, to capture and burn Atlanta. He then turned east to the Atlantic Coast. After traversing 300 miles of Georgia countryside in a 60-mile-wide swath, he claimed to have destroyed $100 million of property, freed over 40,000 slaves and torched the plantations of the aristocracy and the public buildings of the Confederacy. Enraged Southerners called the charred chimneys of the plantations "Sherman's sentinels" and the iron rails wrapped around trees "Sherman neckties."
They abhorred him as an Attila or Alaric, and promised to slaughter his foragers and scatter his army in the same way the Cossacks had ruined Napoleon's forces retreating from Moscow. But the reality was far different. Nearly 50,000 Confederate troops in four widely separated armies under Generals Hood, Hardee, Wheeler and Bragg either fled from Sherman, ignored his advance or nipped at his heels while avoiding battle, as his dreaded and untouched army pulled into an abandoned Savannah.
In the dead of winter he headed northward through the Carolinas, the hotbed of secession, his army growing, not diminishing, amid the rain, mud and nearly impassable terrain. The war most likely ended at Appomattox not because Grant's army had necessarily whipped Lee's, but because Sherman's army of retribution, led by veterans from Michigan, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, with black pioneers flocking in from the plantations, was approaching Richmond -- causing mass defections of Southern soldiers who worried about their families and property, and their own chances of survival sandwiched between Grant and an army of Westerners that had never been defeated.
After leaving Atlanta -- Sherman's men saw the march down to Georgia as the first leg of a great crusade that would end in Richmond -- Sherman suffered nominal casualties and killed few Southerners. His columns of burners and pillagers committed very few rapes or murders, and his army was larger and in better health when it reached North Carolina than when it began. The Southern public put all that aside and hated Sherman with a fury that it had never shown Grant, the devourer of Southern manhood -- thus confirming Machiavelli's dictum that "men more quickly forget the death of their fathers than the loss of their patrimonies."
The contrast between Sherman and Grant and Lee could not be starker. As Sherman went south to discredit the Confederacy at little cost to his army, Grant rammed the Army of the Potomac head-on against Lee's entrenchments for most of the summer of 1864, nearly ruining it in the process, until a horrified Northern public was about ready for a brokered peace. 
Lee too had once launched a great invasion across the Mason-Dixon line, but unlike Sherman's, his fated expedition into the enemy's heartland ruined his own army, led to thousands of Union dead and prolonged the war instead of shortening it. Yet the slave-owning and dapper Lee was beloved despite the carnage at Gettysburg, while the slave-freeing and rough-looking Sherman, who ended the war at little cost in human life, was forever labeled a monster. Such is the paradox that any biographer of Sherman -- who spoke too candidly and wrote too much -- must address. 
Besides Lee Kennett's latest portrait, the last decade alone has witnessed three new biographies of Sherman, each seeking to capture the mystery of this strange American who more than any 19th-century figure reinvented the nature of warmaking and established the rules of modern conflict as we know it today -- as evidenced in the Persian Gulf and Balkan wars, where Americans sought to destroy the infrastructure that fueled the conflict rather than to kill enemy soldiers on the battlefield. John Marszalek's magisterial 1993 study saw Sherman, whose private life was chaotic at best, as devoted nevertheless to "order," a control freak who sought always to curb unruliness. In Michael Fellman's "Citizen Sherman," he is not a brilliant general but largely a racist, sexist and brutal white man who did more harm than good to blacks, American Indians and women. S. P. Hirshson's "White Tecumseh" sought to reconcile the alarming pronouncements of Sherman against the actual record and found him as competent and careful in action as he was reckless and extreme in word. 
Still, for all the new interpretations, neither Kennett nor any recent historian has matched B. H. Liddell Hart's brilliant 1929 biography, which rightly saw Sherman as the great strategist of the Civil War, who understood the true connection between the economy of a modern industrial state and its ability to make war. Liddell Hart, veteran of the carnage in the trenches of World War I, offered up the rambunctious and uncouth Sherman as the true humanist, who found a way, by burning rather than killing, to compel a recalcitrant enemy to concede while still alive. "This may seem a hard species of warfare," Sherman sighed at the conclusion of his great march, "but it brings the sad realities of war home to those who have been directly or indirectly instrumental in involving us in its attendant calamities."
Lee Kennett, the distinguished Civil War historian who previously wrote an engaging cultural study of the march through Georgia, offers no grand insights about Sherman's contribution to the Union victory or the history of war in general. But his biography is welcome for unexpected reasons. Kennett, a University of Georgia historian, writes as a Southerner who in re-examining much new archival material finds little atrocity in Sherman's marches and sees his war on property as largely within the confines of civilized conflict -- a far different appraisal than J. B. Walters's polemical "Merchant of Terror," which still vented Southern rage a century after Atlanta and Columbia, S.C., were ignited. As Kennett shows, the sense of restraint is all the more remarkable inasmuch as Sherman's army was run pretty much as a private army, with him its near dictator, careful to exclude reporters, commissioners and outside observers as he saw fit.
While Kennett carefully describes in excruciating detail all of Sherman's flaws -- contradictory positions, occasional sloppiness in tactical readiness and clever efforts to improve his own image at the expense of rivals -- he gives the controversial ravager grudging respect in curtailing rather than expanding the killing of desperate and outnumbered Confederate soldiers. Perhaps historians are recognizing what Sherman taught us: destroying an enemy's ability to wage war is more moral, and expeditious, than slaughtering its youth; civilians to the rear who advocate, plan and sometimes profit from war can be as culpable as conscripts who pull triggers under orders.
To Kennett, Sherman's wild mood swings, tantrums and controversies that have so bothered his biographers were a result of clinical narcissism, a mental illness of sorts coupled with his own strange childhood that fostered lifelong insecurity. Fatherless at 9, Sherman was adopted by the wealthy Ewing dynasty of Ohio. He married his stepsister Ellen, and for the rest of his life sought to please Thomas Ewing, a leading barrister of the day. Until 40, Sherman was guilt-stricken that he had not lived up to his wealthy benefactors or the meteoric success of his own brother, John, a senator from Ohio -- even as he freely used their influence to receive jobs, appointments and a chance at command in 1861. Kennett therein explains, in a sometimes dubious Freudian context, why the ostensibly modest Sherman spoke and acted in such a self-serving, contradictory and often childish fashion, and why he turned cold and uncaring to his family and friends during their deepest personal crises and losses. But explication of subconscious motive is not the same as appreciation of overt deed, and so we still await answers to the far more haunting and important question: How did such an unlikely man in a mere six months devise such a brilliant strategy to bring such a destructive war to a close?

HEADLINE: The Alchemy of OxyContin 

BYLINE:  By Paul Tough; Paul Tough is an editor for The Times Magazine.

 BODY:
Paula is taking me on a driving tour of Man, the tiny West Virginia town where she has spent her entire life. Because I don't know my way around the hollows and gullies and creeks that carve through these hills, Paula is at the wheel. And because Paula isn't a morning person, we've set out on our tour at midnight. It's dark; the only illumination comes from our headlights cutting through the mist that rolls down from the hills.
 The tour Paula is leading isn't sanctioned by the local chamber of commerce; there are no stops at Civil War plaques or scenic vistas. It's a pillhead tour: an addict's-eye view of the radical changes that a single prescription drug, called OxyContin, has brought to the town of Man. OxyContin abuse started in remote communities like this one more than two years ago; more recently, it has spread beyond its origins in Appalachia and rural Maine to affect cities and suburbs across the eastern United States. I came to Man to try to understand how America's latest drug problem started, to see its roots and trace how it has spread. 
 "That's my best friend's trailer right there," Paula says, pointing out a comfortable-looking single-wide across the creek. "She's somebody that you couldn't 
look at and know she was an oxy addict. She was a cheerleader in junior high. She's married. You can't just look at somebody and tell."
A few years ago, Paula says, Man was like any small town in America: you could buy a variety of illegal drugs, as long as you knew the right person to talk to. Pot was big; there was occasionally some cocaine around and a few pills for recreational use. Fads would come and go. But these days, she says, the only drug for sale in Man is OxyContin, a narcotic painkiller that users crush -- to disable its patented time-release mechanism -- and then snort or inject for a powerful and immediate opiate high. Legally, it's sold only by prescription for the treatment of chronic pain. In practice it's available just about everywhere around here, immediately, for cash. The going rate is a dollar a milligram, or $40 for a 40-milligram pill.
Paula is a thoughtful, good-natured 24-year-old with wispy blond hair, serious eyes and faded jeans. She's fidgety; as she drives with one hand, she's rummaging through her handbag with the other, looking for her pack of Marlboro Lights. She finds them, removes one and stabs the dashboard lighter. "I'll show you some places over here," she says, as she turns her car off the main road, over a short bridge and down into a rough indentation that holds a couple dozen trailers and prefab homes. "This is Green Valley. We just call it the valley. It's a pretty good neighborhood," she says, then interrupts herself. "Well, except that's a dealer there." 
She points to a trailer with a Chevy pickup out front and a light burning inside. I crane my neck to get a look at a real-life drug den, but the tour has already moved on. Paula is pointing out a trailer on the other side of the road: "That's a small-time dealer there, nothing big," she says. Then she points to another one, and then another: "That's a dealer. . . . That's a small-time dealer. . . . That's a dealer. . . . Her son's a dealer, but I don't know if he lives there. . . . He uses, that boy in there. . . . They use really, really big."
We're driving slowly around the circular dirt road that is the only path through Green Valley. The neighborhood doesn't feel dangerous -- no graffiti, no pit bulls, no broken bottles lying around. Still, Paula is pointing out criminal activity in every second home, peering through the front windshield and gesturing left and right: "They used to deal, too, but they don't no more. . . . They deal. . . . There's some dealers up through there, one or two, nothing big. . . . This boy that lives here deals. . . . They deal, in that trailer there." 
The first time Paula did an oxy (as she calls the pills), in the summer of 1999, it didn't do much for her. "That first 10-milligram pill, I didn't really feel nothing off it," she says. "But the second time I did it, I did two 20's, and I was high." She liked the effect. "When you get that oxy buzz," she says, "it's a great feeling. You're happy. Your body don't hurt. Nothing can bring you down. It's a high to where you don't have to think about nothing. All your troubles go away. You just feel like everything is lifted off your shoulders."
What Paula calls "that oxy buzz" comes from OxyContin's only active ingredient: oxycodone, an opioid, or synthetic opiate, developed in a German laboratory in 1916. Chemically, it is a close relative of every other opium derivative and synthetic: heroin, morphine, codeine, fentanyl, methadone. The narcotic effects that Paula is describing are the exact same ones that have drawn people to opiates for centuries. And just as every opiate does, oxycodone creates a physical dependence in most of its users and a powerful addiction in some of them. "At first you do them to get high," Paula says, "and then after you're addicted to them you don't do them to get high; you do them to survive. You do them to feel normal." At her peak, she says, she was snorting four or five 80-milligram pills a day.
The earliest reported cases of Oxycontin abuse were in rural Maine, rust-belt counties in western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio and the Appalachian areas of Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky. The problem traveled through these regions, as friends told friends and the word spread from town to town, county to county, up and down the Appalachians. There are a few defining characteristics that the first affected regions share: they're home to large populations of disabled and chronically ill people who are in need of pain relief; they're marked by high unemployment and a lack of economic opportunity; they're remote, far from the network of Interstates and metropolises through which heroin and cocaine travel; and they're areas where prescription drugs have been abused -- though in much smaller numbers -- in the past. "There's always been a certain degree of prescription drug abuse in this area," says Art Van Zee, a physician in Lee County, Va., "but there's never been anything like this. This is something that is very different and very new, and we don't understand all the reasons why. This is not just people who have long-term substance-abuse problems. In our region this is young teenagers, 13- and 14-year-olds, experimenting with recreational drug use and rapidly becoming addicted. Tens of thousands of opioid addicts are being created out there."
In Man, Paula said, it was like OxyContin came out of nowhere. One day no one had heard of oxys, and a month later, the pills had become a way of life for hundreds of locals. It became so easy to buy OxyContin in and around Man, Paula said, that until recently, she never really thought about the fact that everyone involved was breaking the law. "Buying pills never seemed illegal," she said. "It just didn't feel like it was wrong." There aren't lookouts involved, or secret passwords or elaborate drop sites: when Paula wants to buy an OxyContin pill, she simply drives to a dealer's house and knocks on the front door in broad daylight. If she knows the dealer well enough, she'll go on in and snort the pill there, just to be neighborly. If not, she'll hand over the cash, put the pill in her pocket and drive away. Sometimes she'll be the only person there; other times, there will be a dozen cars lined up out front.
The dealers have the benefit of a captive market: OxyContin, like any opioid, is very difficult to quit abusing. And given the pill's ubiquity here in Man, and the fact that the nearest rehab clinic is two hours away, this is an unusually hard place to quit using it. Nonetheless, Paula is trying. Six months ago, she and her best friend decided they were going to quit cold turkey. They took a couple of days off work, locked themselves in her friend's trailer and started to detox. "That was the worst three days of my life," Paula said. "Honestly, I prayed to God to let me die. That's how bad it is. Your stomach hurts, you get really bad headaches, you get diarrhea. You want to throw up. You get really depressed. If you can get past the third day or the fourth day, you're pretty much fine, but most people don't make it." Paula and her friend didn't make it: at the end of the third day, they went out and got a pill.
A few months ago, OxyContin abuse was considered a regional problem, labeled "hillbilly heroin" and confined to areas far from the nation's population centers. This year, though, abuse of OxyContin has started to move away from its backwoods origins and into metropolitan areas on the East Coast, into the Deep South and parts of the Southwest and into suburban communities throughout the Eastern United States. In Miami-Dade County, there have been 11 overdose deaths so far this year in which oxycodone was the probable cause, according to the county medical examiner. There have been 11 more in Philadelphia, according to the medical examiner there. Police in Bridgeport, Conn., arrested a local doctor in July for prescribing tens of thousands of OxyContin tablets to patients, often, they say, without any medical examination at all. And in the suburbs of Boston, police say more than a dozen pharmacies have been held up by a gang of young men wearing baseball caps and bandannas, looking for OxyContin.
In many ways, the spread of Oxycontin abuse closely resembles another recent drug epidemic. In the early 1990's, the Medellin and Cali cartels controlled cocaine and heroin distribution in the United States. Cocaine was selling well, but there was a marketing problem with heroin: it could only be injected, and many people, even frequent drug abusers, are reluctant to stick needles in their arms. 
The Colombians' solution to this problem was to increase the purity of the heroin they were bringing into the United States until it was potent enough to snort. They were then able to use their existing cocaine-trafficking network in the Eastern United States to get heroin onto the street in powder form. Cocaine users, who were used to the idea of buying and snorting a white powder, experimented and became addicted. As their tolerance increased, these new heroin snorters overcame their aversion to needles and soon turned into heroin injectors.
Similarly, there were plenty of oxycodone users in Appalachia before OxyContin came along. Many of the OxyContin addicts I spoke to in Kentucky and West Virginia used to snort or chew a mild oxycodone-based painkiller called Tylox. They said they found the pills somewhat euphoric and not very addictive -- each Tylox contains just 5 milligrams of oxycodone, along with 500 milligrams of acetaminophen. When OxyContin arrived on the scene, in pills containing 20, 40 and 80 milligrams of oxycodone, it marked a jump in purity similar to that of early-90's heroin -- and again, casual users started snorting, and then shooting, a powerful opioid.
Although heroin and OxyContin have a similar unhappy effect on the lives of people addicted to them, there is a critical and simple difference between the two: heroin is illegal; OxyContin, when used as directed, is legal. More than that: the pill is government-approved. It is made by Purdue Pharma, a successful and well-regarded pharmaceutical company headquartered in Stamford, Conn. It is prescribed to a million patients for the treatment of chronic pain, and it is closely regulated at every stage of its manufacture and distribution by the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
This fact has meant a major conceptual shift for law-enforcement officials, who are used to combating narcotics produced by international drug lords, not international corporations. Terry Woodworth, the deputy director of the D.E.A.'s office of diversion control, says the spread of OxyContin has posed a challenge to the D.E.A.'s traditional methods: "Instead of using the normal law-enforcement techniques -- like going to the source and attempting to eradicate or destroy the criminal organization producing the drug and immobilize its distribution networks and seize all its assets -- you have a very different situation in a legitimate industry, in that your manufacture and distribution is legal." 
Scott Walker, the director of Layne House, a drug treatment facility in Prestonsburg, Ky., puts it more concisely: "You don't have the Coast Guard chasing OxyContin ships," he says. "This isn't something you can stop at the border. It's growing from within."
Part of what makes the spread of OxyContin abuse so difficult to track, let alone to stop, is that the drug moves not physically but conceptually. When crack cocaine spread from the big cities on either coast toward the center of the country, it traveled gradually, along Interstates, city by city. OxyContin abuse pops up suddenly, in unexpected locations: Kenai, Alaska; Tucson; West Palm Beach, Fla. At the Gateway Rehabilitation Center in Aliquippa, Pa., a suburb of Pittsburgh, Jay, a recovering OxyContin addict and a former small-time dealer, offered an explanation for OxyContin's sudden geographical shifts. "It's the idea that passes on," he told me. "That's how it spreads. There aren't mules running the drug across the country. It's dealt by word of mouth. I call a friend in Colorado and explain it to him: 'Hey, I've got this crazy pill, an OC 80, an OC 40. You've got to go to the doctor and get it. Tell him your back hurts."' 
Jay is 26, a college graduate and former nurse. He started doing oxys in 1999, and his consumption quickly rose to 240 milligrams a day. He was clean when we met and trying to stay that way. But when he talked about the drug's potential as a small business, he couldn't help getting excited. "I could go to California or Las Vegas and say, 'Hey, I was getting OC's prescribed to me in Pennsylvania; I'm going to get them in Las Vegas,"' he said. "And then if I wanted to sell them, I could sell them there. I'd start out and sell them for 10 bucks apiece. Get people hooked on them, then sell them for 50 bucks apiece. It's experienced word of mouth. I've experienced the drug, therefore I know how to describe it to you."
Unlike heroin, Jay explained, OxyContin doesn't require investment or muscle or manpower to move across the country. OxyContin abuse is a a contagious idea -- a meme, if you will. Because OxyContin, the medicine, is readily available in pharmacies everywhere, all it takes to bring OxyContin, the drug, to a new place is a persuasive talker like Jay. A powerful recreational narcotic can now travel halfway across the country in the course of a phone call.
In order to understand the particular dilemma of OxyContin, you need to understand the long-fought war among doctors over pain and addiction. For centuries, opium and its derivatives have been considered a double-edged sword -- the most effective painkiller on earth and also the most addictive substance. For most of the 20th century, opiates were considered too dangerous to use in all but the most critical pain treatments. The assumption was that their medical use would inevitably lead to addiction. In the late 1980's, for the first time, public and medical opinion began to swing decisively in the other direction. Patient advocates and pharmaceutical companies, bolstered by studies showing that there were vast numbers of cancer patients whose pain was being undertreated, encouraged the medical community to rethink its approach to opioids, especially in the management of cancer pain. Their campaign was persuasive. Between 1990 and 1994, morphine consumption in the United States rose by 75 percent, and in 1994, the Department of Health and Human Services issued new clinical guidelines encouraging the use of opioids in the treatment of cancer pain. 
Purdue Pharma was a leading player in the pro-opioid campaign. The company contributed generously to patient-advocacy organizations, including the American Pain Foundation, the National Foundation for the Treatment of Pain and the American Chronic Pain Association, and underwrote dozens of scientific studies on the effectiveness of opioids in the treatment of pain. In 1985, the company began marketing MS Contin, a time-release morphine pill that was used to treat cancer pain. As attitudes on opioids shifted, Purdue began to promote MS Contin for noncancer pain as well. 
Dr. Russell Portenoy is chairman of pain medicine and palliative care at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, and the co-author of a groundbreaking 1986 study that supported the long-term use of opioids to treat noncancer pain. "Between 1986 and 1997, within the community of pain specialists, there was increasing attention on the role of opioids," Portenoy says, "but there was relatively little diffusion of that idea to family doctors and other nonspecialists." That began to change, Portenoy says, with the F.D.A.'s approval of OxyContin in 1995. "There was a sea change that occurred with the release of this drug," Portenoy says. For the first time, general practitioners began to prescribe strong, long-acting opioids to treat chronic noncancer pain. Portenoy says the change was due to four factors that came together at about the same time. "The reasons were partly cultural -- the attitudes of the medical and regulatory communities had been gradually shifting for a decade. They were partly medical -- studies had been coming out showing that patients with low back pain, chronic headaches and neuropathic pain might benefit from long-term opioid therapy. They were partly pharmacological -- OxyContin made it easier and more convenient for patients to receive long-term opioid therapy. And they were finally related to marketing, because Purdue Pharma was the first company to advertise an opioid pill to general practitioners in mainstream medical journals."
In addition to those doctor-directed ads in magazines like The Journal of the American Medical Association, the company began an innovative indirect-marketing campaign just before OxyContin's release. Because of F.D.A. regulations on the marketing of narcotics, the company was unable to use direct-to-consumer advertising, as other pharmaceutical companies were beginning to do for antidepressants and prescription allergy medications. So Purdue decided to concentrate on what they call "nonbranded education." Just as Nike advertises the concept of sports instead of shoes, so Purdue would market the concept of pain relief to consumers, but not OxyContin. In 1994, the company launched Partners Against Pain, a public-education program that at first concentrated on cancer pain and later expanded to include other forms of long-term pain. Through videos, patient pain journals and an elaborate Web site, Purdue promoted three ideas to doctors and patients: that pain was much more widespread than had previously been thought; that it was treatable; and that in many cases it could, and should, be treated with opioids. Partners Against Pain didn't promote OxyContin specifically; the company's marketers knew that simply expanding the total market would also increase their bottom line. 
OxyContin was seen by many doctors as the solution to the long rift between pain specialists and addiction specialists. Purdue Pharma believed that OxyContin's time-release function would mean a much lower risk of addiction than other opioid medications. According to a principle known as the "rate hypothesis," the rate at which an opioid enters the brain determines its euphoric effect, and also its addiction potential. This is why injecting a narcotic produces a more powerful high, and addiction risk, than snorting it or swallowing it. Because OxyContin, taken whole, provides a steady flow of oxycodone over an extended period, the high it produces is diminished, as is the risk of addiction.
Before OxyContin, narcotic painkillers were prescribed mostly by oncologists and pain specialists. Purdue believed that OxyContin's time-release safeguards made it appropriate for use by a much broader array of medical professionals. The company began promoting OxyContin to family doctors and local pharmacists nationwide through a network of hundreds of field reps who emphasized, in their office visits, the idea that OxyContin presented a lower addiction risk than other opioid medicines. 
Over the next few years, sales of OxyContin exploded. OxyContin prescriptions have more or less doubled in number each year since its release; the company's revenues from the pill jumped to $1.14 billion in 2000 from $55 million in 1996. Last year, doctors wrote more than six and a half million OxyContin prescriptions, and OxyContin ranked as the 18th best-selling prescription drug in the country (as measured by retail sales) and the No. 1 opioid painkiller. The company grew along with its main product's sales; between 1998 and 2000, the Purdue work force expanded to nearly 3,000 employees from 1,600.
Purdue's attempt to expand the opioid marketplace beyond cancer patients was also remarkably successful. Five years ago, cancer patients were still the main market for long-acting opioids, but oncologists accounted for only 3 percent of the OxyContin prescribed last year. The largest single group of OxyContin prescribers is now family physicians, who account for 21 percent of the total.
According to Portenoy, this change in the number and kinds of doctors prescribing OxyContin is fundamentally linked to the spread of OxyContin abuse. "It's not the drug, per se," Portenoy says. "It's rapidly expanding access, plus the reality of doctors prescribing it who may not have the skill set required to prescribe it responsibly." 
Purdue's field reps were the first wave of OxyContin apostles, spreading word of the pill's effectiveness door to door -- doctor by doctor, pharmacist by pharmacist. But Purdue's officially sanctioned word-of-mouth marketing campaign was followed by another, unsanctioned one. This time the news was that the miracle pill had an Achilles' heel, that its time-release matrix could be eliminated completely in a matter of seconds by the simple act of crushing the pill with a spoon, a lighter, even a thumbnail, and that the resulting powder, when snorted or mixed with water and injected, produced a very potent high. The apostles this time were not Purdue's field reps but casual drug abusers throughout the Eastern United States. And just like Purdue's, their marketing campaign was enormously successful.
In a steel-mill suburb northwest of Pittsburgh, the leader of the second wave of OxyContin apostles was Curt, a young man who in 1998, at the age of 23, found himself kicked out of the Air Force and living back in his hometown. He worked the midnight shift running cranes at the mill, and he dealt a little marijuana during the day. He was part of a "drug community," as he calls it, 20 or so people who worked together, hung out together, went to parties and concerts and smoked a lot of pot. Every couple of months someone would land a prescription for Percocet or Vicodin, and they'd sell the pills to friends for $5 apiece, a cheap and mild high.
In April 1999, someone in his circle was prescribed OxyContin. Curt assumed that it was just like any other pain pill. "Everybody thought at first that they were like a Percocet," Curt says. "Nobody understood how many milligrams were really in these things. People were selling them like an expensive Percocet" -- for $10, in other words, instead of $5 -- and swallowing them whole. At a party, Curt figured out the trick of crushing the pill and snorting the powder, and he quickly spread the word. "I showed a lot of people," Curt says. "At first they were like, 'You're crazy.' But then they'd do it, and that would be it. People tell me now, Yeah, you're the one who showed me how to snort this thing."
Oxys quickly became very popular in Curt's circle of friends, and Curt found a comfortable niche for himself between supply and demand. "I knew people all over the county that were getting prescriptions," he says. "They'd call me and say, I'm getting OC's now and I want to get rid of them. They knew there was money there, but they didn't know who to sell to. They usually gave me a heck of a deal. I'd get them all for maybe $10" per 40-milligram pill. "I'd sell them for $20, so for every one I sold, I made one. And then I'd give them their money and the next month I'd get their scrip again." At that rate, he could make $900 off a 90-pill bottle. But he wasn't in it for the profit; he was in it for the pills. "I didn't need money," he explains. "I worked at the mill. I was always doing it just for the free drugs."
Before long, he had 10 people giving him their pills to sell, mostly women in their 30's and 40's on welfare or disability. (Patients on Medicaid pay just a dollar for a $250 OxyContin prescription.) "It's so weird the people that got into this," Curt says. "Some of them were innocent mothers. I had one that was in her 60's. She never did drugs. She'd sell every last one of her pills, and it would pay for all her other medication." Curt would keep careful track of which day of the month each of his suppliers filled her prescription. "A lot of times I would drive them to the pharmacy," he says. "I'd always get a couple of pills for that."
One of the most valuable -and closely guarded -- resources in the local OxyContin economy was a doctor who was willing to write an OxyContin prescription without asking too many questions. "It's a slow process, breaking a doctor in," Curt explains. "You've got to know how to work him. I'd say: 'I can't take the Vicodins and the Percocets because they're hurting my stomach. Do they have anything that's, like, time released?' The doctor goes, 'Oh, you know what, they've got this new stuff called OxyContin.' And I'd say: 'Oh, yeah? Wow, how's that work?"' Some local doctors, Curt says, knew exactly what was going on, but they needed the business. One started handing out monthlong OxyContin prescriptions every two weeks.
On the demand end, Curt had between 25 and 50 steady customers. "I had a cell phone at that time, so I was doing a lot of driving," he says. "People would gather at their houses, and they'd bring all their friends over, 10 of them that'd use it. They'd all gather when they knew I was coming, because they wanted the pill immediately."
Curt has been in recovery for a few months now; since he got out of rehab, he's been cut off from almost all his old friends, and he fills his spare time fixing up his sister's house, fishing and reading up on psychology, which he plans to begin studying this fall. He's a man of boundless energy and focus, and he has taken to the 12-step process with an unusual intensity; in his first 60 days clean, he told me, he attended 138 Narcotics Anonymous meetings. That same energy served him well back in his oxy days, when he was cutting steel at the mill all night and driving around making pickups and deliveries all day. The pills themselves, he says, helped him keep going. "I could go get two hours of sleep, wake up, do a pill and continue on from there," he says. 
It was only a couple of months after OxyContin arrived in town that Curt and most of his customers realized they were addicted. At first, they were happy just to take a pill whenever one was around, for fun, but soon they found themselves experiencing severe withdrawal symptoms if they didn't have a pill every day. Everyone's tolerance built up quickly -- one week they were able to get by on a 20 a day, the next week they'd need a 40, and a couple of weeks later, it had to be an 80. "No one knew what was going on," Curt says. "These are a bunch of pot smokers, drinkers, just mellow people. This drug just took us by storm. A whole community, at least a hundred people I know around here. They're all into the addiction. These are guys I used to smoke pot with and drink beer with in the woods. I grew up with them all, having parties and that. And now there's not one of them -- not one of them -- that don't use pills."
Purdue Pharma wasn't aware of significant problems with OxyContin abuse until April 2000, when a front-page article in The Bangor Daily News, claiming that OxyContin "is quickly becoming the recreational drug of choice in Maine," landed on the desk of Purdue's senior medical director, Dr. J. David Haddox. In the summer of 2000, the company formed a response team, made up of medical personnel, public relations specialists and two of the company's top executives, which has guided the company's OxyContin campaign ever since.
It's fair to say that in public relations terms, Purdue's reaction to the OxyContin problem has been less than successful. As recently as six months ago, the company had a considerable supply of good will in the media, the government and the affected communities; it is now facing 12 separate potential class-action suits from former patients, as well as one from the attorney general of West Virginia; formerly sympathetic community leaders in Appalachia and Maine have grown increasingly skeptical of the company's approach; and in separate Congressional testimony, Attorney General John Ashcroft called OxyContin a "very, very dangerous drug," and Donnie Marshall, then head of the D.E.A., said in May that unless he received "more cooperation" from Purdue, he was "seriously considering rolling back the quotas that D.E.A. sets . . . to the 1996 level," which would have meant a 95 percent cut in production.
Purdue's P.R. problems seem rooted in the company's deep-seated belief in the inherent safety of and public need for its product. It is an article of faith for the company that illegal traffic in its drug is the work of "bad guys" and "professionals," in Haddox's words. In fact, Purdue says that its internal data indicate that the levels of OxyContin abuse in the country are no greater than expected. "We have had increased numbers in the last year or so," I was told by Robert Reder, Purdue's vice president of medical affairs and worldwide drug safety, "but our estimation is that they're commensurate with the distribution of the drug." The abuse situation, according to Reder's numbers, is normal. (Government statistics indicate that as of 1999, 221,000 Americans had abused OxyContin.) The real victims, the company says, are their "legitimate patients," who would be denied OxyContin if its distribution were restricted.
In March, Purdue announced a 10-point plan to combat OxyContin abuse. The plan includes tamper-resistant prescription pads for doctors, antidiversion brochures and educational seminars for doctors and pharmacists in affected areas, an initiative to combat smuggling of OxyContin from Mexico and Canada and a donation of $100,000 to a Virginia group for a study of prescription-monitoring programs. To Purdue, the plan is generous and well focused; to people in the communities where abuse is widespread, it seems like a way for the company to avoid the real problem. I spoke several times this spring and summer to Debbie Trent, a professional counselor in Gilbert, W. Va., who runs the local antidrug community group called STOP (Strong Through Our Plan). In our first conversation, she was scrupulously cautious and polite when she spoke about Purdue Pharma, saying, "I don't want STOP to be seen as fighting OxyContin." During STOP's first few months, Haddox addressed her group twice. 
When we spoke in April, though, Trent told me that she had come to believe that the company's 10-point plan was addressing the wrong problems -- prescription fraud and international smuggling, for example, when what Gilbert really needed was a way to get immediate treatment for its many addicts. "I read about the tamper-proof prescription pads and I think, Give me a break!" she said. "That seems like such a little thing. It seems so minute in comparison to the scope of the problem. It's almost intentionally missing the point. Rather than prescription pads, I would like to see something done in rehab, something where they're making an effort to help these folks get better."
Similar sentiments were expressed in Maine in July, when Purdue announced its latest solution to the OxyContin problem: a $100,000 grant to start a "mini-M.B.A." program in high schools. This fall, Purdue will send 20 teachers from some of the most affected counties in Appalachia and Maine to New York for training by the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship. When they return to their schools, they will teach students how to formulate a business plan and invest in the stock market. The idea is to "provide these kids with a sense of hope," according to a Purdue spokesperson. A Maine school administrator was quoted in The Boston Globe asking why the company "wouldn't have come up here and asked us what we want"; if anyone had, she said, she would have asked for money for the treatment of addicts rather than entrepreneurial training.
Again and again, Purdue has apparently been blindsided by criticism. At a news conference in Alabama attended by parents whose teenage children had died from OxyContin overdoses, Gov. Don Siegelman interrupted a Purdue doctor who was going point by point through Purdue's 10-point plan. "I find this very offensive, and I want you to stop," he said as the doctor stood open-mouthed in front of the television cameras. "We've had enough public relations and enough sugar-coating of this issue and quite frankly, as governor, I am fed up." In March, Haddox had what he thought was a cordial and cooperative meeting with Attorney General Darrell V. McGraw of West Virginia to discuss the company's plan to combat drug abuse. Less than three months later, McGraw filed a lawsuit against Purdue, charging the company with "highly coercive and inappropriate tactics to attempt to get physicians and pharmacists to prescribe OxyContin and to fill prescriptions for OxyContin, often when it was not called for," and seeking millions of dollars in compensation for state medical costs.
In the meantime, the lack of co-ordination between Purdue and the government agencies that regulate it has had serious repercussions in affected communities, as local police, small-town mayors and individual doctors and pharmacies have been forced to make up their own policies on the fly. Six states -- Florida, Maine, Vermont, West Virginia, Ohio and South Carolina -- have introduced regulations making it harder for Medicaid recipients to receive OxyContin. After the recent spate of pharmacy robberies near Boston, dozens of drug stores in Massachusetts pulled OxyContin from their shelves -- only to be ordered by the state pharmacy board to begin carrying the drug again. In the small town of Pulaski, Va., the police have instituted a program in which patients picking up OxyContin prescriptions from local pharmacies must give their fingerprints, a development that has alarmed civil liberties advocates. Doctors in many states, sometimes fearing reprisals from the D.E.A., have refused to prescribe OxyContin even to patients clearly in need.
Purdue's executives see the company as an unwitting victim of criminal activity -- not unlike Johnson & Johnson in 1982, when seven people were killed by Extra-Strength Tylenol tablets that had been laced with cyanide. The company's critics prefer to compare Purdue to tobacco companies and handgun manufacturers, who are increasingly likely to be found liable for deaths caused by their products. Clearly, the company failed to anticipate the growing chorus of public sentiment against it. And as OxyContin incidents move closer to Washington and New York, pressure may increase on the D.E.A. and the F.D.A. to take regulatory action against Purdue.
When I returned to the Gateway rehabilitation Center outside Pittsburgh earlier this month, I got a clearer sense of the way in which OxyContin is taking hold in urban and suburban America. I also learned about an unexpected secondary effect of OxyContin abuse: in cities like Pittsburgh, the crackdown on OxyContin is resulting in a sharp rise in heroin abuse.
I sat for an afternoon in a glassed-in conference room, looking out on Gateway's parking lot and groomed grounds, and talked with Andy and B., two addicts and former low-level dealers. Before trying OxyContin, they had used their share of recreational drugs, but they didn't consider themselves part of a hard-core drug community. Aside from the track marks on his arms, B., 21, looked like every disaffected college kid in America. He was a professional sloucher, dressed in an orange T-shirt, Army shorts and sneakers, with a mop of brown hair. Andy wore a sparse goatee, a hooded Ecko sweatshirt and a baseball cap with a Japanese character on it. I asked him what it meant, and he said he didn't know.
B. began using OxyContin in 1998, when a friend told him about the pills. He soon started dealing to support his habit, buying pills from a dozen or so people and then selling them from his apartment to friends and friends of friends. His sources were all legitimate pain patients, sick with cancer, carpal tunnel syndrome, lupus or chronic back problems. But, as B. explained, they would often supplement their OxyContin prescriptions with something weaker and cheaper, like Vicodin, then sell the OxyContin and struggle through the month on Vicodin. "Some of them were old sick ladies who've never done drugs," B. said. "They didn't understand what oxy can do to people. They just knew they were getting $20 for each pill -- $1,800 a month off something they can do without. They just wanted that money." 
Andy laughed. "Old people are supposed to keep young people off drugs," he said.
B. described for me the casual feel of his drug deals. For the first several months that he was selling OxyContin, he said, everything was friendly when he'd go to pick up pills from his suppliers. "Most of them would say, 'Hi, honey, come on in.' You go into their house and sit down and have something to drink and talk for a while and see how their family's doing, and they see how mine's doing. They were nice people. I don't think they think of themselves as drug dealers." Nonetheless, B. said, his suppliers kept most of the profits; he'd generally buy their pills for $20 apiece and then sell them for $25.
About six months ago, B. said, as the police and news media began to sound the alarm about OxyContin abuse, local doctors grew anxious. Many switched their patients to harder-to-abuse fentanyl patches and morphine, and B. lost most of his connections. The supply dried up, prices rose and people started ripping each other off. 
A friend told him that shooting heroin was just like shooting OxyContin, only cheaper. He'd never imagined that he might take heroin, but the expense of OxyContin was killing him. "I was spending a hundred bucks a day on oxy," B. said. "That's why I switched to heroin. You get really high off two bags, which is 30 bucks a day. That's a big savings."
Andy agreed. It took him only a month and a half to go from using OxyContin for the first time to shooting heroin, he said. "I've always said that I'd never ever touch heroin. But then oxys came along and that's the same thing, just cleaner. And that got me into shooting dope. If I'd never touched OxyContin, I wouldn't have done heroin."
In Pittsburgh and its suburbs, Andy and B.'s stories aren't unique. Gateway's doctors report a sharp increase in admissions of young heroin addicts who started out on OxyContin. "Ninety percent of my friends that were addicted to oxys are now addicted to heroin," B. said. "I know probably 30 or 40 heroin IV drug users now because of OxyContin."
OxyContin entered the lives of casual drug users as a Trojan horse, disguised as something it is not. It has never become a popular drug among existing heroin or crack addicts, who already have a cheaper and at least as intoxicating mechanism for getting high. OxyContin does the most damage when it enters a community of casual drug users -- Curt's pot smokers and beer drinkers -- who think of pain pills as just another interesting diversion for a Saturday night. In networks like Curt's or Paula's, before OxyContin, no one ever did heroin or crack; those were seen as an entirely different category of drug: something that will take over your life.
When you hold it in your hand, an OxyContin pill doesn't seem any different than a Tylox or a Percocet or any of the mild narcotic preparations that have for years seeped out of the pharmaceutical pipeline and into the lives of casual drug users. What B. and Andy and Paula and Curt failed to realize is that despite appearances, OxyContin actually belongs on the other side of the drug divide; it might look like a casual Saturday-night drug, but it's a take-over-your-life drug. Rehab centers across the country are filling up with young people who discovered that fact too late.
To Art Van Zee, the doctor who has seen his small community in western Virginia "devastated" by OxyContin abuse, the answer to the crisis is to take OxyContin off the market. Van Zee is circulating a petition asking the F.D.A. and Purdue to withdraw the pill until a safer formulation can be found. "The bottom line is, there's much more harm being created by this drug being available than good," he says. "There are very good medicines available that are equally effective. We can certainly meet people's pain needs without OxyContin." 
But for many people, "drug communities" like Curt's are not worthy of a whole lot of official sympathy or regulatory concern -- especially not when their interests are considered next to those of patients in pain, who are using OxyContin the way it is meant to be used and whose lives have been improved as a result. For doctors who have seen their patients transformed by OxyContin, there is something mystifying, even infuriating, about the suggestion that it should be withdrawn or even restricted, just because a bunch of kids in Kentucky didn't know what they were snorting.
"There is no question that increasing opioid consumption for legitimate medical purposes is going to lead to some increase in the rates of addiction," Portenoy of Beth Israel says. "But the fact is, the trade-off is worth it. At the moment, the attitude is that if one housewife in Alabama becomes addicted, then the drug must be pulled and the company shut down. But we're talking about millions of people whose lives can be brought back from total disability by the proper use of opioids. Any actions taken by law enforcement or the regulatory community that increase the stigma associated with these drugs, or increase the fear of physicians in prescribing these drugs, is going to exacerbate an already terrible condition and hurt patients."
The 10th point in Purdue Pharma's 10-point plan to reduce OxyContin abuse is reformulation. The company says that it is spending millions of dollars to create a new version of OxyContin, or perhaps a whole new medication, that would have all the benefits of OxyContin and none of its dangers. Of all the initiatives under way, this is the one that has received the most attention and created the most hope in Appalachia and other affected areas.
In some interviews, Purdue's representatives sound downright enthusiastic about this idea. Earlier this month, they put a price tag -- $50 million -- on the project for the first time. But when pressed, Haddox admits that what Purdue's scientists are looking for is a "holy grail," a drug that will activate the receptors in the brain that control pain relief and leave alone those that control euphoria. And this isn't a new initiative, it turns out, but one that the company has been working on for many years. Scientists and doctors as far back as Hippocrates have tried to find a way to separate the benefits of opiates from their dangers. 
There are often suggestions from Purdue that this reformulation may take "a few years"; it's also entirely possible that it will never happen. Opioids, including OxyContin, may remain the double-edged sword they have always been. And regulators may simply decide to accept a certain amount of unintentional damage in the treatment of pain, and leave local police chiefs and drug counselors -- as well as individual addicts -- to find solutions to the OxyContin problem on their own.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Westchester; 
Independent Agencies Still Overshadow Franchises

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
WORRY that independent realty firms would vanish from the local landscape as national franchises grew has proved unfounded. And while signs bearing the names of GMAC, Prudential, Century 21, Coldwell Banker, ERA and Re/Max proliferate on front lawns across the county, the overwhelming majority of for-sale signs still belongs the small family-owned brokerages, the mom and pop companies with perhaps 10 or 12 sales representatives.
 At last count, independent agencies account for 84 percent of Westchester's residential real estate agencies. Independent brokerages in the county range from one-person shops like Davis Real Estate in Bedford Village to Houlihan/Lawrence, which has 21 offices and 500 salespeople in Westchester. 
 Like J. P. Endres, 30, who owns the David Endres Realty Group in Scarsdale, the independents have responded to franchisers -- and a chain's benefits of broad-based marketing campaigns, referral services and brand recognition -- with a firm "No thank you." 
"I tell them, 'Don't talk to me!' " said Ms. Endres, who took over the family business six years ago after her brother died. "It's not even a consideration."
Bernice Gottlieb, the principal broker and owner of Hudson Shores Realty in Irvington, feels the same way. "I never have wanted a corporation looking over my shoulder, and I still don't want it," said Mrs. Gottlieb, who opened her company seven years ago when she was 64 and decided not to retire. "I like making my own decisions."
Another broker conceded that she had been tempted at times to become a franchisee but finally rejected the idea. "At first, it seemed like a good idea," said Liz Schatz, who has owned Albert P. Schatz Real Estate in Ossining with her husband for more than 40 years. "But then I said to myself, 'Who needs it?' "
In Westchester, a flurry of affiliations occurred in the 1980's and 1990's, suggesting that the national chains would eventually predominate, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, the executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. "There was a lot of concern about companies losing their character when the franchises were first making their presence felt in the nation and in Westchester -- worry that the independents would be gobbled up," he said. "But that hasn't happened at all."
Of the 437 realty agencies in the county, 69 last year -- or almost 16 percent -- were franchisees: Century 21 had 22 offices in Westchester County; GMAC (formerly Better Homes and Gardens), 16; Prudential, 14; Coldwell Banker, 8; ERA, 5; and Re/Max, 4, according to the Board of Realtors' roster.
Nationally, only 22 percent of real estate agencies were associated with a franchise in 1999, the latest year for which figures are available, according to Kevin A. Roth, a senior economist for the the National Association of Realtors, a 750,000-member trade group in Chicago.
One of the main considerations for realty companies in deciding whether to remain independent or operate under the umbrella of a chain is the individual agency's ability to establish a strong referral network. The franchises offer a national base of referrals.
But referrals can come from many sources, Mr. Roth said, citing a study by the association. About 34 percent of buyers choose a real estate agent on the basis of a referral from a friend or relative, the study showed. Eight percent base their choice on an agent's reputation among friends and acquaintances. Referrals from employers, real estate brokers and membership organizations resulted in 10 percent of home buyers choosing a particular agency.
OTHER popular sources of clients are the agent's own personal contacts, for-sale signs, open houses and the real estate office's presence on the street.
Mr. and Mrs. Schatz, who have 10 agents in their office, said they had developed their own referral network over the years by joining various membership organizations. In addition to belonging to the County Board of Realtors, a trade association that offers networking opportunities, legislative advocacy and eduction, they also belong to the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, which lists the overwhelming bulk of properties for sale in Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess counties. In addition, the Schatzes are members of the National Association of Realtors, and the Paris-based International Federation of Real Estate Brokers. "We tell our clients, 'List with us and we'll tell the world about it,' " Mrs. Schatz said. "Who needs a chain?" In addition to other organizations, Mrs. Gottlieb belongs to RELO, the nation's largest referral network of independent realtors, and she also works closely with corporations, who refer customers to her.
Building referral networks, however, is only part of the equation. In Scarsdale, Ms. Endres said that, like many other independents, she competes with the chains by plying niche markets. Especially in the Scarsdale and New Rochelle areas, there is a strong foreign customer base. To tap that, she said, three of the 11 agents in her office have studied to become specialists in international property negotiations.
"We have many German, French and Israeli customers, and we have to communicate with them on an educated basis," Ms. Endres said. "For example, without specialists to monitor currency fluctuations and time things just right, we could lose sales."
In her 12-agent Irvington office, Mrs. Gottlieb said her most effective tool for competing with the chains was "the personal touch."
"Instead of the franchise's market share, the driving force for independents like myself is the people share," Mrs. Gottlieb said. She added that, even if a customer walked in looking for an inexpensive rental, she and her sales representatives would gladly work with the customer because that rental could lead to a house purchase in a year or two.
Many independents also do not want a chain dictating how they spend advertising dollars.
Mrs. Schatz, for example, decided that the money a franchise would cost -- usually about $25,000 -- "we could give back to our own homeowners in terms of advertising." Or as Mrs. Gottlieb explained it, "If a house has squash court in the basement and I want to advertise that house in a squash magazine, I do it."
BUT many of the owners of firms opting to join a national company say that far from selling out to a chain, they have been able to mix the best of both worlds -- their independence and the benefits a national organization affords them.
In Hastings-on-Hudson, Arthur and Peter Riolo took over the business their father started 65 years ago and four years ago became Peter J. Riolo Better Homes and Garden. Since GMAC Real Estate Service's acquisition last year of the Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate Service, the agency is now called Peter J. Riolo GMAC.
"The reason for going the franchise route was to be able to compete with the Houlihan/Lawrences and the Coldwell Bankers and the Prudentials," said Arthur Riolo, whose office has 12 agents. "We developed a base throughout the county of GMAC referrals, which is a good portion of the business. But the name on the front door is still our father's -- with all the honesty and integrity of the business he built behind it."
For some, the technological revolution that hit the real estate industry and the rest of the business world in the late 1990's prompted them to become part of a larger group. Liz Lindsey owned Lindsey Real Estate in Mount Vernon from 1987 to 1999, when she realized that "the world around me was changing faster than I was."
"I needed to computerize," said Ms. Lindsey, 65. "We didn't have a Web site. So I had to ask myself if at that point in my career I wanted to recapitalize."
Instead of affiliating with a national chain, however, she chose to become part of Westchester's largest independent realty company, Houlihan/Lawrence, which has 24 offices and 650 agents in its Westchester and Putnam offices. "That solved my problems," Ms. Lindsey said. "I didn't want the franchise look, because I was used to the small town image and didn't want to give that up."
Stephen R. Meyers, president of Houlihan/Lawrence, said his organization had been able to "bridge a gap between the small mom and pop office and the national franchises."
A healthy mix has evolved, Mr. Mercurio said, adding, "Westchester is county where there is a good number of companies who are affiliated and a great number who are not, and they all coexist quite well."

HEADLINE: DANCE; 
A Small Place Reaches for Ballet's Big Time

BYLINE:  By ALLEN ROBERTSON; Allen Robertson, the dance editor of Time Out London, also edits the British quarterly Dance Now.

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
THIS little country, only two-thirds the size of Florida, has one of the most bustling of Asia's "tiger" economies. Its capital city, with a financial district bristling with postmodern skyscrapers in a machismo display of international clout, has long had its eye on the future. Except, that is, in one particular -- and, to many eyes, peculiar -- instance: classical ballet.
 Paradoxically, the Universal Ballet, generally regarded as the top Asian ballet company, is building its future on the past. The troupe, which is completing its summerlong North American tour with a five-day visit to the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center beginning on Wednesday, will perform the grand and sweepingly demanding Russian classic "La Bayadere" and "Shim Chung," a dance based on a Korean folk tale. Subtitled "The Blindman's Daughter," it is an uplifting story of a young woman's supernatural perils as she tries to help her father regain his sight. "Shim Chung," created by the company's founding director, the American Adrienne Dellas, in 1986, is the sole ballet in the Universal's repertory to celebrate Korean culture and is therefore viewed as a signature work for the company. 
 Founded in 1984, the Universal Ballet has been under the leadership of Oleg Vinogradov, the former artistic director of the Kirov Ballet, since 1998. The Universal is not the only major company in Seoul. The other is the government-sponsored National Ballet, which has formed a relationship with Yuri Grigorovich, the former head of the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow. The National and the Universal both employ Russian teachers, coaches and ballet masters working side by side with their Chinese and Korean counterparts.
The Universal Ballet, which now includes most of the Russian Imperial classics in its repertory, is privately financed, with most of its budget coming from the Korean Cultural Foundation, an arm of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church.
It is housed in an arts complex situated in a city park, and includes a school, rehearsal studios and a 1,280-seat theater. The center and the theater both take their names from one of Reverend Moon's first cultural endeavours, a children's song-and-dance troupe known as the Little Angels.
These tiny-tot ambassadors are meant to show the world that Korea's cultural heritage is rich, diverse and sophisticated and thus a source of hope for the country's future. The ballet company presents that message on an even bigger scale and has already performed in more than 100 cities in more than a dozen countries.
Numbering just over 70 dancers, the company is about two-thirds Korean. The remaining performers come from other Asian countries, the former Eastern bloc and the company's affiliated school, the Kirov Academy in Washington. Founded in 1990, the school is supervised by Mr. Vinogradov and run by his ex-wife, Yelena Vinogradova. So, even before he joined the company full-time, the Kirov's Russian pedagogy formed the Universal's stylistic backbone.
These dancers are determined to find success. Classes in the Universal studios are intense. No jokes, no messing around. The men's class even has its fair share of women, who push themselves, stretching for the jumps, trying to match their male counterparts in vigor and strength.
But as Julia Moon, an original member of the company and Reverend Moon's daughter-in-law, points out, classical ballet and Korean culture both celebrate what is most feminine in women. "I think ballet suits us because Koreans are very lyrical," she said. "There is a lot of grace in the women, and the men are very masculine. That contrast makes for a good combination."
Ms. Moon, an American-born ballerina, is certainly one of the most feminine of dancers, delicately pliant and ethereal. Soft-spoken yet determined, she also functions as the company's general director.
It is mid-afternoon and she is already on her third change of clothes for the day. Having shed her sweat-soaked practice gear just minutes before, she is sitting in the company's large but utilitarian offices filled with oversized armchairs. Here, she is the company spokeswoman. Next, she'll put on a suit to meet the parents of one of the school's new scholarship students. Later, she will get dressed to play hostess to important visitors during the performance. Finally, she will put on a long black gown for the curtain calls, which both she and Mr. Vinogradov take after each home performance.
Those curtain calls are a matter of respect. Throughout Korean society, mentors are honored, even revered, which may explain why these dancers so easily fit into the benign, hierarchical dictatorship that is the structure of all classical-ballet companies. And why Anna Kisselgoff, reviewing the Universal's 1998 New York visit in The New York Times, praised the "astounding precision and attention to stylistic detail" of this corps de ballet.
For his part, Mr. Vinogradov is a much happier man now that he is no longer tangled in post-Soviet politics. Justifiably proud of how rapidly his company has grown, he exudes paternal pride. His projects run several seasons into the future, but right now his particular baby is a new "Romeo and Juliet," due in 2002.
He turns as gleeful as a child when displaying his just-completed stage designs. Shuffling his drawings around as he progresses through the story scene by scene, it seems as if he has never been so proud of any other single accomplishment. Creative and content, Mr. Vinogradov is once again playing a pioneer as he turns his Korean corps into a carbon copy of the Kirov's.
Mr. Vinogradov dismisses any notoriety that the company may have received because of its ties to the Moon church, saying his only concern is with his art and that art, not religion, drives the company's policy and profile. Ms. Moon backs him in this assertion. She is the sole dancer who belongs to the church, while the administrative staff, headed by her father, Dr. Bo Hi Pak, one of Rev. Moon's right-hand men, is about half and half.
"Art needs money to be beautiful," Mr. Vinogradov says with a pragmatic shrug of the shoulders. "What difference if it is from Mercedes or Philip Morris?"

HEADLINE: MUSIC; 
In Seattle, Wagner's Stock, At Least, Continues To Rise

BYLINE:  By CORI ELLISON; Cori Ellison is the dramaturg at the New York City Opera.

DATELINE: SEATTLE 

 BODY:
PERHAPS we should expect the city that gave us Windows, grunge and designer coffee on every street corner to behave a bit quixotically. In 1975, Glynn Ross, the founding general director of the tiny, 11-year-old Seattle Opera, got the mad notion of mounting Wagner's complete "Ring" tetralogy, uncut, in one week. At the time, only one American opera company had ever done so: the Metropolitan Opera, once, in 1939. Mr. Ross pulled it off, successfully enough that the Wagner habit stuck.
 Next Sunday, the Seattle Opera will unveil its third production of Wagner's "Ring des Nibelungen," directed by Stephen Wadsworth, with sets by Thomas Lynch, costumes by Martin Pakledinaz and lighting by Peter Kaczorowski, the same team that gave Seattle memorable productions of Gluck's "Orphee et Eurydice" (1988), Wagner's "Lohengrin" (1994) and Handel's "Xerxes" (1997). 
 "The 'Ring' is Seattle Opera's heart," Speight Jenkins, the current general director, said on a recent afternoon in his office, which is laden with tchotchkes. With his silver hair, black-rimmed glasses and impassioned cadences wrapped in a thick Southern drawl, Mr. Jenkins, 64, could pass for an evangelist. In fact, that's just what he is. "I want people to love opera," he said. "I've been 'converting' people all my life, and I want to keep doing that. Opera generates a kind of proselytizing unique among the arts. It's an experience we must share." 
Born into a prosperous, cultured family in Dallas in 1937, Mr. Jenkins was himself converted at 6, devouring the Metropolitan Opera's Saturday matinee broadcasts and eagerly awaiting its annual tour performances in Dallas. A "Rigoletto," starring Jan Peerce and Leonard Warren, so moved the 9-year-old boy that he remembers thinking, "This is what I'm going to do with my life."
"I studied a little piano and clarinet, but I really had no desire to perform, conduct or direct," he said now. "So my parents would say, 'What do you want to do, sit in an opera house all your life, listening?' Well, exactly!"
When his parents insisted on practicality, Mr. Jenkins enrolled at Columbia Law School, within easy reach of his beloved Met. But instead of practicing law, he became an editor at Opera News in 1967. In 1973, he became a music critic for The New York Post, and from 1981 to 1983, he was the host of the early installments of "Live From the Met" on PBS. All the while, he traveled extensively, attending performances and lecturing at opera companies throughout the United States and Europe.
In 1982, Mr. Jenkins visited the Seattle Opera to speak at a Wagner symposium, and the company's board, seeking a successor to Mr. Ross, asked for Mr. Jenkins's advice. Dazzled in a three-hour meeting by his knowledge and passion for opera, the board offered him the job.
Eyebrows were raised when the company anointed the lowly scrivener, who had never produced so much as a backyard play, let alone an opera. "Even all the critics said, 'What does he know?' " Mr. Jenkins recalled. " 'He's only a critic.' But I knew that I knew opera, I knew singers."
When he took the job in 1983, Mr. Jenkins faced a steep learning curve. The board expected that his mandate of artistic expansion and wider company recognition would come at a price, but they never dreamed that he would rack up an $800,000 deficit in his first season. A few years later, his plans for a new "Ring" cycle and a $2.1 million production of Prokofiev's "War and Peace" nearly bankrupted the company.
In 1992, the Seattle Opera enlisted Kathy Magiera as administrative director to help balance the budget. And Michael Scott, the first president of Apple Computers and a diehard Wagnerite, also came to the rescue, keeping the company afloat for six seasons. Soon, in the wake of Seattle's technology boom, Mr. Jenkins was able to attract major local donors. The company ended its last season with the budget balanced for the ninth consecutive year. Its $19 million annual budget makes it the seventh largest opera company in the United States.
"What is fund-raising, anyway?" asked Mr. Jenkins, now an accomplished mendicant. "Again, it's proselytizing. If you honestly believe in opera, and make people believe you're going to give them something exciting, they'll give you money. But they have to know you care about them."
In this regard, Mr. Jenkins's background as a critic, once perceived as a liability, turned out to be his greatest asset. He has put his speaking and writing skills to sterling use in informal talks around town, on local television and radio broadcasts, in the company's publications and on its Web site. And since 1994, he has led freewheeling audience discussions after every Seattle Opera performance.
It is no coincidence that Seattle boasts the largest per capita opera audience in America. Franz Vote, who is to conduct the "Ring," credits the city's "large collective intelligence and erudition quotient."
The Seattle Opera's recent fiscal health has left Mr. Jenkins free to focus on establishing the company as a home for intriguing repertory presented by vanguard directors and designers. In 1990, the company took bold steps in that direction with a sparse, controversial "Don Giovanni," set in the 1950's and directed by Christopher Alden; a Gunther Schneider-Siemssen production of Dvorak's "Rusalka," starring Renee Fleming and Ben Heppner; and the expensive but acclaimed "War and Peace," directed by Francesca Zambello and featuring artists from the Bolshoi and Kirov operas.
Other highlights of Mr. Jenkins's tenure have included a 1993 "Pelleas et Melisande," designed by the Seattle glass artist Dale Chihuly; a 1994 "Norma," directed by Nicholas Muni with the English soprano Jane Eaglen in her American debut; and Ms. Zambello's 1998 "Tristan und Isolde," with Mr. Heppner and Ms. Eaglen taking the title roles for the first time.
Mr. Jenkins has a knack for retaining such high-priced artists as Mr. Heppner and Carol Vaness long after their normal fees have surpassed the Seattle Opera's resources. Other artists, including Ms. Eaglen, Mr. Wadsworth and the tenor Vinson Cole, have put down roots here, in what several publications have called the most livable city in America.
ONE of Mr. Jenkins's earliest priorities at the Seattle Opera was to plan a new "Ring" that would be strikingly different from the 1975 production. That first production, a budget affair repeated every summer until 1984, was solidly traditional, in deliberate reaction to the symbolic, conceptual productions then popular in Europe, and somewhat provincial.
For the company's second "Ring" production, Mr. Jenkins engaged the postmodern director Francois Rochaix and the designer Robert Israel. When the first installment, "Die Walkure," opened in 1985, the Seattle public, weaned on winged helmets, breastplated Valkyries and rocks that looked like rocks, were greeted by such things as a Bambi-like deer effigy, a huge 19th-century flying machine and Wotan as a theater manager whose production plans were thwarted by his associates.
When the curtain fell, Seattle, that bastion of impeccable manners, foamed at the mouth. The audience both jeered and cheered. Some threw vegetables. After the first "Siegfried," one traditionalist ("a Shiite Wagnerite," in Mr. Jenkins's words) yelled, "It stinks!" Letters poured in, local newspapers bickered, and fistfights erupted at cocktail parties.
"In a sense, the company was built on that violent reaction to the Ring," Mr. Jenkins said. "It caused the community to realize that opera was important enough to incite controversy."
But when that "Ring" cycle was repeated in 1987, 1991 and 1995, the boos subsided. In 1995, more than 10,000 people, from all 50 states and 19 countries, attended. The impact on Seattle's economy was estimated at $26 million.
The Seattle Opera is now investing $14.5 million in its third "Ring" production, which the company tantalizingly previewed last August with three performances of "Das Rheingold" and seven of "Die Walkure." All three cycles this summer sold out the week after those shows opened.
For this "Ring," Mr. Jenkins sought a rare type of Wagner production, entirely different from his previous version: he wanted a realistic-looking "Ring," but one with detailed, intimate, ensemble drama. He turned to Mr. Wadsworth, who has been called a "quiet radical" for his arresting period productions of classic plays and operas.
"I'm not interested in 'interpreting' the 'Ring,' " Mr. Wadsworth said. "The minute you interpret in one direction, you close the door on so many other possibilities. The world that Wagner imagined was so much larger than any one of the many philosophical notions that preoccupied him while he was writing the 'Ring.' "
Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Wadsworth also wanted a "green" "Ring," stressing the importance of nature in the piece. In Mr. Lynch's painstakingly naturalistic sets, one critic recognized a "rugged Pacific Northwest Alpine ambience." And Mr. Pakledinaz's costumes, based on both contemporary deconstructionist fashion design and clothes of ancient Slavic and Middle Eastern cultures, strive for a primeval feel.
"I'm interested in the 'Ring' as a work of art which looks very radically at a future in which all the messes made by humankind are cleaned up and a fresh slate is provided for the earth," Mr. Wadsworth said.
The "Walkure" last year produced an epiphany in the vivid, poignant Brunnhilde of Ms. Eaglen, who is often criticized for stolidity onstage. "The reason it was such a great performance is that Jane Eaglen has a great performance of Brunnhilde in her," Mr. Wadsworth said. "Maybe some directors are afraid of a big, strong woman. She was so happy to be asked to express herself physically as well as vocally. I just gave a small key to an incredibly smart, gifted singing actress who is ready to fly."
For all its intimacy and detail, this "Ring" does not skimp on splashy stage effects. The Rhinemaidens fly 24 feet above the stage, lightning fulminates, and gallons of propane are consumed to the tune of Wagner's Magic Fire music.
Mr. Jenkins will undoubtedly revel in this feast of fancy stagecraft while he can, for days of austerity lie ahead. The company's home, the 3,000-seat Seattle Opera House, owned by the city, has endured much wear and tear since it opened in 1927. Despite sporadic "Band-Aid fixes" that have kept it running, its outmoded facilities and dated amenities are long overdue for repair.
When the building finally closes for renovation in December, the Seattle Opera is to move a half-block east to the Mercer Arts Arena, a former hockey rink being temporarily converted to a 2,900-seat theater. The Opera House is scheduled to reopen as Marion Oliver McCaw Hall in 2003, with the company's first production of Wagner's "Parsifal."
The renovation is intended to improve the hall's sight lines and add tiered box seats without damaging the acoustics. A 400-seat lecture hall will also be added, along with a cafe. The facade will be replaced, and backstage facilities, building utilities and structural elements (including seismic reinforcement) upgraded.
The city of Seattle will cover one-third of the $110 million cost, with King County and Washington State each contributing $17 million. But Mr. Jenkins must raise the rest from private sources. Boeing's recent decision to relocate its headquarters to Chicago, the current perils of Microsoft and the economic downturn are naturally causing him tense moments.
BUT it is not his style to stew, and with his contract extending to 2008, Mr. Jenkins has a lot to keep him busy. His plans include "Ring" revivals in 2005, 2009 and 2013, several commissions and longer seasons. He also hopes to build a new office and rehearsal facility near the opera house and beef up the company's endowment fund, young artists' program and educational offerings. Still, at the moment, the renovation looms largest in his sights.
After all, when you've recruited a cult, the least you can do is build it a bang-up temple.

HEADLINE: Architectural Superstars Tackle Three Hartford Attractions 

BYLINE:  By STACEY STOWE 

 BODY:
IF one measure of a city is its architecture, Hartford is poised for a growth spurt as three of the city's major cultural institutions have announced multimillion-dollar building projects by high profile architects.
 The Wadsworth Atheneum, the Connecticut Historical Society and the Mark Twain House are in the planning stages for major expansions to enhance their presence, and with the proposed $1 billion Adrian's Landing project, they may help increase the economic fortunes of the city. 
 "Taken together, these projects provide jobs and economic opportunity, but they are also giving the city a new face," Gov. John Rowland said. "After a long period of stagnation, Hartford needs to feel good about itself again." 
The most extensive of the three projects is the expansion and redesign of the Wadsworth, the nation's oldest public art museum and recognized as the crown jewel of the city's cultural institutions.
The current space allows for the display of 2,500 of the museum's 45,000 holdings in various galleries set up in five separate buildings around a courtyard.
With the expansion, the space would increase by 40 percent, a special exhibits gallery would be included and the entrance would move from the castle-like facade on Main Street (which the museum director describes as "forbidding") to a side street across from the Traveler's Tower.
A public concourse would begin there, travel through the spine of the museum and open at Burr Mall, just steps from Hartford City Hall.
Maya Lin, the artist who designed the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, has been commissioned to design a work for the Main Street exterior.
Ben van Berkel and Caroline Bos, a husband and wife team based in Amsterdam, were selected last February from among 70 architects for the Wadsworth project.
Kate M. Sellers, the museum's director, said the 36-member board deliberately chose a firm whose work is considered experimental. 
"We weren't looking at the list of architects always associated with big projects," Ms. Sellers said. "If you look at the history of the Wadsworth, there's a tradition of innovation."
The cost, size and appearance of the project will be completed in early fall, Ms. Sellers said.
Susan Hood, public relations officer for the museum, said the state had committed about $15 million, adding that an additional $20 million had been raised through private sources.
A public fund-raising campaign will begin next year and the project will get under way in 2003.
Perhaps the most ambitious of the three projects is the new building commissioned by the Connecticut Historical Society on city parkland near Trinity College.
The historical society has hired Frank Gehry to design an estimated 115,000-square-foot Connecticut History Center with a 200-seat theater, exhibition space and restaurant.
Mr. Gehry's design of curving swaths of titanium steel for the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain was credited with boosting tourism, and David Kahn, the director of the historical society, has similar hopes for the Hartford plan.
Mr. Kahn said the new center would act as "a gateway to the state's history" by unifying historical information from the state's 169 towns.
Although visits to the historical society have tripled from 10,000 to 30,000 visitors a year since Mr. Kahn became the director four years ago, he said he thought as many as 100,000 people will visit the new history center each year for the interactive exhibits and to see its historical treasures, which include a chair made from the Charter Oak.
Staff members at the historical society said they have long outgrown their space on Elizabeth Street, a quiet, tree-lined road next to the University of Connecticut School of Law and a few blocks from St. Francis Hospital.
The new building would expand the exhibit space from 6,000 square feet in a warren of low-ceilinged rooms to more than 30,000, enabling the display of many items currently in storage because of a lack of space.
Computers for the interactive exhibits, a cafeteria and gift shop are also included in the plan. The cost of the new building has not been determined, but Mr. Kahn estimated it may cost $40 million.
He said that Governor Rowland had asked the Bush administration for $25 million in federal funds for the project.
How this institution for scholars and school children managed to retain Mr. Gehry can be traced to Evan Dobelle, the former Trinity College president, who upon meeting Mr. Gehry asked him if he would be interested in designing a building in Hartford.
Mr. Dobelle, who is now the president of the University of Hawaii, masterminded the Learning Corridor, a complex of schools for children ages 3 through high school, a block from Trinity and in one of the city's poorest neighborhoods. The new history center will also be in the Trinity neighborhood but on Zion Street at its western edge, where new development has been virtually nonexistent.
But the exact location of the center is clouded. The land, in Rocky Ridge Park, is a 13-acre site owned by the city. Under the terms of its deed (Trinity gave the property to the city in a land exchange in 1891) if the land is sold, it must be replaced with similar property.
Potential parkland, however, is scarce in Hartford, Maxine Stewart, chairwoman of the city's parks and recreation advisory committee, said. 
"We were concerned about replacing all this green with asphalt and putting a huge building here that would stick out like a sore thumb," Ms. Stewart said. 
In the late 1980's, the city agreed to maintain the land for public outdoor recreation, thus any changes to the property would need the approval of the Hartford City Council and would be regulated by the state's attorney general.
But Mr. Kahn said he was not concerned because extensive legal research has already been done on the land. He said he planned to approach the city after Mr. Gehry visited the site later this year.
Mr. Kahn, however, said he would be thrilled by the specter of an about-face for the project, but acknowledged that some people, particularly those associated with the historical society when it was housed in the Wadsworth before the 1950's, were skeptical of the change.
"It is a major change," he said. "But it isn't a nutty scheme. Models of historical societies of our size scaling up to much larger facilities have been very successful."
The revamping of some of the city's cultural institutions coincides with the development of Adrian's Landing, a massive building project that will include a 500,000-square-foot convention center, a mix of residential and retail space and an entertainment center loosely defined as "science-based."
How to travel between all of the attractions when walking is not feasible?
One facet of the Hartford project, known as "Six Pillars," will address inadequate parking and poor public transportation, said Patrick L. Pinnell, a Higganum architect and the local planner for a 1998 development strategy study of the city.
Although R. Bartley Halloran, chairman of the Capital City Economic Development Authority, estimated the number of parking spaces for Adrian's Landing -- which he said the Wadsworth can share -- to be "in the thousands," Mr. Pinnell said he thought it still will not be enough spaces.
As for the city's public transportation, Mr. Pinnell said a range of transit strategies, including a light rail line and a jitney system that would ultimately connect cultural institutions and Adrian's Landing, has been considered. 
"With all three of these projects and Adrian's Landing, transportation is nobody's job to do right now," Mr. Pinnell said.
The Mark Twain House may not be an easy walk from downtown, yet some 52,000 people visit the writer's home each year. When a 35,000-square-foot visitor's center is built, the historic house will be able to accommodate more tours.
Robert A. M. Stern, an architect, was commissioned last spring to design the center, which board members and the staff said they believed will expand a typical one-hour visit to a half-day outing.
Ground will be broken this fall on the $11 million to $13 million project to house rotating exhibit space, an orientation film on Twain commissioned by the documentary film maker, Ken Burns, lecture hall and restaurant.
About $13 million has been raised through private donors, although a portion is earmarked for endowment and other capital projects. About $5.5 million dollars of state and federal financing was secured for house restoration.
Samuel Clemens, whose pen name was Mark Twain, lived with his family at the 19th-century house on Farmington Avenue from 1874 to 1891.
It was here, in rooms decorated by Louis Comfort Tiffany, he wrote his best-known books, including, "Huckleberry Finn," and "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."
Before its major restoration in 1974, the house was used variously as a branch of the Hartford Public Library, a school, and private apartments. 
The challenge of the new building is its narrow and severely sloped site. Mr. Stern, who is the dean of the Yale University School of Architecture and in private practice in New York City, was hired with three criteria from the Mark Twain board: the new structure had to "resonate but not compete with the historic building," meet the needs of a revamped program for the house and maintain the historic landscape of the property.
The Mark Twain House sits in an area once known as Nook Farm, a literary enclave that also includes the home of the 19th-century writer Harriet Beecher Stowe.

GRAPHIC: Photos: An expansion at the Mark Twain House, proposal at left, would provide a 35,000-square-foot visitor's center between the carriage house, above, and Hartford Public High School. The Wadsworth Atheneum, the nation's oldest public art museum, shown in the next three photographs, would gain 40 percent more space and a new entrance. The open court, with the umbrellas, would become a public concourse.

HEADLINE: Cleaning Up the Stables, But Not With a Shovel 

BYLINE:  By LISA SUHAY 

DATELINE: WILLIAMSTOWN 

 BODY:
The barrels of drinking water were coated with green algae, and the stench of ammonia billowed from the barn, which had not been cleaned in months. Bill Lombardi, director of the Gloucester County Animal Shelter, began to gag.
 Leslie Toner of Holmdel, publisher of the online Horse and Farm Magazine and the founder of Horse Helpers R&R, said this was a scenario that had become more and more commonplace in recent years, resulting in a push for state legislation. 
 In fact, Ms. Toner said, New Jersey had more horses per square mile than any other state, while at the same time it had the nation's worst horse welfare system. 
There are more than 50,000 horses in New Jersey, and the four largest rescue operations here take in an average of 200 horses each year, Ms. Toner said. "There are approximately 300 rescues nationally. These nonprofit groups are staffed by volunteers and will take in starving or mistreated horses to be rehabilitated and adopted out to new owners."
At the petting zoo here, the owner was only given a warning, something Mr. Lombardi said was the norm in a state where local animal shelters, S.P.C.A. facilities and the police are not geared to handle anything bigger than a large dog.
Experts in the field of horse rescues say it is a combination of economics, ignorance and pride that is causing an increase in the number of rescues each year. People either underestimate the cost of owning an animal that spends 20 hours a day eating and requires constant veterinary attention, or they do not know enough about equine nutritional and medical needs, which are vast.
New Jersey has four nationally recognized horse rescue operations: Horse Helpers R&R in Holmdel; Mylestone Equine Rescue in Phillipsburg; Standard Bred Retirement Foundation, Freehold; and Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation Inc. in Shrewsbury. In addition, there are a handful of private individuals with farms who perform the same function.
These organizations, plus a dozen veterinarians and breeders, are trying to do through legislation what they have not been able to do any other way.
"I started my rescue and this legislation push out of rage," said Ms. Toner. "I have seen horses in this state starved and in condition that it would make your heart break just to look at them."
Ms. Toner said the case in Williamstown was classic, and one she intends to use in a package of information that she is putting together to approach state legislators.
"In this case the horses were starving because the farm owner had an economic problem," Ms. Toner said. "But it does not take a lot of money to clean and bleach out a water barrel so the horses do not dehydrate. That's neglect. That's where uniform standards would give local authorities some help and guidance."
To that end, Ms. Toner met recently with Bret D. Schundler, the Republican candidate for governor, to discuss the future of the legislation that would charge each of the state's 76,000 stables and boarding facilities $100 a year for a license, raising more than $700,000 a year to assist in horse rescues.
Ms. Toner and a group of New Jersey breeders, veterinarians and rescue operators are working to create legislation that would mandate a uniform care standard for horses, following the lead of Georgia and Maryland in making the state Department of Agriculture, not local S.P.C.A.'s or animal control, responsible for the relocation of abused horses.
In the Williamstown case the owner, Debbie Mullen, had fallen on hard times after a divorce last winter, and the animals' welfare was put on a back burner, Mr. Lombardi said.
"She couldn't keep up the animals, and she was too proud to ask for help," Mr. Lombardi said. "She is embarrassed and angry that this is out in the open now. Just refused to tell anyone how bad it really was there. Believe me, it was bad."
On a lane where most homes have a paddock in the backyard and chickens pecking at the front walk, the sight of Ms. Mullen's five horses (two she owned, and three were boarded there), three ponies, a zebu -- an oxlike animal -- two goats, two sheep and one burro was not unusual.
Ms. Mullen and her daughter came to the chained and padlocked gate of her small, rundown farm, situated in a residential neighborhood where horses grazed in several back yards and chickens roamed the front walkways.
When asked about the complaints and the investigation, Ms. Mullen said: "The people who complained are just troublemakers. There is no problem here. Never was. The people who complained were just trying to harass me. My animals are nobody's business but mine."
Yet Mr. Lombardi said that Ms. Mullen had signed over two of the malnourished ponies to a local horse rescue organization.
In Ms. Mullen's case, the remaining animals that Mr. Lombardi examined and deemed also to be malnourished and poorly cared for remained with her and were receiving food and medical attention.
One horse boarded there, Jack, was returned to his owner, Marcia Samero, who said she placed Jack with Ms. Mullen because she was undergoing cancer treatment and could not care for him.
"I was horrified when I saw Jack," said Ms. Samero, who chose not to sue Ms. Mullen because she felt there would little chance of monetary satisfaction. "This made me wish stables were licensed so you could at least have the satisfaction of revoking it."
Mona Kanciper, founder of New York Horse Rescue, based in Manorville, on Long Island, said the problem of well-intentioned owners and boarding facilities starving animals was a nationwide problem.
"I think these people go into denial, then shame," Ms. Kanciper said. "I often wonder who we are rescuing -- the horses or the owners."
Kathleen Schwartz, founder of the Days Inn Horse Rescue in Lisbon, Md., said S.P.C.A.'s and local animal control could not afford to handle horses. Also, when a horse was seized in an abuse case, it was property -- and evidence -- that the police must hold on to until the case goes to court.
Agatha Abruzzo, who will only admit her age to be somewhere in the 80's, has run the Gloucester County S.P.C.A. since 1972 in addition to her own farm in Swedesboro.
"I don't get paid a dime to do this job," Ms. Abruzzo said. "If I get more than one call, if a couple of animals die, I try and get out there. But it's getting pretty tough at my age, and I just got out of the hospital and all. I rely on Bill Lombardi to help me out when he can."
Given a week to comply with a list of changes that included more hay, grain, clean water, clean stalls and veterinary treatment, Ms. Mullen had to turn to neighbors for help, according to Mr. Lombardi.
"She finally broke down and let people help her," he said. "There are plenty more people in her same situation in this state. Plenty of animals starving to death with owners too proud to ask and not enough of us to go around protecting them."

Reinventing the Golf Course, With Quality and Price in Mind

BYLINE:  By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
IF you are hooked on golf, chances are you have played a few of the many courses around Myrtle Beach, S.C., or Scottsdale, Ariz. Perhaps you have even visited the luxury resorts at Pinehurst in the hills of North Carolina or Pebble Beach on the rocky Monterey Peninsula of California -- or dreamed of doing so.
 But if you blanch at the thought of another visit to the overbuilt, ticky-tacky atmosphere of Myrtle Beach or paying, say, $600 for a room at the Lodge at Pebble Beach just to assure yourself a $350 tee time at the most famous course in the country, don't despair. 
 Golf will never be cheap, but there are a number of great new courses that any golfer can aspire to play. In the past, nearly all good courses were built for costly, exclusive country clubs near major cities, but many of the best new courses today are found at public resorts or in out-of-the-way destinations where beautiful unspoiled land is still available. 
"In the last decade or so, we've witnessed a second golden age of golf course design, and we're all the beneficiaries," said Joseph Mark Passov, author of "The Unofficial Guide to Golf Vacations in the Eastern U.S." "At the old-style resort, golf was more of an amenity to go along with everything else."
At the new destinations, Mr. Passov said, "you've got to have a spectacular-looking layout and provide a few thrills in the course of a round or the players just won't come."
"People will accept a few lost balls for that kind of experience," he added.
Indeed, as the standards of public golf have risen, some merely good courses are struggling to survive and many are cutting prices. Best of all for golfers, the modern look, while often highly stylized, harks back to the game's origins. 
Most of the stunning courses of recent years were inspired more by the wild, treeless landscapes of the links courses of the British Isles and the rugged, sand-filled challenges of the ultraprivate Pine Valley in southern New Jersey than by the lush, green-carpeted country club look brought to its highest polish at Augusta National, where the Masters tournament is played.
So where should you go to try a new-style course?
After the 1990's economic boom, golf meccas can be found in almost every region of the country, from northern Michigan to the Mississippi coast. Many of the best require some sort of trip from major cities: the Boulders, with its two moonscapelike courses north of Scottsdale, is luring vacationers away from the Phoenix sprawl; World Woods, north of Tampa, is a magnet for golfers looking for out-of-the-ordinary courses amid the flat Florida landscape.
Even places like Bismarck, N.D., with the stark Hawktree Golf Club featuring prairie-grass rough and black sand traps, and Anaconda, Mont., where Jack Nicklaus has built the inexpensive Old Works Course through the Superfund site of an abandoned copper smelter, now can boast of first-class golf, drawing players from far afield.
But the place that may be generating the most talk among golfers is the truly remote Bandon, Ore., where two courses have opened on a windswept bluff above the Pacific Ocean. Already, they are being compared to the best in the world.
The first course, designed by an unknown Scottish architect, David McLay Kidd, opened in 1999. Threading through sand dunes, wild grasses and wasteland, Bandon Dunes has seven holes along the ocean; all the others have ocean views. The second course, known as Pacific Dunes, opened this month. Designed by Tom Doak, a golf course architect who prides himself on avoiding artificiality, it appears even rawer.
I haven't been there, but Jaime Diaz, a contributing editor to Golf Digest magazine who has played most of the world's great courses, has tried both. 
"I'm convinced," Mr. Diaz wrote recently, "it won't be long before Bandon and Pacific -- given their public accessibility, unspoiled environment, dramatic setting, thoughtful design and true golf spirit -- are considered the best tandem of courses in the world."
THIS is golf for purists. There is little to do at the resort -- 100 miles north of the California state line and a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Eugene, Ore., the nearest city -- but play golf amid some of the most magnificent scenery in the country.
"Maybe you can't get farther from the Scotland-Ireland axis in the contiguous United States than the Oregon Coast," Mr. Diaz said, "but give or take a few pubs, you also can't get any closer to the cradle of the game."
By the standards of upscale golf, the Bandon courses are relative bargains. A round costs $120 in high season; add $70 to play a second round the same day. Walking is required; caddies are available.
Back from the ocean, there is a small lodge with 21 rooms and several outbuildings with rooms and suites at rates from $165 for two to $850 for a four-person cottage. The huge cedar-sided clubhouse has a modern look that nonetheless evokes the spirit of Sanford White's architecture. It offers a spa and exercise room; the resort has three restaurants. Other lodging and dining is available in the town of Bandon, but that is all simply a backdrop to the natural stage. 
"The courses look old even though they are new," Mr. Diaz said. "As a golf experience, these are as satisfying as anything anywhere. And once you get there, it's affordable. At Pebble, you're talking about $1,000 a day; at Bandon you can have the same thing for perhaps a little more than $200."
Perhaps. For those seeking a more complete resort experience (at significantly higher prices), but one where golf is still the prime attraction, there is probably nothing better than the American Club in, of all places, Kohler, Wis., home of the Kohler Company, the plumbing fixtures maker.
How do you get there? Fly to Milwaukee, the hub city of Midwest Express, and drive about an hour north on Interstate 43. Kohler is a classic company town; the luxury hotel was once a dormitory for immigrant men who arrived in the early decades of the 20th century to work at the factory.
Since 1988, Pete Dye has built four courses near the resort -- two along Lake Michigan, two wandering through a pristine river valley. 
The resort has a first-class spa and health club and excellent facilities for fishing, swimming and tennis. Seven restaurants are available.
The River Course and Meadow Valleys Course at Blackwolf Run evoke the classic parkland style though with diabolical touches: visually intimidating views from the tees, a number of tree-lined fairways yet many elevation changes that produce majestic vistas, trouble on most approach shots, tricky putting greens.
At Whistling Straits, by contrast, the three-year-old Straits Course, with eight holes directly along the shoreline, was modeled, like the Bandon courses, after the rugged, mostly treeless Irish and Scottish links of Ballybunion and Turnberry. Just inland is the more sedate Irish Course.
Walking is required on the Straits Course. And in a rare honor for such a new course, the Professional Golfers Association championship will be played there in 2004.
"It's very difficult, but not unfair," said Peter Jacobson, the professional golfer, who played there on his own last year. "To me, it's one of the most significant courses built in the U.S. in the last 50 years."
What if you don't want to go all out at a faraway resort? Golfers who live in the Northeast might want to think about Maryland as a closer alternative to the many resorts in Florida and the Carolinas.
Ocean City may be a honky-tonk beach town with its busy boardwalk, but it has also become almost a year-round golf destination where at least one new course, the Links at Lighthouse Sound, can lay claim to being among the best and most attractive marshland courses in the country.
Just across the bay from the barrier island strip, the course, designed by Arthur Hill, preserved hundreds of acres of pristine marsh and wooded wetlands. Certified as an Audubon Sanctuary, the course features a 1,500-foot elevated cart path, the longest in the country, to protect the marsh.
It is the best in an area that now features several highly rated courses like Rum Pointe and Eagle's Landing. 
Even closer to the population centers are a couple of new courses that are just off I-95 in northeastern Maryland. Bulle Rock, built by Pete Dye on the site of an old horse farm, has already received the maximum five stars from Golf Digest, and Beechtree, another natural layout by Mr. Doak, deserves better than the three-and-a-half stars it received. A long-neglected area, best known for the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground, it has little to offer visitors who want to stay the night. But when Bulle Rock opens a resort hotel in two years, along with an additional 18 holes, it should become a prime golf destination.
TO keep up with the new golf jewels, some traditional resorts have been forced to recut their aging courses to produce a fresh sparkle.
For example, the Sea Island Golf Club, in Georgia, which dates to 1927, has transformed a collection of 9-hole layouts into two different 18-hole courses. The new Seaside Course, by Tom Fazio, is a links-style course that extends the original design by Harry S. Colt and Charles Alison of London, who created or remodeled some of the greatest courses of the 1920's and early 1930's. The other, known as Plantation, was rebuilt by Rees Jones as an updated but classic tree-lined design. A third redesigned course is scheduled to open this year.
And the resort, known for the Cloister, the traditional hotel nearby, has built a luxury lodge and clubhouse amid the golf courses.
Indeed, for all the economic troubles of the golf business, the best of the old and the new appear to be coming together as never before.
"I believe," Mr. Diaz said, "the best courses ever designed are being built right now."

HEADLINE: Playland: Treasured Spot Or Money Pit? 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

DATELINE: RYE 

 BODY:
THE waves lapped against the shore, almost in rhythm to the lilting fox trot played on the boardwalk by the Milt Gerver Orchestra. Dozens of elderly people danced in front of the bandstand as Mr. Gerver smiled in his crisp white blazer.
 Nearby, teenagers squealed with excitement as the high-flying Sea Dragon ride propelled them high into the noisy night. Well-dressed couples with strollers watched fireworks splashing Technicolor memories across the evening sky. 
 It was another Friday night at Playland and all seemed right with the world. Problems were as distant as the twinkling lights across Long Island Sound. 
But all is not right with Playland. Tomorrow morning, the Westchester County Legislature will meet in special session to discuss problems facing the park.
When Playland opened in 1928, it was called "the crowning achievement of the Westchester County Parks Commission." Praised for its sophisticated design, it once attracted four million visitors a year. But this golden age is long gone, and for decades the park has drawn complaints from neighbors, upset about traffic and the behavior of parkgoers, and charges from critics that it is mismanaged. 
These days especially, Playland is showing its age.
The colonnades that frame the park's main mall, as well as the 14 towers, have deteriorated and are sinking into the sandy soil. The structures are considered a crucial element in the park's landmark status. So park officials want to build replicas.
But last month, the county's Board of Legislators voted against allocating the entire $10 million needed for the project. Playland officials reacted by saying that this would bruise the park's historic integrity and might endanger its standing as the nation's only amusement park registered as a historic landmark.
County Executive Andrew J. Spano had requested the funds for the colonnade project. The board had already approved $3 million for park infrastructure repairs and had approved $6.2 million for the colonnade project. But when the cost rose to $10 million, many legislators called it exorbitant and voted to send the proposal back to the budget committee for reconsideration.
The board also refused to allocate an extra $1.2 million for a new performance stage.
Some legislators called Playland "a money pit," and said that instead of spending millions on a park that loses money every year, the county should use the money for ball fields, day care centers or tax breaks.
"The park should be a business and stand on its own," said Michael B. Kaplowitz, a Democrat from Somers, a legislator and vice chairman of the board's budget committee. "I have no problem with the park not turning a profit. I don't want to bring in Six Flags and turn it into a mega-amusement park and ruin the history of it, and I certainly don't want to be the legislator who finished Playland.
"But we have to do it cost-effectively and I find it difficult to accept having to spend $10 million to restore these pillars. We don't have a bottomless pit of money. Think of what that money could buy in terms of baseball fields or social services or open space."
Katherine S. Carsky, a Republican from Yonkers, suggested rethinking the county's position on the park: "We're spending a disproportionate amount of our parks funding on Playland," she said, "and we want to be assured that we're not spending good money after bad."
But Mr. Spano and some legislators called the board's actions a threat to Playland, which they consider an irreplaceable county treasure, one that has survived as a family park even as others, including Asbury Park, Freedomland and Palisades Park, have deteriorated.
"To deny money to a place like Playland because it's not making a profit as a public park, I find ludicrous," Mr. Spano said. "The parks are for the enjoyment of the people. These new legislators have to understand the significance of Playland."
He added, "This county has enough money to fix Playland and to build things like ball fields, and we're going to do both."
Of the $35.8 million that the county spent operating its parks last year, some $13 million was allocated to Playland. But, as Stanley G. Motley, the county's parks commissioner, pointed out, gross profits from Playland constitute almost half the $25 million in total annual revenue the county makes from the entire parks system.
And park officials argue the amusement park itself is no burden on taxpayers. In fact, they said, it makes a profit of about $50,000. Of course, running the rest of Playland -- the ice rink, the beach and the pool -- costs the county over $1 million a year.
Playland's director, Joseph G. Montalto, said Playland has had a resurgence over the last few years, attracting more than a million people a year since 1998. The recent denial of funds, he said, would work against the park's comeback.
He called Playland "an economic engine" that helps local businesses and draws tourists. The park is the largest single provider of summer jobs in Westchester, he said, offering roughly 1,000 seasonal positions.
Mr. Montalto said the colonnade structures continue to deteriorate and that "at some point, it's sink or swim," for them. 
Much of Playland's niche as a quaint family park, he said, comes from its historic structures and removing the colonnades would "wreck the feel of the park."
"This is a hands-on, living, working museum," Mr. Montalto said. "When people come here, it's like they just stepped back into the 1930's, and they like it that way."
Repairing Playland will only increase its profitability, he said. For example, building a new performance stage would enable the park to hold evening concerts by high-profile performers, attracting up to 10,000 paying customers. He called the current stage outdated and "held together with spit and rubber bands."
When Pat Benatar played there last summer, she parked her tour bus behind the stage to provide bathrooms and other space the stage lacked.
George S. Latimer, chairman of the Board of Legislators and the legislator representing Rye, defends Playland and said it was wrong to expect it to turn a profit.
Unlike privately run amusement parks that can focus on making money, he said, Playland has other obligations, including being a good neighbor, being environmentally conscious and providing affordable family-style entertainment.
He said the county's money is well spent on Playland, especially because many park users come from lower- and middle-income families with fewer leisure alternatives.
"Playland is an anachronism," he said, "but to call it a money pit and say it has to pay for itself is an immature response."
Playland may be Westchester's most renowned spot. It has been seen in films like "Big," "Fatal Attraction" and "Sweet and Lowdown," as well as music videos, including Mariah Carey's "Fantasy."
"You talk to some people around this country, and if they know one thing about Westchester County, it's Playland," said Mr. Motley, who has held parks commissioner positions throughout the country.
Playland replaced a ramshackle seaside resort that included, according to an old newspaper article, "bawdy hotels and rowdy amusement areas attracting unsavory crowds."
The City of Rye petitioned the county to buy the area and develop it. County leaders built the park along with a lattice of parkways to draw potential homebuyers to Westchester. Playland Parkway was built, "insuring a middle-class clientele arriving by car," noted one newspaper account.
Designers had the lofty goal of creating "an amusement park possessing artistic merit to attract a class of people who before resented going to summer amusement resorts of the 'Coney Island' type and to educate the habitual amusement parkgoers to an appreciation and a desire for things beautiful."
"Playland is not an amusement park," declared one 1928 advertisement. "It is a greater, finer, better thing. Playland is the start of a modern recreation center such as the world has never known."
The park opened on Memorial Day weekend in 1928 with the hoopla of a World's Fair. The only amusement park designed in Art Deco style, Playland was called the "the poor man's country club."
The park was unique in that it was county-designed, built and operated.
Admission to Playland has always been free, and when the park first opened, parking cost 25 cents and rides cost 15 cents. 
The park featured a circus, aerial acts, human cannonballs and live organists. The sound system piped "restrained harmonious music" through seven wooden speakers, 40 feet long and 7 feet wide.
Playland draws nowhere near the crowds it did in its earlier days. A typical hot Sunday would find some 20,000 people on the beach, according to newspaper articles. Playland now gets less than 100,000 beach and poolgoers over the entire summer (65,843 last year because of rainy weekends and 97,192 in 1999).
Although Rye residents were eager to see Playland replace the colony of hotels, restaurants and slapdash carnival attractions that had occupied the site, the City of Rye has never exactly embraced Playland.
Before the park opened in 1928, The Rye Chronicle warned that Rye "may not relish the idea of having its fine shorefront monopolized by great hordes from New York," but added that marketers would book group excursions that would "bring a desirable class of business to Playland."
After Playland opened, another article reported that residents were complaining that "the amusement park was noisy and attracted undesirables, and Playland officials countering with charges that enforcement of Rye's petty ordinances was interfering with the operation of the park."
Neighbors complained about overflow parking that interrupted local baseball games and parkgoers who changed their clothes in their cars.
Even today, Playland is still one of the most important issues in Rye.
"There's almost a love-hate relationship here," said Arthur H. Stampleman, a member of the Rye City Council, who explained that complaints about traffic, fireworks and rude patrons seem to be an inevitable result of Playland being in the middle of an upscale bedroom community.
"All you need is something bothersome to happen once or twice a year, and that's what people remember," he said.
Rye has never tried to draw parkgoers to its shops. There are no stores along Playland Parkway and no signs indicating that Rye Village, a thriving downtown of boutiques and sandwich shops, is a minute's drive away.
"Capitalizing on the park by pulling its clientele into the shopping area has just never been done," said Barbie Haynes, a real estate agent at Merritt Associates, an agency in Rye. "Rye has always kept them two separate entities. The main objective of the Playland clientele is to get to Playland, and then leave and go home."
Ms. Haynes said that a property near the Playland tends to be "at a little lesser price point than if it were in a quieter neighborhood in Rye."
But some buyers, she said, enjoy the prospect of living near Playland. "We tell them, 'It's not like one of those new parks over in Jersey. It's an amusement park that's been here forever, and it's something you have to do once a summer with your kids.' "
Many residents are still seething over an incident earlier this month. Playland booked an outing for some 11,000 corrections officers, but traffic flooded the park early on and the park had to close its gates, causing traffic backups along Playland Parkway and onto Interstate 95.
Michael Klemens, chairman of the City of Rye's Planning Commission who lives just off Playland Parkway, said that such backups plague local residents because some park-bound drivers pull over and start their partying roadside, often drinking and urinating and "making out" in his yard.
"There have been times we've had to retreat into the house," he said, adding that it is also unfair to parkgoers. "I've seen families sitting in three-hour traffic jams with kids screaming and crying.
"It's a very deep and complicated issue, and it's been a major source of tension in the community," he said. "People have said, 'Close it down,' and there's a hysteria: people want to pull up all bridges, but you can't. The reality is that we both need to be good neighbors. We should not shut our community off just because they come from 'outside areas,' whether it's Scarsdale or the Bronx."
Mayor Steven Otis called Playland "a mixture of benefits and burdens for our community" but added that things have improved and that Rye has been working with the county to address the main problem of weekend traffic congestion.
The park has stopped running garbage trucks in the early morning, and when residents complained that Playland's Wednesday evening fireworks show was waking their children, park officials removed louder rockets from the show and moved that starting time to 9:15, from after 10.
"It's a fantastic place 10 months a year -- it's the two summer months that are the problem," said Lillian Candreva, who lives near the park on a block that she says is used as a shortcut by parkgoers. Some have, on occasion, parked in front of her house and barbecued on her lawn, she said, leaving behind trash, including disposable diapers.
Another nearby resident, Orna Nahor, had similar complaints. Ms. Nahor takes her children to Playland about twice a week. Still, she said, problems arise when the parking lots fill up. Then users park at Rye Town Park and damage its lawns. They also spill out onto Playland's fringes, starting ad-hoc picnics and parking lot parties.
"Here you have one of the richest places in the world and it looks like a third world country," she said. "If you come from Harlem and the Bronx, great. But take care of it. Don't leave trash all over."
In the past, the park was plagued with urban problems, like gang-related fights. But things have improved, with fewer park users getting into trouble. 
"The people come here off 95 and they go right back onto 95," Mr. Montalto said.
Certainly, Playland's clientele has changed over the years.
For one thing, it has gotten more difficult to attract suburban families who can take more upscale vacations.
Mr. Montalto said it was difficult to say where visitors are from, but on weekdays the park is used more by Westchester residents, including many camps. On weekends, there are more people from outside Westchester, mostly from New York City.
"There's always been a relationship between Westchester and the city," he said. "It's not a foreign country."
There has been much debate over whether to modernize Playland to attract thrill-seekers from far and wide or to preserve its older elements and protect the park as a historic treasure serving more of a local family clientele.
Park officials say the decision is at the heart of the future of Playland. A successful strategy, they say, requires a delicate balance between attention to the old and the new.
Over the last few years, the county has intensified its marketing -- largely in New York City -- touting its exciting new rides. 
But Playland cannot compete with larger amusement parks, Mr. Montalto said. It can only survive, he argued, by maintaining its niche as a family amusement park.
Overloading the park with newer rides could both threaten its landmark status and drive away customers who enjoy Playland's quaintness.
Of course, many Playland patrons care little about the historic structures. Last Wednesday, the temperatures were in the 90's, and the Rivera family stood on the boardwalk enjoying the 73-year-old bathhouse tower more for the shade it offered than its Spanish Revival art deco style.
Carlos and Maria Rivera had taken the train and bus from the South Bronx, bringing their three young children.
'It's nice to have the beach and the rides in one place," Ms. Rivera said. "Plus, it's nicer than Coney Island."

Following the Hudson River School
 A summer's day, a river view, a sketchpad. Historic Hudson Valley is inviting artists at all levels to share in the landscape that inspired Hudson River School painters like Thomas Cole. The place is Kykuit, the Rockefeller estate in Pocantico Hills, where a two-day drawing class, "The Artist's Eye," will take place Aug. 9-10. 
 You provide the drawing board, sketchbook and other supplies; Historic Hudson will provide transportation from Philipsburg Manor in North Tarrytown, a box lunch and the landscape. The course is limited to 20 people and costs $70 ($55 for members of Historic Hudson). 
Susan Greenstein, who directs programs at Kykuit, said the class was something new for Historic Hudson. "When you're up at Kykuit, you're surrounded by Governor Rockefeller's painting and sculpture collections, the gardens and the same view of the river that inspired all those 19th-century artists," she said. "So often, visitors say it would be wonderful to have some time to relax here. This is a real opportunity to give people a chance to do some of their own drawing on the grounds." 
To set the mood, Gillian Greenhill Hannum, a professor of art history at Manhattanville College, will begin with a lecture on the Hudson River School. The next day, she will read from Emerson, Thoreau and Washington Irving. The drawing instructor, Francis Sprout, will demonstrate Hudson River School techniques.
Mr. Sprout, who teaches at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and at Manhattanville, is a conceptual artist who began as a landscape painter. Why will the students sketch and not paint at Kykuit? To be true to 19th-century methods, Mr. Sprout said.
Information: (914) 631-8200, ext. 618.

Widening an Orchestra's Appeal
Michael Shapiro has what every conductor hopes for -- his own orchestra to shape. Mr. Shapiro is the new music director of the 42-year-old Chappaqua Chamber Orchestra, a semiprofessional group with many volunteer players that performs at Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua.
"Under me this orchestra will be different," Mr. Shapiro said, promising to bring in new audiences by programming "the music of our common heritage."
This means music from Broadway and Hollywood as well as a concert in memory of Holocaust victims. (Mr. Shapiro, a 16-year Chappaqua resident who is also a composer and pianist, was a music consultant to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.) The season will open on Nov. 17 at 4 p.m. at Horace Greeley High School auditorium with a family concert called "Storybook Hour."
"We're concerned with breaking down the old barriers, so the choice of repertoire is very important," Mr. Shapiro said of his mission to attract teenagers, in particular. "We want to be a compelling choice." Information: (914) 238-1373.

For Arts, the Economy Is Booming
Alvin H. Reiss sees the big picture when he views the American art scene. From his perch, the arts in America are "in a stronger position than ever before."
Mr. Reiss of Somers teaches, lectures and writes about arts management, has been monitoring the health of arts institutions for 40 years. He also edits the periodical Arts Management and has written books like "Don't Just Applaud, Send Money." 
He accentuates the positive when he counsels arts groups on approaching businesses for money. "They've got to learn what resources they have, and not undersell themselves," he said. ROBERTA HERSHENSON

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Belmont; 
Close-Knit Bronx Area With Italian Aura

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
FOR hundreds of thousands of Italian-Americans in the metropolitan area and beyond, it is "the old neighborhood," a hallowed place remembered at family gatherings, the setting for countless stories told to children and grandchildren. It is Belmont, the Little Italy of the Bronx.
 "We didn't know what grass was; our ballparks were the streets," said Salvatore Addeo, 68, a co-owner of Addeo & Sons bakery at Hughes Avenue and 186th Street in Belmont, who returns to the neighborhood most weekdays to bake the bread. "But the best days of my life were here." 
 Mr. Addeo moved to Ardsley in Westchester County in 1960, but he continues to run the bakery that his father, Gennaro, founded in 1930. The staff still adds up an order by hand on a paper bag, but Addeo's was ranked as the No. 3 "Best Buy" in Zagat's 2000 Guide to the New York Marketplace . Many other restaurants and groceries in the neighborhood are ranked high by the guidebook, including Borgatti's Ravioli, the Calabria Pork Store and Dominick's restaurant, which does not provide menus. 
Finding real estate in the area is difficult because most buildings are sold through family and friends. The handful of real estate agents and building management companies in the area advertise mainly rentals. "Everything that is sold here is sold by word of mouth," said Frank Franz, president of the Belmont Small Business Association and a lifelong resident.
Belmont has remained popular in part because of its lively commercial district, its strong ethnic flavor and its proximity to the Bronx Zoo, the New York Botanical Gardens and Fordham University. St. Barnabas Hospital is on the edge of the neighborhood. 
In recent years, demand for housing in the area has escalated. Mr. Franz said he received more than 40 phone calls from people asking about availability of apartments in a tenement building with nine apartments that he is rehabilitating. "There never would have been that kind of interest 5 or 10 years ago," he said. Mr. Franz attributed the increased interest to the Bronx's improved image in recent years.
Most of the neighborhood is made up of tenements built from the turn of the last century to the Great Depression. Most tenement buildings, which usually have between 15 and 25 apartments, sell for about $500,000 to $700,000, said Joe Cicciu, executive director of the Belmont-Arthur Avenue Local Development Corporation, which builds low- to middle-income housing in the area.
Most of the apartments are rent stabilized, and as a result the rents are low, according to Mr. Cicciu and Catherine Macri, who manages tenements in the neighborhood for Cosmopolitan Property Management. Rents for the one-bedroom apartments range from $500 to $600, while two bedrooms can go for $600 to $800, they said.
There are also many brick and wood-frame houses for one to four families. The most common are two-family homes, which cost $150,000 to $175,000, Mr. Cicciu said. "It's good immigrant stock housing."
The immigrants, first Germans and Irish, began arriving in the 1880's. In the 1890's and thereafter it was Italians, who began moving into the neighborhood when the Third Avenue elevated train was built as far north as Tremont Avenue, said Lloyd Ultan, the Bronx borough historian. When newspapers that circulated in Little Italy and East Harlem, both of which were also served by the Third Avenue El, began advertising apartments for rent in Belmont, many immigrants made their way there, he said.
Long before the immigrant influx, during the colonial days, the area was farmland that covered most of the western Bronx. When the land was divided into estates in the mid-19th century, the Belmont area was given to the Lorillard family, tobacco producers. They lived on a mansion on the hill where St. Barnabas Hospital now stands and named their area "Beautiful Mountain" or the Latin version, Belle Mont.
When the city began to build streets in the area in the late 19th century, Catherine Lorillard, an admirer of the 21st president, Chester A. Arthur, asked that the main street in the area be named after him, Mr. Ultan said. (Hughes Avenue, one block to the east, was named after John Hughes, the founder of Fordham University and first Roman Catholic archbishop of New York.)
With the exception of some city subsidized towers that were built on the neighborhood's eastern fringe during the 1970's, little was constructed in Belmont from the late 1950's to the mid-1990's. But during the 1990's the area experienced a rebound along with much of the rest of the Bronx, and low-rise buildings designed for Fordham students began to sprout up north of 188th Street.
The Third Avenue el was demolished in 1973, and now the closest subway lines are the B and D under the Grand Concourse, a 15-minute walk away. The best way to get to Manhattan, residents say, is by Metro-North, whose station at East Fordham Road is 20 minutes from Grand Central.
PARKING is scarce, especially in the evenings, when the restaurants are filled. Much of the neighborhood's business comes from visitors -- including celebrities like Joe Pesci, Robert De Niro and Joe Torre -- who come from the suburbs, from Manhattan and from around the world to eat in one of about 10 Italian restaurants or shop in dozens of specialty food shops on or near Arthur Avenue. 
The exodus of Italians who lived in the area may have changed the residential character of the neighborhood, which is increasingly heterogeneous as Albanians, immigrants from the former Yugoslavia, Mexicans and Dominicans have moved in, but the commercial feel is still overwhelmingly Italian and old New York.
"In other parts of the city there are individual businesses that are nearly 100 years old," said Peter Madonia, 47, owner of the Madonia Brothers bakery on Arthur Avenue, "But nowhere else are there 12 of them on the same block, all with the same families still running them."
Most of the owners of the shops have moved to different neighborhoods or to the suburbs. But some have stayed, including Joe Liberatore, who sells plants, fruit and vegetables from a stand in the Arthur Avenue Market, an open market inside a building at 2344 Arthur Avenue that was built in 1940. Mr. Liberatore, 83, arrived in the neighborhood in 1936 and began by selling potatoes and onions from a pushcart for 5 cents for three pounds. "I've been here since I got off the boat," he joked.
"It's not that people moved away," said Mr. Liberatore, who lives in one of the few high-rise towers, Keith Plaza."The younger generation, as they grew up and got married, they moved up to Connecticut, out to Jersey and up to Westchester," he said.
Still, the pace of turnover is slow. Vanetta Wilson, a 26-year-old lifelong resident, who lives in a one-bedroom apartment on Hoffman Street, said, "The same people have been here for so long that everybody knows everybody." She said the neighborhood was convenient for any kind of shopping she needed. "People come from upstate to go to the bakeries, and we're right next door."
But her friend, Erin Rimmer, 18, noted that heavy "tourism," as it's called in the neighborhood, does not necessarily make the neighborhood much more livable. "That's nice that they come here, but once it turns dark, it's dangerous," she said.
Once ubiquitous graffiti have been removed, and murder and robbery rates are down from what they were 10 years ago, but Ms. Wilson said the neighborhood was more dangerous now than when she grew up there. "You can't let the kids walk to school alone," she said. "When I was a kid, we always walked to school alone."
Ms. Wilson, a stay-at-home mother, attended Public School 32, the Belmont School, on East 183rd Street, where slightly more than a quarter of the 1,094 students read at grade level or above, a rate well below the citywide average of 42 percent.
The neighborhood's other public elementary school, P. S. 205, the Fiorello H. La Guardia School, is a few blocks away on Southern Boulevard. Last year it had an enrollment of 1,043. One third of its students read at or above grade level, according to the Board of Education statistics.
Most children from the local public elementary schools continue on to Middle School 45, the Thomas C. Giordano School, on Lorillard Place, where the extracurricular activities include a competitive chess team, a yearbook and a school newspaper.
There are also two Roman Catholic elementary schools in the area: Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish Elementary School on Bathgate Avenue and St. Martin of Tours Parish Elementary School on 182nd Street. Both cover kindergarten through eighth grade, and tuition is about $1,700 a year.
THERE are also two Catholic high schools in the area. Aquinas High School, for girls, has an enrollment of 788 in Grades 9 through 12 and has been recognized by the United States Department of Education and by U.S. News & World Report as one of the top performing high schools in the country. Its tuition is $3,950 a year. Nearby is Fordham Prep, an all-boys school, where tuition is $8,530 a year. Located on the Fordham University campus, many of its 875 students commute by Metro-North from Westchester.
The public high school for the neighborhood is Theodore Roosevelt High School, on Fordham Road across from the university.
Belmont is home to a number of cultural institutions, including the Belmont Italian-American Playhouse, the Enrico Fermi Cultural Center, a library and center for the study of Italian American culture, and the Bronx Dance Theater, a studio that will celebrate its 25th anniversary in December.
"For an arts organization, that's a long time," said Neil Goldstein, the director of the studio, "but for an institution in this neighborhood, it's chopped liver."
As an example, the Teitel Brothers specialty grocery shop has been on Arthur Avenue and 186th Street since 1915, when Jacob and Morris Teitel, tailors who had recently arrived from Austria, set up their grocery. "There was a stable across the street," said Jacob's son, Gil Teitel, who owns the shop. "We used to deliver orders by horse and wagon."
While Belmont weathered some tough economic times during the 70's and 80's, the close-knit community has provided stability not found in most city neighborhoods. "We could have taken our businesses and gone up north to Westchester and probably done O.K.," Mr. Madonia said. "But there's just sort of an aura about the place and a sense of community here."

THE STUFF OF LEGEND: In 1958, Dion DiMucci and a group of his neighborhood friends formed Dion and the Belmonts, probably the most famous white doo-wop group. The group had three top-10 hits, "I Wonder Why," "A Teenager in Love" and "Where or When." The group helped put the neighborhood on the map and Hollywood has done so also. The 1993 movie "A Bronx Tale," produced by Robert De Niro, was set in Belmont. The main character, a boy named Calogero Anello, grew up on East 187th Street next to Chez Bippy, the club where the local gangsters hung out. The movie describes what happens after Calogero meets Sonny, the local crime boss. "I could live anywhere I want to," Sonny says to Calogero. "You know why I live in this neighborhood? Availability. I want to stay close to everything."

HEADLINE: For Sale: Minimalist Condos, No View 

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
IT wasn't until Michael Friedman bought a car a year or two after moving from Manhattan back to his native Brooklyn in 1981 that he remembered how his schoolteacher father, Louis, had circled the block again and again hoping to find a parking spot on the street. And after he finally found one, he hesitated to move the car from its space rather than repeat the ordeal.
 Not so Michael, a lawyer. He parked his car in a garage in his Park Slope neighborhood so that he could come and go when he wanted. But in 1986, with the garage steadily raising its parking rates, he read about a free-standing six-story garage whose parking spaces were to be sold as condominiums. Since buying a parking space essentially meant having it as long as he wanted, Mr. Friedman took out a bank loan and bought one of the condo spaces for $29,000. 
 "I figured that if you plan to live in the area long enough, you'd come out ahead buying the space," said Mr. Friedman, who with his wife, Ruth Witztum, also a lawyer, has lived in Park Slope almost 20 years. Yet to this day incredulous acquaintances still sometimes ask, "What do you mean, you have a condo for your car?" 
They might be more surprised if they knew that instead of driving to his law office in the Empire State Building, he commutes by subway. Or that his car is in the garage most of the time except on weekends. And still more surprised to know that numbers of condominium or co-op parking spaces in New York cost far more than the price Mr. Friedman paid for his. 
For example, at 429-35 Greenwich Street in TriBeCa, where an 1897 lantern factory was converted into 28 condo apartments five years ago, the asking price for the 18 indoor condo parking spaces ranges from $45,000 to $80,000. One prospective buyer asked whether the $80,000 space included a new car. 
The asking price for one of the 400 outdoor co-op parking spaces at Lincoln Towers on West End Avenue, ranges between $30,000 and $40,000, on the rare occasions that any become available.
In addition to the purchase price, owners of condo parking spaces pay a common charge, which at 429-35 Greenwich Street ranges from $75 to $130. And owners of parking spaces at co-ops pay a monthly maintenance, which at North Shore Towers in Queens ranges from $46 to $103.
North Shore Towers, which is on the Nassau County border in Floral Park, has 2,400 underground parking spaces for its 1,844 apartments and another 125 spaces outdoors. Robert Serikstad, the site controller with the Charles H. Greenthal Management Corporation, which manages the property, said that some parking slots are still available under the co-op sponsor's offering plan, at price tags ranging from $8,000 for an outdoor space to $10,000 for an underground space to $15,000 for an underground space big enough to accommodate two end-to-end full-sized cars. 
Resales of parking spaces in condos and co-ops are negotiated between buyer and seller and are often less, sometimes substantially so, than the sponsor's asking price. 
An explanation for this decline in price is that spaces for sale at a co-op or condo can usually be sold only to tenants of those buildings. An important reason for that stipulation is security, according to Jim Bennett, a real estate lawyer in Manhattan. "They only want people in those spaces who live in the building," he said. "They don't want strangers wandering around." In addition, he added, the certificate of occupancy for the building sometimes prohibits outsiders from using the property, which therefore limits the sale of parking spaces to residents. 
A letter in May from the ACP Realty Group in Manhattan to tenants of 180 West End Avenue in Lincoln Towers said that an outdoor space was available for sale to current shareholders for $40,000. However, Polly McLeod in ACP's sales office said vacancies come up rarely, usually no more than three or four times a year. "But I still get people calling all the time saying, 'I live here; what can I do to get a space?' " she said.
IN downtown Brooklyn, on a five and a half acre site at 175 and 191 Willoughby Street and 122 Ashland Place, the three 16-story University Towers co-ops have 275 outdoor parking spaces for the 549 apartments. So far 120 parking spaces have been sold, and the asking price for the remaining 155 is $15,000. "The reason we haven't sold more," said Daniel L. Rosenfield, a principal in University Towers Associates, the sponsor, "is that transportation around there is so convenient. All three subway lines and many buses converge at the buildings." But based on the growth in the borough, Mr. Rosenfield added, "Demand is only going to increase." 
Despite the 187,862 spaces in the city's 1,096 commercial parking garages and the 94,434 spaces in its 855 commercial lots, according to the Metropolitan Parking Association, many if not most New Yorkers, especially Manhattan residents, are not eager to pay to park, which accounts for the daily round robin of searching for a parking space on the street.
Parking space in New York does not come cheap, of course, nor does the real estate for parking garages and lots. A survey late last year of almost 200 licensed parking lots and garages throughout Manhattan found that while parking at some Midtown garages can cost $50 a day or $1,000 a month, including the 18.25 percent parking tax, the average monthly charge ranges from $250 to $450.
It does not help the parking crunch that the ratio of parking spaces to apartments is almost certainly less than it was two decades ago, when developers were required to provide 40 parking spaces for every new 100 apartments. In 1982, however, concerns about traffic and air pollution prompted city planners to limit the number of new garages that could be built and to eliminate the requirement that developers provide parking spaces. The assumption was that this would discourage residents from keeping cars in the city, especially in Manhattan. 
Developers are still not required to provide parking spaces, and in new buildings south of 60th Street they are limited to 20 percent of the number of new apartments or 200 spaces, whichever is less. North of 60th Street, in Community District 7 (roughly 59th to 110th Streets on the Upper West Side) and Community District 8 (the Upper East Side from 59th Street to 96th Street), they are limited to 35 percent or 200 spaces, whichever is less. 
Such limits are a big reason that so many car owners have to search for parking space on city streets, a city where, as Steven Benardo, the president of the Association of Riverdale Cooperatives, put it, "people design their life around parking." 
Scrambling for space still requires spending lots of time circling the block or idling near a spot where parking will be legal after the hours set aside for the street cleaners expire. But people who park on the street were recently given a modicum of relief. For several decades alternate-side parking prohibitions were in effect for three hours at a time, but about 18 months ago they were reduced by half on many residential streets, after the Department of Sanitation determined that 90 minutes was enough time for the street-cleaning machines to do their job.
In the mid-1970's, after almost six years of parking on the streets near his apartment in the mid-80's near Broadway, Les Graifman finally rented a parking space for about $25 a month at 134th Street and Riverside Drive. But rather than take a subway up to or back from the garage, he decided to combine economy with fitness by jogging the 50 or so blocks each way.
"I not only paid a fraction of what garages around my neighborhood would have cost," said Mr. Graifman, the executive director of the Well Spouse Foundation, an organization for husbands and wives of the chronically ill, "it allowed me to still keep in pretty good shape."
BUT the garage was unheated, and he tired of periodically sitting in the winter cold waiting for the automobile club to come start his car. So after six years of using the garage, he sold his car, and these days whenever he needs one, he rents it.
"Between the cost of parking and insurance, it makes more sense to rent a car in Manhattan than to own one," he said, "unless you have a lot of available cash." 
To park a car on New York streets each night, it also helps to have a good memory as well as patience. Mary Ann Rothman, the executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, used to go to Cape Cod every year for six weeks. But by the time she returned to the city to her prewar building that did not have any parking spaces, "I forgot about alternate side parking and those hundreds of hours of circling," she said.
But it did not take long for the inevitable flurry of traffic tickets to remind her and to conclude that "a car is an albatross in Manhattan, especially in Midtown." 
Another albatross, though one that has been removed for certain residents, has been the 18.25 percent parking tax. The tax is still in place at the 830 commercial garages and 406 commercial parking lots in Manhattan, according to Robert Ull, president of UlltraCar Park System, Inc. headquartered in Manhattan. But on Feb. 6 of this year, according to the city's Department of Finance, owners of condos and shareholders in co-ops who park in garages or lots at their buildings were exempted from all parking taxes. Before that, Manhattan residents were exempt from only 10 percent of the 18.25 percent taxes if their parking spaces were managed by the homeowners associations, not by commercial parking companies. 
With an average 1.9 million vehicles entering or leaving Manhattan every day, according to a 1999 survey by the city's Department of Transportation, it is no surprise that the competition for parking spaces is exceedingly intense in the borough. But there is plenty of jockeying for space in those other boroughs as well, even including parts of Staten Island. According to Joel Stahl, the executive director of the Metropolitan Parking Association, Staten Island has just one licensed parking garage with space for 200 cars and five outdoor lots with space for another 1,052.
The scrambling helps explain why perfectly rational New Yorkers are willing, and in some cases eager, to pay so much for a parking space -- a parking space for which in many cases they had to wait for years.
But salespeople say that even tenants who are eligible to buy condo or co-op parking spaces are turned off by the cost, saying they would rather continue circling the block each day than pay what they consider a small fortune.
"Even now people will curse me on the street, saying, 'How do you have the nerve to charge all that money for a parking space?' " said Howard Pronsky, the sponsor of the 145-car condo in Park Slope where Michael Friedman, the lawyer, has parked his car for the past 15 years. "And I say, 'How do you have the nerve to buy a house or apartment for more than a million dollars?' " he added. "But a lot of people have praised me, including people who can't ever find a parking space on the street."
When Mr. Pronsky came up with the idea in the mid-1980's to transform the garage at 841 Union Street into a condo, the structure had already been a garage for more than half a century. "I've been in Park Slope since 1969," he added, "and when I saw that garages were being converted to apartments, I thought why not covert this garage to a condo parking garage for people in the neighborhood."
The first condo garage that Mr. Pronsky heard of opened in Boston, he said, but his was the first in New York state. But Mr. Pronsky acknowledges that his idea did not catch on as fast as he thought it would, in large part because the recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's took its toll. But he has sold 118 of the parking spaces, he said, and he rents the remaining 27 by the month for $305. 
To accomplish the sales that have occurred, Mr. Pronsky has lowered the price at various times from the original $29,000; the current price is $25,000. But with the demand for parking space continuing to grow in Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights -- a neighborhood where Christopher Thomas, the senior vice president of the William B. May Company's real estate offices in those Brooklyn neighborhoods, said it is almost impossible to find a parking space, at least one that does not attract an "army of ticket and tow trucks" -- Mr. Pronsky said the price would increase this September to its original $29,000.
MR. PRONSKY said he has had requests to buy a space in order to store a boat, but he decided to limit the parking spaces to cars only. Other parking garage owners, however, have sold parking spaces to people who use the garage for storage. 
Joel Silverman, a stockbroker from Rye Brook in Westchester County, bought one of the Park Slope condo spaces almost 15 years ago and hasn't parked in it yet. "I bought it as an investment," said Mr. Silverman, who bought it when the price was $29,000. "But right after that, in '87, the stock market crashed," he added, "and it dragged down real estate in the '90's."
Although Mr. Silverman usually managed to rent out his space, and therefore managed not to lose money, neither did he make much from his investment. He believes that it is only a matter of time before he will make money from his parking space. Meanwhile, though, whenever he sees Mr. Pronsky, he said, he jokes that "I'm the only guy who owned real estate in New York for 15 years and hardly made a profit."

HEADLINE: Arts Cuts in the North Not Quite as Painful as Predicted 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA KUEHL 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
UNDER a legislative mandate to funnel more money to arts groups in South Jersey, the state arts council at its annual meeting last week cut operating grants to 19 groups in the north and scaled back other projects to come up with the cash.
 The move had been feared in the north but widely expected after lawmakers adopted budget language last month ordering that 25 percent of the arts council's $20 million appropriation for cultural projects, or $5 million, go to groups in the eight southernmost counties. So the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, which budgeted $4.2 million directly to the southern region in the last fiscal year, had to find an additional $800,000. 
 Because the Assembly increased the council's appropriation for salaries and expenses this fiscal year, a chunk of a federal grant that used to pay for administration was freed up to pay for programming, said Kenneth Endick, chairman of the council's grants committee. The council also trimmed or postponed some programs, he said. In the end, 19 northern groups lost $290,000 -- the same amount they had received last year for providing services in the south. 
"The arts council leadership and the grants committee did an amazingly good job to limit the damage," said Lawrence Goldman, president of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, which lost $55,000.
Although the cuts were small -- less than 3.7 percent of each group's operating grant -- they were still painful for organizations whose mission is to serve the entire state. "We don't think of ourselves as a northern New Jersey organization," said Donald Edwards, vice president for institutional advancement for the American Boychoir, which tours across the state, nationally and internationally. "But somehow our address seems to put us in that position."
Mr. Edwards said the Princeton-based group, which lost $7,000, spent far more than that to perform in South Jersey every year and would continue to do so. But the implications of the cuts disturbed him. "Let me put it this way: It's not clear to me whether this budget encourages organizations that see themselves as statewide to really function on a statewide basis," he said.
To bolster arts development in the south, budget language since fiscal 1998 specified that 25 percent of the council's grants go to "cultural projects within the eight southernmost counties." Last spring, The Courier-Post newspaper in Cherry Hill reported that direct grants to Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester, Ocean and Salem counties fell below the 25 percent level all four years. Instead, some money went to statewide programs that benefited the south and to northern groups providing services there.
Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. supported the council's interpretation of the budget language, but as accusations of regional favoritism escalated, the Legislature stepped in and rewrote the mandate to guarantee that 25 percent go to southern groups and artists.
For now, the south's victory last week appears twofold: the region will receive more money and also will continue to benefit from programming provided by northern groups, like American Boychoir, the Newark Museum and the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra. The Newark-based orchestra will continue to offer concerts to schools and the public in South Jersey despite a budget cut of almost $58,000, said Jane Harovas, the symphony's marketing director. "It's a tremendous hardship for us, particularly with the difficult economic environment," she said. "But the symphony is very committed to maintaining a statewide presence."
The future of NJPAC's southern programming is less assured. In the last two years, the center has sponsored regional performances by artists from Israel and Mozambique, among others. "We're going to try very hard to continue to be statewide," Mr. Goldman said. "Whether we'll be able to do it this coming season without these funds remains to be seen."
Over all, the arts council approved plans for spending $19.5 million in state and federal money. For the south, the council approved $4.14 million in immediate grants and set aside an additional $870,000 -- $262,500 for fellowships and other awards coming later in the year, and about $607,000 for "regional initiatives," like a survey of the south's cultural facilities and a technical assistance program to help groups there develop.
"We've certainly now come within the mandate of the Legislature," Mr. Endick said.

HEADLINE: MY MONEY, MY LIFE; 
The Graduate Meets the Slowdown

 BODY:
DURING my senior year of high school, I was often accosted by neighbors in my apartment building. "Wow! I can't believe you're graduating," they'd say, invariably adding, "Where are you going to college?" For several months, I had to fake a smile, explain that I was still making a decision and act as if I actually remembered who these people were. 
 After choosing a school and moving 200 miles from home, I figured that I was finally free from this inquisition. Little did I realize that after four years of college, I would face a second round. This time the cross-examination sounded like this: "Wow! I can't believe you've graduated. Where will you be working?" My answer was equally uncertain. 
 Since I moved back home after graduation in May, my daily routine has included sitting down at the dining room table with a red pen and a stack of newspapers opened to the help-wanted sections. Between bites of breakfast, I browse the ads. At first I circled only those that interested me -- mostly jobs in the music industry, where I had several internships in college. But as the weeks passed and I remained unemployed, I found myself circling anything containing phrases like "entry level," "college grad," "receptionist" or "no experience required."
I figured that I could always fall back on a temporary-employment agency. During my summer and winter breaks from school, I used to find work that way. I'd come in one day, fill out some paperwork and take a typing test, then come in the next morning on standby and be sent out on whatever assignment came in. I spent the bulk of my vacations working for two agencies, so I decided to call them and spare myself more tedious testing and interviews. 
One agency never returned my calls, and the other told me that it had been a slow summer so far. Fair enough. On to bigger and better, I figured. I called four other agencies -- ones that had the biggest, boldest ads. I went in for interviews and met with friendly faced, nicely dressed 30-somethings who sympathized with my anxieties.
"We'll be in touch," each recruiter piped as I left. 
Well, no one was in touch. When I made follow-up calls, I heard excuse after excuse. On Mondays I was told, "We usually get assignments midweek." When I called at the end of June and even until the middle of this month, I was told that the Fourth of July had made for slow weeks.
I became very skeptical whenever an agency assured me that while nothing had come in, "we'll give you a call as soon as we get something." After all, every time I read the Sunday classifieds, I'd see that big, bold ad from the same temp agency that had said it had nothing for me. And, week after week, I'd also see the same ads for the same positions with the same companies. When I inquired about these jobs, I was told, "Uh, we have a lot of people registered with us for the summer."
What was going wrong? I had graduated from a good college with good grades and a handful of awards and honors; I knew how to answer phones and to use a fax and copy machine, and I was as chipper as could be. Maybe I was just a victim of bad timing. While new graduates with credentials no better than mine seemed to have jumped right from college to a career just a year or two ago, perhaps the slumping economy had made the job market very tight.
How bad, though, can it be? Every newspaper still manages to produce a help-wanted section, and dozens -- if not hundreds -- of temp and other employment agencies are still in business and placing ads. 
I've given up on temp agencies, drawing the line after the sixth one failed me. But I still send my resume by fax and e-mail to companies where I'd like to work. For every 10 that I send out, I receive one response. I come home from many interviews glowing, thinking that I had established dazzling rapport with the interviewer, only to receive a letter a week or two later -- in one case, two days later -- saying another candidate has been chosen. 
MY friends tell me to be persistent and patient. But when neighbors, my parents' friends and even the doorman want to know "if I've found a job yet," it becomes difficult to maintain a perma-grin. 
I have found, however, that my attitude has changed. I'm still sending out dozens of resumes each day. And I still cross my fingers when I'm not typing cover letters. But I've relaxed a lot. It's only been about a month and a half, and something will materialize -- because it has to. Everyone works. I will, too. In time, I will find the place that is the best fit for me. 
And I've also realized how nice it is not to work, at least for the time being. Now that I'm finally happy being unemployed, I'm sure that someone will hire me just because I'm not so sure it's what I want anymore.

HEADLINE: Approaching Energy Needs From a Sensible Perspective 

 BODY:
 The practical consequence of Peter Maniscalco's approach is quite elitist. 
Only those of means will be able to afford the spiraling energy prices and the sharp downturn of the economy that is sure to be the consequence of the policies he advocates. 
 It is clear that California's current energy problems were largely a result of the failure to build sufficient generating capacity and that this failure was as a result of the actions of the same sort of coalition that now works to defeat power plant construction on Long Island. Let's not repeat California's mistakes.

Saks to Leave White Plains, Opening Way for Fortunoff

BYLINE:  By Vivian S. Toy 

 BODY:
Saks Fifth Avenue will close its store in White Plains, opening the way for Fortunoff, the Long Island-based retailer, to open its first full-service store in Westchester County on the Saks site.
 Saks officials said they planned to close the store at the end of the year because sales were lower than the company deemed necessary to keep the store open. 
 Fortunoff would demolish the Saks store, which was built in 1954 and which is across the street from The Westchester mall, and build a $50 million store of between 150,000 and 190,000 square feet. The new Fortunoff would probably not open for business until sometime in 2003.
Industry experts said that the time and expense needed to finish the White Plains store would probably absorb all of Fortunoff's expansion efforts for the next few years. Fortunoff now has five locations including its flagship store in Westbury and other stores in Manhattan and Paramus, Wayne and Woodbridge, N.J.
Louis Fortunoff, a vice president of Fortunoff, said that plans for the White Plains store depend on negotiations for business incentives with Westchester officials. But he noted that White Plains and Westchester officials have actively courted the company for years.
"We believe that the Westchester market offers Fortunoff an unprecedented opportunity to further expand our customer base," he said. And County Executive Andrew J. Spano said that his county's development officials "will work very hard to make Westchester the best choice for Fortunoff's next flagship store." Vivian S. Toy

PREDICTING A SLOWDOWN

BYLINE:  By Karen DeMasters 

 BODY:
 New Jersey's economy is beginning to feel the effects of the downturn in the nation's economy, and slow growth will continue at least through the end of next year, according to an analysis by the Rutgers University Economic Advisory Service. New jobs will top out at 40,000 for 2001 and 2002 combined, compared with 100,000 new jobs created in the state in 2000 alone, said Dr. Nancy H. Mantell, director of the service, which is part of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning. The average unemployment rate will go from 3.8 percent last year to 4.3 percent this year to just under 5 percent over the next several years, according to the predictions. Karen DeMasters

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LONG ISLAND CITY; 
For an Area of Jarring Notes, a Move Toward Melody

BYLINE:  By JIM O'GRADY 

 BODY:
To urban planners, Queens Plaza and the surrounding area of Long Island City is a Rubik's Cube: a bewildering puzzle with an infinite number of incorrect arrangements. 
 This urban space is simultaneously a transit hub, a museum and manufacturing zone, a checkerboard of old houses and artists' studios and an emerging high-tech and white-collar office center. 
 Planners and others have long said that getting these sectors to complement each other rather than clash is the key to making Long Island City the next hot neighborhood. And ever since 1989, when the 48-story Citibank office tower opened just south of Queens Plaza, many have prognosticated -- wrongly -- that this was about to happen. 
But there is a new buzz about a local renaissance, one loud enough to hear above the din of the trains and the 80,000 cars a day that go over the Queensboro Bridge.
On July 17, about 150 architects and designers gathered on the roof of a municipal parking garage opposite the elevated train station to peer down at the visual cacophony of Queens Plaza. They had been invited by the Van Alen Institute to a design ideas competition with a $10,000 first prize for whoever can figure out how to make the place less desolate. The city plans to spend a $1.8 million federal grant on the winning vision, which, if nothing else, will probably "green" the parking spaces of the John F. Kennedy Commuter Plaza under the el. 
There are already signs of renewal. Adam Rubin, the director of special projects for the Long Island City Business Development Corporation, told the group that a former Brooks Brothers warehouse, at 33rd Street and 37th Avenue, is now home to several high-tech companies, and that a former factory for Dannon Yogurt containers, at 11th Street and 45th Avenue, is about to reopen as an art gallery. In the fall, Met Life will move 1,000 of its Manhattan workers into a onetime car factory on Queens Plaza North between 27th and 28th Streets. 
In May, more than 1,000 artists took part in a local festival, Art Frenzy. A month later, the Museum of Modern Art began a shuttle bus loop to some local cultural sites, including Socrates Sculpture Park and the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center. The loop will eventually include the museum itself, which is planning to move temporarily to the former Swingline factory at Queens Boulevard and 33rd Street. 
Another important change came Thursday, when the City Council approved a 37-block rezoning that is expected to create a cluster of tall office buildings around the isolated Citibank tower. This will mean the demise of the parking garage on which the designers stood. City officials want to replace it with an office building.
Kate Dunham of the Department of City Planning said the new zoning is intended to produce that nirvana of urban planners: an active downtown. JIM O'GRADY

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Despite Defaults, Junk Bonds Are Jumping

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
OVER all, the economic environment seems sluggish. But things are peppy in the junkyard. More than $64 billion worth of new high-yield bonds were sold in the first half of the year, according to Moody's Investor's Service. That is more than all the junk bonds sold in 2000.
 Investors are snapping up the bonds even though default rates are rising and ratings agencies like Moody's are downgrading more companies than they are upgrading. But there is compensation for the risk: interest rates on high-yield bonds are running at least 7.5 percentage points above Treasury securities of comparable maturity. 
 Bruce H. Monrad, co-manager of Northeast Investors Trust, a Boston-based company with $1.3 billion in high-yield bonds under management, talked about the market on Thursday. Following are excerpts from the conversation: 

Q. Conditions in the high-yield market have been deteriorating for some time. Are we close to a bottom?

A. Default rates have been rising since 1997, and rate spreads versus Treasuries have been widening since 1997 and 1998, at the time of the Asian crisis. The default rate is probably peaking now.

Q. Telecommunications company bonds have been troubled over the last year. Have prices fallen to the point where you are beginning to nibble?

A. We were fortunate not to have participated in the telecom sector, and are not involved now. We think conditions in that sector are a long way from the "good company/bad balance sheet" phenomenon of the early 1990's. We are talking about companies that by and large have negative cash flow and have a need to access the capital markets.
I read recently that the $200 billion of face amount in telecom bonds are trading at around $44 billion. You would buy anything for a price, and there have been instances of telecom companies coming back, but we are not purchasing these securities. 

Q. So what bonds are you buying?

A. The average high-yield bond is trading at around 80 cents on the dollar, which gives us a lot of running room. We have positions in most of the industrial parts of the high-yield market. We also have exposures to gaming and energy companies and some of the service companies, like a restaurant or two.
And some of the so-called fallen angels, formerly investment-grade issuers like Finova, Owens-Illinois and Crown Cork and Seal, are on our radar screen now.

Q. Do you have much cash to invest now?

A. We are 95 percent invested right now. Back in 1997, we had 15 percent to 20 percent of the fund in Treasury bills or cash. We have been 100 percent invested in the past, but I'd say we are pretty well invested at this point. This is an expression of our view on the market and on interest rate spreads.

Q. Why should an investor own high-yield bonds?

A. This is an asset that could be a substitute for Treasuries in a bond portfolio. At this point it offers an unusually high yield.
If the economy really does turn around, then default rates are going to come down and price performance of the bonds ought to be pretty good. It is entirely possible that five years from now, people will look at the total return on high-yield bonds with a starting interest rate of 12 percent and it will compare favorably with returns in the stock market, where earnings grow at single digits, with the economy.
We unambiguously suggest individuals buy funds rather than individual bonds. It minimizes the risk and lessens transaction costs. 

Q. How should you shop for a high-yield fund? How long should you own it?

A. There are fund managers out there with very good long-term track records. Get a prospectus and look at the portfolios.
There are higher-risk funds, lower-risk funds, funds that like or don't like telecommunications bonds. If the individual investor has a view on those sorts of things, there are ways to match him up with a fund.
The time horizon on a high-yield fund ought to be comparable to one for a stock or a bond fund, that is to say a few years.
Most of the bonds in our portfolio should convert to cash and mature within six years. But we have investors who have been in our fund for much longer than that. 

Q. Since you are very nearly fully invested, you seem confident that the market is going to move higher. Is that a fair assessment?

A. We are not so optimistic to expect a high-yield fund to replicate the 17 percent annual compound rate of return we had for five years after the last market bottom in 1991. That was a very good period.
The average yield on our portfolio is about 12.5 percent, which compares well with 10-year Treasuries at 5.25 percent. If rate spreads compress, we could realize capital gains on top of that.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/2002 Chevrolet Avalanche; 
Ride 'em, Urban Cowboy

BYLINE:  By JAMES G. COBB 

DATELINE: DODGE CITY, Kan. 

 BODY:
OUR nose knows when you draw close to this small Great Plains city. Unless you have had the foresight to roll up the windows and set the air-conditioner to "recirc," blocking the outside air, your olfactory senses are treated to the historically accurate aroma of a Wild West cowtown.
 Dodge City was one of the most famous of these towns, as anyone old enough to associate Matt Dillon with the 60's TV marshal, and not the 80's screen heartthrob, will recall. By 1884, some eight million cattle were herded here by cowpokes whose itchy trigger fingers helped to fill the Boot Hill Cemetery downtown. You can pay your respects by turning off Wyatt Earp Boulevard and making a left onto Gunsmoke Street. 
 There is less lawlessness here today, but cattle -- tens of thousands of them -- are still fattened at the feedlots outside town. From there, the animals will visit the slaughterhouse, destined to become chateaubriand, Kansas City strips and all-beef patties on sesame-seed buns. If the wind is right, the sharp aroma of feedlot wastes literally takes your breath away. 
I am here not for the fresh air, but to help celebrate the 80th birthday of my aunt, Thelma Nelson. She, my father and their six siblings grew up on the family farm east of town, scrimping through the Depression and clinging to the soil that didn't blow away in the Dust Bowl. Still, the economics of modern agriculture managed to do what droughts, hailstorms and tornados did not: drive most of the family into other occupations in other places. As part of the Plains diaspora, the family scattered from Seattle to Jacksonville, from El Centro, Calif., on the Mexican border, to New York City.
So it seems fitting that I'm riding into town in the 2002 Chevrolet Avalanche, a citified truck far removed from the battered, dusty farm pickups indispensable to my forebears. A four-door truck with seats for five or six, plus a versatile cargo bed, it is a cross between pickup and sport utility vehicle, and it is intended not so much for heavy cargo and back-breaking labor as for hauling people and playthings.
Is it all hat and no horse? Or has General Motors managed to adapt a big, utilitarian truck to today's suburban lifestyles of people like my cousins, nephews and nieces -- transporting the outfield to a Little League game, hauling mountain bikes to the wilderness, carrying plywood from Home Depot?
Many other vehicles blur the lines between traditional segments, and there are four-door trucks like the Ford F-150 Super Crew and the Dodge Dakota Quad Cab, not to mention the Ford Explorer Sport Trac, an S.U.V. with a small cargo box. The problem, though, is that if you start with four doors and two rows of seats, adding a large and truly useful cargo bed makes a truck about as petite and agile as a Greyhound bus.
Chevrolet has split the difference with the Avalanche, which can handle half a dozen passengers and a moderate amount of stuff, or a couple of passengers and a whole lot of stuff. The back of the passenger cabin consists of a unique bottom-hinged panel that can be opened to expand the the cargo bed to eight feet in length, from about five.
Chevy calls this panel the midgate, and it is a clever idea that works. With the midgate upright, the back seat can accommodate three passengers. If you flip down the seat, you have a large storage area inside the cabin, plus the cargo bed. If you fold the midgate, too, the bed runs from the tailgate to the back of the front seats.
You can leave the back window in place, with the cargo opening beneath it, or remove the window. You can take out the crossbar that separates the window from the midgate, turning the back of the cabin into a yawning cavern. Just make sure you securely tie down any cargo back there, or you could be pummeled by two-by-fours shifting forward in a panic stop -- or, worse yet, have your personal watercraft come crashing into the back of your seat.
The rigid cargo cover provides more flexibility. Consisting of three removable panels that weigh less than 20 pounds each, it is integrated into the locking tailgate and transforms the bed into the world's largest car trunk. A soft tonneau cover is also available.
In the often wasted space behind the wheel wells, Chevy added deep, lockable bins that are handy for tools or camping gear -- or for a tailgate party, given that you can fill them with ice and beverages. (Holes at the bottom provide drainage.) Two-sided lights shine into both the cargo bed and the storage boxes.
Many trucks have steps molded into their bumpers, but they are often unusable, given that they are inaccessible when the tailgate is lowered. The Avalanche's more useful steps are cut into each end of the rear bumper. Hefty grab handles, which can also be used to tie down cargo, are bolted atop the rear fenders. The skin of those fenders is plastic resin that resists dents, and the bed is covered with a thick rubber mat to protect the steel floor. All storage areas are water-tight, Chevy says, thanks to a system of rain channels and drains.
Having carved a new niche, G.M. took pains to make its truck look different. Indeed, the Avalanche is a little like the Plains creature that is said to be the offspring of a jack rabbit and an antelope. The jackalope appears on postcards -- designed, not too convincingly, with pre-Photoshop technology -- as a bunny with a rack of antlers. The look is distinctive though not graceful, which is one way to describe the Avalanche.
It bears a passing resemblance to a Silverado pickup, though the hood is high and prominent and the wheel wells are flattened, as if fitted with 50's-style fender skirts. Slanted headlamps give the front end a pinched look (or, in G.M.'s view, "powerful, sharply chiseled rock-face features.") A triangular sail panel -- it provides structural reinforcement -- connects the cabin to the bed. Geometric shapes abound.
The body seems not so much by Fisher as by Fisher-Price. A good third of the exterior wears plastic cladding that seems to belong, except for its somber gray color, on a kiddie car. Instead of shouting "Tough!" -- which must have been the idea -- the plastic whispers "Cheesy."
One could look at the Avalanche and see, as G.M. hopes, a rugged, distinctive truck. Or one could see the graceless geometry of the Pontiac Aztek on a larger scale. In truth, during my travels around Memorial Day, giving Kansans their first glimpse of the Avalanche, it attracted a lot of mostly positive attention. People out here know their trucks, and the Avalanche never sat for long without drawing curious onlookers and small crowds.
The new Chevy isn't likely to have farmers and ranchers lining up to trade in their Silverados and F-150's, but my traveling companion on this trip is a potential customer: Dave Shandy, a restaurant manager in suburban Kansas City who is married to my niece Ronnita. A Chevy enthusiast -- the couple have a Blazer, a 1500 Series pickup and a vintage Corvette -- Dave has closely followed the Avalanche's development since it appeared as a design study at the 2000 Detroit auto show.
As we head west from Topeka on Interstate 70, Dave and I are both impressed with the stiff structure and supple ride. Because of the midgate, Chevy could not use the architecture of a conventional pickup, with a separate cabin and cargo box. So it turned to the Suburban S.U.V., which provided several additional benefits, including a one-piece cabin-cargo bed and rear coil springs.
Not only does the Avalanche ride smoothly -- so much that you have to remind yourself that you're in a truck -- it is quiet. The silence is especially impressive if you consider all the hinges, latches and movable parts that make it possible to open up the back of the cabin.
All of G.M.'s big trucks handle well for their size, and so does the Avalanche, at least on the open road. With a length of 18.5 feet, the Avalanche is two feet shorter than a Silverado extended-cab truck with a long box, but it is still a big brute, and its size works against it in town.
The steering is light enough for parking maneuvers but weighty enough to inspire confidence at extralegal highway speeds. There is reasonable road feedback, good on-center feel and a reassuring sense of stability. The four-wheel disc brakes, however, feel barely adequate.
Adequate, too, is the engine, a 5.3-liter V-8 used in various G.M. trucks. It is powerful, pulling the Avalanche from a stop to 60 m.p.h. in a little over 8 seconds, and thirsty. (I averaged about 15 m.p.g.) But we noticed that on long upward grades through the Flint Hills, the four-speed automatic transmission had a tendency to kick down to a lower gear. Pulling a trailer, or hauling a load of lumber, would bog it down more.
The Avalanche has a payload capacity of about 1,300 pounds and is rated to tow trailers of up to 8,300 pounds. Two- and four-wheel-drive versions are offered, at prices for standard models of $30,965 to $38,711. A North Face Edition, developed in conjunction with the purveyor of outdoor gear, gets you special trim and waterproof duffel bags and daypacks for $3,500 extra. A heavy-duty 2500 Series, with leaf springs and a 340-horsepower, 8.1-liter V-8, will arrive in dealerships next month at base prices of $32,865 to $35,865.
The same basic configuration will also be the basis for a Cadillac pickup, the Escalade EXT, which will go on sale this fall for over $50,000.
The Avalanche is less lavish, but still well equipped. Standard are keyless locking, front-seat side air bags, power windows and locks, cruise control and CD player. The Z66 (rear drive) and Z71 (four-wheel drive) packages include 17-inch wheels, locking rear differential, special decals and even "aggressive rubber floor mats." (With all the talk about road rage, do we really need attitude in our floor coverings?)
Seating choices include cloth, leather and a cloth-leather combination, with either buckets or a three-person bench up front. There is plenty of room for burly ranch hands and 10-gallon hats.
By the end of our return trip to Topeka, after nearly 10 generally pleasant hours in the Avalanche, Dave delivers his assessment. Having demonstrated the midgate several dozen times and taken a turn at the wheel, he is impressed by the Avalanche, but not yet ready to buy one. He'd like more seating, he says, for hauling around the entourages of his pre-adolescent sons. If gasoline prices remain stable, he'd like to get a Suburban in addition to his big pickup.
And therein lies the dilemma of the Avalanche: It offers a lot of solutions to problems that many people don't know they have. Pickup people tend to remain loyal to what they already drive, and many S.U.V. owners don't really need a cargo box.
Still, Chevy may well meet its goal of 100,000 sales in the first year of production. More cross-bred pickups and S.U.V.'s are inevitable, and some of these -- like the showy Lincoln Blackwood -- will be city slickers with more style than substance.
The Avalanche isn't likely to go on many cattle drives, but at least it is capable of a hard day's work.

HEADLINE: Big Tobacco's Pull 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 "Death in the Ashes," by Bob Herbert (column, July 26), about the World Bank study showing the high toll that cigarettes are taking around the world, is a timely reminder to the American people that Big Tobacco is still the only industry that sells a deadly product with impunity. 
 Some critics say that Big Tobacco has bought legitimacy by contributing millions of dollars to the coffers of both political parties. 
But to the honorable men and women of the United States Congress, I say: 
Please tell us that it will not be so. And enact real tobacco legislation to protect our children and grandchildren from the unscrupulous merchants of death.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
Dispelling the Myth That Options Help Shareholders

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
INVESTORS' hard-earned money is not the only thing that has been lost since the technology stock bubble went pfft. Also gone is the credibility of a host of bull-market conceits. They include the hilarious notions that new-economy companies would be invulnerable to the traditional economic cycle, that valuations were not important when it came to buying stocks, that the invention of the Internet rivaled that of electricity. 
 Here's another truism to throw onto the slag heap: Stock options are a boon to shareholders because they motivate management and align the interests of investors with those of executives. 
 The greatest damage to this theory has been done by companies that reduce the strike prices of their stock options after their shares have plummeted. Option repricings, as they are called, are quite simply a gift to management and workers that outside shareholders do not receive.
Companies that reprice their options have typically argued that doing so is necessary to keep treasured executives from leaving for sweeter packages elsewhere. Implicit in this argument is the belief that an exodus of executives would hurt the company. 
But a new academic study, to be presented at the annual meeting of the Academy of Management starting on Aug. 5 in Washington, indicates that companies that reprice options actually show higher levels of executive turnover later. More important, the study found no evidence that the repricing of options was associated with improvement in the financial performance of the company. 
The authors of the study were three academics at Indiana University's Kelley School of Business -- Catherine M. Daily, S. Trevis Certo and Dan R. Dalton. They studied repricings at more than 100 companies in 1997 and 1998 and compared the companies' results with those of similar concerns that did not reprice. 
They found that in the first year after a repricing, chief executive turnover at the companies was 16.3 percent, versus 4.7 percent at companies that had not repriced. By the end of 1998, companies that had repriced options clocked chief executive turnover at 25.5 percent. Those with no repriced options had turnover of 10.5 percent.
Top management turnover below the chief executive level was also much higher at companies that repriced, the study found. By the second year after a repricing, that turnover was nearly 41 percent, versus 28 percent at companies with no repricings. 
Investors who suspect that option repricings are decidedly anti-shareholder will also find confirmation in another study to be presented at the academy's meeting. Timothy G. Pollock, Harald M. Fischer and James B. Wade at the University of Wisconsin at Madison concluded that repricings were more likely at companies with powerful, entrenched chief executives who also head their boards of directors. Repricings are less likely at companies where the chief owns a lot of the stock.
Despite this and other research proving stock option repricings to be an egregious transfer of wealth from shareholders to management, companies and boards continue to approve such plans. The Investor Responsibility Research Center reports that 59 companies repriced options this year, as of June 15. That was far higher than the 31 that repriced in all of 2000, but down from the 312 that did so in 1999.
With the main argument for repricings -- executive retention -- now demonstrably false, it will be fun to see how companies justify these shameful tactics in the future. But justify them they must. For stock options are the drug of choice among American executives. And like any addiction, this one is exceedingly hard to kick.

HEADLINE: Can the Life of the Party Succeed as a City Innkeeper? 

BYLINE:  By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
LULU DE KWIATKOWSKI, the airplane heiress and fabric designer, loves Jeff Klein. So does Rachel Peters, Irving Berlin's granddaughter and a fledgling film producer. Ditto for Ginny Bond, an actress and heir to a Texas oil fortune, who refers to Mr. Klein as merely "the most incredible human being on the planet."
 Who is Jeff Klein, lucky recipient of all this junior-jet-set adulation? 
 He's the self-described "eternal host" who is putting his skills to the test next month by opening a new 65-room hotel, the City Club, across West 44th Street from the Royalton, the mother of all boutique hotels. 
Not that Mr. Klein cares for the term boutique hotel. He prefers "small luxury hotel." "People have used the term boutique too loosely, and now it's become something cliched," Mr. Klein said. "So if you're going to call your hotel a boutique, I'm not going to call mine that." 
Good enough. Whatever the nomenclature, Mr. Klein, 31, a first-time owner, with two other partners, is off to a pretty good start. The City Club has corralled one of the city's most respected chefs, Daniel Boulud, who opened DB Bistro Moderne, his third restaurant, in the hotel last month; and the celebrity interior designer Jeffrey Bilhuber, who has done the guest rooms in earth tones and the bathrooms in chocolate marble. This development has apparently piqued the interest of Anna Wintour, Vogue's editor in chief, who hired Mr. Bilhuber for her own home. 
"She calls every week," Mr. Klein said, flashing a big smile, "and asks, 'When is it going to be finished?' " 
Perhaps more than Mr. Bilhuber and Mr. Boulud, the people Mr. Klein is banking on to make the City Club a success are his friends, many of them the impeccably groomed, impossibly stylish and, above all, impressively rich young women who populate the city's junior benefit committees and gossip columns. It's not known whether a hotel can become hot by association with the princesses of Park Avenue, but Mr. Klein is giving it a try.
"My friends have told me, 'If we need to sit in your lobby for a week straight so that Page Six will write about it, we will,' " he said. "They're all going to be a part of it."
Among those offering their services as lobby accessories, and more, are Ms. Kwiatkowski, who is designing a fabric for linens at the hotel, and Shoshanna Lowenstein, who is designing some staff uniforms. 
To his friends, Mr. Klein holds an esteemed position as the life of the party. He is known for giving elaborate dinners at his brownstone on West 18th Street. After dinner, guests typically retire to Mr. Klein's roof garden, a spacious, tree-filled deck complete with an outdoor shower and homegrown tomatoes. "He threw me two parties at his house," Ms. Bond said. "I never wanted to leave."
Another heiress in Mr. Klein's set is Aerin Lauder Zinterhofer, of the cosmetics dynasty. Their grandmothers knew each other in Palm Beach. Ms. Zinterhofer was born a day before Mr. Klein in 1970 in the same delivery room, and they have done lunch ever since. 
His special skill may actually be relationship counseling, a much sought-after talent in his rarefied clique. "He's the very first person to bring you chicken soup on a sick day," said Samantha Kluge, the daughter of the billionaire John W. Kluge. "And hold your hand when you need it held," Ms. Kluge added, "and be the shoulder to cry on." Her first, short-lived marriage was to Mr. Klein's friend and former partner in a teddy bear company, Adam Cahan. 
Ms. Peters concurred. "He's the eternal father and brother and son and shrink when it's needed," she said. "Particularly when we're all having boy problems."
Considering his untested record as a hotel developer in a very competitive market, Mr. Klein exudes enormous confidence. Hotel occupancy rates in New York have declined this year to their lowest level since 1996, a function of the winded economy and a pack of newcomers to the field, including the Bryant Park, 60 Thompson, the Dylan and the W Union Square. 
"My favorite part is that I'm opening in a difficult time," Mr. Klein said boldly last week. "This is my opportunity to say, 'Jeff Klein is here, and I'm full, and I'm selling out at $500 a night, and all you wannabes, all you little boutique copycats, are going to go bankrupt.' "
He wasn't finished. "And I'm going to buy you guys up, because you guys are going to be available for about 10 cents on the dollar in about one year. And my hotel, by the way, is going to be so special."
He said he had great respect for the successful players in the game he is joining, like Ian Schrager, owner of the Royalton, Hudson and many others, and Andre Balazs, of the Mercer in New York and the Standard and Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, but he said that Mr. Schrager's expanding empire is increasingly tired. Mr. Schrager declined to comment. 
Less-known competitors he dismisses out of hand. "They just don't get it," he said. "They don't get the design, they don't get the service, and they don't understand buzz." 
John A. Fox, the senior vice president of PKF Consulting, a hotel advisory firm, said the boutique hotel business was healthy regardless of Mr. Klein's predictions. "We have a lot of boutique hotels, but I don't characterize it as a glut," he said. 
As cocky as Mr. Klein sounds, his personal charm goes a long way toward diffusing his braggadocio. Tall and boyishly handsome, with a wide smile and an irrepressible laugh, he is a common sight on New York's benefits circuit, in whatever regalia is called for, whether it be a turban (for an Arabian Nights gala for the New York City Ballet last month) or as Truman Capote (for a decadent-80's party for the designer Pamela Dennis last year). 
With inherited wealth from both sides of his family, he serves on the junior boards of the Public Theater, the City Ballet and Guild Hall in East Hampton. Catwalking in a fashion show for 
Cynthia Rowley's men's wear this month in the Hamptons, Mr. Klein sported an open shirt and wildly colored pants worthy of Austin Powers. 
Last spring, he gave a Cuban-theme party, complete with South American dancers, Carmen Miranda imitators, scantily clad debutantes and an endless stream of mojitos. 
"I think I saw an episode of 'I Love Lucy' and thought, 'Ricky is so fabulous, let's do a night around him,' " Mr. Klein said with a laugh.
Kevin West, the European editor of W magazine and a friend of Mr. Klein's, said, "If he was blond and looked good in a Chloe dress, he'd be one of those bold-face names." 
Despite all this, he insists that his party boy reputation is overblown. "Everyone thinks I'm like this big party animal," he said. "But I cannot stay up past midnight. Unless it's like the best party of all time." 
Mr. Klein is one of two sons born to Robert Klein, who built Assured Environments, a pest control company on Lexington Avenue, into the Upper East Side's premier killer of rats and other vermin, and Susan Klein, nee Tannenbaum, whose family developed Yonkers Raceway and owned office buildings in Manhattan, including 530 Madison Avenue and 470 Park Avenue. 
Mr. Klein grew up on Park Avenue and 79th Street, surrounded, he said, by "a lot of oak and big stuffy chairs." The family's dining room was done by the society decorator Mark Hampton. 
Looking back, he says, growing up in luxury helped his professional development. "I got to stay in the finest hotels, so I know what they are like," he said. 
Mr. Klein said he was asked to leave the competitive Horace Mann School after the first grade for academic reasons, and that he burned through two more private schools, Riverdale and Dwight, before graduating from Columbia Prep. He was no scholar, but he excelled at making friends, passing time on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum with Lulu and Liz and Rachel and Samantha.
He graduated from Tulane with a degree in French literature. After a brief stint in advertising in France, he returned to New York and got a job with the Gotham Hospitality Group, whose president, Bernard Goldberg, was one of the pioneers of buying distressed small hotels in the 1980's and making them over as stylish boutique hotels.
Mr. Klein worked at Gotham for four years, earning his stripes, he said, as a desk clerk, concierge and even as a housekeeper, before rising to be a manager of the Mansfield and Shoreham hotels. After Mr. Goldberg sold his five hotels in 1998, Mr. Klein decided it was time to start his own place. 
He is in partnership with two other principals, Forthright Development and Metropolitan Hotels, both started by former colleagues at the Gotham Group. They have leased the City Club site at 55 West 44th Street, a onetime men's club (hence the name) dating from 1904. Mr. Klein and his partners plan to spend $10 million on the gut renovation. Mr. Bilhuber's rooms combine modern elements, like couches built into walls, with traditional upholstered chairs with wooden arms. Televisions are hidden behind artwork and, in at least one room, behind a mirror. 
It hasn't been a bump-free project. The hotel's opening has been delayed as construction work drags on, while on the sidewalk across the street, whistle-blowing union representatives have periodically protested the nonunion labor used at the site. Mr. Klein promises that the hotel will open 25 rooms by Aug. 27, with the rest of the rooms to be completed even as guests are staying on other, fully finished floors -- not an unusual arrangement in the hotel business. 
Sipping a glass of wine over lunch, he seemed in his element and perpetually excited, talking about the intricacies of the real estate market and the opening party in September, an event certain to draw dozens of bold-face names, his friends.
"I am the luckiest man in the world in every aspect of my life," he said. "I have the best family, the best job and the best friends. They're the sweetest, best people in the world." He smiled and added: "They're all like my little sisters. I protect them and love them. And they protect and love me."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 5, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about Jeff Klein, who is opening a new hotel, the City Club, on West 44th Street in Manhattan, misspelled the surname of a fashion designer who is designing some of its staff uniforms. She is Shoshanna Lonstein, not Lowenstein.
A picture caption with the article reversed the names of two of the many celebrities and socialites who are Mr. Klein's friends. (A caption with the same picture, published with an article on Nov. 5, 2000, about a socialite party given at Indochine by the fashion designer Pamela Dennis, included the same error.) Rachel Peters was pictured at the left and Ginny Bond at the right.

HEADLINE: Yearning To Be Safe 

BYLINE:  By SASHA ABRAMSKY; Sasha Abramsky is the author of "Hard Time Blues: How Politics Built a Prison Nation," to be published in January by St. Martin's Press.

 BODY:
THAILAND was no good," 8-year-old Pyi Son Aung said, his black hair flopping forward on his forehead, his dark eyes open wide. To explain, he held his palms together and cocked his fingers in the time-honored imitation of a gun. "Brrrr, brrrr, brrrr, brrrr, brrrrrr," he shouted as he sprayed the walls of his living room with bullets from an imaginary weapon.
 The apartment in which Pyi Son is reliving his past is tiny, a one-bedroom fourth-floor walkup on 187th Street, just off the Grand Concourse in the Fordham section of the Bronx. The neighborhood is working class, characterized by bodegas, greasy chicken restaurants and car-repair shops. Pyi Son lives here with his parents, his three sisters and, sometimes, an uncle and a family friend. 
 A decade after the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war, New York is home to large numbers of a special kind of immigrant: refugees from around the globe. 
Pyi Son's family fled to Thailand from the military dictatorship in their native Myanmar (formerly Burma). But the city's refugees come from many other places. Some are from the former Soviet republics or Vietnam. Others have fled messy conflicts and local tyrannies that have spewed forth in this new multipolar world: civil wars in Africa, ethnic strife in the former Yugoslavia, and fundamentalist religious regimes or insurgency movements. 
More than 42,000 of them arrived in the city from 1994 to 2000, according to the State Bureau of Refugee and Immigration Affairs. The numbers of refugees entering New York ballooned in the mid-90's, as tens of thousands escaped the Balkan wars and fighting in central Africa. Today a smaller but steadier stream arrives from around the world.
Unlike many immigrants, refugees often arrive with little property, no money and physical and psychological ills. And while in an age of jet travel it is increasingly easy for immigrants to visit their homeland, for refugees there literally is no going back.
Pyi Son's family came to the Bronx nearly a year ago after years of terror in Southeast Asia. First they endured the political turmoil in Myanmar; then, after fleeing to Thailand in 1998, they spent two devastating years in a refugee camp. What would happen if they returned home? In response, Pyi Son's father, Khin Maung Htwe, drew his fingers across his throat: the family would be slaughtered. 
They had arrived with virtually nothing. Among the few possessions from their former life is a photograph showing Pyi Son with an aunt, a sister and a friend. He is wearing an orange monk's robe and his head is shaved.
What Pyi Son and his family remember mostly is trauma, fear and political disarray. As a result, their adjustment to life in New York is beset by special emotional and practical problems.
To an outsider, their life in the Bronx might seem pinched and their options few. But in their eyes, New York, and America, truly seems like a promised land.

Odyssey From Fear
On Sept. 2 of last year, Khin Maung, his wife, Yin Yin Thein, and four of their six children stepped off a plane at Kennedy International Airport. It was late at night. They were met by a representative from the International Rescue Committee, an organization set up before World War II to bring over refugees from Europe and that now resettles about 500 refugees annually in New York City alone. The family, destitute and dependent on others for financial survival, was driven to its new home. It was crowded. The parents and the three girls shared a bedroom, and Pyi Son and a family friend slept on pullout beds next to a refrigerator in the living room.
Burmese have been coming to this country in greater numbers since 1999, when the United States government approved a program permitting them to be processed by refugee agencies before making the often difficult journey to America. Although statistics on the number of Burmese in New York are sketchy, several hundred have settled in the state, according to the State Bureau of Refugee and Immigration Affairs. Until recently, most went to cities in upstate New York. Since late last year, however, in part because of the efforts of the rescue committee, an increasing number have landed in the Fordham section of the Bronx. 
Khin Maung is a stocky 45-year-old whose right arm and left hand are tattooed with dark green tigers, the animal associated with the year of his birth. After the political crackdown that began in 1988 and led to the creation of the State Law and Order Restoration Committee, known by the Orwellian acronym Slorc, he left his home and trekked for five days through the jungle to join the armed forces of the All Burma Student Democratic Front, a rebel group. Skinny and sick with malaria, Khin Maung, a tailor by trade, began to sew uniforms.
But he eventually quarreled with the group's local leadership. Fearing both the brutal Burmese government and the rebels, he and most of his family slipped across the border into Thailand. At first, things were no better, with Khin Maung spending two months in prison. But after two years, the family was granted official refugee status -- and the documents that would let them come to America.
They flew to Tokyo and then Los Angeles, where they told immigration officials that they had different last names because, like many Burmese, they did not use a common family name. They continued to Detroit and then to New York, an odyssey condensed by air travel into a few dozen hours.
None of them spoke any English and none had ever traveled by plane. A few Burmese friends and Yin Yin's brother had preceded them to New York, but they had just hazy, cinematic ideas about the city: images of large buildings and fast cars, vague impressions garnered from village conversations thousands of miles away. Nevertheless, speaking through an interpreter, Khin Maung said that when he arrived, at close to midnight in the dying days of summer: "I felt freedom. This is my new place."

Ruled by Law, Not Men
It has been nearly a year since the family's flight touched down at Kennedy Airport. In that year the number of Burmese settling in New York has increased. At least a score live in Khin Maung's neighborhood, some in his building, and each week, it seems, more friends or relatives arrive.
For all that is imperfect in their newly adopted homeland, for all the inequality and racial tension and hardship, Khin Maung and his fellow refugees still find something magical about America.
"In our country," said a Burmese friend who arrived the same day as Khin Maung, "there is no law. Everybody is afraid. In the United States, we need to obey just the law. We don't need to obey man to man. It's a very different experience for us."
When Khin Maung's family first arrived, they were deeply fearful. Yin Yin was particularly anxious. She had heard rumors: that Asians were viciously discriminated against, that refugees were shunned. Shopping for food without being able to speak English terrified her. The noise and bustle of the streets confused her. She was afraid that her children would be swallowed up by the anonymity of the city and that their cultural heritage would vanish like a bubble on the breeze.
Within a few months, however, her feelings had changed. The city hadn't rejected her family. Nor had it peeled off its culture. On the contrary: she was developing a network of friends, fellow Burmese refugees, along with people from the rescue committee, with whom the family explored the city. And her children were developing hybrid identities. 
"We will try to keep our children in the Burmese culture as much as we can," Yin Yin said. "But we understand it is not Burma. We will not totally keep the Burmese culture." She has come to accept that one day her family might even ask her to cook a Thanksgiving dinner.
The family's economic situation had also brightened slightly.
Clifford Rames, the committee's director for New York resettlement, said families were eligible for up to eight months of cash assistance. They are also eligible for a month's free rent provided by the committee. Most refugees may also receive Medicaid, food stamps and free school lunches. Refugees who do not have a job after eight months can be moved into the city's workfare program.
Khin Maung was lucky. He found a job quickly. Last December, at the Buddhist temple where he worshiped, he met a Vietnamese man, Thina Nguyen, who worked for a Westchester County company that made sun roofs for cars. Thina Nguyen urged his boss to hire Khin Maung, saying that although Khin Maung spoke virtually no English, he was a hard worker and adept with his hands. The request fit into what Thina Nguyen called the Buddhist "wheel of help."
The boss agreed, and Khin Maung started work. He put up a blackboard in his living room and tried to learn the English words used in his new trade, scrawling Burmese words and, opposite, their English counterparts. The pay was only $7 an hour, and out of his weekly paycheck of $350 Khin Maung, who owned no car, had to pay a friend $15 a week to drive him to and from work. 
The family lived frugally, rarely even using the subway. Yin Yin bought only the most basic staples: the cheapest cuts of meat, lots of rice and noodles. Every stick of furniture in their $600-a-month apartment was provided by the Rescue Committee. But Khin Maung felt that the family could one day buy a house and send the children to college. "And," he added, with a glint in his eye, "if they try hard, maybe they'll graduate."

A Boy With Racing Dreams
Because Yin Yin was one of the few women in a refugee community composed mostly of young men -- fighters weary of fighting -- she had become something of a den mother to the group. On weekends, 10 or more people came to her house to eat coconut rice and spicy ounkow soup, a Burmese specialty, along with American fried chicken. 
They sat cross-legged on her bare living room floor, their shoes piled up in the hallway in traditional Buddhist fashion. Smoking Marlboros and drinking Heineken beer (bought with pooled money from the group), they sang Burmese folk songs while Khin Maung played the guitar. He had pasted a sticker showing a bare-chested Jesse Ventura on his instrument, and his friends were as likely to request American rock anthems as the mournful, yearning folk songs and resistance ballads from home. 
The children watched college basketball and Burmese martial arts videos on the television set while the adults grew merrily tipsy on beer. When the doorbell rang, the youngsters charged downstairs, barefoot, to escort new guests up to the apartment.
Khin Maung's children quickly adjusted to life in America. The eldest, Win Thanda, 13, was less sure of her surroundings and slower to learn English than the younger ones. Sometimes, her siblings yelled at her when she didn't understand an English phrase quickly enough. But Pyi Son and his sisters Soe Sanda, 6, and Thin Zu Hlaing, 3, were thriving. Thanks in part to English classes run by the rescue committee, Soe Sanda and Win Thanda could read English. 
Pyi Son was fascinated by baseball, football and hockey and by computer games like Game Boy. At school he was learning to play the violin and drums. He also had a dream. 
"I like motorcycles and cars and car races," he said. He has already decided he wants to be a race car driver when he grows up.

A Little Lady Liberty
One of the best things that happened to Khin Maung's family is that Annie Smith, a project manager for the rescue committee's youth program, practically adopted them. Ms. Smith, 34, a short, vivacious woman with curly, shoulder-length brown hair, was drawn to the family members, she said, "because they're so open, generous and warm and giving of themselves."
There is almost nothing Ms. Smith won't do for the family. She helps the adults fill in immigration paperwork and navigate the food stamp bureaucracy. She took Khin Maung to the doctor when he hurt his arm at work. She walks the children home from the English language classes.
Ms. Smith often visits the family in their apartment. The adults speak pidgin English combined with miming, while Ms. Smith, like a charades player, teases out what they are trying to say.
"Khin Maung, money?" Khin Maung asked anxiously one day recently, holding up a welfare form. Ms. Smith figured out he was asking whether the government would send him money or was saying he owed money. She reassured him that didn't owe the government money.
She also takes the family on outings, sometimes paying for their subway tokens. One lovely spring day, she took the family to the Statue of Liberty. After being cooped up in the small apartment, the children were eager to run around and play in the grass. Khin Maung was in a particularly good mood because he had got a raise to $7.50 per hour.
Yin Yin packed a huge noodle picnic to eat in the park. The children dressed up for the occasion. Soe Sanda wore a green coat and bright red lipstick; Pyi Son had a new red baseball cap, worn backward.
Ms. Smith bought their tickets. As the boat pushed off from Lower Manhattan, members of the family crowded against the railing, staring back toward the receding skyline and then craning their necks as they approached the huge statue. 
When the boat docked, they hurried down the gangplank. Lying flat on the ground, Khin Maung took out his camera, aimed it at his children and snapped, hoping to catch the size of the statue as it reached up toward the sky. Thin Zu was a small bundle of energy, racing around and squealing with delight. At the sight of the statue, she balled her little hand into a fist and stuck her arm up and forward, looking for all the world like a miniature Liberty with her torch.

Recreational Vehicle Makers See Gold in a Graying Market

BYLINE:  By The International Herald Tribune 

 BODY:
SHARES of many big makers of recreational vehicles have soared recently, and many analysts say the stocks of at least some of the companies are likely to keep climbing.
 The sector is hardly free of risk. Investing in an R.V. maker is a bet on good times ahead, because the industry is enduring its worst downturn in a decade. Shipments are falling because of a slowing economy and fears of rising fuel prices, a major expense for these gas-guzzling road houses. 
 "Even though the industry is not in good shape, stocks are rising in anticipation of an economic rebound and lower interest rates," said Craig Clarke, who follows the industry for A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. "This year will be the trough, but then the industry will rebound."
He said he believes the business will be driven by a flood of baby boomers approaching retirement age and ready to roam the highways. 
"The retiring 50-and-over age category will take the industry to new heights, and people want to get in while these stocks are cheap," Mr. Clarke said.
While many analysts agree with that idea, R.V. sales remain stagnant. And after the rapid run-up in the stock prices, they are selective about their picks, emphasizing that they should be long-term holdings.
One possibility is the Monaco Coach Corporation in Coburg, Ore. Like all R.V. manufacturers, its sales have fallen, but it has not been hit as hard as some of its competitors because it concentrates on the high end of the market -- bus-sized, diesel-fueled vehicles that have price tags of $100,000 to $1.2 million. Monaco has a solid share of the popular $100,000-to-$200,000 segment, which features extras like satellite television and double slide-outs, walls that expand to create living space when the vehicle is parked. 
"We like them because they have been really strong in the diesel-powered segment, the fastest-growing in the past several years," Mr. Clarke said. He added that Monaco had recently acquired the SMC Corporation, a competitor, making it the biggest maker of high-end motor homes. In recent weeks, Monaco has traded around his target price of $30, but that did not include the SMC acquisition, he said. "If that works out well," he added, "it could add another $4 to $5 to the share price." 
Some analysts are even more positive, predicting $39 a share over the next 12 months. On Friday, Monaco closed at $29.18. 
The other top pick at A. G. Edwards is Winnebago Industries, the industry leader with about one-fifth of the R.V. market in the United States. It appeals to customers who favor gasoline-powered models costing $60,000 to $100,000. 
"Winnebago is better in entry-level mobile homes, especially for first-time buyers," Mr. Clarke said. 
The company, based in Forest City, Iowa, reported earnings of 60 cents a share for the quarter ended May 26. That was down from 74 cents for the corresponding quarter a year earlier, but far ahead of analysts' estimates of 43 cents a share. The stock now trades at $28.50. 
One company whose shares have been particularly volatile is Fleetwood Enterprises of Riverside, Calif. Its revenue is about equally divided between large recreational vehicles and manufactured housing, factory-fabricated homes that stay in one place rather than taking to the road.
Fleetwood's problems were compounded because the manufactured housing and R.V. markets, usually countercyclical, fell apart at the same time, just as it was entering an ambitious expansion. 
"Their big error was trying to build up and open retailers to imitate Champion Enterprises Inc., the biggest player in manufactured housing," said Michael Crawford, an analyst at B. Riley & Company in Los Angeles. When the company said it was in violation of some of its loan covenants, nervous investors bailed out.
BUT Robert Marshall, an analyst at First Union Securities, has a "buy" rating on Fleetwood. He noted that the company had gained new financing, ending fears of a possible bankruptcy. 
"I never thought they were that close to filing anyway," he said. Management has been slashing costs, closing retail operations and eliminating 7,000 jobs, nearly a third of the work force, and the worst is probably over for the manufactured-housing market, Mr. Marshall said.
"On the R.V. side, I draw some degree of comfort that inventories are down about 30 percent since Christmas," he added. "People were cutting prices fast and furious, but that has slowed down." 
Fleetwood's stock closed on Friday at $15.35.

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: How Many Miles Per Gallon?; 
It's Easy: Add Safety, Mileage, Pollution. Divide by Dollars.

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
WHEN a panel of the National Academy of Sciences was asked a decade ago to assess federal fuel-economy regulations, it warned that higher gas-mileage standards for cars would make the nation's roads less safe and threaten the financial survival of Detroit's automakers and their workers. 
 But a new panel of the same academy has drafted a completely different report this summer, recommending higher standards, playing down most safety concerns and giving little heed to Detroit's interests. 
 The report is due to be made public on Monday, and while some of its language has been toned down after industry lobbyists objected to a draft copy that was leaked July 17, the final document is still likely to create problems for the industry when the House takes up legislation this week to raise fuel-economy standards.
The report -- and the industry's objections to the first draft -- present an object lesson in the trade-offs facing politicians and auto executives alike. Deciding how many miles a family vehicle should get to a gallon of gasoline affects the environment, public safety, the economy, the nation's trade deficit and even national security -- to the extent that America's dependence on imported oil influences its policies in the Mideast. 
The findings of this year's panel show how much perceptions of the trade-offs have changed over the last ten years.
For example, a decade ago global warming had barely begun to be seen as an automotive issue, but the new report cites global warming as the single most important reason for regulating the fuel economy of new vehicles. When a car engine burns gasoline, it is basically combining carbon from the gasoline with oxygen from the air coming through the grille, producing a remarkable 19.5 pounds of carbon dioxide, an important global-warming gas, for each gallon of gasoline consumed. A full-sized sport utility vehicle belches nearly 11 tons of carbon dioxide a year, almost twice as much as the midsized cars that have long dominated the American road. 
The automotive safety debate has also been transformed since the last report was written in 1991 (and released in 1992). It focused on research suggesting that when automakers reduced the size of cars in the early 1980's to improve gas mileage, the lighter cars provided less protection for occupants during crashes, with deadly results.
But the report paid little attention to sport utility vehicles, even though lenient gas-mileage rules for the tall vehicles were already contributing to soaring sales. It briefly mentioned that research was needed to determine whether the taller vehicles were exacting a heavy toll in crashes with cars. And the report predicted that the problem of rollover crashes of sport utility vehicles would be solved by new rules that federal regulators had just drafted.
The new report takes a much more complex look at safety, with an emphasis on S.U.V.'s and other so-called light trucks, although the final version has been softened somewhat following industry objections. It mentions that lighter vehicles provide less protection, but looks at other problems at the same time. 
The rollover regulations drafted in 1992 were never put into force; automakers complained that they were so strict that they would essentially outlaw S.U.V.'s. Insurers warn, however, that lighter sport utility vehicles are the most likely to roll over, so higher mileage standards for them might actually increase the rollover problem.
A study last month by a Transportation Department researcher found that as the percentage of light trucks on the roads increases, traffic deaths also rise. Light trucks have higher death rates than cars in single-vehicle crashes, but do nothing to make multiple-vehicle crashes less deadly (though they do tend to shift the deaths in multivehicle crashes to car occupants).
The question now is how Congress will balance issues like safety and global warming with consumer choice. Americans have been telling pollsters for years that they want better fuel economy. But upper-income families increasingly dominate the market for new vehicles, especially sport utility vehicles. (Middle-class families now tend to buy reliable late-model cars coming off leases instead.) And upper-income families consistently tell the auto industry's market researchers that gas mileage ranks no higher among vehicle attributes than the quality of the carpets.
THE interplay of all these issues is so complex that, while this year's panel recommends that mileage standards be raised and provides statistics on what increases are feasible, it has steered clear of recommending specific increases in mileage standards, saying that must be left to elected officials.
Paul R. Portney, the economist who is the panel's chairman, said that it might cost $800 to substantially increase the fuel economy of a new car or sport utility with better engine technology, money many consumers might rather spend on making their vehicle fancier. And no scientific panel, he said, should be expected to decide how to balance consumer choice with all the other issues involved in fuel economy.

Slowdown's Other Shoe, Hanging Over The Hudson

BYLINE:  By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
FRIENDS in Manhattan planning a kitchen remodeling tell me that it is practically impossible to find an available electrician anywhere in the city. In the suburbs of northern New Jersey and in Westchester County, nearly every contractor seems to be booked into the fall.
 Despite the economic slowdown almost everywhere else -- and the first signs of real job losses in the region -- the New York metropolitan area still feels robust. 
 Well, wait a few months. The situation is about to change -- for the worse. Indeed, the odds are that just as the national economy begins to improve somewhat late this year and early in 2002, the New York region will be falling into a slump. And that suggests that the job market, which has been stronger lately in and around New York City than elsewhere in the country, will begin to lag behind. Contractors, though, should start returning phone calls. 
There are several reasons to expect a downturn in the vast metropolitan region, where more than 20 million people live and which generates more than 10 percent of the nation's economic activity.
To begin with, it's no secret that the region's fortunes are closely tied to Wall Street's. While only about 4 percent of the work force is employed in the financial sector, it still accounts for almost 30 percent of the area's total income, according to Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. With much of that income tied to year-end bonuses that are expected to be only about half as large this year as last, the sharpest blows from the market's slide and the drying up of deal-making have yet to be genuinely felt in the region.
And not just those who work on Wall Street will feel its pain. As the wealthiest section of the country, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut contain a disproportionate share of rich people with big stakes in the market.
"People in the area are still a lot wealthier than they were just a few years ago," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com. "But it takes time for it to sink in psychologically that their portfolios are down and that the market isn't going to come roaring back. It hasn't affected spending much yet, but it should this Christmas and next year."
Beyond Wall Street, the region's economy is largely dependent on a vast array of business services, from accounting and law to communications and management consulting. With the exception of a slump in media advertising that is already obvious on Madison Avenue, the nation's economic pain so far has been felt largely by manufacturing industries, which have only a modest presence in the region.
But cuts are coming to New York's service-oriented businesses, too. As soon as summer ends, corporate executives start getting serious about preparing their budgets for the coming year. Even if the overall economic outlook improves, most will still be searching for ways to hold down spending. Some of the easiest things to trim are consulting, public relations and business travel. Already, New York hotels are reporting that occupancies are down as much as 20 percent from a year earlier.
Moreover, New York, as the nation's most important center of global business activity, is vulnerable to an impending slowdown abroad in ways that go beyond the losses that exporters have already suffered.
TO be sure, the economic turbulence ahead is not likely to be anywhere near as severe as the storm that tore into the region in the late 1980's and early 1990's. There has been no rerun of the vast office overbuilding, fueled by reckless bank lending, that took years for both bankers and developers to recover from. The soaring real estate market should come down to earth, but it isn't likely to crash the way it did a decade ago. And in contrast to past out-migration, New York City's extensive growth and immigration of the past decade provide a cushion against a sharp downturn.
"We've had a huge increase in consumer spending, bolstered by 700,000 more people than a decade ago," said Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University and an adviser to Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayoral candidate. "That will help insulate the city."
In the New Jersey suburbs, the health of the pharmaceutical industry should help counterbalance the collapse of telecommunications spending and layoffs at Lucent Technologies, AT&T and others.
But despite the region's bright long-term future, the immediate road ahead is looking darker. And while many still rest their hopes for New York on the stock market bouncing back to life, that prospect looks more and more remote. "It could happen," Mr. Zandi said, "but I wouldn't bank on it."

You Can Come In. You Stay Out.

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
UNITED STATES immigration policy is not fair. Never has been. Probably never will be. 
 Ever since the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 barred Chinese laborers from the country, American immigration history has been littered with laws and policies that have favored some countries and discriminated against others. 
 Instead of adhering to consistent, evenhanded rules, lawmakers and presidents over the years have withheld or doled out green cards, citizenship and other immigration perks based largely on race, economics, domestic politics and foreign policy. Immigrants fleeing Communist Cuba, for instance, are granted permanent legal status faster than other foreigners.
The latest proposal for selective treatment is a recommendation from President Bush's top immigration advisers to allow some of the estimated three million Mexicans living here illegally to earn permanent legal residency over time. 
Advocates for other illegal immigrants howled that other groups deserve equal treatment. They may be here illegally, their advocates argue, but they hold jobs, pay taxes and raise American-born children who are citizens, just as most Mexicans do. Mr. Bush seemed to try to tamp down the growing furor last week when he said he would ultimately "consider all folks here," but immigration specialists say the president is on firm ground in singling out Mexico for starters.
"The lesson to be learned is that U.S. immigration policy has to make choices," said Pamela S. Falk, a professor of international law at City University of New York and a former top House Democratic aide on Latin American issues. "To choose one group over another is a harsh reality, yet it's the fuel for the engine that drives the American economy and American foreign policy." 
In 1997, for example, Congress passed a law that made it easier for Nicaraguans to gain permanent residency, but treated Salvadorans and Guatemalans less generously. Hondurans and Haitians were left out of the deal altogether. 
"These were all people fleeing civil disorder in the 1980's, but we favored people fleeing from former communist regimes," said T. Alexander Aleinikoff, a former general counsel of the Immigration and Naturalization Service who is now a senior associate at the Migration Policy Institute, a new research and policy group here.
It's not just foreign policy that makes the difference. Last year, high-technology employers facing labor shortages persuaded the Republican-controlled Congress to nearly double the annual quota for temporary, high-skilled immigrants, to 195,000. Most of those visas go to immigrants from China and India. 
And this year, a broad coalition of employers from restaurant and hotel owners to landscapers and meat-packing plants are lobbying to expand a temporary worker program to include lesser-skilled laborers in their fields. "People complain about interest groups," said Professor Falk, "but that's the American system." 
In the case of Mexico, the legalization plan would be a crucial component of an ambitious new "guest worker" program that would allow some of the Mexicans living in the United States illegally to earn permanent residency, and give new migrants the chance to apply for green cards over time. The program is part of broader talks between Washington and Mexico City that tie migration to trade, energy, human rights and the fight against drug trafficking. 
"There are very good reasons for crafting a special immigration relationship with Mexico, given its propinquity, its historical ties and Nafta," said Mr. Aleinikoff. "That said, when it comes to the legalization proposal, it's very hard to distinguish long-term undocumented immigrants from Mexico in the United States from long-term undocumented immigrants here from other countries."
BUT let's open the history books. For a variety of reasons, not all them worthy by contemporary standards, American immigration policy has always made distinctions by race, ethnicity and socio-economic class. 
In 1907, under the so-called Gentlemen's Agreement, the United States agreed not to ban all Japanese immigration if Japan promised not to issue passports to Japanese laborers for travel to the continental United States. (They were still welcome to become agricultural workers in Hawaii.)
In 1921, the United States adopted a national-origins quota system that limited admissions from each European country to 3 percent of the foreign-born population here as of the 1910 Census. That had the effect of favoring northern Europeans over southern and eastern Europeans for nearly half a century. Most Asians were still excluded, but there were no limits on migrants from the Western Hemisphere. 
Three years later, President Calvin Coolidge signed an even more restrictive bill governing ethnic quotas, saying, "America must be kept American."
Not until the McCarran-Walter Act in 1952 did Congress crack open America's door slightly wider, maintaining the national-origins systems but for the first time approving minimum annual quotas for all countries.
As part of the civil rights movement, the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 eliminated racial criteria and replaced country-by-country quotas with a system that awarded green cards based largely on family or employer sponsorship. Until 1965, for example, the annual quota for Germans was almost 26,000 and the Irish almost 18,000, while the quota for China was 105, for Japan 185 and for the Pacific Islands 100.
Under the 1965 Act, which is still in effect, there is a worldwide ceiling on the number of people who come in through the family-preference system (excluding parents, spouses and minor children of refugees and American citizens). There is also a cap on admissions for individual countries. 
Only a handful of nations reach the annual limits -- Mexico, China, India, the Philippines -- but their nationals wait the longest to get in. Siblings of United States citizens born in the Philippines, for example, now face a 22-year wait for a green card.
"There will never be an ideal, totally fair immigration policy," said Ellis Cose, the author of "A Nation of Strangers: Prejudice, Politics, and the Populating of America." "So the best we can aim for is something that's not blatantly racially discriminatory."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 5, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the history of United States immigration policy misidentified the 1965 law that eliminated race and national origin as criteria for admission. It was the Immigration and Nationality Act, not the Immigration and Naturalization Act.

HEADLINE: Unreachable? It's an Ideal Summit Site! 

BYLINE:  By BRUCE McCALL; Bruce McCall, a humorist, is a frequent contributor to Vanity Fair and The New Yorker.

 BODY:
"BIG enough for a group photo, but small enough that nine would be a crowd" -- that was the charge to location scouts fanning out across the globe seeking venues for future powwows of the leaders of the Group of 8, the world's leading industrialized nations and Russia. Due to the mobs of autograph- and photo-seeking industrial and economic policy fans who badly overtaxed parking spaces, souvenir shops and restrooms in Seattle, Quebec City and Genoa, the Group of 8 explains, locales of future conferences will remain confidential until three minutes before they convene.
 But ever more obscure and out-of-the-way sites, like the Canadian resort community of Kananaskis, just chosen for next year's meeting, seem a virtual cinch. Kananaskis, set in out-of-the-way parkland left over from the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics, enjoys no cachet and boasts few of the luxuries found in nearby Banff. "A place so out of it that even Canadians notice," burbled a Group of 8 site coordinator. "What a find!" 
 Another rumored early favorite is a slippery rock off the coast of the island Fernando Po in the North Atlantic. Its assets: no natural or man-made obstacles for attack helicopters delivering sandwiches and airlifting out fans injured in pep rallies and sing-alongs; sea spray off the island's coastal rocks that could blind the aim of fans hurling notes; and police dogs that love to frolic in the surf.
Hermit Cave near Feeney's Cut, W.Va., accessible to one person at a time via a 50-foot rope down to a sandbar on an underground spring, may be another hot prospect. "Spiders, bats, snakes and the almost surely apocryphal ax-wielding 'Mad Hermit,' " one scout enthused, "are a small price to pay for the seclusion the G-8 would enjoy. And since folk in these parts don't take kindly to strangers, even asking directions would quickly give pause to even the most rabid G-8 fan!"
A cramped bed-sitter on London's Brompton Road? Inside word is that the interchangeable anonymity of myriad depressing Victorian-era row houses on a busy thoroughfare in a seedy neighborhood greatly charms leaders less interested in pomp and circumstance than freedom from the sounds of broken glass and sirens, which can so rattle great deliberations. Then, too, there's the financial side. "The keen following that our meetings draw from nondelegates and kibitzers is flattering," said one summit veteran. "But we have an obligation to ease the host taxpayers' burden by holding our conclaves in places where the expense of tanks, concrete barriers, barbed wire and dumdum bullets can be kept to the absolute minimum."
Perhaps that is why dedicated summit-watchers insist another site proposal is Blubber Point in Antarctica, a scenic haven almost unreachable without sophisticated logistical planning, where even king penguins left outdoors for more than a half-hour quickly perish. "It's really just two overturned lifeboats from a long-forgotten expedition," reported one frostbitten scout, "but crowd control? Mass petition signings? No problem!"
One Group of 8 member, Japan, is said to be lobbying for the Nippon Maru, a decommissioned squid boat now high and dry on a remote fog-bound beach on the Inland Sea. "One," said a backer, "it's haunted. Two, you can only get to it by walking 16 kilometers on sharp rocks. Three, it stinks. Really stinks!"
A fellow member, France, is known to have recommended the British mid-Atlantic island of St. Helena, a forlorn, hard-to-reach lump of rock repellent even to contemplate. But the nomination was vetoed by other European Group of 8'ers as too closely linked to its most famous resident, the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, a flagrant autarkist and enemy of free trade.
Some sentiment, meanwhile, supports an unnamed French coal-mining community near Lille, in Picardy, alleged to be so crummy that even the miners prefer to stay underground. "Five minutes in that dump," exulted one scout, "and the craziest wackball protester would be begging to go home!"
An open offer from the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, for a summit HQ anywhere in his confederated states is being duly weighed -- but with difficulty. "I mean, how do you narrow it down?" agonized one site-searcher. "Talk about an agony of choice! There's an abandoned boiler works in Kazakhstan that has some folks pretty darn excited. But then again, have you ever seen Putin's apartment?"
The Group of 8 will continue sifting through the recommendations and winnowing down the candidate venues. All agree that Kananaskis marks a superb choice for the next summit meeting, and a prototype for all to follow. "Somewhere you've never heard of, would never go to, can't find on a map and couldn't get to even if you did," one observer beamed. "It has 'successful Group of 8 meeting' written all over it!"

HEADLINE: The Future of Slavery's Past 

BYLINE:  By Henry Louis Gates Jr.; Henry Louis Gates Jr. is chairman of the Afro-American Studies Department at Harvard and author of "Wonders of the African World."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Near the end of the millennium, Mathieu Kerekou, president of Benin, made a pilgrimage to the Church of the Great Commission in Baltimore to apologize on his knees to African-Americans for the African role in the slave trade. Then, in December 1999, during a reconciliation conference at which Africans (including Ghana's former president Jerry Rawlings), Americans and Europeans acknowledged and apologized for their ancestors' culpability in the slave trade, Mr. Kerekou said all parties, buyers and sellers, "must confess our responsibility before history for this shameful trade." The kingdom of Dahomey, precolonial ancestor to Benin, profited handsomely from the traffic in black slaves. 
 The candor of Mr. Kerekou and Mr. Rawlings stands in refreshing contrast to the reluctance of Western leaders to treat honestly, or even to mention, the problem of slavery. In 1998 Bill Clinton was roundly criticized in the United States for suggesting that slavery might conceivably have been an obstacle to the development of a healthy relationship between the United States and the nations of Africa. Shocking! Did anyone think less of Pope John Paul II when he apologized for the Vatican's complicity in the Holocaust? Did anyone think less of Tony Blair when he acknowledged Britain's inaction before the Irish famines that also did so much to populate America? Of course not; those were bold and honest assertions, the kind we forlornly expect our leaders to make, all the more bracing for the fact we hear them so rarely. 
 At the same time, the stakes involved in such recognitions with regard to the slave trade are vastly different for African leaders than for their Western equivalents. The profits of slave trading did not lead to expansion (or diversification) of economies in Africa on any significant scale. The export of human beings from Africa led mainly to more such exporting, and to a dramatic net economic loss to exporting nations as a whole. By contrast, in the West -- in Europe and European colonies in America -- imported slave labor, given certain political, economic and geographical conditions, did greatly enable the building of what we now consider modern economies.
In short, many Western nations reaped large and lasting benefits from African slavery, while African nations did not. African regrets, profound indeed, do not have to be other than regrets, because the results of African slave trading have, in Africa, been negative, an economic curse. The results in many parts of the West, and spectacularly in the English North American colonies, later the United States, have been economically positive. So Western regrets about slavery have a different character because here the responsibility for slavery is carried forward from past to present in the form of wealth. Slavery is embedded in American prosperity. That will not go away.
This fact materially increases the possibilities for Western countries to advance the reconciliation of Africa, Europe and the Americas -- it provides a context for the call last month by Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations for annual contributions of $7 billion to $10 billion to a fund uniting rich and poor nations in a global effort against AIDS. It is a magnificent goal, emphasizing prevention and treatment, linking private and public sectors and stressing short-term goals along with the urgent need to build enduring health care systems. The fund could save millions of children around the world, but it will be aimed especially at Africa, where seven out of 10 AIDS victims live.
This is the answer that so many of us have been waiting for, from Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, who believes we need a Marshall Plan against AIDS, to Americans like me who have long hoped for a truly grand gesture by the United States toward Africa. Combined with a generous package of debt relief for African nations, it could save an entire generation.
The United States originally committed $200 million to the AIDS fund, and it hiccuped another $100 million last weekend in Genoa, Italy. This is grossly out of scale with the size of the American economy and the global responsibility that America's leaders so often invoke when it is in their interest.
Our recognition of our responsibility will make or break the success of Secretary General Annan's fund. Already, other nations and organizations have given generously to the fund -- and made the American contribution look paltry in comparison. The Gates Foundation alone has given $100 million. Japan and Britain have each given $200 million. The G-8 summit in Genoa offered smoke and mirrors and some imaginative relabeling of other aid commitments, but at the end of the weekend the fund was still far short of its goal.
The United States should give not less than $2 billion annually to the fund. That amounts to $1,750 for each person taken from Africa and brought to the New World. A gesture of this magnitude will be far more than an exercise in altruism. By fighting seriously against diseases that take millions of African lives a year, Americans will be protecting their own lives and drawing from Africa's hard-won expertise in a brutal struggle. More and more of our recent progress against AIDS has been based on discoveries made in Africa. On July 3, an article in The New York Times described the high incidence of AIDS in the Mississippi Delta -- one of America's most African regions. One of the top specialists treating patients there was a young Nigerian doctor, Hamza O. Brimah.
Vigorous American participation in the United Nations effort would, among other benefits, recognize the links that join all families long after the simplest link of physical presence is broken. It will allow Africans to see Americans as I know them to be -- people of all colors and backgrounds who often pursue selfish ends but can be motivated to unite when extraordinary circumstances demand it. In other words, people just like Africans.
The more we come to realize these truths about ourselves, the more we will bridge gulfs that once seemed unbridgeable: the gulf between the continents and the gulf between the centuries. Slavery will not disappear from our common history, but it may be mitigated by this type of reparation. In the end, you can't relive the past, but you can do a lot to live with it. And sometimes you can a build a future while doing so.

Rethinking Segregation Beyond Black and White

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
THE waves of immigration to the United States over the last 20 years -- the largest two-decade influx in the nation's history -- have produced new forms of segregation and integration that challenge the traditional meaning of those words. The 2000 census reveals that the issue of black-white segregation has been complicated by new forms of Latino and Asian separateness and mixing.
 While the census makes clear that the segregation of blacks from whites remains stubbornly high, Latinos and Asians have integrated places once largely black or largely white. Yet they have also formed racial and ethnic enclaves that upend long-held assumptions about segregation's causes and costs. 
 These enclaves are the result of forces far more complex than those that produced black-white segregation in the past -- forces that include not only discrimination but also varying degrees of necessity, personal preference and the immigration process itself. 
Among Asian groups, for example, it is sometimes those with higher incomes and a greater range of choices who opt to cluster. So the enclave is a springboard for some, a destination for others. And while some Latinos assimilate quickly, others become segregated in places that resemble traditional ghettos.
"The conventional notions of integration and segregation need rethinking," said George Galster, a professor of urban affairs at Wayne State University in Detroit. "We are starting to see many more multiracial and ethnic neighborhoods. And the dynamics of how and why those neighborhoods change are relatively unknown to social scientists, compared to the dynamics of the traditional white-black transitions."
John R. Logan, a sociologist at the State University at Albany who has long studied black-white segregation, said he shifted after 1990 to include Asians and Latinos. He has gone from thinking of segregation as "almost entirely imposed on minorities" to believing there is "more variation and complexity among different groups, and even different social classes among groups."
 EXTERNAL barriers, like housing discrimination based on race, are still viewed as the main cause of black-white segregation. But among Asians, preference plays a larger part. Latinos fall in between. Like blacks, they face discrimination in the real estate market, though they can also benefit from the ethnic economies found in Hispanic enclaves. Many, better educated and better off, move on; others do not. Language ability is a key factor.
Professor Logan said Latino children tend to remain bilingual at home even in the third generation, particularly when they live in concentrated enclaves. But most Asian children in the third generation, he said, live in entirely English-speaking environments.
"The complexity of segregation is brought home to us when we see how differently it is working out for different groups," he said. 
To many, the term segregation connotes black isolation from whites. And black-white segregation remains the most extreme. As Edward L. Glaeser, a Harvard economist who studies segregation, puts it, blacks, more than any group except perhaps Native Americans, have been subjected to an unusually severe set of external segregating forces -- from violence to restrictive covenants to racial steering by real estate agents.
"One of the striking things about black-white segregation over the years is that it has been and remains so much higher than other kinds," said John M. Yinger, a professor of public administration and economics at Syracuse University. "It is, in some ways at least, a different phenomenon."
 BY contrast, Latino and Asian segregation is often a transitory product of immigration: a Korean immigrant moves into an Asian neighborhood not because of housing discrimination but because a Korean friend finds her an apartment. In that way, researchers say, Latinos and Asians resemble earlier European immigrants, who faced discrimination but also congregated voluntarily.
"There's probably some discrimination against Latinos and Asians in the housing markets," said Reynolds Farley, a sociologist at the University of Michigan, "but most immigrant groups have, to some degree, clustered when they arrived. As they move up the economic ladder, their clustering goes down."
Not everyone, however, moves on. Some Latino groups are isolated in inner-city areas just as disadvantaged as some African-American ghettos, Professor Logan said. While Latinos who achieve higher income and educational levels have assimilated after the first generation, many have not -- even in the third generation.
"There are many places now where Mexicans or Guatemalans or Dominicans or Puerto Ricans have greater disadvantage and perhaps not better prospects in the next 20 years than African-Americans," he said. "There's a social process in place that makes assimilation possible for them in a way that African-Americans do not experience. But, particularly among Hispanics, only a relatively small share get the benefit of that."
Another difference between the segregation of blacks and other groups has been the intensity of concentration. Philip Kasinitz, a professor of sociology at Hunter College and a specialist in immigration, said it is unusual for people who voluntarily cluster to become as highly concentrated as African-Americans. For Europeans who came in the early 20th century, as for more recent Latino and Asian arrivals, high concentrations occur only rarely, in so-called neighborhoods of first settlement.
Second-generation neighborhoods are far more mixed. The dominant ethnic group in places that used to be called, say, Little Italy rarely topped 50 percent, Professor Kasinitz said. Then middle- and upper-middle-class members of the immigrant group moved on, leaving the working class behind -- a pattern he suspects is being repeated by Asians and Latinos.
Black segregation is different. Concentrations of 80 or 90 percent occur almost exclusively in black neighborhoods, Professor Kasinitz said, because only in the case of blacks do all whites flee. There are neighborhoods in the Bronx, he said, where the older population is Italian and the younger population Latino, that will remain integrated for a long time.
Other scholars make the point that "voluntary" segregation is rarely clear-cut. The last national study of housing discrimination, in 1989, found discrimination in the sales market was as high on most measures for Latinos as for blacks. Another national audit, which for the first time included Asians, was done in 2000; the results are due this year.
"It's very hard when you see a clustering of any type of racial or ethnic minority group," Professor Galster said, "to know the degree to which their expressed preferences are a function of positive desires to be with their own kind as opposed to fears of being with a different group."
 The census shows a mixed picture. Nationally, there has been a slight drop in black-white segregation, measured by indexes sociologists use. Much of the improvement seems limited to the black middle and upper-middle class; new and growing metropolitan areas in the South and West; and suburbs. Older cities remain highly segregated.
Segregation between blacks and Latinos dropped in some areas, as lower-income Hispanic immigrants moved into black neighborhoods that some blacks left behind, Professor Logan found. But segregation between whites and Latinos changed little in cities with the largest Hispanic populations, where many immigrants have settled in Hispanic neighborhoods; it dropped more where Latinos had been a small fraction of the population.
The pattern is similar for Asians. Asian-white segregation was unchanged in metropolitan areas with the largest Asian populations, which also saw heavy Asian immigration. It dropped where Asians made up 2 to 4 percent of the population.
"In some ways, we have become a far more mixed, multicultural community," Professor Kasinitz said of New York. He pointed out that the number of places that whites share with Asians and that blacks share with Latinos increased. "But the old, core segregation problem in the United States, the distance between blacks and whites, hasn't changed."
Researchers have drawn divergent conclusions. Professor Logan, who calculated rates of segregation between all four groups, found little change. Despite the small drop in segregation between blacks and whites, he said he was struck more by its persistence, and its persistence between whites and the other groups.
In contrast, Professor Glaeser, who is studying segregation between blacks and all nonblacks since 1890, concluded that the level had "declined dramatically" for the third straight decade. He said the drop appeared greater if one looked at black-nonblack segregation, instead of black-white, but it was significant either way.
Professor Galster of Wayne State said: "The data are just very complicated. There are all sorts of trends happening that suggest certain things that are positive and other things that are not. It becomes just a matter of judgment and ideological position whether one sees the glass as half empty or half full at this point."

In 2nd-Quarter Declines, 3rd-Quarter Worries

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Stocks were buffeted last week by a spate of dismal second-quarter earnings reports that led many investors to conclude that the third quarter would be no better and could be worse. But some still held out hope for a turnaround in the final three months of the year. 
 Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing crystallized concerns about foreign economies, reporting on Monday that profits fell 4 percent because of overseas market weakness and the dollar's strength. Next, Exxon Mobil and Lucent Technologies reported disappointing results, and AT&T warned of a decline in revenue. 
 After two days of losses, the market turned around a bit as a few positive earnings reports emerged. But the good news seemed to have less effect than the fact that prices had been battered already. Trading volume was slim all week, and the markets stagnated on Friday.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 159.98 points, or 1.51 percent, to 10,416.67. The Nasdaq composite index fell 0.3 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,029.07 and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.03 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,205.82. 
 In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 5.09 percent from 5.11 percent the previous week. MICHAEL BRICK

HEADLINE: MY FIRST JOB; 
Blockbusters Aren't Everything

BYLINE:  By WALTER EINHORN; Written with Judy Tong.; Walter Einhorn, 64, is the president and chief executive of the Sunrock Capital Corporation, a Philadelphia concern that lends money mostly to new or struggling companies. For 25 years he was a senior vice president at Mellon Bank.

 BODY:
I WAS 16 when I got my first job, as an assistant movie projectionist at the Iris Theater in Philadelphia.
 Part of my job was to lug two cans of celluloid weighing 30 to 45 pounds each into the projection booth. 
I think I got the job because I stood 6-foot-1 and had fairly broad shoulders. 
 In those days, movie theaters used two projectors to show the film on a screen almost seamlessly. I was responsible for watching for black marks in the upper-right-hand corner of the screen. That signaled when you had to switch projectors. The projectionist would start the second projector and I would stop the first, remove and rewind the finished reel and set up the next.
 I learned a lot about the economics of the business. Most of the money wasn't made on the big Hollywood films, the theater owner told me. It was made on reruns of "Frankenstein" or "Dracula" or John Wayne war movies. For a blockbuster film, 55 cents of the ticket price of 75 cents went to the movie studio. For an older movie, the studios charged a flat $25 for a three-day rental, allowing the theater to keep everything beyond that amount. My boss still charged 75 cents a ticket, and the films sold out four, five or six shows a day. 
 That taught me to look beyond the obvious, and I can use that lesson in my own business today. 
 I lend money to secure, good-quality companies, but I make real money on out-of-favor companies that some consider substandard. The risk is often much less than it appears. Sufficiently collateralized, reasonably managed businesses with the capacity to be profitable appeal to me.

To the Editor:
 I, too, have found a profession that allowed me to work from home. 
I worked in a corporate environment in New York City until I had my first child at 32 and made the decision to stay at home. Luckily, five years later, after my second child, I found an opportunity to have a home-based business. Twenty years later, I am content with my professional role and have raised two great boys. 
 Yes, the decision is difficult. I encourage women who opt to stay home to find something that allows them to be home, if that is their desire, and if the economics work for them.

HEADLINE: A Bicycling Mystery: Head Injuries Piling Up 

BYLINE:  By JULIAN E. BARNES 

 BODY:
Millions of parents take it as an article of faith that putting a bicycle helmet on their children, or themselves, will help keep them out of harm's way. 
 But new data on bicycle accidents raises questions about that. The number of head injuries has increased 10 percent since 1991, even as bicycle helmet use has risen sharply, according to figures compiled by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. But given that ridership has declined over the same period, the rate of head injuries per active cyclist has increased 51 percent just as bicycle helmets have become widespread. 
 What is going on here? No one is very sure, but safety experts stress that while helmets do not prevent accidents from happening, they are extremely effective at reducing the severity of head injuries when they do occur. Almost no one suggests that riders should stop wearing helmets, which researchers have found can reduce the severity of brain injuries by as much as 88 percent. 
Still, with fewer people riding bicycles, experts are mystified as to why injuries are on the rise. "It's puzzling to me that we can't find the benefit of bike helmets here," said Ronald L. Medford, the assistant executive director of the safety commission's hazard identification office.
Some cycling advocates contend that rising numbers of aggressive drivers are at fault, while others suggest that many riders wear helmets improperly and do not know the rules of the road. Some transportation engineers say there are not enough safe places to ride. 
Many specialists in risk analysis argue that something else is in play. They believe that the increased use of bike helmets may have had an unintended consequence: riders may feel an inflated sense of security and take more risks.
In August 1999, Philip Dunham, then 15, was riding his mountain bike in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and went over a jump on a trail. As he did, his back tire kicked up, the bike flipped over and he landed on his head. The helmet he was wearing did not protect his neck; he was paralyzed from the neck down. 
Two years later, Philip has regained enough movement and strength in his arms to use a manual wheelchair. He has also gained some perspective. With the helmet he felt protected enough to ride off-road on a challenging trail, in hindsight perhaps too safe.
"It didn't cross my mind that this could happen," said Philip, now 17. "I definitely felt safe. I wouldn't do something like that without a helmet."
In the last nine years, 19 state legislatures have passed mandatory helmet laws. Today, such statutes cover 49 percent of American children under 15.
And even some professionals have embraced helmets. While most of the riders in the Tour de France have worn helmets infrequently, Lance Armstrong, the American cyclist favored to win the race today, wore a helmet through most of the race.
Altogether, about half of all riders use bike helmets today, compared with fewer than 18 percent a decade ago, the first year the safety commission examined helmet use.
During the same period, overall bicycle use has declined about 21 percent as participation in in-line skating, skateboarding and other sports has increased, according to the National Sporting Goods Association, which conducts an annual survey of participation in different sports. Off-road mountain biking is often considered more risky than ordinary bicycling, but it is unlikely to account for the recent increase in bicyclists' head injuries. Participation in off-road mountain biking has declined 18 percent since 1998, the association said. 
Even so, bicyclists suffered 73,750 head injuries last year, compared with 66,820 in 1991, according to the safety commission's national injury surveillance system, with the sharpest increase coming in the last three years. Children's head injuries declined until the mid-1990's, but they have risen sharply since then and now stand near their 1991 levels even with fewer children riding bikes.
The safety commission is investigating why head injuries have been increasing. Officials hope that by examining emergency room reports more closely and interviewing crash victims, they can find out if more of the injuries are relatively minor, and how many people suffered head injuries while wearing helmets. Some bicycling advocates have doubted the statistics on participation in cycling, and the commission plans to re-examine those as well.
Dr. Richard A. Schieber, a childhood injury prevention specialist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the leader of a national bicycle safety initiative, said public health officials were realizing that in addition to promoting helmet use, safety officials must teach good riding skills, promote good driving practices and create safer places for people to ride. 
"We have moved the conversation from bicycle helmet use to bicycle safety," Dr. Schieber said. "Thank God that the public health world is understanding there is more to bicycle safety than helmets."
Promoting bicycle helmets without teaching riders about traffic laws or safe riding practices can encourage a false sense of security, according to several risk experts. Helmets may create a sort of daredevil effect, making cyclists feel so safe that they ride faster and take more chances, said Mayer Hillman, a senior fellow emeritus at the Policy Studies Institute in London.
"You would be well advised to wear a helmet provided you could persuade yourself it is of little use," Dr. Hillman said.
One parallel, risk experts said, is anti-lock brakes. When they were introduced in the 1980's, they were supposed to reduce accidents, but government and industry studies in the mid-1990's showed that as drivers realized their brakes were more effective they started driving faster, and some accident rates rose.
Insurance companies have long been familiar with the phenomenon, which they call moral hazard. Once someone is covered by an insurance policy there is a natural tendency for that person to take more risks. Companies with workers' compensation insurance, for instance, have little incentive to make their workplaces safer. To counter such moral hazard, insurers may give discounts to companies that reduce hazardous conditions in their factories, said Robert Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute. 
"People tend to engage in risky behavior when they are protected," he said. "It's a ubiquitous human trait." 
Even cyclists who discount the daredevil effect admit that they may ride faster on more dangerous streets when they are wearing their helmets.
On May 5, Noah Budnick, a 24-year-old New York resident, was wearing a helmet and cycling on Avenue B in Manhattan when he had to pull out from the side of the street to avoid a double-parked car and a taxicab idling behind it. As he moved to the left, the cab pulled out, striking Mr. Budnick. He broke his fall with his hands and did not hit his head on the ground, but the accident left him with a deep cut on his leg and a badly strained knee.
Although the cab was at fault for the accident, Mr. Budnick said, if he had been riding more slowly he might not have had the accident.
"I probably would have ridden more cautiously and less aggressively without the helmet," he said. "I don't know if I would ride in Manhattan at the speed I was going."
Still, many cycling advocates contend that it is not bicyclists but drivers who are more reckless. Distractions like cell phones have made drivers less attentive, they say, and congestion is making roads more dangerous for cyclists. They also believe that some drivers of sport utility vehicles and other trucks simply drive too close to cyclists. 
Brendan Batson, a 16-year-old high school sophomore in central Maine, had been knocked off the road twice by drivers, so as he entered the home stretch of a 60-mile ride on May 26, he was wearing his helmet. But as he passed through Norridgewock, Me., riding along the shoulder of a rural highway, a pickup truck struck him from behind. It hit Brendan with enough force to rip the helmet from his head, the straps gouging his face before tearing off. Brendan was dragged along the road, past a friend he was cycling with, then thrown to the side. He was killed instantly.
It is difficult to show statistically that drivers have become more reckless in the last decade. The percentage of fatal bicycle accidents that involved cars has declined, falling from 87 percent in 1991 to 83 percent in 1998, according to the C.D.C.
Thom Parks, a vice president in charge of safety for the helmet maker Bell Sports, said safety standards could be upgraded and helmets could be designed to meet them. But that would make helmets heavier, bulkier and less comfortable. "There are limits to what a consumer would accept," Mr. Parks said, adding that if helmets became bigger, fewer people might wear them.
Dr. James P. Kelly, a neurologist and a concussion expert at Northwestern University Medical School, said that even as helmets were currently designed, patients who were wearing them when they were injured were much better off than those who were not.
"Bicycle helmet technology is the best we have for protecting the brain," Dr. Kelly said. "The helmets serve the function of an air bag."
But the most effective way to reduce severe head injuries may be to decrease the number of accidents in the first place.
"Over the past several decades, society has come to equate safety with helmets," said Charles Komanoff, the co-founder of Right of Way, an organization that promotes the rights of cyclists and pedestrians. "But wearing a helmet does not prevent crashes."

(Shelley Diamond)(pg. 16) Chart: "How to Wear A Helmet (And Other Tips)"A recent rise in head injuries among bike riders may be caused, in part, by improper use of bike helmets as well as a rise in unsafe behavior by riders. According to bike safety experts, here are some of the things riders should do to avoid injury. Helmets should be snug and worn level, not pushed back, which exposes the forehead in case of an accident. Riders should always ride single file and in the right-most lane that goes with the traffic flow. They should let other bicyclists know when cars are approaching. Bikes should be equipped with front and rear lights for riding at night; reflectors are not enough. Wearing reflective clothing is also a good idea. Riders need to obey all traffic laws which includes using hand signals to indicate turns.(Source: League of American Bicyclists) Chart: "A Troubling Trend"Fewer people ride bikes regularly now than 10 years ago, and a larger percentage of them wear helmets when they ride.

HEADLINE: A Plunge in Profits Is Raising Risk For Stock Market and Economy 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
For the first time in a decade, corporate America's profits are plunging, creating what some economists see as significant risks for the stock market and economy alike. 
 In profit reports released over the last two weeks, large publicly traded companies said that their earnings fell an average of 17 percent in the second quarter, compared with a year earlier. 
 The rapid reversal has stunned Wall Street. Just seven months ago, analysts expected profits to rise 9 percent for the full year. They now forecast that earnings will drop more than 8 percent this year, or $30 billion, according to Thomson Financial/First Call, which surveys analysts' forecasts. The decline would be the first in annual profits since 1991. 
The profit squeeze -- along with Friday's report that the economy grew by an annual rate of only 0.7 percent in the second quarter -- raises fears that the nation may be moving closer to a danger of recession than it has in the last decade. While some economists are optimistic, thinking that the tax rebate and falling interest rates make stronger growth likely this fall, shrinking corporate profits could worsen the economic downturn already in progress.
"The risk is that the profits recession becomes a recession for consumers and therefore a recession for the entire economy," said Edward Yardeni, chief investment strategist for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. "By September, when company managements come back from the beach, if they don't get a sense that things are significantly improving for profits, you're going to see another round of cost cuts, which will this time include payroll cutbacks."
The drop in corporate profits also means that investors hoping for a rebound in stock prices may have to wait, many investment strategists say. They argue that stocks -- which began falling from their high point more than 16 months ago -- are unlikely to recover until Wall Street can be confident that earnings have hit bottom and better times are ahead.
But a turnaround in corporate profit now may be two quarters away. Wall Street analysts are reducing their earnings estimates for the second half of the year, said Charles L. Hill, research director for First Call. He expects profits at the large companies that make up the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to fall more than 10 percent for the year.
And even that estimate may understate the extent of the business slump, because it excludes tens of billions of dollars in what companies define as one-time losses. These special charges have been taken by struggling companies like Lucent Technologies and, last week, JDS Uniphase to cover the costs of layoffs and to account for the plummeting value of their pricey acquisitions.
Although technology companies have recorded the largest losses, the problems during the second quarter spread beyond technology, with brokerage firms and some consumer products companies also struggling. According to First Call, profits of the S.& P. 500 companies, excluding technology producers, fell 7 percent in the quarter ended June 30 after remaining flat in the first quarter of 2001.
"I'm struck by the continued negative picture that's presented on a month-to-month basis," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. "We're building the basis for a recovery, but there's not any clear evidence of an upturn yet."
In the late 90's, a boom in corporate spending, especially for computers and software, lent force to an already strong economy. But with earnings weak, such investment -- which fell off sharply late last year -- will recover only slowly, technology executives say. On Friday, the government reported that corporate investment fell at an annual rate of 13.6 percent in the second quarter.
Making large sales of software has become much more difficult, said Bob Beauchamp, president of BMC Software in Houston. 
"A lot of what we're dealing with is just earnings pressure, quarterly earnings pressure," Mr. Beauchamp said, explaining his customers' reluctance. "Nobody is going to go in with a big blank check and write you a check for $20 million. During the go-go dot-com days, the budgets were looser."
Consumer spending remains the strongest part of the economy, and so retailers like Home Depot and Wal-Mart are anticipating solid gains in profit. Home Depot, based in Atlanta, expects to add 50,000 employees and open 204 new stores by the end of the year.
"We are not taking our foot off the growth accelerator even though the economy is weak," said its chief financial officer, Carol B. Tome.
A prolonged drop in profit might carry additional damage on Wall Street. Despite its skid, the stock market as a whole remains expensive relative to its declining earnings. The price-to-earnings ratio of stocks in the S.& P. 500 index now stands at about 24, far above the historical norm. A high price-earnings ratio is a sure sign that investors are hoping that falling profits represent only a short-term aberration.
For example, major airlines in the United States are expected to lose a total of about $1.5 billion this year, compared with combined profits of $3.8 billion in 1999, said Samuel Buttrick, airline analyst at UBS Warburg. Mr. Buttrick said his estimates of industry losses had worsened markedly since May, because new data shows that domestic airline revenue dropped about 10 percent in both May and June, the most rapid decline in at least 25 years.
"In the past two months," Mr. Buttrick continued, "profit forecasts for 2001 and 2002 have been cut at the fastest rate in the last decade." A few months ago, he expected the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, to break even this year. Now, he predicts that UAL will lose almost $20 a share.
But even as Mr. Buttrick and other analysts have cut their estimates, the prices of airline stocks have risen. This disconnection between earnings and profit "suggests a certain level of benign complacency on the part of investors -- that things will get better and get better quickly," Mr. Buttrick said. "I think the rate of recovery is likely to disappoint investors."
With technology stocks, even though their prices have plunged, earnings estimates for big technology companies have fallen so far that many stocks still look expensive relative to company earnings. A few months ago, analysts expected that Cisco Systems, the leading maker of Internet equipment, would earn nearly $1 a share, or $7 billion, for the next fiscal year, ending in July 2002. Now they forecast Cisco to make 27 cents a share, or less than $2 billion, excluding one-time charges.
On Friday, Cisco's shares closed at $19.06, less than one-fourth their March 2000 high of $80.06. But because profit forecasts have plunged, the company's shares, by some estimates, trade somewhere between 47 times estimated 2002 earnings and 73 times. As a result, Cisco and some other technology stocks could fall further, pessimists among the analysts warn. In March, Cisco said it would lay off up to 5,000 employees, or 11 percent of its work force.
Douglas R. Cliggott, chief equity strategist at J. P. Morgan, who warned last fall that earnings estimates were too high, said investors had still not accepted how weak earnings would be at least through the end of this year. Within days, he said, he expects to cut J. P. Morgan's earnings forecast for the S.& P. 500 for both 2001 and 2002. "It looks to us, unfortunately, like the earnings numbers are still too optimistic," Mr. Cliggott said. "There's a lot of risk."

HEADLINE: Our Towns; 
To Senecas, Casinos Cut Deep and Open Old Wounds

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: CATTARAUGUS INDIAN RESERVATION 

 BODY:
THE prospect of casino gambling in western New York is breeding political intrigue in Albany. All the big names and powerful forces are arrayed on various sides, posturing, threatening, offering to trade chits for chips.
 But if wheeler-dealers think Albany's tough, they ought to drive 300 miles west to the Seneca Nation, where combatants enter the political arena at their own risk. 
 Pro-casino signs hung on telephone poles have fallen to chain saws in the night. Fliers depict tribal leaders as devils. Everyone is alert for vote-buying and other staples of the nation's sometimes treacherous politics. 
"The last battle led to war," said Susan Abrams, a Seneca who opposes casinos. "There are bullet holes that still exist today."
Casinos have tempted and divided Senecas for more than a decade. Forces for and against them clashed in 1995, when gambling was one issue in a tribal presidential election. The margin was only three votes, and opposing groups encamped for months in adjacent tribal government buildings before a gun battle erupted, killing three men.
Conflict has returned since Gov. George E. Pataki struck a deal in June with Cyrus Schindler, the Seneca president, for the nation to open casinos in nearby Niagara Falls and Buffalo -- if the Legislature and the Seneca approve.
The economy across western New York has soured to the point of curdling, and Mr. Pataki grasped at casinos as an answer. Facing a re-election campaign, he lashed his unsteady fortunes in this region to the knotted politics of the Senecas.
The casino debate taps deep conflicts among the Senecas -- from fears of ceding sovereignty to New York to raw patronage politics on a reservation with 3,500 people, 700 tribal employees, Bingo parlors and $60 million from a land settlement. 
Last week, the tribal council postponed a referendum on the Schindler-Pataki deal until the Legislature acts, lest it appear too eager to do the governor's bidding.
It may seem odd that the Seneca, of all New York's tribes, would do business with the state. Twice in the 1990's, they resisted state attempts to tax gasoline and cigarettes on their territory, battling state troopers and blocking the Thruway. 
Mr. Schindler, who owns the Big Indian Smoke Shop and was arrested in the tax disputes, said: "I get questions from my people, 'How can you deal with the state after what they did to us? We were invaded by state troopers.' "
Still, he predicts that the lure of as much as $250 million a year from casinos will win over a reservation where many people live in aging trailers. "I look at it like a business," he said, adding with bluster, "The state needs this more than the nation does."
MR. SCHINDLER is part of a business elite that benefits handsomely from the reservation's tax-free status, which allows its merchants to offer cut-rate prices at smoke shops and gasoline stations that draw customers from far beyond the reservation.
A previous tribal administration passed a law requiring businesses to pay money to the Seneca government, but a tribal court stopped it. Now there is concern that the businessmen would find a way to benefit from casino revenues. 
Ms. Abrams, the casino opponent, said someone asked Seneca leaders at a recent hearing on casinos: " 'What's going to stop you from stealing from us at the casinos?' He had the loudest applause of the night."
Tyler Heron, a former member of the tribal council who once favored casinos, doubts the government could manage the money. "In reality," he said, "we're a banana republic when it comes to this casino." 
The Seneca council passed a code of ethics in 1997 covering everything from conflicts of interest to alcohol abuse by officials. But it never appointed officials to enforce it. "Lack of interest," said Rick Jemison, a council member.
The council banned vote-buying, too, but on election days, parties offer voters food, drinks and cash, and even travel expenses for Senecas living off the reservation. "Money decides the outcome," said Dennis J. Bowen, a former Seneca president. 
Lost in the rancor is the effect on Indian culture. "People want the money, they want easy street," said Robert Jones, an ironworker. "But they don't want to give up what's left of our sovereignty."
It is a delicate balance, being in, but not fully of, the United States. 
"Every culture changes, but the question is, what are we going to embrace next?" Ms. Abrams said. "Is it O.K. to do anything for a buck?"

HEADLINE: The Bondage of Poverty That Produces Chocolate 

BYLINE:  By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: LOGBOGBA, Ivory Coast 

 BODY:
One week after leaving his village in neighboring Mali for the first time, Yacouba Diarra, then 14, fell into the hands of a trafficker of children and was smuggled across the border into Ivory Coast's cocoa-producing heartland.
 He was with another boy of the same age, both drawn by the promise of $135 each for a year's labor. "I did not know what kind of work I would do," Yacouba said. "I did not even know we were coming to Ivory Coast." 
 Once here, Yacouba was taken to a village of mud houses, miles from the nearest paved road, where he worked every day on a cocoa plantation, hacking brush with a machete and slicing ripe cocoa pods from trees. But after a year in the village, Petit Tieme, the owner paid him only $13 -- or about 4 cents a day, he recalled. 
He walked away from his employer at Petit Tieme in late spring, he said, and settled nearby, here in Logbogba, where he had chanced upon a friend from the same village back home. His only concern was to get paid his back wages. 
Yacouba's story is like that of many boys and girls in West and Central Africa, who leave their homes to work in foreign places, sometimes separated from their families for years. 
Some children fall into the hands of rings of smugglers and end up exploited. Others are reputed to end up in outright slavery. But most often parents send their children away to earn money or learn a trade, in keeping with an age-old tradition.
Child labor does retain deep roots but it is hard to measure, and the line between slave trading and the bondage of poverty is sometimes unclear.
A recent weeklong journey through this country's remotest cocoa plantations, reachable only by driving on flooded and crater-filled dirt roads and hiking for miles though dense forests, revealed only a handful of children brought here this way -- not hundreds. Almost all hired hands were adults from Mali and Burkina Faso.
Only a visit to the hundreds of cocoa plantations in Ivory Coast would be comprehensive. But the discovery of just a few foreign children during visits to dozens of plantations suggests that children who are smuggled by a stranger for profit do not make up a significant share of the cocoa work force here.
But reports of widespread abuse in Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa exporter, have generated accusations and anger, all the way to Europe and the United States. 
In Britain, groups have tried to organize a consumer boycott of chocolate. And in Washington, the House passed a bill that proposed a voluntary labeling system identifying the origin of the cocoa in chocolate. The label would read "No child slave labor."
The use of children forced to work this way was more common just a few years ago, according to interviews with workers, plantation owners, cocoa industry officials and traffickers themselves.
Since 1998, they say, a drop in cocoa prices and political instability here have made it extremely difficult for foreigners to live in Ivory Coast. The government also pointed to the effects of a bilateral agreement, signed last September, that allows Ivory Coast to repatriate Malian children found working here.
According to a 1998 report by Unicef's Ivory Coast office, children from Mali and Burkina Faso were systematically brought by traffickers to work here; the report contained no estimates of the number involved, effectively acknowledging that it was impossible to determine. 
Unicef's office in Mali later estimated the number of foreign children working in Ivory Coast at 15,000. The figure, which was not based on research in Ivory Coast but only in Mali, has been widely cited by private organizations that deal with children and by the Western news media. 
Ivory Coast acknowledges the traffic in children, but has angrily denied that it is widespread. "There are isolated cases of trafficked children whom we are trying to protect by arresting the traffickers," Henriette Lagou, the minister of family, women and children, said in an interview in her office in Abidjan.
Much of the confusion stems from the working conditions here. Backbreaking work for 50 cents a day is part of everyday life in much of Africa. Indeed, that wage puts plantation workers at a very low rung, but hardly at the bottom rung, of the ladder in Africa.
According to Unicef, 200,000 children are the victims of traffickers every year and are forced to work in brutal conditions. But experts concede that the figures are only broad estimates.
Just as economic factors push Mexicans into the United States, workers from Mali and Burkina Faso, two landlocked, semi-desert nations, have flocked to Ivory Coast. That this phenomenon includes children is a reflection of this region's enduring poverty, Ms. Lagou said. "People who don't live here can't understand our realities," she said. "You take a couple in Europe or in the United States. They have one or two children, and they can't understand why people traffic in children. But when you live here, you understand right away."
A father in Burkina Faso may have 40 children, she said. "Some of his children don't even know him. It's not the same situation over here."
Under Ivory Coast law, minors over age 14 are allowed to work, as long as the work is not dangerous and they have parental consent. Children brought by traffickers are not allowed to work at all, but the temptation is often too great because they are routinely paid about $165 a year for plantation work in Ivory Coast. The poorest of Malians, back home, could not make that sum in five years.
In Katienou, a village north of here, Ibrahim Konate, an 18-year-old Malian, was in the middle of his second working term in Ivory Coast. During his first, two years ago, Mr. Konate stayed for 20 months and earned about $350 -- a huge sum to him. 
"It was enough to support my family for a year in Mali," said Mr. Konate, the oldest son in a family of 10 children. "The money is so good here. That's why I came back."
But the working and pay conditions have put the government and the Western chocolate industry on the defensive, and led to the proposed voluntary labeling system, as sponsored by a New York congressman, Eliot L. Engel, a Democrat who represents the Bronx. In practice, such labeling would be meaningless, because unless one ventured into the plantations, in thick forests several hours by truck and foot, it would be impossible to know who was employing children supplied by traffickers.
Most plantations are small family-owned businesses. Buyers from towns and villages nearby send agents in trucks to buy the cocoa from farmers. These buyers, in turn, sell the cocoa to exporters in Abidjan. The exporters tend to be rich Africans, French or Lebanese. They send the product to the West, where companies like Nestle and Hershey make it into chocolate.
In Sedoudougou, a village near the cocoa center, Drissa Diarrassouba, a 57-year-old Ivory Coast resident, lives in a compound with stark, one-room houses, without electricity or running water. 
He has been a cocoa farmer for 33 years, and in that time his 48 acres have yielded enough for him to buy a tractor and send 8 of his 20 children to school for a few years.
Ivory Coast has many cocoa farmers like Mr. Diarrassouba, rich by the standards of the Malians who work for him, poor by the standards of Ivory Coast city dwellers. A few years ago when the cocoa harvest and prices were strong, he said, he hired seven or eight workers from Mali. 
Today, there are only two: Madou and Siaka Traore, who are brothers, 18 and 14. "If things were going well, I would just be supervising my workers," Mr. Diarrassouba said.
Siaka and his older brother are the oldest of nine children. Their parents are subsistence farmers, too poor to afford an ox.
"We've come to earn money," Siaka said, adding that there was simply none to earn in Mali.
Siaka said he did not know that cocoa was turned into chocolate. He had eaten chocolate once or twice in Mali. The planter, Mr. Diarrassouba, said he had never tasted it; he could have afforded it, of course, but chocolate is not part of the African diet.
Mr. Diarrassouba said acquaintances led him to Siaka and his brother, who were entrusted to him by their parents for a year. "We never discussed salary with the parents," Mr. Diarrassouba said. "What we pay them in the end will depend on the price of the cocoa."
Sitting later on the concrete floor of a tiny dark room at his compound, his swollen belly glistening with sweat, his right eye blinded from a childhood accident, Mr. Diarrassouba said he preferred hiring younger workers.
"It's easier to tell young workers what to do," he said, citing a commonly expressed reason. "The older ones are harder to control. If they are big, they can even lack respect."
Unlike Mr. Diarrassouba, many farmers turn to brokers for their workers. In the town of Sinfra, Niamantou Diakite, a 48-year-old Malian, is one of the best-known brokers. On a recent night, after a dinner of grilled chicken and carp, he relaxed somewhat to explain what he did.
Truckers from Mali brought him workers, whom he then dispatched to local plantation owners. Most of the workers he dealt with were adults, Mr. Diakite said, but sometimes they were as young as 14 or 15. He said there was nothing wrong in his work -- in fact, he said, he provided a service by keeping these workers from unscrupulous brokers. 
With him as a broker, the workers would be paid about $160 a year by the farmer -- minus the worker's transportation fee from Mali, about $30, and Mr. Diakite's own fee, which after much hemming and hawing he said varied between $10 and $14.
"With the dishonest brokers it's chaos," he said. "The workers might have to work one year, or even two years, to repay their debts." The piling on of "debts" is one of the most common abuses of the child laborers.
Mr. Diakite said, with evident pride, that he was an honest broker. Indeed, he was respected enough in the town's Malian community to have been elected the local Malian association's secretary general. 
But like others in the country's cocoa towns and on the plantations, Mr. Diakite said that his business had been down in the last two years. The cocoa harvest has been weak. What is more, thousands of people from Mali and Burkina Faso have become the targets of xenophobia inside an increasingly unstable Ivory Coast. Many have left the country.
The worldwide prices of cocoa have also reached historic lows, forcing farmers to rely more and more on family members. That appears to be the reason the man who hired Yacouba Diarra paid him only $13.
According to Yacouba's account, he and another 14-year-old from the same village went looking for work in Sikasso, a city in Mali near the border with Ivory Coast. His friend took them to a distant relative, named Madou, who introduced Yacouba to the man for whom he would work for the next year, a Malian named Moussa Sangare. Madou asked $160 for each of the boys, Yacouba recalled. After some haggling, a deal was made for about $135.
The two boys and Mr. Sangare eventually arrived on the man's cocoa plantation. After a month's work, Yacouba's friend fell ill and was sent back to Mali. Yacouba stayed for the full year, living with the family.
But after a year, Mr. Sangare refused to pay Yacouba. Yacouba was owed $135 -- minus the initial transportation fee from Mali, an identity card that Mr. Sangare had had made for him and incidentals. He reckoned about $100 was left.
Mr. Sangare gave him $13, Yacouba recalled, and told him to leave. Yacouba wanted the remaining $87.
The plantation, in Petit Tieme, is a few hours away on a bad road. It is a typical African village, where everyone knows everybody else's business. Several young men in the village said they knew about the case of Yacouba Diarra, and, without prodding, confirmed that he had been paid only $13 for a year's work.
At the edge of the village, Mr. Sangare, a man in his 40's, was sitting on a wooden bench in the middle of his courtyard. His family lived in three small mud-brick buildings. It was Friday, a day of rest for him and the rest of the villagers.
"Yacouba Diarra?" Mr. Sangare said, the smile with which he had greeted a stranger vanishing at the mention of the name.
Mr. Sangare denied that he had hired Yacouba through a broker in Sikasso. "I met his mother on the road and she agreed to have him work for me," he said, looking down at the ground. His hands shook.
Asked why he had not paid the boy, he said he had gone to Mali a month before to give the money to the boy's mother.
"The money has been given to the mother of Yacouba Diarra," he said. "I gave her the money myself."
Asked to identify the mother's name and village, Mr. Sangare kept silent for perhaps a full minute, his eyes fixed at his feet.
"I don't remember," he said finally.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL; 
Pro Leagues' Ratings Drop; Nobody Is Quite Sure Why

BYLINE:  By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
There has never been a more uncertain moment in the recent history of America's $250-billion-a-year sports industry.
 Broadcast television ratings for the four major professional sports -- baseball, basketball, football and hockey -- have been generally decreasing for more than a decade. With the exception of the National Football League, average attendance at games in the most established pro sports has been static or diminishing. 
 No one is certain why this is happening. Some experts contend that declining ratings and static attendance do not mean that Americans are losing interest in sports. They note that the fees paid by television networks to broadcast major professional sports continue to rise, as does the value of most franchises. 
But others think that there are signs of a fundamental change in the golden age of American sports, which began in the last quarter of the 19th century.
"Sport just doesn't carry the central metaphoric position in our culture that it did in 1935," said Robert Thompson, a professor of pop culture and television at Syracuse University. "When Richard Hatch can become a reluctant American hero on 'Survivor,' then the question of 'Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?' becomes very relevant."
America's interest in sports has become as fragmented as its interest in television, many experts say. Golf has its own cable channel. Women's professional leagues now exist in basketball, soccer and softball. Extreme sports like snowboarding, mountain biking and windsurfing have become mainsteam. Figure skating and stock car racing have developed such broad appeal that over the past seven years, only the National Football League has drawn consistently higher ratings.
The way Americans experience sports has changed dramatically. There are now more cable versions of ESPN (four) than there were broadcast networks (three) a decade ago. The proliferation of the Internet and of regional cable networks and satellite packages have further diluted the broadcast networks' television ratings.
Some people speculate that mainstream professional sports might be following the life cycle of any other product, meaning that baseball, football, basketball and hockey could be in a period of late growth, or in some cases, early decline.
The concerns of sports leagues and television networks are apparent in cold, hard numbers:
*Ratings for the World Series sank to record lows in two of the last three years. Attendance for Major League Baseball reached a high last season at 72 million, but the average attendance was a thousand fewer than before the player strike in 1994. The sport is considering reducing the number of franchises.
*While the National Football League has continued to set attendance records, its television ratings hit a low in the 2000 regular season; this season, it will move some playoff games into prime time in an attempt to improve ratings.
*The 2001 National Basketball Association finals tied for the third-lowest rated ever. The N.B.A.'s regular-season ratings are down 40 percent since 1995-96. Attendance has dropped in three of the past four seasons.
*The National Hockey League's attempt to expand from regional to national appeal was blunted by poor television ratings this season. While revenues are up, the league is drawing only 500 more fans a game than five years ago.
"There is always concern when ratings decline," said Sean McManus, president of CBS Sports. "I think we're kind of in a series of crossroads. It's an evolving industry, and one that hopefully will make sense economically for the networks. If it stops making sense, somebody will say, 'Enough is enough; we'd rather put on old movies instead of golf or football or basketball.' "

The Erosion of Tradition
 There seems to be a growing dislocation between fans and traditional sports, as players, coaches and teams move frequently, as athletes misbehave publicly, as salaries skyrocket and as ticket prices become prohibitive, many experts said.
When Jerry Buss bought the Los Angeles Lakers in 1979, a courtside seat cost $15 a game. Next season, it will cost $1,500.
"We've become unhinged as traditional fans," said Richard Lapchick, director of the Center for the Study of Sport in Society at Northeastern University.
Once, sports made heroes of the common man. As athletes become multimillionaires, that becomes much more difficult. Asked why fans resented the astronomical salaries of athletes but not of movie stars, Sharon Treacy of Fawn Grove, Pa., said at an N.B.A. playoff game last May, "Because we don't have to pay $113 to get into a movie."
There may also be a racial component to dwindling television and attendance figures, as predominantly white audiences are faced with the growing diversity of sports teams.
"To market a game that's played increasingly by young African-Americans, not hiding their history and heritage, to upper middle class white guys getting their companies to buy tickets is a continuing challenge," said Jay Coakley, a sports sociologist at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.
America's thirst for a different sporting experience can be seen in the explosion of youth soccer. It can be seen in the construction of more than 100 minor league baseball parks, with their intimate atmosphere and inexpensive tickets, since 1990. It can be seen, too, in the fact that the most celebrated American athlete of the spring was a high school runner, Alan Webb, who broke the national schoolboy record for the mile. 
Most visibly, this yearning could be seen during the 1999 Women's World Cup of soccer, an event that began off the public radar and, in three weeks, built itself with joyful, fierce team play into a galvanizing moment that attracted 90,000 people to the Rose Bowl and 40 million watching on American television.
Habits that once led youngsters to become fans at an early age are also changing. Children are more likely to be home mastering video games than roaming the neighborhood looking for sandlot ball games, said Thompson, the Syracuse University professor. Team sports have become so structured that individual sports like skateboarding and inline skating have become popular alternatives, a form of rebellion from strict youth sports organizations and overbearing parents.
Americans are also growing increasingly numb to spectacle and are seeking a more personal, simple and direct connection with the world around them, said Charles Hess, managing director of Inferential Focus, a New York consulting firm that monitors societal change. That might help explain why so many more people are participating in the solitary pursuit of road racing. In 1999, 7.1 million Americans finished a road race, as against 3 million in 1985, according to the United States track and field federation.
"Professional sports have been so successful at marketing and packaging, they've created a product which is a little too remote from the fans," said Craig Masback, chief executive officer of the track and field federation. "I think people want to participate or attend where they feel like they have some connection.
"Participation in running and golf have gone up. Look at minor league sports, track meets, women's events. It's for regular people. It doesn't cost as much. You can take your family and get near the athletes, whether it's the women soccer players or Marion Jones signing autographs until everyone leaves."

Sponsorship Spending Rises
 Although the signs of change are everywhere, the broadcast television networks are not about to give up their investment in professional sports. The big leagues are still big business.
Not only is the value of franchises and broadcast fees continuing to rise, but spending on athletic sponsorship rights by corporations increased to $5.9 billion in 2000 from $5.1 billion in 1999, according to industry estimates.
Broadcasting major professional sporting events still gives networks an aura of major league status. It also enables them to promote their entertainment programs, all the while keeping big-ticket events like the Super Bowl or World Series away from their competitors.
"The fan base can even be growing while TV ratings decline," said Nadine Gelberg, executive director of sports and entertainment for Harris Interactive, the market research and polling firm. "It's not that sports no longer are reflective of our cultural values. How we experience sports has changed."
The splintering of the television audience can be seen in statistics compiled by CBS, based on data from Nielsen Media Research. In 1990, the three broadcast networks at the time televised 1,572 hours of sports programming. In 2000, with Fox added to the network sports lineup, the hours climbed to 2,453. Meanwhile, the average television sports audience dipped from 8.7 million viewers to 6.8 million. That 22 percent decline, however, is less than the 30 percent decline of overall network viewing since the mid-1980's, which gives television sports their cachet.
It might seem logical that the exorbitant fees the networks pay to sports leagues to broadcast their games would also decline. Not necessarily, network and league executives say. While the exponential growth of fees paid for television rights might level off, an actual decrease will most likely occur only if all the networks begin losing hundreds of millions of dollars on their sports deals, said Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports.
In other words, the more difficult it becomes to attract a broad audience in these fragmented times, the more attractive major sporting events become to networks and corporate sponsors. Even with declining ratings, NBC remains sanguine about its contracts worth $3.5 billion to broadcast the Olympics through 2008, because this is the only event that gets the entire family in front of the television set.
"It makes the big events probably even more appealing than they were 10 to 15 years ago," said Chuck Fruit, marketing chief for Coca-Cola.
CBS's loss, after three decades, of its National Football Conference contract in 1993 was like "trying to play the game with one arm," said Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Television. So CBS was more than willing to shell out $500 million a year for the American Football Conference contract in 1998. CBS has also agreed to pay $6 billion over 11 years for the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament, an arrangement that includes Internet rights and other collegiate championships.
"When CBS lost the N.F.L., it was a devastating loss," McManus, the president of CBS Sports, said. "We're the No. 1 network now in terms of having the largest audience watching our programming. I don't think anyone would argue that we would be in that position without the N.F.L. We can promote our prime time lineup from August through January. It's possible for a network to survive without the N.F.L., but it's difficult to survive long-term without that programming.
"But if the deals start becoming economic disasters, then a network may make that decision. Hopefully, we manage our business well enough so that we never reach that point."
Still, the new television climate has produced evident tension among sports leagues, broadcast networks, their affiliates and advertisers. NBC has opted out of the N.F.L., projecting that it would lose $150 million a year, an amount Ebersol calls "obscene." Against his advice, NBC's West Coast affiliates plan to show the 2002 Winter Olympics from Salt Lake City on videotape instead of live, in an effort to maximize ratings.
Ebersol said he was more concerned about a weakening economy than soft ratings. Fewer dollars from corporate sponsorships would mean fewer dollars for networks to pay in fees to professional leagues, which would then have fewer dollars to pay athletes.
"And then," Ebersol said, "you get to the point of, does a shortstop batting .220 have a fundamental right to make $2 million or $3 million a year?"

HEADLINE: Silicon Alley Journal; 
Dot-Coms Are Dead, Long Live Dot-Com Parties

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
With the dot-com bubble not only burst but evaporated, one might presume that the mood at pink-slip parties around Silicon Alley these days would be decidedly funereal rather than funky.
 Not so. Even though many dot-commers are on their third or fourth job -- and are wondering where the next one might come from -- their parties are still going strong, as those who have lost their jobs gather in trendy nightclubs to network and drink their worries away. 
 "The party scene was a big part of the Internet industry," said Allison Hemming, president of The Hired Guns, a consulting firm. Ms. Hemming organized Manhattan's first dot-com pink-slip party last summer, and hundreds of guests made it to one of her gatherings on a recent Wednesday night at Hush, at 17 West 19th Street. "A lot of people just want to keep the party going," she said. 
Each month, Ms. Hemming's parties, which have been replicated in San Francisco, Philadelphia and other cities, draw hundreds of people -- many of whom have managed to find jobs. They come for the drinks. They come for the karaoke. And even some recruiters who show up admit they are trying harder to land a date than a job candidate.
"It reminds me of the old days," said Annie Tsui, a 26-year-old former dot-com worker who has been out of work for months. She spent most of the time at Hush socializing with friends and very little of it looking for a job.
Though the pink-slip parties began just as the bubble's first pricks were felt last summer, they had a very late-90's feel to them. For those who can barely remember, that was when Internet companies were going to change the world completely, and dot-coms were paying just about every kid with a head for computers a hefty salary and loading up him or her with stock options.
Back then, Internet parties -- from those at the SoHo loft of the Pseudo.com founder, Josh Harris, to Razorfish's infamous bash on Grand Street -- were seen as the dark underbelly of the bright new economy: a place to blur the lines between networking, drinking, drug-taking and romancing.
For many who soaked up that world, the next-generation pink-slip parties have become a cultural phenomenon that goes on, whether or not the economy is good.
As the music blares at Hush and guests sip $3 Budweisers and knock down shots of tequila for the same price, it does not seem to matter that songs like Queen's "We Will Rock You" have been replaced with the likes of R.E.M.'s "It's the End of the World as We Know It" and Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive."
For many, like Ms. Tsui, industry collapse and job loss were not the end of the party. "There have been a lot of great dot-com stories about people taking off to Europe," she said, noting that she spent her savings on a trans-Atlantic trip and met the man of her dreams. They are engaged to be married in January.
Soon after her first pink-slip party in June 2000, Ms. Hemming knew she had a hit on her hands. She had to send an e-mail message to more than 1,000 people, warning that those carrying pink slips would get first priority at the entrance.
Eventually, she felt it necessary to begin color-coding the crowd: laid-off workers wear glowing pink armbands, recruiters wear green armbands and all others wear blue armbands. On Wednesday night, those with blue armbands made up nearly a third of the crowd, which totaled about 1,100.
Among them was Carla Stroud, 33 and gainfully employed as a lawyer in Seattle. She said she was visiting friends who had turned her on to the dot-com scene. "They have pink-slip parties in Seattle," Ms. Stroud said, "but nothing like this."
Ms. Hemming, 33, said she started the parties to help laid-off co-workers drink away the blues and find new jobs. But even she acknowledged that the parties had "become a bit of a cult event, with investment bankers from Wall Street showing up just because it is a cool scene."
On occasion, she said, she likes to point out to those in attendance that it is not 1999 anymore.
Still, Ms. Hemming, an energetic former Internet worker at Merrill Lynch and the now defunct POV magazine, admits she likes a good party.
"Aside from the usual imbibing, commiseration and all-out insanity that every pink-slip party brings," she wrote in a recent e-mail message to those on her lengthy guest list, each one attracts "headhunters and other H.R. types into the house to network and recruit." 
"So, if you're looking for a job -- you've come to the right place," she continued. "If you're looking for a date (after 9:00 p.m. . . . ditto)."

Secretary of State Colin L. Powell ended his first meeting with China's leaders sounding upbeat and announcing further talks on human rights and weapons sales, but showing little headway in overcoming opposition to the Bush administration's plans for a missile shield. 1

General Powell said he did not raise any individual cases of people detained in China at the meeting, saying instead that he spoke about improving the rule of law in China. 8

Perils of Research in China
Gao Zhan, the sociologist and Chinese resident of the United States who was freed by Beijing after being jailed on spy charges, said in an interview in Virginia that her work collecting speeches, magazine articles and book excerpts about China-Taiwan relations had been misinterpreted by Chinese authorities. Her release was seen as a step by Beijing to lessen tensions with Washington over the detention of other U.S.-based Chinese researchers. 8

Celebrities Crowd Japan Ballots
In today's vote for Parliament, a test of strength for the governing Liberal Democratic Party, nearly 10 percent of the candidates are celebrities. A change in Japan's electoral system has allowed large numbers of famous novices to enter politics. 3

Britain Ousts Kiley from Tube
The British government has fired Robert R. Kiley, the American mass transit expert, from his job restoring its crumbling subway system. But Mr. Kiley still has his original job as London's transportation chief, not to mention the overwhelming support of the city's harried straphangers. 10

Legal Turn in Chirac Funds
A Parliament committee considered whether to turn over to investigating judges President Jacques Chirac's financial disclosure statements, which show his use of hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash for airplane tickets, widening a political brawl. 10

NATIONAL 12-21

Social Security Proposal Makes Trade-Offs Clear
Two influential members of Congress have developed a Social Security proposal that would achieve President Bush's goal of creating investment accounts for all workers -- but at the cost of substantial cuts in guaranteed benefits. The proposal, which will be introduced as legislation in the House, provides a detailed look at what it might take to overhaul the program. 1

Business Profits Down
Corporate America's profits are plunging for the first time in a decade, creating what some economists see as significant risks for the stock market and economy alike. 1

Puzzling Rise in Bike Injuries
New data on accidents raises questions about the effectiveness of bicycle helmets. The number of head injuries has increased 10 percent since 1991, even as helmet use has risen sharply and ridership has declined. 1

Vieques to Vote on Navy
A rally was held on Vieques, P.R., in anticipation of a citizens' referendum on whether the Navy should leave the island now, in 2003, or stay indefinitely. The vote is nonbinding but intended to send a message to the federal government. 12

Scouts Set Controversy Aside
The Boy Scouts held their first jamboree since the Supreme Court upheld the organization's right to ban gays from being members. But the issue was not discussed much by the campers or counselors. 12

Children's News Service Folds
Foundations and staff members are trying to find reasons for the collapse of Children's Express, a news service that gives children a voice in public affairs. 14

How Accused Spy Struck a Deal
Details are emerging on how Robert P. Hanssen, the F.B.I. agent charged with spying for Moscow, struck a deal to spare his life. 17

What a Celebrated Divorce May Say About the Courts
The ongoing divorce case between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Donna Hanover has raised questions about whether New York's courts encourage messy divorces in the way that tabloid talk shows goad the weak-minded into abusing one another. 23

Planning a Coup, of Sorts
The dozen or so City Council members who are not losing their jobs to term limits have been huddling for months, plotting to take control of the Council if they can win re-election. 23

The Future Just Happened.
By Michael Lewis.
236 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $23.95.
 It's tough to get excited about the Net these days, after being overexcited for so long. The Internet's like a young suitor who flashed a ring, then fled in his Porsche before the wedding ceremony -- a Porsche that, it turns out, wasn't even his but was borrowed from a relative, who'd leased it. Frustrated, fleeced and left standing at the altar, with barely enough juice to charge its Palm Pilots or enough cash to buy a savings bond, the public has learned a lesson from this affair: those who don't stop thinking about tomorrow risk being rear-ended by the present. It's morning again in America, all right, but it's a bleary-eyed, Alka-Seltzer morning after a long and wild fluorescent night.
Michael Lewis, for one, remains undaunted. The sun, he believes, has just moved behind a cloud. "Next," his collection of linked essays about the Internet -- several of them have appeared in The New York Times Magazine -- minimizes the gloomy state of things to declare that the revolution succeeded after all, if not as a get-rich-quick scheme for the masses then as an abiding rearrangement of the fundamental social order. The elites have been plopped in the dunking tank, he declares, by a populist electronic uprising. In the war of the khakis against the power suits, the khakis won -- we're all in management now! It might have happened anyway, this coup, but networked computers supercharged the shift. "If the Internet was giving the world a shove in a certain direction," Lewis writes, sounding like a plain-spoken Marx or Hegel, "it was probably because the world already felt inclined to move in that direction."
Note the confident use of the past tense. The changes Lewis trumpets have come to pass, we're told, and his book represents a freeze frame from a movie that will go on running for years to come. Not so fast, the reader wants to say. A couple of seasons back, such brave assertions filled the covers of a dozen magazines devoted to the gospel of high-tech, many of which are no longer in business. As for evidence back then, who needed evidence? By the time it arrived, the market might be so high that skeptics on the sidelines couldn't buy in. Nowadays, though, one wants a little more protein, a little more meat, in his visionary sandwich. So this is Oz, you say? Let me see the Wizard.
For Lewis, the Wizard's name is Jonathan Lebed and he lives (or he did live, when Lewis tracked him down) in darkest suburban New Jersey with his parents. When Lebed was just 13, he got a notion to open an online brokerage account and vie with the Morgan Stanleys for the big money. He found it strangely easy: just choose a stock, preferably a small, obscure stock; herald it in chat rooms across the Net as the next Nokia or Microsoft; then sell into the resulting suckers' rally. The kid made a bundle, hundreds of thousands of dollars, terrifying his grumpy, Luddite father and eventually drawing the patrician wrath of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The boy was puzzled. What had he done wrong? He was playing the market the way the big boys did, but doing it from his PC. Was that a crime?
Not since Ed Sullivan censored Elvis's hips had the aged lashed out so unfairly against the young. That's Lewis's view, and it's hard not to agree with him, since he makes an infectious fable of Lebed's story. Lebed is Jack, the bright-eyed giant slayer, the S.E.C. men are the doltish ogres and the Net is the beanstalk. Lebed's sin, for Lewis, was not stealing but climbing. The gullible investors who bought his hype got what was coming to them, it's suggested, while the regulators who claimed to be protecting them were really only guarding their own hind ends. They feared a Bastille Day on Wall Street. To arms, old men! The next thing we know they'll be chugging Mountain Dew on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange! 
Lebed's tale is the strongest section of the book, and not just because it bolsters Lewis's thesis about the subversion of the old regime. As in his last book, "The New New Thing," which arrived at the crest of the Nasdaq's manic swoop and captured the high, cracking voice of the hysteria, Lewis writes best when he's personalizing, not analyzing, economic change. His youthquake paradigm has been standard form for every social ruckus since rock 'n' roll, but his portrait of Jonathan's father, who paces the house pulling phone cords out of walls and wailing about the old days, before computers, is fleshy, vivid and so real it sweats. As Lewis describes him, you can feel the plaque collecting in the poor guy's arteries, and other cameos are just as striking. Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the S.E.C., comes off as a handsomely graying talking head perched on the knot of an expensive necktie. His brain's a tape loop playing blue-chip pieties. Investor confidence. The public trust. Stability. He's a briefcase with a mouth.
Lewis's next exhibit in his case for the Internet as social leveler is Marcus Arnold, another teenage prodigy lurking at cyberspace's great masked ball. With one hand in his parents' refrigerator and the other on his mouse, Marcus managed to pass, online, as a legal expert. Using a service called AskMe.com, he counseled desperate "clients" by the hundreds, drawing on nothing more than memories of cop shows and Court TV. His barrister's wig was finally snatched away, but the demand for his advice continued. His mother was proud, if baffled, like all the grown-ups in Lewis's new topsy-turvy universe. The Internet is the VCR gone cosmic: adults may have brought this wonder into being, but only the kids know how to run the thing.
In a tone both ominous and bemused (since the middle-aged author can neither beat nor join the kids, he affects a sporting fatalism), Lewis suggests that they'll soon be running everything. Parricide, he concludes from his reporting, is the very essence of the Net -- indeed, it's the essence of capitalism itself, he feels. For Lewis, the world is one big blackboard jungle now, and the teachers had better take cover behind their desks. It's a provocative image, but premature, perhaps -- the country these days is littered with red-faced oracles, including the chairman of Oracle itself, whose straight-line projections of upward-sloping trends have been bent into fishhooks by events. What's more, it was only yesterday, it seems, that the pop-sociology consensus had the elderly taking over America.
Timing the market, whether in stocks or megatrends, is a chancy game. Few can hope to win at it for long. Fortunately, Lewis the observer, alert to the family-room comedies of manners that play out under the economic headlines, gets as much space in the book as Lewis the prophet. Whether they represent a new world order or the latest bout of the old insanity, the pranks he so sharply depicts will still amuse.

 WILSON'S GHOST
Reducing The Risk of Conflict, Killing, and Catastrophe in the 21st Century.
By Robert S. McNamara
and James G. Blight.
270 pp. New York:
PublicAffairs. $24.
 The specter of John F. Kennedy, not Woodrow Wilson, haunts the pages of "Wilson's Ghost." Nor is this surprising, since the authors of this anti-Machiavellian handbook are Robert S. McNamara, secretary of defense under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and James G. Blight, a professor of international relations at Brown University who has written extensively on the Cuban missile crisis. The lessons they have learned and wish to pass on to a new generation largely derive from the experiences of the Kennedy administration, especially the president's able handling of the missile crisis.
The authors believe, however, that "just as the ghost of Jacob Marley haunted Ebenezer Scrooge," Woodrow Wilson haunts world leaders today. Power, in Wilson's vision, was supposed to yield to morality, and armed conflict to the force of public opinion. America, Wilson declared, "is the only idealistic nation in the world," and so the world had to be made over in America's image.
In McNamara and Blight's view, America may not be the only idealistic country in the world, but they fully embrace the Wilsonian notion that United States foreign policy must be grounded on the bedrock of morality. Two "imperatives," they believe, should shape foreign policy in the 21st century -- the moral imperative" to avoid the kind of carnage caused by conflict in the 20th century; and "the multilateral imperative," which holds that the United States "will not apply its economic, political or military power unilaterally" (except to defend itself).
The prescriptions of these self-proclaimed "idealists" run squarely counter to the "realist" paradigm, and the vision of that quintessential realist Henry Kissinger. Order, Kissinger has stated, "will have to emerge much as it did in past centuries from a reconciliation and balancing of national interests." To counter this call for an interest-based foreign policy, McNamara and Blight are prepared to provide us with a moral compass. The Kennedy brothers and their associates in the missile crisis are held up as a good example of how to preserve the national interest "while also holding fast to the essence of one's moral convictions." 
McNamara and Blight's own struggle with morality and power focuses on three foreign policy issues: preventing great-power conflict between the United States and Russia or China; reducing communal killing in "dangerous, troubled, failed, murderous states"; and moving steadily toward a nuclear-weapons-free world.
To avoid inflaming the Russians and the Chinese, who might rightfully resent American military and economic preponderance, any American administration, they believe, has to show "realistic empathy" for these potential rivals. Indeed, perception may play the largest role in the formation of foreign policy. McNamara, at a conference with high officials in the Vietnamese government in June 1997, declared that these North Vietnamese officials "might well have believed, as I judge they did, that the United States' goal in Southeast Asia was to destroy the Hanoi government and its ally, the National Liberation Front." But they would have been "totally mistaken": "We in the Kennedy administration had no such intention; we had no such aims with respect to Vietnam." 
Well, they certainly fooled a lot of people. Why else would the Kennedy administration have sent some 16,000 American advisers to South Vietnam? McNamara's Vietnamese interlocutor, one of the leading Vietnamese specialists on the United States, sharply disagreed with the former secretary of defense. "Our assessment of the U.S.," he said, "was essentially correct." McNamara bridled at this retort. "We were not opposed to an independent, unified Vietnam. We were not!" But he admits in this book that "we discounted their nationalism." 
Yes, foreign offices are supposed to understand the point of view of potential enemies. And McNamara and Blight are sensible in their analysis of what probably drives Russian and Chinese foreign policies. American intentions to expand NATO to the Russian border doubtless trouble Moscow, and the Bush administration's commitment to sell ever more sophisticated arms to Taiwan, coupled with its seeming sympathy for Taiwanese independence, clearly alarms Beijing. If the United States wishes to bring "Russia and China in from the cold," McNamara and Blight advise, the Bush administration should curb further NATO expansion and reduce arms sales to Taiwan.
Good advice -- unlikely to be followed. Hegemonic great powers like the United States tend to act unilaterally, and history teaches us that such power invites opposition. The American position will almost surely be seriously challenged in the near future, and eventually a pluralism of power -- or what Wilson loathed, a balance of power -- will most likely re-establish itself. But the way this comes about very much depends on how the United States perceives its relations with other major powers. To single out China as the next great threat, as a recent Pentagon strategy review does, is to create a self-fulfilling prophecy.
In their plea for reducing communal killing, McNamara and Blight warn against promiscuous American interventions to right wrongs. Nonetheless, they continue, the marked reluctance to violate national sovereignty should not prevent coalitions of nations from intervening in regions where the violation of human rights is excessive, as it was in Kosovo, Bosnia, East Timor and Rwanda. They quote approvingly the 1993 declaration of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, which in turn cited this statement by Pope John Paul II: "The principles of sovereignty of states and noninterference in their internal affairs . . . cannot constitute a screen behind which torture and murder may be carried out." 
But to avoid any American tendency to go it alone, McNamara and Blight absolutely rule out acting unilaterally. "Unilateral intervention," they say, "is simply prohibited by international law," whereas "multilateral intervention can be legally sanctioned, if the level of communal violence is sufficiently great to produce either 'threats to peace' in the surrounding area or a humanitarian catastrophe or both." 
Of course it is preferable to have multilateral backing for any intervention that violates state sovereignty, but it is arguable that if the United States had acted unilaterally to end the killing in the Rwandan civil war, many thousands of lives might have been saved (as former President Clinton now admits). McNamara's insistence that the United States should intervene multilaterally -- with no exceptions allowed" -- seems once again to be based on his experience during the Vietnam War, when high government officials in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations wrongly dismissed Charles de Gaulle's offer to broker a neutral government in Saigon.
McNamara and Blight's argument that the United States must take the lead in embracing a policy that would result in the elimination of all nuclear weapons is surprisingly persuasive. They approvingly cite the 1996 Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, which stated, "The proposition that nuclear weapons can be retained in perpetuity and never used -- accidentally or by decision -- defies credibility." They are also realistic in concluding that America should open discussions with Russia to achieve deep cuts in nuclear arms "until the number of weapons, now in the thousands, can be reduced to roughly the number held by China, France and Britain -- around 500 or so." Only then should multilateral talks begin to achieve "zero nuclear weapons on all sides." To get to zero, they admit, will require "a verification regime far more transparent than any now in existence, to prevent possible effects of cheating and breakout."
"Wilson's Ghost" is a courageous attempt to tackle the most crucial issues of our time. The book's message would have been better framed, however, if the authors had urged us to embrace not the Wilsonian tradition of moralism but an alternative one exemplified by Alexander Hamilton. Writing in 1793, Hamilton urged that a policy for nations should not be "absolutely selfish," but be "regulated by their own interest, as far as justice and good faith permit." That is, justice and good faith should not be drawn from Wilsonian dreams of perfectibility. They should be the practical goals of a realistic American foreign policy in the new century.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN; 
London

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN; ANDREW ROSS SORKIN, a business reporter for The Times, previously wrote for the paper from London.

 BODY:
With its resurgent South Bank, London -- always one of Europe's great walking cities -- now offers visitors a new array of paths to stroll along the Thames while enjoying views of the city and its constantly changing architecture.
 London's many parks, although sometimes crowded at midday, can be tranquil escapes at other hours. And the Diana Princess of Wales Memorial Walk, a seven-mile route extending through four royal parks, highlights buildings and landmarks that played roles in Diana's life. 
 At night, the city's streets are overflowing with a boisterous mix of people eating and drinking outdoors at London's trendiest new restaurants and old-time pubs. The parks too play an evening role as places for outdoor plays or concerts. 
And visitors this summer will find bargains. Because of weak reservations, hotels in London and throughout England are offering discounts. The travel restrictions in England caused by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease this year may have caused many Americans to reconsider their plans to visit.
The weakening United States economy and Wall Street's anemic returns have also been factors in holding down bookings. Whatever the cause, a drop of 10 to 15 percent in visits by Americans is being projected for this year, and hotels are responding accordingly, so look for specials.

Events
The BBC Proms, evenings of orchestra music, is a century-old British summer tradition. The series celebrates its 107th season at the Royal Albert Hall, with the final concert Sept. 15 featuring works by Verdi, Ravel and John Philip Sousa, as well as "Rule, Britannia." Performers include Frederica von Stade and Alice Coote. That night, Jose Carreras and the jazz pianist Jools Holland will perform in Hyde Park. Tickets cost between $7 and $30 (calculated at 71 pence to the dollar). Tickets and information: (44-207) 589 8212; www.bbc.co.uk/proms. 
A temporary aluminum-clad structure made up of a series of intersecting planes designed by the architect Daniel Libeskind sits on the lawn of the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington Gardens; it serves as a cafe as well as a terrific place to spend an afternoon when the weather is good. The structure is the setting for a series of BBC Proms poetry readings and debates on urban design, which comes to an end Aug. 31. The cafe will stay open till Sept. 9. Admission is free. Information: (44-207) 402 6075; or at www.serpentine gallery.org.
Hampstead Heath, that bucolic and serene oasis just north of London, is always a fine setting for a stroll, and on weekends, Kenwood House, a neo-Classical mansion remodeled in the mid-1700's by Robert Adam, offers open-air concerts by the lake. On Aug. 18 at 7:30 p.m., the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra will present music from Oscar-winning scores. The flamenco guitarist Paco Pena and his dancers join the BBC Concert Orchestra on Aug. 25 for an evening of works including Ravel's "Bolero" and Rimsky-Korsakov's "Capriccio Espagnol." Times vary, and tickets range from $20 to $28. Kenwood is near the Archway, Golders Green, Hampstead and Highgate subway stops, with a free shuttle from Golders Green. For information and reservations call (44-207) 413 1443; on the Web at www .picnicconcerts.com.
An evening of theater in Regent's Park is a special London treat. This summer's repertory includes "Love's Labour's Lost"; "Where's Charley?" a quintessentially English musical comedy about mistaken identities; "The Pirates of Penzance"; and "Pinocchio in the Park," a spoof about a group of actors who try to put on "The Adventures of Pinocchio" without Pinocchio. The plays run through Sept. 8. Tickets range from $11 to $32. Tickets and information: (44-207) 486 2431; www.open-air-theatre.org.uk.
The Reduced Shakespeare Company, at the Criterion Theater in Piccadilly, presents "The Complete Works of Shakespeare" -- all 37 plays in just an hour and 55 minutes -- in a hysterically funny show enjoyable for the entire family. Tickets are $11 to $41; (44-207) 413 1437; on the Web at www.reduced-shakespeare.co.uk.
The South Bank has enjoyed a revival with the opening of the Tate Modern museum and dozens of new restaurants and shops. Through Aug. 27, the Summer on the South Bank festival, with everything from African drummers to ballroom dancing, will be presented at the Royal Festival Hall. On Aug. 19, a tribute to Charles Coles, the master of jazz and rhythmic tap dance, will feature film clips of his performances and tap-dance workshops for beginners and more advanced students. Indoor and outdoor events take place at lunchtime, afternoons and early evenings. Information: www.rfh.org.uk/free summer.

Sightseeing
A path through four of London's royal parks -- Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park, Green Park and St. James's Park -- that was created last year pays tribute to Diana, the Princess of Wales. The picturesque seven-mile walk is marked by 90 memorial plaques -- describing the role that various buildings, including Clarence House and St. James's Palace, played in her life -- as well as fountains, ornamental gates and other memorials set along a path that strollers can enjoy at their own pace. It also includes a playground designed on a Peter Pan theme near Kensington Palace. An illustrated guide, "A Walk for Diana" (Hudson's, $14), is available at London bookstores. Visit www.royalparks .gov.uk.
The National Maritime Museum in Greenwich has reopened the 17th-century Queen's House, a grand white Tudor structure built by Inigo Jones, with a new art exhibition called "A Sea of Faces," 150 portraits of European naval luminaries dating back to 1620. Open daily; admission $1.40, free for seniors and children. Information: (44-208) 312 6565; www.nmm.ac.uk.
Charles Darwin's daughter Annie is the subject of a new exhibition at his home, 20 miles from London by train (from Charing Cross to either Bromley South or Bromley North), in the village of Downe, in Kent. It's worth the trip for "Annie's Box," displaying the contents of a box written about in a book of the same name by Darwin's great-great-grandson, Randal Keynes, and published in May, 150 years after Annie died at the age of 10. Inside the box were Annie's personal items and notes and letters from Darwin. The exhibition is open Wednesday to Saturday until Oct. 31. Admission is $7.70, $4 for children.

If it does happen to rain, visitors can stay dry underground and marvel at the futuristic architecture of the new London subway stations along the recently extended Jubilee line. Start at Westminster station and hop on and off at the different stops until you get to Canary Wharf. Subway tickets cost $5.50 for an all-day pass.

Where to Stay

Through Sept. 30, rates are as low as $147 a night. 
In Notting Hill, the year-old Westbourne, 163-165 Westbourne Grove, (44-207) 243 6008, (44-207) 229 7201, www.zoohotels.com, describes itself as an "urban inn." Its 20 rooms are outfitted with bespoke furniture, DVD players and a changing selection of modern art. A beautiful Japanese garden is a serene place to read or relax, while the bar inside, for guests and private parties by invitation only, is jumping. Rooms start at about $245.
Budget: The 19-room Willette, 32 Sloane Gardens, (44-207) 824 8415, fax (44-207) 730 4830, www.eeh.co.uk, just off Sloane Square, is a typically British bed-and-breakfast and a terrific value, with rates starting at $122 and going up to $217 for a triple with full breakfast included. Rooms are small but beautifully appointed, with 19th-century-style English furnishings. And the service is exceptional. 
A family staying a week or more may want to rent an apartment. The Club Suites, (44-207) 730 9131, www .sloaneclub.co.uk, at 52 Lower Sloane Street, has apartments with maid service Monday through Friday that start at $175 a night.

Fresh fruit is delived daily to the rooms, which are generally small, and decorated in a cool, spare style. Music is played underwater in the blue-tiled pool, and there is an expansive candle-lit bar downstairs. Regular rates start at $386, though a summer rate of $279, including breakfast, will be available until Sept. 9. 

Where to Eat
In the heart of Soho, Zilli Fish, 36-40 Brewer Street, (44-207) 734 8649, is a trendy spot known for Italian seafood and celebrity spotting. Close to the theater district, it's great for a quick pretheater dinner or a lingering late-night meal. Try the lobster spaghetti, and the banana spring roll for dessert. A three-course dinner for two with wine costs about $125. Reservations recommended.
Chez Bruce, 2 Bellevue Road, (44- 208) 672 0114, is out of the way (in Wandsworth, about 20 minutes by taxi from central London). But it serves some of the best modern British cooking for reasonable prices. Try the roast cod with leek and wild mushroom risotto. A three-course dinner for two with wine costs about $125 (plus cab fare of about $15 to $20). Reservations recommended.
In summer, a retractable roof makes the patio of Il Convivio, 143 Ebury Street in the Pimlico-Belgravia area, (44-207) 730 4099, especially appealing. Ask for seating in the back. Service can be spotty, but the food -- including homemade egg pasta ribbons with fresh crab and asparagus -- makes up for it. Dinner for two, with wine, is about $125. Reservations recommended.
Delicious food and grand views come together at the new Neat Brasserie, Oxo Tower Wharf, Bargehouse Street, (44-207) 928 5533. A French restaurant owned by the Michelin-starred chef Richard Neat (two for Pied a Terre, also in London), it sits on the South Bank near Blackfriars Bridge offering spectacular views of the city. Go for lunch when it is not too crowded and when a three-course meal for two, with wine, costs about $125 (and save room for the lemon meringue tart).
For a cheaper meal, Wagamama, www.wagamama.com, an Asian noodle bar with several locations in the city, is done in a style best described as cafeteria chic -- patrons sit on benches at long tables, often next to strangers. And lines can be long, probably because the food -- like the spicy salmon ramen or yaki soba -- is one of the best values in town. Dinner for two, with wine or Japanese beer, costs about $35.

HEADLINE: A Do-It-Yourselfer Takes On Home Depot 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
WALK into a Home Depot during the day, and one thing may strike you by its inescapable presence, another by its conspicuous absence.
 There will probably be a big display of energy-efficient wares right up front, under a colorful sign urging you to buy the products to prevent soaring energy prices from siphoning off your tax refund. But there will probably not be many forklifts clogging the aisles, or employees restocking the shelves. 
 Robert L. Nardelli, who left General Electric to become chief executive of Home Depot in December, has engineered both. He has also made sure that Home Depot's people are clear about his time frame. 
"He tells us, 'I'm not looking at the calendar; I'm looking at my watch,' " said Bryant Scott, president of Home Depot's chain of Expo Design Centers. These days, Home Depot restocks at night.
And it does seem that everything at the company is moving faster these days. Mr. Nardelli, who calls himself the "consummate do-it-yourselfer," has spent the last seven months installing management systems that Home Depot had never before imagined, and pressing the fast-forward button on ones it had just begun to consider.
Using news about oil prices and tax cuts to push products? His idea. The push to restock shelves at night? Home Depot had been trying it out in a couple of stores, but Mr. Nardelli insisted that every store do it, and by year-end.
"We'd have done all this anyway, but Bob really shifted us into high gear," said Gary Harvin, a regional vice president for Home Depot's mid-South operations.
The company may be hitting high gear just in time. It is facing a big challenge from Lowe's, a fast-growing home-improvement chain based in Wilkesboro, N.C.
Changes at Home Depot's headquarters here are even more drastic. Mr. Nardelli has wiped out a swath of group presidencies and placed several deposed chiefs in charge of areas he wants to see move even faster. 
Home Depot had been shuffling toward Internet sales and purchases, but it is now barreling ahead, under the aegis of Rebecca Bass, a new vice president whom Mr. Nardelli hired from a local dot-com.
And he is codifying procedures that were generally seat-of-the-pants under Bernard Marcus and Arthur M. Blank, Home Depot's revered co-founders. There are now formal councils, with members from all levels of the company, to assess and improve how Home Depot handles inventory control, accounts payable and vendor relations.
"He is preserving and nurturing those things that made Home Depot what it is," said Kenneth G. Langone, chairman of Invemed Associates, an investment banking firm, and a member of both the G.E. and Home Depot boards. "But he is bringing in Six Sigma, e-commerce, succession planning, coaching and training systems -- all the things that G.E. is noted for and famous for." 
THE pace of change is dizzying -- but analysts and Home Depot aficionados alike say it is exactly what the company needs. The chain has retailing expertise in abundance, they say. But its return on equity was just 18.9 percent in fiscal 2001, which ended on Jan. 31; a year earlier, it was 22 percent. Operating margins, meanwhile, were down to 9.16 percent, from 9.87 percent, while net margins dropped to 5.65 percent from 6.04 percent.
What Home Depot needs now, analysts figure, is more than a soupcon of G.E.-style efficiency.
"There are embedded costs in this organization, and Nardelli has the skills to drive them down," said David A. Buchsbaum, an analyst at Wachovia Securities.
Home Depot, which earned $2.6 billion on $45.7 billion in sales last year, has grown less by planning than by sheer momentum and, often, happenstance. For example, the company's chain of 32 -- soon to be 34 -- Expo Design stores, which stress home decor more than two-by-fours, originated in 1991 not as part of any grand plan, but because there was a plum piece of real estate near a Home Depot store in San Diego that the company wanted to keep out of the hands of competitors. 
"It was too close to open another Home Depot, so we figured we'd experiment," Mr. Scott, the president of the Expo chain, recalled.
But such serendipitous choices are unlikely to carry the company much further. Home Depot, which pretty much created the big-box category of home improvement stores, is facing increased competition just as the economy is faltering. Until recently, it generally had the biggest markets to itself, with Lowe's, its closest rival, appearing content to operate in smaller suburbs and towns.
But lately, Lowe's has been opening stores in Dallas, Houston, Boca Raton, Fla., and even on Peachtree Street, the main drag in Atlanta, Home Depot's hometown.
"If both those companies keep growing, you'll soon reach a point where there are just enough home improvement stores out there," said Daniel Binder, an analyst at the Buckingham Research Group.
Through a spokeswoman, Lowe's declined to discuss its competitive stance, but Lowe's stores have wide aisles, bright lighting and other cosmetic niceties that appeal particularly to women, a growing factor in the home improvement market.
In response, Home Depot is trying hard to modernize its warehouse look. It has been tinkering with its store formats and product mixes, stocking, say, corrosion-resistant aluminum exterior lights on the West Coast and more brass fixtures inland, and dispensing with 12-foot-high racks that kept too many products out of sight and out of reach.
Home Depot still has many fans on Wall Street. Analysts as a group have a strong buy recommendation on its stock, and Home Depot's market capitalization of more than $115 billion is second only to Wal-Mart among retailers, and far above the nearly $30 billion market cap of Lowe's. Home Depot shares, which closed at $49.65 on Friday, are not far below the year's high of $53.45 on May 24, but nowhere near the $68.50 they hit in March 2000, when Home Depot was a Wall Street darling.
And Lowe's is wooing investors away. Lowe's stock, which has grown far faster in the past year, closed Friday at $38.90. "We have been recommending that people switch out of Home Depot into Lowe's for over a year, and that has been a successful strategy," said Donald I. Trott, an analyst at Jefferies & Company.
NONE of the options available to Home Depot are slam-dunks. It could open still more stores in its major markets, but that would risk cannibalizing its existing stores' sales. It could start carrying new products -- apparel, say, or food -- but that could blur its image as a home improvement store. It could expand in Europe, but that would force it to grapple with the chaotic economies in some countries, the low home ownership rates in others and the absence of an entrenched do-it-yourself culture in most.
Tick off those concerns to Mr. Nardelli, though, and he shoots them down methodically. Market saturation? "That's a self-fulfilling prophecy," he said, seeming both relaxed and pumped up as he chatted about the company's prospects in a small conference room near his office. Ideally, he said, a Home Depot should be within easy driving distance of about 150,000 households. But as the company tinkers with its product mix, its store layouts and its services, the theory goes, each customer will wind up spending so much more per visit that it will take no more than 50,000 households to support a given store. And as baby boomers age, he said, they will move from being do-it-yourself customers to do-it-for-me customers, which means that Home Depot can raise sales significantly by offering more installation services.
As for new products, Mr. Nardelli sees ample room for diversity within the home improvement category. The company offers the Expo Design stores for home decor and recently opened four Villager's Hardware stores; it also acquired Georgia Lighting, a local chain. In Dallas, Mr. Nardelli is trying out a store specializing in flooring. Two urban Home Depots, in Chicago and Brooklyn, should open soon, as part of a new program to see if the concept can work in smaller stores catering to city dwellers. 
"We've got pilots going, and we'll see which ones work," he said. 
Nor does the concept of overseas expansion daunt him. G.E. buys nearly 100 companies a year, so acquisitions are business as usual for him. He has his eye on a couple of home improvement chains in Europe that he figures would be solid additions to Home Depot's orange-apron brigade. He would not mention names, but analysts expect that he is talking to, among others, Homebase in Britain; Bauhaus, Praktiker, Hornbach and OBI in Germany; Leroy Merlin in France; and bauMax in Austria.
All told, Mr. Nardelli finds laughable any suggestion that growth at Home Depot will slow. He has pared plans for new stores, to 200 from 225 this year. But he has not tampered with advertising, and he has not cut the sales staff or training. Instead, he is hunting for new revenue sources. Mr. Nardelli expects that Home Depot could be a $100 billion company within a few years.
He is pushing particularly hard to shore up Home Depot's edge with professional customers -- the contractors, developers, apartment superintendents and maintenance people at institutions like hospitals and universities. Home Depot already has special professional desks and a designated sales staff for large professional accounts at some stores, and Mr. Nardelli has been having a round of breakfast meetings with those customers to see what else they would like. One result will be the rollout of separate stores catering solely to professionals, with easily accessible loading docks and warehouses replete with large quantities of lumber and other bulky items. 
"We had our seat belts on for the last surge of business, but now we're buckling up for a surge to megabusiness," said Greg Turner, president of Home Depot's mid-South division. 
Easily said, but Mr. Nardelli has to walk a fine line, shoring up the systems that underlie Home Depot without damaging the gung-ho, almost Amway-like culture that has driven the company since its inception in 1978.
"These people are comfortable in their own skin, and they have no desire to become an industrial company like G.E.," said Gerard R. Roche, the chairman of Heidrick & Struggles and the recruiter who placed Mr. Nardelli at Home Depot. "They want a C.E.O. who initiates spirit, who brings inspiration and leadership to the party."
John F. Welch Jr., the G.E. chairman and Mr. Nardelli's former boss, says he can do it. "You can be a highly gregarious, outgoing guy with a warm touch, and still be a very efficient materials-flow manager," Mr. Welch said. "He's tireless, he'll put rigor into their processes, but he'll motivate the hell out of their team." 
Still, when Mr. Nardelli's hiring was announced, the company's 250,000 "associates" -- Home Depot, like Wal-Mart, wouldn't dream of calling them just employees -- did not know quite what to expect. They were not afraid, exactly. They thought that if Mr. Marcus, the 72-year-old chairman, and Mr. Blank, 58, who has since retired as chief executive, trusted Mr. Nardelli with their baby, they would give him the benefit of the doubt.
But still, someone with no retailing experience? Someone who had just lost what was arguably the most publicized succession race in history -- to replace Mr. Welch -- and who might well consider the Home Depot slot a consolation prize at best? 
Mr. Nardelli picked up on the fierce pride right away. "You get into a room with 300 associates, and suddenly they're yelling, 'Give me an H, give me an O,' " he said. "Anyone can acquire technology, but at this place they've got passion, they've created a soul, they allow for emotion."
Mr. Nardelli has been swallowing the Home Depot culture in big, bold gulps. Not once during a recent two-hour conversation did he slip and say "employees" instead of associates, or use "they" in referring to Home Depot or "we" to mean G.E. 
He has made the psychological transition from the consummate G.E. company man to the rah-rah Home Depot leader. He led that Home Depot cheer himself eight times in his first week, and does so at meetings several times each week. He has walked the floor at dozens of stores -- a tradition for Home Depot executives and board members -- and has even spent a half-hour or so working the checkout counter at a couple of them. 
BUT that does not mean he has not seasoned the cultural brew with several shakes of G.E. salt -- its penchant for measuring performance of people and businesses in concrete terms, for asking everyone and anyone for their ideas, sifting through those ideas and then going directly to action without months of cogitation or tests.
"He measures everything -- not just sales, but how well we coordinate with other stores, our mix of full-timers and peak-timers on staff, everything," Mr. Bryant said. "We've always been held accountable for performance, but he's ratcheted it up a couple of notches."
In fact, the G.E. way of life has emerged in subtle ways that only true G.E. aficionados may recognize. Every Monday morning, Mr. Nardelli holds a conference call with regional executives, in which they exchange tips on new products or methods, coordinate advertising and staffing plans and update him and one another about what is selling and what is not.
It sounds awfully familiar to Noel M. Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan Business School who has written extensively about G.E. "Linking salespeople to the top of the organization, using their data to make quick decisions and apply them -- G.E. learned that from Wal-Mart," he said, "so it will certainly work well at Home Depot." 
Six Sigma, G.E.'s complicated statistical analysis method for quality control, is filtering through Home Depot, too. So is G.E.'s penchant for pushing sales and back-office operations onto the Web. "Last month he asked us how our Web presence was, and we said anemic," Mr. Bryant said. "He said, I want you online in weeks. Guess what -- we're going live right now."
But perhaps the most important G.E. concept that Mr. Nardelli is bringing to Home Depot is an emphasis on developing people. "As soon as we learned that Bob wouldn't succeed Jack Welch, I called Jack and said, 'Tell me more about this guy,' " Mr. Marcus said. "And Jack said, 'His most important attribute is that he knows how to build people.' "
At the fundamental, merchandising level, Home Depot abounds with such skills. "Arthur and Bernie trained us beyond our wildest dreams," said Tom Nichols, manager of the Home Depot store in Roswell, Ga. 
BUT the company still had to reach outside for a new chief executive after two top executives and possible heirs had to quit for health reasons.
"Succession planning was a deficiency that Arthur and I had," Mr. Marcus acknowledged.
Mr. Nardelli may soon discover that the management vacuum is not a problem just in the executive suite. Mr. Langone, the Home Depot director, says that for far too long, Home Depot promoted managers purely on the basis of their store's sales growth, without a thought to whether they could really take on more responsibility. He points to one manager who performed terrifically running a $50 million store and was then put in charge of a $100 million store. "He's drowning there," Mr. Langone said. "We have to find better ways of spotting and rewarding high-potential people." 
Mr. Nardelli and Dennis Donovan, a former G.E. executive who joined Home Depot in April as executive vice president for human resources, have been visiting every divisional office, checking their human resources plans and methods. 
They have already started making changes. Some are small and symbolic, like having public relations people report to Mr. Donovan. ("P.R. has to do with reputation, and reputation is an important part of attracting and motivating the work force," Mr. Donovan said.)
Others are more basic, like asking every division to use the same employee appraisal forms. (Forty-eight separate ones are now in use.) "We had too many separate systems that were complicating things," Mr. Donovan said.
Mr. Nardelli and Mr. Donovan have been meeting with people at all levels of the company whom the divisional vice presidents have tagged as having high potential. And they have put into place some of the vice presidents' ideas. For example, they will try to loosen the link between a store manager's bonus and the store's performance, so that successful store managers can more easily be persuaded to try their hand at turning around troubled stores.
HOME DEPOT isn't really as much of a culture change for Mr. Nardelli as it might appear. For one thing, his do-it-yourself passion is readily apparent to everyone who knows him. "I'd call him on a Saturday, and find him in his garage fixing a rocker," Mr. Roche, the corporate recruiter, said. "He loves shop work and two-by-fours and fixing things." 
And it is not as if he has severed all ties with his past. Home Depot is a big customer for G.E. appliances, and Mr. Nardelli remains in close contact with Jeffrey Immelt, who won the succession race. Home Depot buys lots of masking tape, insulation and other products from 3M, now led by W. James McNerney Jr., the other G.E. also-ran. Although Mr. Nardelli could easily be forgiven if he felt at least a slight rivalry -- a desire to prove that maybe he should have been Mr. Welch's first choice -- he said he felt nothing of the sort. "The three of us remain very good friends," he said, "and, yes, we talk all the time." 
Still, G.E. has been part of Mr. Nardelli's life as far back as he can remember. Some people are army brats; Mr. Nardelli was a G.E. brat. His father worked his way up the G.E. ladder, and the company moved the Nardellis several times, from Old Forge, Pa., where Mr. Nardelli was born, to Scranton. Pa., to Rockford, Ill., and ultimately to Louisville, Ky. 
In his youth, however, Mr. Nardelli never thought about following in his father's footsteps. He was more interested in playing football. He attended Western Illinois University on a football scholarship and for a while even thought about coaching. 
But two things happened at college: he took what he calls a "smattering" of business law, and liked it. And he fell in love with Susan L. Schmulbach, the sister of a teammate. He married her in June 1971 and started working as a manufacturing engineer less than a week later in G.E.'s Louisville appliance plant. They have four children, ranging in age from 15 to 26.
"The job market was awfully tight in 1971, and I was lucky to get a decent job anywhere," he said. Money was tight, too, and he and his wife bought a classic fixer-upper, finished the basement, added bedrooms and did the wood paneling and wallpaper work themselves. 
It was one of the few outside activities for which he had time. From the start, Mr. Nardelli was on G.E.'s fast track, changing assignments every few months, rising to head GE Power Systems, one of the largest units. 
Mr. Nardelli, who says he wants to visit at least 200 stores before year-end, has not slackened his pace. He is up at 5:15 each morning, and gets dressed with one eye on the TV news, another on the daily newspapers.
He lives a short commute from the Atlanta headquarters, so he is at the office by 6 a.m. An hour later, he is already on the way to a store or a meeting with regional executives. He rarely gets home before 8 p.m., and weekends often find him in the office, catching up on paperwork.
Nor is Mr. Nardelli the only family member to be spotted in the local Home Depot. His wife has been hitting them lately, too, with architect and designer in tow. The Nardellis have bought what he calls a "huge remodel and repair" house, and Sue Nardelli has become an enthusiastic lumber and cabinetry customer. "We don't even get a discount," he said. No one on staff does, and Mr. Nardelli is not about to pull rank.

Rebate and Switch

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
There was an odd, almost whining tone to the speech Lawrence Lindsey, the White House's top economist, gave in Philadelphia last week. Mr. Lindsey said that he was "disturbed" to find that any doubts remain about the tax cut passed two months ago, that the cut is "an obvious success story." Clearly, Mr. Lindsey is feeling the heat: many people, even those who enthusiastically supported George W. Bush's campaign, are starting to have second thoughts about his tax cut. 
 The latest sign of second thoughts came on Friday, when the front page of USA Today carried a story about disgruntled military leaders who have realized that the tax cut precludes big budget increases. (What did they expect?) And there are more shocks to come. Wait until retirees realize that the tax cut also precludes any realistic plan to provide prescription drug coverage. 
 So Mr. Lindsey fell back on his usual argument: that the tax cut is needed to support the economy. He compared critics of the tax cut to Herbert Hoover, who raised taxes at the beginning of the Great Depression. But the very next day Mr. Lindsey's logic was contradicted by none other than the man who made the tax cut inevitable, Alan Greenspan.
By the "tax cut," I don't mean the rebate checks being sent out as you read this; neither does Mr. Lindsey. A rebate this year will do no harm, and may do some good. But although the Bush people are doing their best to wring political advantage out of the rebate, it wasn't their idea: their original plan offered almost no tax relief this year, and at first they scoffed at proposals for broad, short-term relief. Initial proposals for an immediate, across-the-board rebate came from Democrats; the administration finally went along, but tied the rebate to what it really wanted, big tax cuts for the rich in future years (and fudged the accounting to pretend that it could do all this without raiding Social Security).
So Mr. Lindsey wasn't defending the rebate; he was defending those future tax cuts. "A repeal of the scheduled tax cut would hit the economy at precisely the wrong time," he declared. In other words, we don't dare undo tax cuts that aren't supposed to happen until 2006 -- or in the case of the estate tax, 2010 -- for fear of depressing consumer spending right now. As soon as one puts his argument this way, of course, it becomes hard to take seriously. How many families base their current spending on news about tax changes that won't take place for five years?
On the other hand, there are some people who think very hard about the future budget picture, like bond traders -- which brings us to Alan Greenspan. On Tuesday Mr. Greenspan was trying to explain to a Senate hearing why repeated interest-rate cuts have not yet turned the economy around. An important part of the explanation, as he noted, is that while the Fed has reduced short-term rates, long-term rates have stayed stubbornly high. Why?
An obvious answer is that bond traders, who not long ago expected the government to rapidly pay down its debt, now see the projected surplus dwindling rapidly because of the tax cut. So it's just supply and demand: estimates of the future supply of bonds are rising, so bond prices are falling -- and that means higher long-term interest rates (including mortgage rates). When asked by Senator Charles Schumer whether this was a factor in the economy's sluggish response to Fed policy, Mr. Greenspan replied, "Oh yes, no question."
Mr. Greenspan did not retreat from his earlier endorsement of the tax cut. But in subsequent testimony he seemed again to concede that the effect of future tax cuts on today's economy is, on balance, negative. Where does that leave Mr. Lindsey?
For four out of five American families, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, this year's rebate is most of what they will ever get from the Bush tax cut. Those future tax cuts that Mr. Lindsey wants to defend are overwhelmingly for the very, very affluent -- and they will severely squeeze every other national priority. So why not reconsider them? 
The threat of recession, it seems, is now the last refuge of . . . well, let's just say that we should not let Mr. Lindsey's scare tactics deter us from undoing a serious policy mistake.

HEADLINE: Free Trade Needs a Chance to Sell Itself 

BYLINE:  By Alan S. Blinder; Alan S. Blinder is a professor of economics at Princeton and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J. 

 BODY:
I have just started a new club. Anyone can join, but I particularly want to sign up President Bush and his trade representative, Robert Zoellick. The club is Free Traders against Fast Track. Let me explain, starting with a confession.
 Like 99 percent of economists since the days of Adam Smith, I am a free trader down to my toes. But the sad truth is that despite 225 years of trying, economists have not been able to convince the public or its elected representatives of the virtues of free trade. This constitutes pedagogical failure on a grand scale. Perhaps not enough people have taken Economics 101, or of those who have, not enough remember what they learned. 
 Instead, the same false arguments against free trade and for protectionist policies that Adam Smith demolished in 1776 dominate public discourse about trade. Listen to the political rhetoric, and you will hear only about the virtues of exports. Imports are, at best, a necessary evil. Thus, the United States is said to make a "trade concession" whenever we allow in more foreign goods, even though our citizens enjoy cheaper prices while foreigners work for us. And we are said to score a victory whenever we persuade foreign countries to open their borders to our goods, so that we Americans can work for them.
These misconceptions have an important practical consequence: they make free trade difficult to sell politically. To push a trade agreement through Congress, the administration is typically forced to show that it has wrung even greater "concessions" from foreign countries than we have granted to them. And the enhanced export opportunities must be tangible: What new market access have you won for the movie industry? For the farmers? For the pharmaceutical companies? Only when the pro-export lobbies overwhelm the anti-import lobbies does Congress act.
Given this political reality, it is futile to get lost in the fight to give the president fast-track trade authority when there is no trade agreement in sight. The argument for fast track is that the administration cannot negotiate a comprehensive agreement if other nations fear Congress is waiting to pick it apart. So major trade negotiations are generally conducted under a simple rule: Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. With fast-track authority, the idea is to submit the whole package to Congress for a straight up-or-down vote, making it impossible for Congress to strike out unpopular trade concessions and making it more likely that the entire package will pass. 
But arguing for fast-track authority before trade negotiations have even started means making a case for free trade in the abstract -- a losing proposition, as President Clinton discovered in his failed attempt to renew fast-track authority in 1998.
President Bush seems to be repeating the mistake. Because of the debacle in Seattle during World Trade Organization talks there and the lack of progress since then, there is no agreed-upon agenda among the nations of the world for the next round of trade talks. Will the negotiations focus on agricultural trade, textiles, services, intellectual property? Will labor and environmental standards be high on the agenda? Since no one knows the answers, American industries cannot see concrete prospects for gains, and so few are ready to help push the fast-track idea through Congress.
Those in the administration who believe that we now need to fight the fast-track battle in Congress are misguided. While fast-track authority will ultimately be necessary, a comprehensive multinational trade agreement will take years to complete. Instead of expending political energy on this issue prematurely, the administration should work with other nations to set a specific agenda for trade talks -- and even begin negotiating some of the details -- all of which can be done without fast-track authority. As these early-stage negotiations progress, American industries will start to see prospects for attractive trade advantages -- and that may well entice them to support fast-track authority.
Unfortunately, the Bush administration's current strategy is actually hurting the cause of free trade. In a misguided effort to grease the way for fast track, the president appears ready to buy off the forces of protectionism in a piecemeal fashion -- by steps like his recent decision to consider protecting the American steel industry. But trying to win fast-track authority by showing protectionists that he can be tough on foreign producers will only embolden protectionist lobbies to seek more victories. 
President Bush, who says he supports free trade, should forget about fast track for now. The best way to further free trade in the long term is to focus on starting the trade negotiations and leave the strategizing and politicking on fast track for later, when there is something actually at stake.

HEADLINE: America on the Sidelines 

 BODY:
During the presidential campaign, George W. Bush often said that a country as powerful as the United States should be humble in its relations with other nations. That was good advice, but since taking office Mr. Bush has shown a surprising disdain for the kinds of treaties and international agreements that set the tone for America's engagement with the world and that have figured prominently in Washington's foreign policy for most of the years since World War II. The administration's hostile attitude communicates a sense of arrogance and contempt for international cooperation that ill serves American interests. 
 This page favors preservation or adoption of the treaties that the Bush administration opposes. But we recognize that in the case of recently negotiated accords, any new administration has a right to reconsider draft agreements endorsed by its predecessor and to propose revisions more in keeping with its own philosophy. Washington clearly has an obligation to make sure that international agreements do not undermine American security. But unless a treaty is fatally flawed, Washington should not abruptly walk away from the agreement. The more responsible answer is to work with other countries to modify the accord. 
 As the world's strongest economic and military power, the United States has a compelling interest in helping to expand and shape international law on matters from arms control to the environment to criminal accountability. Mighty as it is, Washington cannot expect to lead the way to a less dangerous, more law-abiding and environmentally sustainable world from the sidelines. 
The administration's record in this regard is dismal. In January, even before Mr. Bush took office, his spokesmen declared that he would not seek Senate ratification of the treaty creating the International Criminal Court. In March, the White House announced that the United States was withdrawing from the Kyoto Protocol on global warming. In May, Mr. Bush made clear he was ready to set aside the constraints of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty in order to test and build missile defenses. 
Earlier this month, American delegates insisted on diluting a United Nations agreement to reduce illegal trafficking in small arms. Last week, Washington pulled out of long-running efforts to negotiate enforcement provisions for the convention banning biological weapons. Meanwhile, the administration has indefinitely deferred seeking Senate ratification of the 1996 nuclear test ban treaty and the 1993 nuclear weapons reduction treaty with Russia negotiated by Mr. Bush's father.
The flaws in imperfect treaties can generally be fixed, whether through further negotiations or in the Senate ratification process. Last week, representatives of nearly 180 countries met in Bonn to refine the Kyoto Protocol. Important changes were made that addressed previous American complaints. But instead of engaging in serious negotiations in Bonn, Washington's representative was instructed to stand aside. 
The administration has also so far ignored a useful opportunity to address many of the objections it has raised to the nuclear test ban treaty. Early this year, Gen. John Shalikashvili, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, proposed steps that Washington could take on its own to strengthen verification of other countries' compliance with the ban and assure that America's own stockpile of nuclear warheads remained reliable in the absence of testing. Yet the White House has shown no interest in the Shalikashvili recommendations.
The Bush administration's negative approach has all but scuttled efforts to enforce the global biological weapons ban. Unanimous agreement is needed to produce a new draft accord. Other countries are moving ahead with the Kyoto Protocol, but efforts to slow global warming will be badly weakened by the refusal of the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases to participate. The future of the ABM treaty remains in doubt. 
This is not a productive role for the world's leading country and the architect of much of the international law created over the last half-century. Contempt for the concerns of other countries will only erode American influence.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk; 
Senator Looks to Home With Bill on Manure Use

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28 

 BODY:
Hundreds of millions of tons of cow and pig manure accumulate every year in the United States. If it were piled into trucks, which of course it never would be, the line would stretch bumper to bumper from San Francisco to New York, according to a calculation once made by the Environmental Protection Agency.
 The stuff is disgusting. It stinks. The methane gas it emits pollutes the atmosphere. The runoff pollutes the water. And it is ubiquitous. There are dairy or hog farms in almost every state. 
 For at least 30 years, the technology has existed to convert this waste into electricity. But the process has not been economical. The initial capital outlay has always been too high, and what utilities would pay for the electricity has been too low. Today, only 31 American farms have such operations, the E.P.A. said.
Now, with high energy prices and power shortages at the top of the news, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa has weighed in with legislation that would give a tax credit to dairy and hog farmers who produce electricity from their wastes.
To sweeten the pot, the bill would specify that grants from the government's environmental quality incentive program could be made available to farmers who wanted to invest in the technology.
Mr. Grassley calls his bill POWER, which stands for Providing Opportunities With Effluent Renew ables. It is another example of legislation that benefits one particular interest or another of an important lawmaker. The measure was introduced just this week, and so far no opposition has developed.
Thousands of bills are introduced in Congress every year, and most lie untouched in the hopper. But this bill has some chance of enactment this year because of Mr. Grassley's influence. A farmer, he was chairman of the Finance Committee, the panel with jurisdiction over tax legislation, until Republicans lost control of Congress and is now the committee's top-ranking Republican.
He got the idea for the bill from his predecessor as chairman, William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware. Delaware has few cows or pigs but many chickens.
Mr. Roth, who lost his seat last year, got a law enacted in 1999 that allows a tax credit for electricity made from chicken droppings. No one has claimed the credit, said Bill Satterfield, executive director of Delmarva Poultry Industry Inc., a trade association for chicken producers.
"Only a big company with millions of dollars of resources can do it," Mr. Satterfield said.
Most of the 31 commercial farms in 16 states where livestock manure is converted into electricity are quite large. Carl Theunis, who owns one of the farms, in Wisconsin, said he had 2,500 dairy cows and had invested more than $2 million in the conversion technology.
The normal capital outlay is $200,000 to $250,000, said Kurt Roos, director of a federal program that promotes the technology. That is more than twice the government grants that would be allowed to any farmer under the Grassley bill. If a farmer can save 6 cents per kilowatt-hour on the electricity bill, the initial outlay can be paid off in about four years, Mr. Roos said. Under Mr. Grassley's bill, the tax credit would be 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.
Estimates are that the tax credit could cost the Treasury $300 million over the next 10 years and that 2,000 to 3,000 farmers may benefit.
Doug Williams, an agricultural engineer at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo who has been working for 25 years with the manure-to-electricity technology, said government subsidies would not be the make-or-break factor in whether the conversion operations became more prevalent.
More important, he said, is whether the price of electricity remains very high and whether state and local environmental laws become stricter. In fact, the environmental advantages of turning manure into electricity are probably greater than the benefits of energy production. 
The process, called anaerobic digestion, eliminates the odor of manure; controls the release of methane, one of the main greenhouse gases; and makes the pollution from runoff less serious. 
Mr. Grassley said he was confident his measure would pass. "If Senator Roth could get his bill passed for chickens, I can sure get mine passed," he said.

HEADLINE: Islanders to Vote Today On Vieques Bomb Drills 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: VIEQUES, P.R., July 28 

 BODY:
The firing range that has been the make-believe battlefield for countless invasions on the eastern tip of this tiny island was silent. Instead, the only booming noises came from the bands and people who packed the town plaza Friday night and into this morning to demand that the United States Navy cease fire and leave immediately, not in May 2003 as President Bush recently announced. 
 The festivities were a prelude to the referendum on Sunday when Vieques residents will vote on whether the Navy should leave now, stay until 2003 or remain indefinitely. On one level, the nonbinding vote is about as real as the mock invasions that have taken place for 61 years here, since any decision rests with the United States government. 
 But in an atmosphere charged with the symbolism of self-determination, opponents of the Navy, who predict they will win easily, want to send an unequivocal message to Congress and President Bush. For many, Vieques's contribution to national security over the last six decades has come at the expense of land, jobs and health.
"How many more people will be affected?" said Ismael Guadalupe, a leader in the anti-Navy movement. "The Navy has destroyed our natural resources. We have to stop it now. It is necessary to have our land in our hands. It is an act of immorality to continue bombing for however long it may be."
Sunday's ballot, in which almost two-thirds of the island's 9,300 residents are expected to vote, is not the referendum that had been expected. An accord between President Bill Clinton and former Gov. Pedro J. Rossello provided $40 million in economic development aid and a referendum, scheduled for November. But Puerto Rico's new governor, Sila Maria Calderon, called for a referendum this weekend as part of her campaign pledge to evict the Navy.
Ms. Calderon, who is the leader of the pro-Commonwealth party that supports the island's current status, which confers United States citizenship on Puerto Ricans but does not give them the right to vote in presidential elections, said the November referendum would be unfair. She said it would give voters only the choices of stopping the Navy training on Vieques in 2003 or continuing indefinitely in exchange for $50 million in additional aid, but it shut out the option of an immediate withdrawal. 
"I made a commitment to the people of Vieques to let them express themselves with three options," she said. "This may not have the force of law as in the United States, but it has a moral force and gives people a chance to express themselves freely. That is the importance of this vote, that the people's voice be heard in Puerto Rico, Washington and the entire world."
The loudest voices here in the weeks leading up to the vote have been from the opponents of the Navy, who have led vigils and protests from a makeshift village at the entrance to the firing range at Camp Garcia. They have been there, coordinating acts of civil disobedience like trespassing, since a Puerto Rican security guard was killed in April 1999 on the range by a bomb that veered off course. 
They have drawn throngs to their cause, including such well-known advocates as the Rev. Al Sharpton, the environmentalist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the labor leader Dennis Rivera of New York. 
On Friday, Terry McAuliffe, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, visited the island, where residents told of concerns over the environmental and health effects from the bombing runs.
Governor Calderon has kept her party officially out of the campaign, and she has insisted that the vote over the future of Vieques should not be politicized. 
Puerto Rico's small independence movement has seen Vieques as a focal point for the larger issue of Puerto Rico's status, and they have the support of President Fidel Castro of Cuba, who welcomed a leading independence official in Havana a few months ago.
Such links have alarmed the Navy's supporters in Vieques. 
"We need to save Puerto Rico from the Communists and terrorists," said Luis Sanchez, a leader of the pro-Navy faction who is also a security guard at the base. "The campaign against the Navy is directed by separatists who attack democracy and American citizenship." In recent days, fliers have circulated on the island with Mr. Castro's picture alongside that of Che Guevara and Robert Rabin, a leader of the Navy opposition.
"If the Navy leaves, we are left in the open and unprotected," said Juana Rivera, a statehood supporter who unsuccessfully ran for mayor last year. "Puerto Rico is the door to the Atlantic and the Americas. I am not going to give it to Fidel Castro on a silver platter."
Governor Calderon dismisses such talk, saying: "This is about human rights and justice for people who have been bombed for 60 years. I repudiate Fidel Castro. His government has nothing to do with this. Those who say so want to harm the people of Puerto Rico."
Political analysts agree that the Vieques vote has great resonance for Puerto Rico, which became a United States territory in 1898, at the end of the Spanish-American War.
"Vieques is a symbol for national affirmation against the United States," said Juan Garcia Passalacqua, a political analyst. "The people have found a way to express their rejection of colonialism without having to choose between the options for political status." 
On Friday night, hundreds of Navy opponents trekked up Mount Carmelo here to cheer the unfurling of the Vieques flag, a blue and white banner. As more than 50 people lifted the banner high, the Rev. Nelson Lopez, the Catholic pastor of Vieques, sprinkled holy water and intoned a benediction.
"As we lift this flag, we lift our souls, our faith, our hope for a better Vieques without the Navy," he said. "A Vieques where people live in peace and love, developing themselves to earn their daily bread." He removed his stole and kissed it, then began a chant not taught in the seminary.
"Vieques si!" he shouted. "Navy no!"

HEADLINE: CHINESE UNSWAYED AS POWELL PUSHES U.S. MISSILE PLAN 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 28 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell ended his first meeting with China's leaders today sounding upbeat and saying the two sides would talk more about human rights and weapons sales. But he made little headway in overcoming opposition to the Bush administration's plans for a missile shield. 
 The secretary met separately with President Jiang Zemin and Prime Minister Zhu Rongji in the administration's highest-level talks yet. 
 The meeting, intended to lay the groundwork for a visit by President Bush in October, came after months of tension over the emergency landing of an American spy plane in China, American weapons sales to Taiwan, and China's arrest of several scholars with ties to the United States. 
But with release of two of those scholars, who were convicted of espionage, as Mr. Powell headed toward China, Beijing had paved the way for seemingly pleasant encounters today. 
After their meeting both sides, using nearly identical language, said they looked forward to building "constructive" relations. But the administration's plans for a missile shield, which Beijing fears could undercut its small nuclear arsenal, clearly remained a big obstacle. 
"I tried to make a comprehensive case of the president's strategy," the secretary said at a news conference after his day of meetings. "They listened carefully. I'm sure we will have many more conversations on this subject because they have a different view of it." 
The secretary said he had tried to offer assurances that the missile defense system would not negate China's status as a nuclear power. "I told them that our plans with respect to missile defense are for a limited missile defense," he said. He also tried to persuade the Chinese that such a shield would not undermine the arsenals of either China or Russia. 
The secretary's explanation was the highest-level presentation of the issue that China's leaders have heard. 
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Sun Yuxi, who attended all the meetings, did not repeat China's outright opposition to the plan, but said that if Washington was ready to continue with consultations, China "is open to hearing U.S. views." China's goal, he said, was for "constructive, cooperative relations." 
The secretary himself helped set the stage for today's generally positive atmosphere in the last few weeks by conspicuously dropping references to China as a "strategic competitor." 
He said today that he represented the "advance party" for President Bush in October, when Mr. Bush is to attend an economic conference of Asian-Pacific leaders in Shanghai, and then proceed to Beijing. 
Mr. Powell received a warm welcome from Mr. Jiang, who greeted him at the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square by saying, "Your reputation goes before you." 
But he chided his visitor for staying only a day and not visiting Shanghai and Xian, where terra-cotta warriors created in 221 B.C. are a major attraction. 
But any discomfort the Chinese felt about the brevity of the visit may have been overcome by the secretary's enthusiasm for all the new buildings he saw from his limousine window as he sped up and down a highway on his round of appointments. The buildings, he said, illustrated the strides China has made since he last visited in 1983, and the "gifted, skilled political leadership that would move the country in that direction."
In another warm note, the secretary said he congratulated Mr. Jiang on China's successful effort to be host for the 2008 Olympics. "The United States looks forward to seeing the changes in the next seven years that this historic event is bound to stimulate," he said. 
Along with congratulations, the statement implied the administration's hope that the Beijing government would feel impelled to improve its human rights record as the world's attention focused on China. 
The secretary said he brought up human rights at every meeting, and had made a point of introducing his Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, Lorne W. Craner.
But he said he did not raise the specific cases of people in detention, preferring to deal with the subject generically. It was more important, he said, to raise the broader question of the rule of law. "I don't think that message was missed by my interlocutors," the secretary said. 
The scope of the differences on human rights will be discussed in a formal dialogue that will be resumed in the coming months, Secretary Powell said. Such talks were held for a while during the Clinton administration and then suspended several years ago after the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade during the war with Yugoslavia. 
Human Rights Watch said today, however, that it was unimpressed by the resumption of the talks, saying that in the past the dialogue had been "pro forma." 
On China's sale of missiles and weapons technology to other nations -- another major issue on which the secretary was looking for progress -- the two sides agreed to hold more talks among experts on both sides. Mr. Powell said the administration was holding up the licensing of the sale of American communication satellites to China until Beijing improved its record on the issue. 
Officials traveling with the secretary said specifically that China had failed to live up to pledges last November to curb sales of missile components and technology. Once it did so, Washington would move forward with the satellite sales. 
Secretary Powell said that he raised "specific transfers" of missiles and technology today, but declined to say which sales concerned him most. Previously, administration officials have said they were most concerned about sales of missile components to Pakistan. 
The top Chinese leadership has insisted that it is committed to ending the sales but appears unable or unwilling to carry through on its pledges, a senior Bush administration official said before the secretary left Washington for Beijing. 
The perennial question of Taiwan and American arms sales there was raised, too, officials said, with the two sides reiterating their opposing positions. 
The secretary said that the sales gave Taiwan the "confidence" to engage China and that "hopefully, with that confidence, they can restart dialogue and discussions on cross-straits issues."
The Chinese spokesman, Mr. Sun, said, "The sales of weapons, especially sophisticated weapons, will inevitably benefit the Taiwan independence forces." 
The secretary said a bilateral economic commission would meet in Beijing in September. Additionally, a joint military committee, which was used by the administration to defuse the crisis over the American spy plane earlier this year, will hold a special meeting in August, the secretary said.
"So in the course of the day we have come to quite a few agreements on how we can move forward with our dialogue on a full range of issues that the two nations are interested in from trade, proliferation, to human rights to commerce," Mr. Powell said. 
The one area notably absent from that list, however, was the administration's plan for a missile shield. 
As the secretary embarked on his trip this week, influential Democrats on Capitol Hill suggested that the distance between the two sides could push China toward an aggressive buildup of its long-range ballistic missiles. 
The chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, argued that if China feared that its small arsenal would be undercut, it would rapidly begin expanding it. 
A recent unclassified Central Intelligence Agency report said China could respond by multiplying tenfold its number of long-range ballistic missiles. It estimated that China currently had 18 such missiles. 
Mr. Biden too warned of a similar outcome this week if the administration rushed forward with an "unproven missile defense program." He said the administration "must work much more closely with China" to ensure that it understood the White House's approach to building a new strategic framework. 
Secretary Powell's visit today appeared to be a first step in that direction.

HEADLINE: Where Breaking Up Is Harder to Do; 
New York Law May Fan the Fire in Divorces Like Giuliani's

BYLINE:  By JANE FRITSCH 

 BODY:
There is a temptation to look for greater meaning in the high-volume Giuliani-Hanover divorce case, especially in legal circles. The ongoing train wreck has raised some uncomfortable questions about whether New York's courts encourage Extreme Divorce, in the way that tabloid talk shows goad the weak-minded into abusing one another.
 Some say the Giuliani spectacle, and others like it, demonstrate that New York's divorce courts are the worst in the country. It is a claim that is impossible to prove, of course, and besides, New Yorkers rarely care how things are done in the rest of the country. 
 In the end, people who are determined to make divorce into World War III can do it, judges and lawyers say, whether they are in New York or Los Angeles or Keokuk, Iowa. 
Still, for better or worse, there are some provable differences between a New York divorce and a divorce almost anywhere else. New York has long resisted a national trend toward allowing no-fault divorce. Mediation, in which couples are encouraged to work out an agreement, rather than have one imposed by a judge, has never caught on in New York. In some other states, it is required by law. Even benign-sounding parent education classes are controversial.
Some think all of these measures are essential to cutting down on the acrimony -- not to mention the legal bills -- brought on by divorce. Maybe so, others say, but there are good reasons New York is the way it is and should stay that way. If there is a problem, they say, it is the fault of some ill-mannered lawyers, not the system.
"The New York matrimonial bar does not have a national reputation for giving people advice to cool down the conflict for the sake of their children," said Andrew I. Schepard, a professor at the Hofstra University School of Law. New York, he said, is "the worst place in the country for a child whose parents are getting divorced." And, he said, it is the last major state in the country to require that fault be proved.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his wife, Donna Hanover, are enmeshed in a system that maximizes opportunities for conflict, Professor Schepard said, but they are also part of the problem. "They set the tone for everybody else," he said. "The media culture filters down. If Rudy does it and Donna does it, then this is the way it's done."
Actually, few divorce cases are fought to the bitter end. Most times, the parties settle, if for no other reason than they can't afford the $20,000 or more in legal fees that a contested divorce can cost each side.
Divorce anywhere can be expensive, but in New York, the costs can be particularly high. In New York, the blame is supposed to land on someone.
If, for instance, the husband wants a divorce but the wife does not, the husband must prove in court that she was at fault in some way recognized by New York law. He has four choices: cruel and inhuman treatment, abandonment, imprisonment or adultery. The fact that he may simply have grown bored with her, or is in love with someone else, is not enough in New York. This often creates a paradox in which the partner who strayed must accuse the other of wrongdoing.
In the Giuliani-Hanover case, it is the mayor who has fallen in love with someone else and wants a divorce, but he can't have it unless Ms. Hanover agrees not to contest his charges, or he proves that Ms. Hanover is at fault. He has accused her of "cruel and inhuman treatment," but the details of his accusations have not been made public. He must, under the law, provide those details at a divorce trial, giving dates and times and descriptions of her cruel and inhuman behavior.
In the meantime, the judge in the Giuliani-Hanover case has to sort out a list of bitterly contested matters. Last week, the mayor was ordered to pay Ms. Hanover $1,800 a month in child support. She had asked for $3,200. The judge denied a request that Mr. Giuliani be forced to pay the $58,000 salary of Ms. Hanover's press secretary, who had been paid by the city until last spring, when Mr. Giuliani stripped Ms. Hanover of her official duties as first lady. 
It is possible to file for divorce in New York without accusations that one person or the other did something wrong. But this can happen only if the spouses agree on everything. It is done by first declaring a formal separation. After husband and wife have lived apart for one year under the terms of the separation, a divorce can be granted.
It has been a decade since there was any serious attempt to push no-fault divorce legislation in Albany. Proposed legislation failed because of opposition by some lawyers and activists who contended that it would hurt women.
"A lot of the opposition to no-fault divorce is that the economic consequences of divorce for women and children are downward consequences," said Assemblywoman Helene E. Weinstein, a Brooklyn Democrat and chairwoman of the Assembly Judiciary Committee. A no-fault proposal in the early 1990's failed because some legislators demanded provisions that addressed economic inequality, like equalization of lawyers' fees, Ms. Weinstein said. That would mean, she said, that husbands who have more money to spend on lawyers would be required by law to pay their spouses' legal fees.
"There's a problem almost everywhere in divorce where the wealthier party hires an expensive lawyer and keeps driving the litigation until the other has to settle," said Jane Rutherford, a professor at the DePaul College of Law in Chicago. "Frequently, the wealthy party is the male."
But studies show that when women can come up with the money to litigate, they come out better financially, Professor Rutherford said. This is one reason some divorce lawyers and women's groups dislike mediation, she said.
Another is that there is "a tremendous problem with emotional and physical power in mediation," she said. "Women back down because they are afraid, and mediators won't necessarily take control." And women are generally less willing than men to be confrontational, she said. 
For just those reasons, measures to require mediation in divorce cases have gone nowhere in Albany, Assemblywoman Weinstein said. And there has been little willingness to require parent education programs because they could intimidate women into agreeing to custody and other provisions that are inappropriate, she said.
But mediation has its supporters, as well as a growing number of practitioners like June Jacobson, a lawyer and psychotherapist who is the president of the Family and Divorce Mediation Council of Greater New York. Children in particular are hurt by the fighting that comes with litigation, she said.
"Most women who try mediation are satisfied with the results," Ms. Jacobson said. "And the process of mediation does acknowledge that there are goals other than financial ones."
Although the lawmakers have been reluctant to tinker with divorce, the judiciary has not. The chief judge of New York State, Judith S. Kaye, has ordered a variety of revisions, including pilot programs for parental education in cases where custody is an issue, and help from social workers on custody and visiting issues.
Perhaps most significant, administrative changes have reduced the time it takes for a divorce case to wind its way through the courts. In 1993, the average case dragged on for 2 years and 4 months. Last year, the average case brought just over 10 months of legal agony.
But it is possible to move too quickly, said Seymour J. Reisman, a divorce lawyer who represents many wealthy clients. "You've got to be careful with that," Mr. Reisman said. "There is a real push to keep moving these cases, but the parties aren't necessarily ready for that."
One partner may be in a rush, he said, but the other is often shocked by the breakup. "They have to be emotionally ready to deal with these issues," he said, "and that takes time."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island; 
7 Homes Planned at Former Estate Held by College

BYLINE:  By DIANA SHAMAN

DATELINE: BROOKVILLE 

 BODY:
FRONTING on busy Northern Boulevard east of Glen Cove Road is one of Long Island's still intact Gold Coast estates -- 101 acres of rolling fields and woods with a magnificent Georgian-style mansion designed by the architectural firm of Carrere & Hastings for Alfred I. du Pont, a one-time head of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, the chemical company.
 The house, known as White Eagle when it was built in 1917, has undergone some extensions and alterations, but its architecture has basically been maintained. Purchased in 1972 by the New York Institute of Technology, whose Old Westbury campus is next door, and renamed the de Seversky Conference Center, the ornate 41,000-square-foot mansion has been used for the college's culinary arts and hospitality management programs, for conferences and for other college functions. It is occasionally rented out for weddings and seminars, and weekday lunches prepared by culinary arts students are open to the public. 
 The Russian-born Alexander P. de Seversky, who died in 1974, was an aviator, inventor and founder of the Seversky Aircraft Corporation. As a trustee of the college, he was instrumental in the acquisition of the mansion. 
But the college had little use for some of the expansive grounds. A heavily wooded area extends to the south of the mansion. To the north, the land undulates toward Northern Boulevard in a series of meadows, while another heavily wooded section borders the property to the east. Formal gardens surround the house, which also overlooks a serene 15-acre pond.
Now the school, after three years of what its president, Edward Guiliano, called "a very amiable give and take" with village officials, has developed a subdivision plan that would allow it to retain the section of the property it needs for college functions and to dispose of the rest, with the proceeds to go into its endowment fund.
Under the proposal to which the village gave preliminary approvals on April 2, a 44.5-acre parcel will remain with the house, and the remaining 56.5 acres will be split into seven residential lots. The plan now awaits final approvals by the Board of Zoning and Appeals and by the Planning Board. 
The college already has a developer under contract to buy its surplus acreage, with a closing to take place as soon as the final approvals are in place. The purchaser, Daniel H. Serota, is vice president of construction at Serota Properties in Valley Stream, a commercial development group owned by his father, Nathan. He is developing the new subdivision, to be called Dupont Estates, under his own name. Mr. Serota said he already held signed contracts for five of the seven lots, and the other two contracts are out for signing. Closings are to take place as soon as he takes title to the land. 
One 21-acre lot will be at the wooded southerly end of the property abutting the college and the Old Westbury Golf and Country Club. Any further subdivision of the lot, on which a single home is to be built, is permanently barred. The remaining lots, which range in size from 4.85 to 6.33 acres, will be in the northeast section of the property, with the houses secluded in woods. A 150-foot-wide buffer area along Northern Boulevard will be placed under a conservation easement to insure that the pastoral vistas from the road will be preserved. The area bordering the college campus on the east will be protected by a 100-foot-wide easement.
The mansion will have its own access road from the college's campus. The new houses will be entered from Northern Boulevard through an iron gate. Their private road will be maintained by a homeowner's association.
"We have been working on this since about 1997 because when we recognized the real estate market was good we wanted to take our noncampus properties and convert them to our investment portfolio," Dr. Guiliano said.
UNDER the property's five-acre residential zoning, there could have been more home sites, but such a design would have detracted from the overall objective, which was to minimize the impact of new development on the mansion.
"Nothing will change," Dr. Guiliano noted. "We will have a nicer entrance because we will drive right up to the main face of the building. We retain the pond, all the landscaping and the specimen trees around the building itself. The lots are at least five acres so we won't see the houses. The parking lots remain, and the function and usage of the building remain 100 percent the same. It's a spectacular division, and we are thrilled because we are getting everything we wanted, and better." 
Richard P. Goodwin, the mayor of the village of Brookville, was also enthusiastic. "It's a gorgeous piece of property," he said, "and the village is happy that the university, which owns the property, will hold the de Seversky Center, which is a beautiful building, intact and not squish it on a small piece of land."
Mr. Serota, the developer, declined to disclose the purchase price of the land he is buying -- as did college officials -- but he said he made his offer three years ago as soon as he heard the land was on the market. 
Despite the slowing economy, he had no trouble finding buyers for what, depending on their size and accouterments, will be multimillion-dollar houses, he said. All the would-be buyers came through word of mouth and not from advertisements, he added. The location in the highly regarded Jericho School District helped draw families with children, he added.
The purchaser of the 21-acre lot -- Mr. Serota identified him only as the owner of a leading retail company -- will build his own house and has filed preliminary drawings with the village indicating that the house will be about 25,000 square feet in size. 
The remaining houses will be built by Mr. Serota. The architect will be Angelo F. Corva & Associates of Manhasset. No specific plans have been drawn. One thing is certain, though: the houses will have classic lines, reflecting the architecture of the mansion. "Everyone wants to have homes that look as if they had been here 30 years," Mr. Serota said.
This was not the first time the New York Institute of Technology had its Brookville property on the market. In 1991, Canon USA, the camera and electronics company, was willing to pay the college $15 million for the entire 101-acre property for which it proposed a 600,000-square-foot headquarters building occupying only five acres of the site. The company intended to refurbish the mansion and use it for corporate offices. But a rezoning application was denied by the village.
Residents overwhelmingly rejected the idea, fearing that the increased traffic that the expected 1,800 workers would bring, would urbanize their area. There are 640 homes in the 3.5-square-mile village.
Mayor Goodwin, who has been mayor for nine years and was recently re-elected for another four-year term, was among those who opposed the Canon project. "Villages are in business for one reason only," he said, "and that is to protect their zoning. People come to these kinds of areas for that reason. We don't want to turn this into an urban area." 
The du Pont property was one of several palatial estates that sprang up in Old Westbury and Brookville at the turn of the last century and that subsequently found useful lives as college campuses, no doubt saving them from subdivision because of the expense of their upkeep.
The nearby Old Westbury campus of the New York Institute of Technology, which the college purchased in 1964, once belonged to Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, son of the sculptor Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, who founded the Whitney Museum of American Art. The college owns the Whitney stables and outbuildings and a 30-room house modeled after a French chateau. The former main Whitney residence is now the clubhouse of the Old Westbury Golf and Country Club.
A half mile east on Northern Boulevard in the village of Brookville is C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University on approximately 300 acres of which 128 acres and a 59-room Tudor mansion once belonged to Marjorie Merriweather Post, daughter of Charles William Post, founder of the Post Cereal Company, for whom the college is named. The school later purchased the adjoining E. F. Hutton estate, which also had a grand mansion.
The Gatsby feeling that these surviving estates evoke will not be compromised by the new Dupont Estates subdivision, Mayor Goodwin said. "The planning board of the village worked extremely hard with the owners to make sure everyone was happy at the end of the day," he said. "The product will be beautiful when it's finished."

HEADLINE: PORTFOLIOS, ETC.; 
A Weaker Dollar Could Help the U.S. (and Europe)

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
MERCK, McDonald's and Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing provide reminders of how the strong dollar is making matters worse for American investors by eating into sales and earnings. 
 The dollar took three percentage points off the sales growth of Merck's five key drugs in the second quarter. McDonald's operating income in Asia was cut by 12 percentage points. 3M's profit was reduced by 7 cents a share. 
 Looking abroad, the CAC-40 index in France is down 16 percent so far this year in euros but off 22 percent in dollars, a reminder of how Americans investing abroad have been hurt by the dollar's strength. Based on a broad, trade-weighted index, the dollar was 7.2 percent higher in the second quarter than it was a year earlier. 
A strong dollar cuts into earnings by dulling a company's competitive edge overseas and through the reduction of profits earned abroad when they are translated back into dollars. This translation is also deepening the foreign stock market losses for Americans.
All of this makes the dollar's recent slide against the euro something to note. Since reaching a 2001 high on July 5, the dollar had fallen 4.6 percent against the euro by Friday.
Whether this is a trend is hard to tell. The euro has rallied many times since its birth in 1999, only to fall again. Because it has been a currency that disappoints, analysts and traders who once had positive opinions of it have since sworn off it.
But there is growing pressure from exporters in the United States and finance officials abroad for a weaker dollar. That would help American exporters by making their products more price-competitive abroad. It would also help some domestic sales, because foreign imports now have a price advantage. If a weaker dollar helped the American economy rebound, it could be the engine that pulls Europe and other regions out of the doldrums.
Anne Mills, senior foreign economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company, is willing to go only this far out on the forecasting limb: the average value of the dollar against the euro is likely to be lower over the next six months than it was for the last six months.
The European Central Bank could help the dollar's recent slide become a trend by cutting its benchmark interest rate this summer. The Federal Reserve could also put downward pressure on the dollar. Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company, expects a weak economy in the second half of the year to force the Fed to push its benchmark rate, now at 3.75 percent, even lower. Such a move, he said, would weaken the dollar.
But the Bush administration's management of the strong-dollar policy it inherited from President Bill Clinton may be more important to the outlook. The administration says it still supports a strong dollar. But some analysts, like Ms. Mills, saw an opening when President Bush said recently that markets should set exchange rates.
This does not mean that the Bush administration would say it wants a weaker dollar. That would probably send the dollar plunging, which would not be beneficial. But if the dollar is taken lower by "the markets," and if the administration can say the dollar is still strong when it has slipped to 1.05 euros, from 1.14 at the end of last week, there could be a change without a change.
IF the dollar does weaken, it would be quite a break. Thomas Doerflinger, an investment strategist at UBS Warburg, said the firm's dollar index, weighted for sales by American subsidiaries in foreign countries instead of by overall trade, had increased in each of the last 23 quarters.
Based on UBS Warburg forecasts, he is not confident that the dollar will weaken enough against a broad range of currencies to improve the outlook for earnings soon. While the dollar is slipping against the euro, it is staying robust against the Japanese yen and has risen sharply against the currencies of some emerging-markets countries. "The pressure on earnings now is not worse than it was in the fourth quarter," he said. "But it's not getting better."

HEADLINE: SILICON VALLEY ROUND TABLE; 
So, Technology Pros, What Comes After the Fall?

BYLINE:  By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI

 BODY:
THE American economy may or may not be in a recession -- but the information technology industry surely is, with no sign of an upturn. Lately, Silicon Valley, fabled for its invention, its can-do mentality and its dot-com fever, is looking a lot less fabled.
 For two hours last Monday, four veterans of the valley -- Craig R. Barrett, the chief executive of Intel; Judith L. Estrin, a serial entrepreneur who is now chief executive of Packet Design Inc.; Mitchell E. Kertzman, the chief executive of Liberate Technologies; and Eric E. Schmidt, chairman of Novell and Google, -- met at the Garden Court Hotel in Palo Alto to discuss the state of the high-tech world. Asking the questions of these executives, who sit on the boards of eight other companies, all told, were John Markoff, Matt Richtel and Judith H. Dobrzynski of The Times. 
 Overcapacity -- and its probable longevity -- was on their minds. So were intellectual property issues, the lack of interest in technology among American students and the lack of interest in innovation in the valley, frustration with Wall Street analysts and pop-up ads on the Web, even their inability to get broadband in their homes. 
Following are excerpts from the conversation. JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI

Q. What's the mood in Silicon Valley? When do you think you might get out of this downturn?

BARRETT -- I'm more concerned about synchronous world recessions than I am in what's exactly happening in Silicon Valley or the U.S., even. The economy's relatively weak, obviously, in the U.S., in the high-tech sector. It's weak in Europe. It's actually pretty strong in Latin America. It's strong in the emerging Asian economies -- India, China, for example. Over all, we're all operating at one plateau level down from where we were six to nine months ago.

KERTZMAN -- Booms, big booms, are really followed by very small slowdowns. Many of us are taking out our old "what do you do in a down business cycle" chops and managing our businesses that way as opposed to, "Oh my God, this is the end of the world."

ESTRIN -- I think that the past five years was the anomaly, not now. A set of very real technology issues -- PC's, cellular, the Internet -- that should cause a boom, coupled with overreaction and kind of overexuberance, and then throw the Y2K buying on top of it. What we're seeing now is somewhat a normal overreaction to overreaction on the other side.
The reason this is so hard is because the technology industry is such a young industry -- you have so many managers, technologists, analysts, spectators, press that have never seen anything else. Their careers started in that 10 years as technology became it. And so now everybody's like, "Oh my God," because they haven't seen anything else.

SCHMIDT -- Things may actually be worse than we're saying. You had this enormous overbuild that occurred in telecommunications, which was largely vendor-financed. You have all of the issues around PC market saturation in certain key markets. You have Windows XP as the next great white hope there. You have these incredible physicists who work at Intel who continue to build new processors, faster and faster. And the value proposition isn't necessarily there for the whole solution -- the next "killer app" has not yet evolved.
On top of that you had the Internet, which is the world's biggest opportunity to hype something because everyone could see that it was transformative. So you have this enormous overbuilding, which will take a fairly long time to overcome. It's overbuilding at the software level, at the systems level, at the infrastructure level, at the fiber optic level. Meanwhile, the technology continues to get better. I think the slowdown could be quite a bit longer than all of us would like it to be. 

BARRETT -- We have this tremendous overbuild but none of us can get broadband to our home.

ESTRIN -- Typically, when you're in a time like we are now, what gets you out of it is some new technology, some real breakthrough that is not incremental. We have a lot of work to do on the Internet. If you look at the next three to five years, it is good incremental, but it is incremental progress. It's not the cell phone where the cell phone didn't exist. It's not PC's where PC's didn't exist.

SCHMIDT -- I know what it was. Unfortunately, it was Napster. Napster went from zero to 50 million users in six months. If that's not a killer app, I haven't seen one recently. Unfortunately, it happened to have this mild problem that it was illegal. So it shows you that there at least was a path, unfortunately an illegal path.

ESTRIN -- Too much was done over the last five years without thinking about business models and thinking about making money. And the problem with Napster is the same problem with too much of the initial push into the last mile. There was no business model for doing it.

Q. Are you concerned about the studies that suggest that people who don't use the Internet see no use for it, or that if the adoption of the Internet matches that of the TV, it's going to be 30 years before a lot of people get the Internet?

BARRETT -- Some very interesting studies comprised of 4 percent of the world's population. They always forget about the other 96 percent outside of the United States.

ESTRIN -- I think that we have hit a limit that we need to break through based on making things easier to use. If it's one thing the valley is famous for, it is we take it only so far in terms of how easy it is to use the technology -- whether it's search, whether it is the seamlessness of mail and how you get access to it and how hard it is as you travel around and do things. I'd still call this incremental. But I think these are things that help with standard growth.

Q. Who's doing a good job at helping ease of use?

KERTZMAN -- It happens in a variety of ways. Look at Eric's area, which is search. Before Google, most people had assumed that search had about reached its limits with the variety of search engines that were available. I run into people like my mother-in-law who refer to Google as search -- and the reason is that when they put in the search, the results are better. Therefore it's easier to use because you don't now have to navigate a whole result set out of that. So Google is a great case of a huge leap forward in ease of use that had nothing to do with the way people see and use it, but everything to do with the computer science on the back end.

Q. But hasn't the PC desktop been frozen for a long time? Isn't that a candidate for innovation?

ESTRIN -- That's why you see the whole movement toward network appliances.

Q. How much of a quantum leap would it be to have you be able to tell in voice your --

SCHMIDT -- The issue with voice is that it's essentially an artificial-intelligence problem, because voice recognition is at some level ambiguous. The easiest way to test that is to get one of these cars that has "dial your cell phone using your voice while you're driving." And you'll play with this for about 30 seconds and then you'll go back to using the keypad.
There's been a lot of discussion about the state of the PC user interface and the fact that it's derived from the WIMP interface -- Windows, icons, menus and pulldowns. And it is 25 years old -- the underlying ideas. But it's been extended in many ways. And it's a very robust platform from the standpoint of economics and where people are going and so forth. 
I don't think it's reasonable to predict at this point that there will be a significant challenge to the way people use desktop computers for quite some time. I think that the ease-of-use challenges will come from completely new areas.
My current favorite is movies. The technology exists. The user interface technology exists. The caching device exists. The home connection exists. Well, partly, because the content's not on the Net yet. I can't find a movie that's not stolen on the Internet that I want to watch on my PC.

ESTRIN -- But that's because we haven't solved the intellectual-property question.

KERTZMAN -- This is completely an intellectual-property problem and not a technology problem.

SCHMIDT -- But my point here is that it's traditional to beat on Windows in particular and the PC in general. I don't think that's where this huge orthogonal new user interface question's going to resolve. I think it's going to come out in some kind of a device that uses multimedia and Internet and content and communication in a new way.

BARRETT -- You can criticize the Windows-based PC all you want, but there are 150 million of them sold each year. And there's all sorts of trivial cool things you can do -- the instantly available PC today which allows you to just put it to sleep like a TV set. It pulls three watts and it turns on within three seconds right where you were six months later, in the middle of a Word document or something like that. It's kind of what the user wants.
You can basically get the operating system off the disk and put in some different type of memory if you want the thing to boot in a few seconds when you turn it on and not hear that hard disk spin. And it's all that instant-on, instant-off type of stuff that consumer electronics -- things you can do. 
But I don't think there's going to be a major change in that interface. It gets challenged. Interactive TV was going to kill it four or five years ago. There's not a whole lot of interactive out today. The network PC was going to kill it three or four years ago. Find one today. Mobile handsets were going to kill it in the last two years. Look at what's happening to the 3G rollout. 

KERTZMAN -- I would raise the point, for better or for worse, in terms of innovation, having a single company with what has now, at least by a court of appeals, been judged to be a monopoly on that particular technology. I think you are less likely to see innovation. Let's just say that, even as it is, it's terrific.

BARRETT -- No, Bill took a lie detector test, self-administered, and said Microsoft is totally committed to innovation.

ESTRIN -- There's a much more immediate issue that has to do with ease of access and seamlessness. There are places where it just takes a computer scientist to figure out how you do something. The valley is based on innovation, or used to be based on innovation, and needs to get back to innovation again -- technology innovation.
What happened over the last couple of years is the valley lost its association with being the place where you were in love with technology and innovation and became the place where you are in love with getting rich, based on whatever scheme you could come up with.

SCHMIDT -- There are a whole bunch of people graduating from Berkeley and Stanford who are busy trying to form technology-centric, new innovation companies. There are more small companies with clever new ideas to take advantage of this infrastructure that is defined, as Craig put it, with the PC as the starting access point and the interconnection that spans the world. So the cycle has not stopped. We're just at a trough.

Q. If you're an entrepreneur today and you're thinking about business models in the content area, how do you think about intellectual property? Does your model presuppose that information is free?

KERTZMAN -- You'd have to assume that "free" does not equal "high quality" in a more Darwinian economic environment. And if you're thinking about a content-based business, you need to create great original content that people will pay for in some form or another, or if you're going to redistribute content it means you probably need to add value somewhere to the content's creator.

Q. But could the advertising model still work?

KERTZMAN -- We are certainly seeing an overreaction to the damning of all advertising and the value of all advertising on the Internet. We're going through a particularly nasty little business of pop-up ads -- but are pop-up ads, being annoyed by them, any different from "ring around the collar" in Wisk commercials? Annoying advertising has its place in the pantheon of advertising. And, by the way, it seems to work.

ESTRIN -- Not everything can be paid for by advertising. So there have to be different models. And people have to be smarter about thinking about ads and what's effective where and how you pay for things, the same way they do in print or on TV.

Q. What do you tell 40 million kids who know how to turn a product into data that they can trade freely?

ESTRIN -- You teach them some values. You can walk into any store and steal something, and kids don't do it. We've got to bring up a generation that understands that if you steal a movie over the Net, and it is "Pearl Harbor," that is stealing.

KERTZMAN -- You've got to make it easier to do something legally than it is to do it illegally.

BARRETT -- I'd be aghast if we assumed that recent college graduates took the attitude that they had during college and carried that through their full professional life, moral life, social life, any other life that they have. Values change; attitudes change. And this whole concept of intellectual-property creation and then being able to protect content or intellectual property is key. If you don't have the ability to protect that which you create, society falls apart.

Q. Is this going to work itself out without the need for new laws?

SCHMIDT -- I think the laws are sufficient when enforced, at least in Western-world countries. There are issues around third-world countries. And people are lobbying in the right ways there.
There needs to be some form of protocol or standard way in which one sells and markets technology. There is an enormous demand for all-you-can-eat subscription services for proprietary intellectual property. People are tired of having 500 accounts which charge them $5 a month for this source and that source. There will be aggregators who will appear, whether it's the Lexis-Nexis type aggregator that we saw over the last 20 years or something new. You need a stronger notion of identity and you need these aggregators to put it all together. And you need an economic model which may be subscription, may be advertising or may be some third way that sort of funds everybody. 
The problem is, while what I've said is pretty obvious if you think about it, none of the actors are behaving in a systemic way. So the industry is in collision because each company has a model that is under attack, either because there isn't a protocol or because of thievery. 
And my guess is we'll end up with lots of pressure on the intellectual-property producers to use some common system. In addition, we're going to see pressure on their business models. And then we're going to have a certain percentage of people who are illegally stealing. And that's what happened, if you look at the software industry 10 years ago. There was some percentage of people who would take the floppies and copy them. But most people didn't. And the model kind of worked. And that's a viable model for all of us.

ESTRIN -- Also, there is some technology needed here to allow the enforcement -- to make it easy enough to do the protection so that in the end you don't steal, or the business doesn't grow. We're not quite there yet. The technology industry and the entertainment industry have to engage together to solve this.

Q. What about Washington? What is your biggest policy concern?

BARRETT -- Education. We talk a lot about the whole concept of the Internet being free and protecting intellectual property and all that. It would probably help -- this may be a minority opinion here -- but the government's preoccupation with not putting taxes on Internet transactions kind of gives the wrong message in this whole direction as well.
There are big regulatory efforts, problems associated with broadband for the last mile. Whether you talk cable or specially twisted copper D.S.L. connectivity, I think the biggest deterrent happens to be government regulation and the lack of people wanting to take the chance to invest money in that space, if in fact they can have a reasonably high probability of return. And the regulatory things work in the wrong direction there. But I would have put education on a plateau three levels ahead of everything else.

ESTRIN -- We, as an industry, have to be very careful in immediately jumping to the conclusion that it's up to the government to solve these problems for us.
But one of the things that really concerns me is the lack of Americans going into sustaining our industry. We have a problem of people who are growing up in America choosing not to go into technology and not being excited by technology. People often ask me, "Well, why aren't there more women in technology?" That's a problem, but there are not enough American men in technology, either. And to me, that goes back to our educational system and how we're bringing up our kids.

SCHMIDT -- The Bush budget, as currently proposed, significantly decreases on a per capita basis the spending for non-health-care-related research. And a tremendous amount of money has gone into medical and other. That's a problem because a number of us, certainly myself, got here because we were funded on, essentially, government grants.
If you look at the number of computer science graduates that have been produced in the last five-ish years, the absolute number is not growing; in many cases it's declining. It's actually a huge crisis brewing. This could be relatively easily solved by a relatively small amount of money increased in basic research funding for nonmedical-related research. 
The second thing is that there's clearly going to be pressure around privacy legislation of some kind. A lot of people are worried that the privacy legislation will end up being written by a large number of lobbyists from all the different sides, and it will not end up looking like whatever outcome people really think it should. 
If you look, the last time we went through this was with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which was essentially a war between the intellectual-property people in the broadcast industry, media industries and high tech, and it sort of became this weird compromise that people are working on.
So all of us, I think, have Mitchell's view, which is let's approach any legislation here very slowly.

Q. Help us understand the distinction between resources and culture when it comes to raising a generation of people interested in the hard sciences. Is it a function of money that is put into these things or of not glorifying the practice of scientists?

ESTRIN -- Some of it is cultural, and I think that the last couple of years made it worse because you had a whole generation of people thinking that you don't need to go to college to succeed.
And so the notion of a computer scientist and a programmer blurred, and there is a difference. And so we have a whole generation of people who think putting up a Web site is being a computer scientist. I have nothing against people who program well, but there are different talents.

BARRETT -- Go back to any kind of independent international test of kids graduating from high school in the United States. They're destroyed, on average, by the time they get to the 12th grade in terms of math and science capability. We are systematically taking young kids who at fourth grade do pretty well on an international basis, by the 12th grade do horribly. So there's an infrastructure issue.
The root issue, probably, is we do not do a good job teaching and getting kids interested in math and science. You go through the statistics in terms of qualified teachers in that area, for math and science, and especially in the inner-city area, you only have a probably slightly less than 50 percent chance of getting a math teacher who's taken a math course.

Q. Are there limits to growth in Silicon Valley? How close are we?

SCHMIDT -- I'm waiting for what I would call the mark to market. We've had this sort of price collapse in the stock market and commercial real estate has dropped very, very dramatically. However, salaries of key people have not fallen. A lot of data says the salaries are going up. And furthermore, housing prices, though not growing, have not fallen dramatically.
There's a lot of discussion about people leaving the Bay Area, but certainly the key highways, 101 and 280, are still full of all those dot-commers, I guess looking for jobs. Because they haven't left.
From a quality-of-life perspective, it's pretty clear to me that this area is going to remain a mecca. I don't see that this has somehow become a less desirable place in any fundamental way.

BARRETT -- It's always fun to throw a little data into these discussions. The demographics of the valley are interesting. Most projections show that the job growth rate is probably going to be five times the single-housing-unit growth rate, which suggests that A, traffic is going to get worse and B, that long term the price of real estate is never going to come down; it's a supply-and-demand issue. That's just a fact of life in the valley and you have to live with it.

Q. I wanted to bring up the venture capitalists because, well, they've had a pretty bad year.

BARRETT -- Come on. Down 8 percent?

Q. But they're holding back on funding. What are the implications?

SCHMIDT -- I could argue that there's a scenario that says there will be very few public liquidity events, relatively few, for the next two to three years because so many of them occurred in the last two years. If you assume a constant rate of company formation by smart people, and assume that it takes five years to get a good company, and assume that all those companies went public two years earlier, then maybe you have a drought.
And that drought may go on. I'd say there's a whole bunch of issues around second-level funding and initial public offerings , which are unresolved.

KERTZMAN -- There's still a lot of money in the funds that were raised over the past few years. There is an issue that's been recently addressed about a shortage of funds to do follow-on financings of the companies that didn't make it.
The whole approach is going to be different. We went through a period where valuations were a multiple of expenses rather than a multiple of profits, and that has changed.

BARRETT -- Good ideas will always find ready venture money. It would have to be a good idea with a good business plan with products and a future, not just an idea of how to use the Internet to do something.

ESTRIN -- I think one of the big challenges the technology industry has, and the valley has, is not enough seasoned management to cope with all of this.
We as an industry probably haven't invested enough of our energy, or couldn't because we were coping with that growth, in developing the next generation of management to be able to, in a balanced way, make some of these decisions. Coping with this type of market is a very different type of management skill than coping with a market that is growing. Both are hard. Growing and not losing control is hard, as is managing in a down market.

Q. How do you feel about the role of Wall Street analysts in taking stocks to unsustainable heights?

KERTZMAN -- Everybody in the chain had a role. I don't think you can single out the analysts. Shareholders had a role. People who didn't know due diligence, people who only listened to the analysts on CNBC.
But there's this thing that happened, which is relatively recent, of "price targets" being the analyst's job. When I started doing public companies, price targets were not what they did. They would do earnings estimates, but not price targets. And they would do primary diligence, meaning they would talk to customers, they would look at the market. That certainly went away.

BARRETT -- I've never understood how 90 percent of the companies could do better than average.
The other aspect is, quite frankly -- and probably Intel's no different than a lot of other big companies -- we've lost some of our investor relations people to go become industry experts overnight. These are people that have been there for two years and never been through a downturn, never been through a real product cycle. All of a sudden they're out broadcasting to the industry as experts on the semiconductor, computer industry, what have you. 
They're not held accountable in the same fashion that they're holding management accountable. We make projections. We miss our projections, we get hung out to dry. They make projections and they revise them the next day. And no one goes back and tracks, really, the accuracy of their projections.

Q. Analysts say that they don't put "sell" recommendations on stocks because companies then deny them access. Do you deny them access?

SCHMIDT -- The answer is no.

BARRETT -- Dead no.

Q. Do you deny them investment banking business if they put out a "sell" recommendation?

SCHMIDT -- The answer's also no.

BARRETT -- These are fallacious --

SCHMIDT -- They're just false. And they're offensive. They are made in the industry and they need to be refuted. Companies are highly, highly regulated on how they operate for all sorts of good legal reasons. And the modern-day C.E.O. is so highly constrained on what he or she can or cannot do precisely for that reason. It's a red herring.
What I always worry about is when the business seems to be about marketing to its shareholders rather than to its customers. And having now gone through this a couple of times on a personal basis, and I've certainly borne my responsibility for talking about the Internet and its phenomena and so forth, so I share a responsibility as well, I hope we go back to a model where the product that we're selling is the product that the company makes, whatever it is, as opposed to the C.E.O., the brand, the executives, the shareholders, whatever. Because ultimately the stock price -- I learned this sort of the hard way -- the stock price is the tail of the dog.

Q. Is there any topic that you're dying to say something about?

SCHMIDT -- Everyone always focuses on the short term and not the longer term. And I think a lot of what we discussed has really been over the next two years. It's very difficult in our industry to predict more than two to three years.
If you just do the physics math, if you assume that the current rate of innovation at Intel and the necessary fiber optic companies, etc., roughly continues at its current rate, we're going to be in an extraordinarily interesting place 5 or 10 years from now. There will be a last-mile problem, but it will be "my megabit connection doesn't connect fast enough to my 10-megabit connection." And "my Pentium 5 or 6 or 7, which is operating at 10 gigahertz, is not fast enough to do ray tracing simulations in real time so my kid's game can't play."
Google went from 30 million pages to 1.3 billion in two and a half years, which is a 110-mile-high stack of paper. In 12 years that 110-mile-high stack of paper will fit on a single hard drive in your shirt pocket.
So in the context of how are we doing, as an industry, I think the real story is that the rate of innovation has not at a fundamental level slowed. The fundamental activities that we're talking about, the drive, the fundamental things, are not in any dire straits. If you project out a 5- or a 10-year period, I view it as very positive. It's certainly very different.

BARRETT -- I have every confidence that the numbers Eric is throwing out will happen. They're kind of in the labs already, so we're on that track. But if there's one thing that I think gets left out quite often in preoccupation with the dot-coms and the business-to-consumer aspect of the Internet, it's really what is happening internationally. The U.S. tends to be very, very U.S.-centric in its outlook toward the adoption of technology and where that world is going. And in a couple of years, maybe less than a couple of years in Europe, there'll be more Internet users in Asia, there'll be more Internet users than the U.S. in a couple of years.
It's important to look at what's happening from a worldwide perspective, and not just what happens here in Silicon Valley or what happens on Route 128 or wherever you happen to be in the U.S. We tend to look at ourselves and say: "Golly, it's 60 percent Internet penetration. It's all over, it's downhill from here." And you know, folks, it's just not the case.

HEADLINE: House Social-Security Bill Shows Trade-Offs for Bush 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28 

 BODY:
Offering a detailed look at what it might take to overhaul Social Security, two influential members of Congress have developed a proposal that would achieve President Bush's goal of creating investment accounts for all workers -- but at the cost of substantial cuts in guaranteed benefits.
 The proposal, which will be introduced as legislation in the House, largely tracks the general approach set out by Mr. Bush when he established a commission this spring to develop a specific plan for him. The commission is just beginning to work on its plan. 
 While it is impossible to know what Mr. Bush's plan will look like, the new Congressional plan is a window into the painful trade-offs the president and his commission will face. Its authors said they hoped that putting a detailed plan on the table would help Mr. Bush in his effort to transform Social Security, a goal that is among the most ambitious and politically divisive on the administration's agenda. 
Since the presidential campaign last year, Mr. Bush has promoted the benefits of allowing workers to invest part of their payroll taxes in stocks and bonds. But he has avoided specifying how he would pay for the transition to the investment accounts, or saying what other measures he would back to ensure that Social Security can pay promised benefits to the 76 million baby boomers after they retire in coming decades.
The authors of the Congressional proposal, Representatives Jim Kolbe, Republican of Arizona, and Charles W. Stenholm, Democrat of Texas, are among the leading supporters in the House of putting personal accounts at the heart of efforts to overhaul Social Security.
But the two lawmakers said personal accounts alone would not solve the problem. To pay for the accounts and to put the system on sound footing, they said they would propose reducing the guaranteed benefit, especially for middle- and upper-income workers, increasing the level of earnings subject to the Social Security payroll tax and reducing cost-of-living adjustments. 
The plan would also accelerate the current schedule for raising the retirement age to 67 from 65, and it would reduce annual benefits further in line with any future increases in life expectancy.
The plan would also divert some tax revenues away from Medicare, worsening the already weak financial condition of that program.
Mr. Kolbe and Mr. Stenholm said the proceeds from the investment accounts would at least make up for the cuts in the guaranteed benefit. Moreover, they said, the system would avert the certainty of even bigger benefit cuts and huge tax increases if nothing is done.
To offset some of the proposal's painful measures, the plan would provide benefit increases to low-income workers, and would match part of any money invested by people with low incomes in their personal accounts.
But even with the sweeteners, Mr. Kolbe and Mr. Stenholm said they knew their plan would attract intense criticism. Mr. Stenholm said he and Mr. Kolbe were like canaries being sent into a mine shaft for Mr. Bush and other advocates of changing the system, putting themselves on the line to gauge what the two parties were willing and able to do.
"If we survive, maybe others will venture into the subject," Mr. Stenholm said.
Most of the changes would be phased in so that they would not affect anyone currently receiving retirement benefits or within a decade of retirement.
Critics of Mr. Bush's approach said the Kolbe-Stenholm bill showed that the administration would find it nearly impossible to come up with a politically acceptable plan that includes private accounts -- at least without relying heavily on general tax revenues to pay part of the bill, a step the White House has made clear it would be loath to take.
"The combination of the lack of general revenues and the diversion of financing into individual accounts creates unbearable pressure on the rest of the program," said Peter R. Orszag, a former Clinton administration economist who is an authority on Social Security. "What this plan illustrates is the difficulty of fashioning a politically viable Social Security reform proposal without using any non-Social Security revenue."
Charles P. Blahous, the staff director of the Bush commission, said the panel would look at every constructive proposal made by members of Congress or other people with an interest in the subject.
"The most important aspect of the Kolbe-Stenholm proposal is that it's a bipartisan collaboration, and we're trying to build a bipartisan atmosphere," Mr. Blahous said.
Social Security is taking in more through payroll taxes than it needs to pay benefits. But that situation will change rapidly starting in about 15 years as the bulk of Americans born between 1946 and 1964 retire. 
By 2016, under current projections, Social Security will need to draw on its holdings of government bonds to pay benefits. By 2038, the bonds will be exhausted, leaving the system capable of paying only about 72 percent of promised benefits.
Most Republicans in Congress support the idea of private accounts, but they have been reluctant to back any plan that requires benefit cuts or tax increases. Most Democrats -- Mr. Stenholm is an exception -- oppose private accounts, saying that they do nothing to solve the system's problems and introduce risk into what should be a guarantee against poverty in old age.
With the problem still years away, neither party has made a serious push so far to address the issue. Whether Mr. Bush has the clout to push a plan through Congress next year, a midterm election year, is the subject of much debate among both Democrats and Republicans.
Mr. Kolbe and Mr. Stenholm have been pushing versions of their plan for several years but have generated little overt support in Congress. The significance of their bill lies less in its prospects for passage, which are slim, than in their willingness to prepare the public on Mr. Bush's behalf for the tough choices that were obscured by both sides when the issue was last aired, during the presidential campaign.
"We have to acknowledge that there isn't a fix to this problem that doesn't include spinach along with the ice cream," Mr. Kolbe said. 
At the heart of the Kolbe-Stenholm plan is a mandatory personal investment account for all workers covered by Social Security. The plan would direct into an account 3 percent of the first $10,000 in earnings, and 2 percent of additional earnings up to the maximum subject to the payroll tax, which this year is $80,400. 
A worker making $10,000 a year would place $300 a year into the account. A worker making $80,400 or more would place $1,708 in the account each year.
The proposal would allow additional voluntary contributions up to $5,000 a year. To help low-income workers build up their assets more quickly, the plan would provide a partial government match for their voluntary contributions.
According to preliminary calculations by the Social Security Administration, the Kolbe-Stenholm plan would reduce the guaranteed benefit for the average worker in 2020 to 81 percent of what it would be under current law. 
For people earning above the maximum annual amount subject to the payroll tax -- $80,400 this year -- the guaranteed benefit would be around 75 percent of the benefit under current law. But low-income workers would do as well or better under the Kolbe-Stenholm proposal than under current law, the projections show, even without including the proceeds from the private account.
The plan would also impose a tax increase on upper-income workers by increasing the maximum amount of income subject to the payroll tax, an amount that already rises each year with inflation. If the plan were to take effect next year, the earnings ceiling for 2002 would increase to $90,800 from an estimated $84,900 if the law is not changed.
To save money, the proposal would reduce cost-of-living adjustments, initially by one-third of a percentage point below the inflation rate assumed by Social Security's trustees and then by adopting a new inflation index being developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The new index is expected to show that inflation is persistently lower than current measures show.
To reflect increases in longevity, the proposal would move up by a decade, to 2011, the year at which 67 would become the normal age at which retirees could claim full benefits. The early retirement age would remain 62.

Stenholm (pg. 19) Chart/Photos: "DETAILS -- A Plan to Privatize Social Security"Here are the main provisions of legislation to be introduced in the House on Tuesday by Representatives Jim Kolbe, Republican of Arizona, and Charles W. Stenholm, Democrat of Texas. INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTSPart of the payroll tax levied on all workers and their employers would be directed in personal investment accounts -- 3 percent of the first $10,000 in earnings and then 2 percent of additional earnings, up to the maximum that is subject to the payroll tax ($80,400 this year). ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONSWorkers could choose to place up to $5,000 in additional money into the account each year. For low-income workers, the government would match a part of those contributions. TAX INCREASEThe plan would increase the maximum earnings subject to payroll taxes, effectively raising taxes on high-income people. BENEFIT CUTSBased on calculations by Social Security, the plan would reduce the guaranteed benefit for the average worker to 81 percent of the benefit under current law by 2020. The combination of the guaranteed benefit and the proceeds of the private account would be at least as much as the current-law benefit. COST-Of-LIVING INCREASESThe plan would cut cost-of-living allowances by a third of a percentage point each year. RETIREMENT AGEThe plan would move up by a decade, to 2011, the year in which 67 would become the normal age at which retirees could claim full benefits.

HEADLINE: American Embroiled in British Subway Debate 

BYLINE:  By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 28 

 BODY:
The tourism-minded British government customarily offers American visitors a warm reception. But all it has shown Robert R. Kiley, the American mass transit expert hired by London's mayor to restore its crumbling subway system, is a cold shoulder.
 Prime Minister Tony Blair's government fired him 10 days ago from a job it had given him just 10 weeks earlier. And it obtained an emergency court injunction to keep him from releasing consultants' reports exposing serious flaws in its own plan for the London Underground. 
 But the Yankee-Go-Home tactics did not work in Mr. Kiley's case because he still had his original job as Mayor Ken Livingstone's transportation chief, not to mention the overwhelming support of London's harried straphangers. 
Hundreds of them showed up this week outside the Royal Courts of Justice with "London Loves Kiley" signs as he and Mr. Livingstone took on the government in a High Court challenge to the Underground proposal.
What is at issue is a complex $18.5 billion partial privatization arrangement that the government wants to put in place. The plan, which had little input from people experienced in running trains, was put forward by the British Treasury and its powerful chief, the chancellor of the exchequer, Gordon Brown, as a way of transferring risk from the public purse to the private sector.
The government already eyed Mr. Kiley suspiciously on his arrival last fall because his sponsor, Mr. Livingstone, is a reviled figure at 10 Downing Street. As leader of the Greater London Council in the 1980's, Mr. Livingstone represented a theatrical brand of populist politics that the current Labor government blames for making the party unelectable for nearly 20 years.
Mr. Kiley, 65, is credited with rescuing rapid transit networks in Boston and New York and he consequently was a popular choice among Londoners, who put the dilapidated state of their once-celebrated Tube at the top of their lists of complaints about their congested city.
The government plan would transfer tracks, signals and stations to three privately owned companies on 30-year contracts while leaving operation of the trains to the publicly run London Underground. Mr. Kiley bluntly pronounced the arrangement "fatally flawed" and "dumb" and said it would compromise safety -- a loaded charge in Britain, which has experienced a series of fatal rail crashes in recent years. 
Mr. Kiley said the government proposal would replicate the fragmented structure of the privatized British rail system, which is notorious with the British public as the most expensive, hazardous and inefficient in Europe. He proposed a substitute that he said would save money and speed improvement through a unified management structure. He said such a structure was the norm in all successful transit systems and necessary for guaranteeing safety. 
Mr. Kiley's stance gained such a following in London that Mr. Blair foresaw political damage to Labor members of Parliament in the June 7 national election. So he installed Mr. Kiley as the man in charge of the government's Underground plan, an assignment that quieted the dispute during the campaign season. 
On July 18, Mr. Kiley was scheduled to give the government the results of two consultants' studies that called into serious question the financing and the safety guarantees of its plan. But before he could do so, Mr. Blair ousted him and obtained a court gag order to keep him from going public with the findings. 
In this week's High Court case, Mr. Livingstone and Mr. Kiley argued that the government plan would prevent the mayor from delivering a "safe, economic, integrated and efficient" rail network as the 1999 act that created his office said. 
The government's handling of the matter has been criticized on a broad front. "Those who think this is a purely local matter should beware," said Simon Jenkins of The Times of London. "Nowhere in the recent history of British politics can I find anything so ham-fisted."
The stated purpose of Mr. Blair's first term was to cede power to local decision makers, as shown in the "devolution" project that created legislatures in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and the first elected mayor of London. The battle of the Tube puts in question whether the government will be willing to cede any more powers. Mr. Livingstone's campaign for mayor was based on his opposition to the government's Tube privatization plan and he beat the Labor candidate supporting it by a 3-to-1 margin.
The struggle now looms as a test of Mr. Blair's second-term priority -- restoring Britain's battered public services. 
It has also attracted intense political interest because of its identification with Mr. Brown, the man whose power in the British government is second only to Mr. Blair's and, in the eyes of some commentators, equal.
Mr. Brown has refused to meet Mr. Kiley, but evidence emerged this week that the backlash was affecting him. Aides of his put out word to a disbelieving press that the proposal wasn't his at all. "He treated it like it was some sort of diseased thing he had nothing to do with," Mr. Kiley said gleefully. 
Justice Jeremy Sullivan rules this week. Mr. Kiley said that win or lose, he was staying.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 31, 2001

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Sunday about the efforts of an American transportation expert, Robert R. Kiley, to reorganize London's subway system referred incorrectly in some copies to a pending court ruling. A High Court judge ruled yesterday that the British government had the right to impose its plan. The ruling did not concern an injunction barring the release of critical studies by consultants. Details appear today in the World Briefing column, on Page A10.

And Then There Were 9: A Shrinking Credit Club

BYLINE:  By Jeff Sommer 

 BODY:
Increased competition and a greater willingness to take on debt have cost all but a handful of of American companies their triple-A credit ratings, according to Moody's Investors Service.
 Only nine companies in the United States now receive the top, triple-A rating, down from 22 a decade ago and 58 in the late 1970's. And only four of the top-rated companies of 1979 -- Merck, Bristol-Myers (now Bristol-Myers Squibb), General Electric, Exxon and Mobil (now Exxon Mobil) -- still make the grade today, said Kamalesh Rao, a Moody's economist. 
 "Companies over the last 20 years have found a higher necessity to leverage balance sheets," Mr. Rao said. "Back in the 1970's companies placed a certain value in keeping a pristine balance sheet. But the business environment has become much too competitive for that and they have to take risks."
The other five companies with triple-A ratings, according to Moody's, are Berkshire Hathaway, American International Group, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and United Parcel Service.
Among the companies to lose that rating in recent years, Moody's said, are International Business Machines and Sears, Roebuck.
Only 6.2 percent of debt in the $2.6 trillion investment-grade corporate bond market carries the top rating, down from 10.2 percent in 1990 and 25 percent in 1979, the agency said.
While a triple-A rating brings lower borrowing costs and a certain prestige, many companies now prefer to take on debt to increase their return on equity. Utility companies once routinely received top ratings, Mr. Rao said, but none does so today. Jeff Sommer

HEADLINE: Vanishing Wetlands of the Musical Sort 

BYLINE:  By NEIL STRAUSS 

 BODY:
Peter Shapiro knew the life of the club he owns, Wetlands, was drawing to an end when he saw scaffolding and other signs of urban renewal slowly working their way northward along Hudson Street in TriBeCa. Last week the construction frenzy finally reached the doorstep of Wetlands, at the corner of Laight Street, and the office building that houses it was sold to an architect and a group of local residents who want to convert the space into apartments. The club, which was on a short-term lease, is to announce today that it will be closing in mid-September. For music fans, already reeling from the loss of a number of clubs in a city whose administration is seen as hostile to night life, the shuttering of Wetlands, which opened in 1989, is a major blow. 
 "They called the other day to say they were closing their doors, and I was devastated," said Marc Brownstein, the bass player in the electronica-fueled jam band the Disco Biscuits. "I've been going to the club since its opening, when I was in high school, to see this band called the Authority. I was so amazed. It seemed like the biggest, most prestigious venue in the country. When I got a band, our only goal in life was to play Wetlands." 
 Nowadays the Disco Biscuits perform at far bigger clubs, like Irving Plaza and Roseland, but they and scores of other bands credit Wetlands, which holds 500 people, with nurturing them to national success. The club remains best known as ground zero for post-Grateful Dead jam bands, and the place that kick-started Blues Traveler, the Spin Doctors, Phish, the Dave Matthews Band, Joan Osborne, and Hootie and the Blowfish. To concertgoers, the name Wetlands evokes not just a room and a sound system, but a wide-reaching genre of semi-improvisational music and a dedicated audience of neo-hippies, who are often at the club as late as 5 a.m., watching the explorations taking place onstage.
For many of these late-night revelers, Wetlands is a way of life. Joe Sarkis figures he has attended more than 900 shows at the club. "It was my home," said Mr. Sarkis, known in the live-music world as Concert Joe. He is best known for trying to get in the Guinness Book of World Records for attending the most live-music shows in a single year (though Guinness has yet to create such a category). When he hit his 1,000th show one year, Wetlands staff members prepared a ribbon outside, which Mr. Sarkis broke as he entered the club to introduce the night's performer, Jorma Kaukonen of Jefferson Airplane. "Most people get thrown out of a club," Mr. Sarkis said. "Wetlands is the only club that I ever got thrown into. They said that I had paid more than anyone else to enter the club, and I didn't have to pay anymore. I told them I was paying anyway, and two bouncers picked me up and threw me in. Wetlands was the only place that ever let me in for free."
In recent years the club has bred a new generation of jam bands, many of which dip deeper than their predecessors into eclectic musical styles, like bluegrass, electronica, funk and jazz. These bands include the Disco Biscuits, Moe, the New Deal, Lake Trout, Sound Tribe Sector Nine, Soulive, the Slip, Carl Denson, Deep Banana Blackout and String Cheese Incident. In addition to jam-rock, however, Wetlands attracted other genres and their cult followings, from hard-core rock to ska to hip-hop. Even Oasis, Pearl Jam, Sublime, Rage Against the Machine, the Wallflowers and Counting Crows all played their first New York shows there.
"People think of Wetlands as a new-hippie thing, but they did a lot of hip-hop too," said Richard Nichols, who manages the rap act Roots. "Other clubs are regimented and corporate, and Wetlands was way more free-flowing and relaxed. It was actually one of the best sounding rooms in the city."
Peter Moore, the architect who engineered the purchase of the building, said he was trying to help the club find a new home, perhaps alongside a youth hostel that is being built in a nonresidential neighborhood. Speaking of the building's future residents, Mr. Moore said: "They weren't going to buy the building unless Wetlands left. They go out to clubs. They don't want to go to clubs within their own building."
In the ground-level corner of the building where Wetlands sits, an engineer who designs microscope parts plans to open an office. So, Mr. Moore said, the club has gone "from head banging to head examining."
Wetlands was opened in February 1989 by Larry Bloch, who returned to Manhattan after a decade in California to rear a family and, with no prior experience, start a club. For eight years he created a tightknit family of bands, fans, environmental advocates and loyal employees. In the mid-90's he announced that he was leaving the world of night life to spend more time with his son. 
He spent nearly two years searching for a successor willing to carry the environmental torch as well as maintain the musical legacy of Wetlands. He found Mr. Shapiro, a freshly matriculated Northwestern film student with absolutely no experience in running a bar or club. "I made it easy for Peter," said Mr. Bloch from his home in Brattleboro, Vt., where he owns an ecologically minded clothing store and activist center called Save the Corporations. "He was young and naive and idealistic. It seemed more likely that somebody young like him would have a chance to learn and become more aware of the environmental and social conscience issues. Most of the people wanted to buy the name and good will of Wetlands. They didn't want to commit to what he committed to." 
Among those commitments were to illuminate the club with only energy-efficient light bulbs; use recycled paper for business cards and stationery and in copy machines; allow groups like Greenpeace, Amnesty International and the Rainforest Action Network to meet and recruit at the club; and to have paid employees run the club's environmental center. Mr. Shapiro had only just made his final payment for the club this month when he discovered that he would have to close it. He said that he planned to bring back some of the bands that made Wetlands famous (and that Wetlands made famous) for a closing week blowout. Afterward, Mr. Shapiro; the club's booker, Jake Szufnarowski; and longtime manager, Charley Ryan, will be looking for a new Manhattan space, which they hope will house a bigger and better Wetlands.
But as any promoter can tell you, with resistance from community boards and city licensing authorities, opening a club in Manhattan is a challenge. "It's a drag," said the guitarist Warren Haynes, a club regular who has performed there with Gov't Mule and the Allman Brothers Band. "It was such a friendly atmosphere, and we loved playing there. I'm going to hate to see it go."

HEADLINE: 3 Oil Producers Pledge to Take 'Any Measure' for Price Stability 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: GENEVA, July 29 

 BODY:
Oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico agreed today to take "any measure needed" to ensure a stable international oil market.
 "The ministers agreed to continue monitoring market fundamentals and adopt any measure needed, in a timely matter, to ensure a stable and adequately supplied oil market," a statement issued after their meeting said. 
 Venezuela's oil minister, Alvaro Silva Calderon, met here with Ali al-Naimi, the oil minister for Saudi Arabia, and Ernesto Martens Rebolledo, his Mexican counterpart, as part of an effort to persuade countries that are not members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce production to increase oil prices. 
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico, which is not a member of OPEC, have consulted on oil policy since 1998, helping to raise prices from about $10 a barrel in December of that year to the current level in the United States of around $27. They are among the top five suppliers to the United States, the biggest oil consumer.
OPEC agreed last week to cut daily supplies as of Sept. 1 by one million barrels, or 4.1 percent, after its oil price benchmark fell 13 percent from June 1 to July 24, as inventories rose and an economic slowdown curbed demand. 
Mexico said last week that it would reduce its exports by 70,000 barrels a day next month.
The ministers said OPEC's decision was timely, "given the slowdown of the world economy and its effect on market fundamentals," the statement said.
"Over the past few months, demand has continued to fall while supply has been rising," the statement said. "The market has shown signs of entering a new cycle of instability, which has warranted this timely action."
Among other non-OPEC producers, Oman and Russia have offered support for OPEC's cuts this year, though they have not announced any specific measures of their own.
OPEC has already cut output twice this year. Mexico did not participate, saying it was concerned higher prices would damage the global economy and lower demand for Mexican exports like cars.

Unmasking The Poor

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The poor are pretty well hidden from everyone except each other in the United States. You won't find them in the same neighborhoods or the same schools as the well-to-do. They're not on television, except for the local crime-casts. And they've vanished from the nation's political discussion.
 Hiding the poor has been quite a trick, because there are still millions upon millions of them out here. And despite all the rosy scenarios we've been fed -- the end of welfare as we know it, rising tides lifting everybody's yachts -- they're not doing very well at all. 
 This has been made clear in a new report from the Economic Policy Institute in Washington and in Barbara Ehrenreich's latest book, "Nickel and Dimed."
Ms. Ehrenreich spent the better part of two years trying to survive on jobs that paid $6 or $7 an hour. It wasn't pretty. She worked in Florida, Maine and Minnesota in jobs that included waitress, hotel maid, cleaning woman, nursing-home aide and Wal-Mart sales clerk.
She tried valiantly. She lived in a trailer park in Key West, Fla., and stayed, briefly, in a hideous motel room in Minnesota that was "pretty much open to anyone's view or to anything that might drift in from the highway."
She ate cereal, chopped meat, kidney beans and noodles. And she listened to the ghastly stories that are common to poverty, like that of the roofer who lost his job because he missed too much time from work. It seems he had cut his foot and he "couldn't afford the prescribed antibiotic."
Ms. Ehrenreich did just about everything she could, but she was unable to make ends meet. "In Portland, Maine, I came closest to achieving a decent fit between income and expenses," she wrote, "but only because I worked seven days a week." And even in Portland, there was no margin for car trouble, a new pair of shoes, the loss of the few free meals she got at work, or any unexpected expense.
The only honest conclusion you can reach after reading Ms. Ehrenreich's book is that you can't make it in America on $6 or $7 an hour. Not if you're only working one job. And if you have children, you can't even come close to making it.
The biggest problem is housing. Affordable housing has gone the way of the double-feature movie and 30-cents-a-gallon gas. It is not uncommon for poor people to spend more than half their meager monthly incomes on housing.
"There are no secret economies that nourish the poor," Ms. Ehrenreich wrote. "On the contrary there are a host of special costs. If you can't put up the two months' rent you need to secure an apartment, you end up paying through the nose for a room by the week. If you have only a room, with a hot plate at best, you can't save by cooking up huge lentil stews that can be frozen for the week ahead. You eat fast food or the hot dogs and Styrofoam cups of soup that can be microwaved at a convenience store."
These kinds of economic struggles are much more widespread than most Americans realize. And they are by no means limited to the people we tend to categorize as poor. The report by the Economic Policy Institute, released last week at a briefing attended by Ms. Ehrenreich, flies in the face of the happy talk we've heard for so long about how well American families are doing. Many families, according to the report, earn too little to cover "basic necessities like food, housing, health care and child care."
The report said that over the course of a year, nearly a third of poor and working-class families with children under 12 -- many with two parents and incomes above the official poverty line -- faced at least one "critical hardship, such as missing meals, being evicted from their housing, having their utilities disconnected, doubling up on housing, or not having access to needed medical care."
These struggling families are not easily stereotyped. Many are white. Many are headed by workers with a high school education or better. Many of the parents are over the age of 30.
In the absence of policy changes designed to strengthen the social safety net and significantly boost wages, they will continue to struggle, and at times suffer. Because, as Heather Boushey, the lead author of the study, commented, "Work alone doesn't ensure a decent standard of living."

HEADLINE: What's Red and White And Made in New Jersey?; 
Wineries Boom, but Are Short on Respect

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: LANDISVILLE, N.J. 

 BODY:
Heard the one about the New Jersey chardonnay?
 Don't laugh. That's not meant to be yet another poke at the country's most mercilessly maligned state. Although some wine snobs might sniff at the mention of a Monmouth County merlot or a Cape May pinot noir, New Jersey now has 17 vineyards, some of which produce award-winning vintages that can proudly stand up to Sonoma Valley's finest. 
 Starting with just three vineyards in 1981, New Jersey's winemaking industry has been exploding in recent years, a result of liberalized wine production laws, attractive land prices and a growing realization that parts of the Garden State are surprisingly well suited to grape cultivation. Wine production in New Jersey is now a $1.5 billion-a-year business, and a half-dozen wineries are expected to open within the next couple of years. 
"Everywhere you turn, someone's growing grapes or opening a winery," said Charles Tomasello, whose family has been making wine in Hammonton since 1933. "It's become like an epidemic."
Kevin M. Atticks, a wine writer from Maryland, admits that he rolled his eyes several years ago when a stranger at a book signing stood up and started raving about New Jersey's cabernet sauvignons and chardonnays. But he drove up the turnpike to pop a few corks.
"I was really amazed," he said. "Who knew?" Mr. Atticks was so impressed, he published a guidebook, "Discovering New Jersey Wineries," last year.
Still, it's not easy being a Garden State riesling. Many winemakers here complain that their biggest challenge is beating back the stereotypical thinking and snipes that come even from those who live here. Although New Jersey wines are distributed in 12 states, less than 1 percent of the wine drunk in New Jersey is produced locally, said Thomas M. Sharko, president of the Garden State Wine Growers Association. 
"People just have a hard time equating wine with New Jersey," he said. "They hear New Jersey and they think of parkways, tolls, gambling in Atlantic City and 'The Sopranos.' "
Most winemakers in New Jersey say they have no problem selling out their stocks each year, but can't seem to get much respect. Terrence Meck, a spokesman for Wine Spectator, said the publication, based in Manhattan, had never written about New Jersey wines. "I didn't know they produced wine," he said with a blend of surprise and disdain.
Anthony Giglio, a food critic for New Jersey Monthly magazine and a wine critic for The Boston Globe, has sampled some of the state's offerings and found some great wines and some not so great. "We're not talking world-class wines," he said. "But on the other hand, Lutece buys New Jersey chardonnay."
To fight the ignorance and raise the industry's standards, New Jersey vintners have formed a marketing group to promote the increasing array of grape-stomping festivals and wine-tasting competitions.
In 1999, New Jersey became only the third state to vet its wines annually through an independent panel of experts. Although the process is voluntary, only wines that pass muster can display the Quality Wine Alliance seal on the label.
"These days," Mr. Atticks said, "if you go into a wine shop and blindly grab a California wine, your chances of getting something mildly unpleasant are greater than if you pick a wine from Jersey."
Although the Renault Winery in Egg Harbor City was started in 1864, the vast majority of the state's winemakers have been in business for only a decade or so. As any experienced vintner will explain, it takes many seasons to find the right grape for a particular soil and climate.
"It's basically trial and error, and you only get one try a year," said Rudy Marchesi, 51, a co-owner of Alba Vineyard in Milford. He planted his first row of Marechal Foch grapes in 1983. That crop and another of cabernet sauvignon were killed by a deep winter chill; others have been decimated by marauding deer. These days, the deer fencing is eight feet high, and Alba's wines are flowing in New York hot spots like Gramercy Tavern, Union Square Cafe and the Bubble Lounge in TriBeCa. Last year, Mr. Marchesi said, his winery sold out its entire stock of 90,000 bottles. "We'd like to be twice as big as we are now," he said.
The blossoming wine industry can be traced to the repeal of a Prohibition-era state law that limited the number of producers to one for every million people. That left the state with a handful of wineries, until 1981, when the Legislature eased the restrictions.
But the winemaking boomlet is not just a response to fewer bureaucratic obstacles; experts say it's also a matter of economics, romanticism and the growing realization that New Jersey has some ideal grape-growing geography, especially in the south, with its sandy earth and temperate winters.
And in a state where almost half the residents can trace their heritage to wine-loving Italy, it is not coincidental that many winemakers here are Italian-American. 
"It came down through the genes," said Jim Quarella, 42, a fourth-generation vegetable grower who in June opened Bellview Winery on his farm in Landisville, about 30 miles west of Atlantic City. "A lot of people down here have been making wine all their lives."
Compared with California wine country, New Jersey's agricultural land is a relative bargain, said Gary C. Pavlis, a viticulture specialist at Rutgers University's Cooperative Extension. Prime New Jersey farmland sells for $1,800 an acre, he said, compared with $50,000 an acre in the Napa Valley. His annual winemaking workshop, Grape Expectations, drew a dozen or so people during the 1980's. These days, as many as 100 people show up.
Then there are the gentlemen-farmers, the Wall Street brokers who cashed out and found a new calling. "I think part of it is farmers who see winemaking as more interesting and profitable than corn," Dr. Pavlis said. "But it's also people who did well with the economy and realized, 'Is this all I want to do with my life?' "
Winemaking offers the potential for greater profits than vegetable farming, although the initial investment -- $200,000 for those who already own farmland, to as much as a $1 million for newcomers -- is fairly steep. It also takes at least three years before newly planted vines will produce wine-quality fruit.
For Mr. Quarella and his wife, Nancy, winemaking was a lifelong dream that took 20 years to realize. They planted their first vines in 2000, and this year, they spent $150,000 to buy fermentation vats and convert a former garage into a tasting room and wine cellar.
Like most New Jersey wineries, theirs is a family business. Mrs. Quarella, 43, oversees tastings, designs the labels and helps with bottling operations. Two teenage sons spend much of their free time pruning and training the young vines.
"This is so much less stressful and less labor-intensive than vegetables," Mr. Quarella said, standing in the wine cellar where as a teenager he was taught how to make wine by his grandfather. "Vegetables can be backbreaking, and they're so perishable. I also love the fact that with winemaking, you control the whole process, from beginning to end."
Then there is the glamour factor, which was explained by the Quarellas' 18-year-old son, Lee, who said he might reconsider his plan to leave the family business after college. "Vegetables are not cool," he said. "Wine -- now that's cool."
Whether the Quarellas remain vintners may depend partly on wine drinkers like Sylvia Costanzo, 68, and Gabriel Risco, 77, retirees and siblings from New Jersey who usually pour a glass of red each evening when they sit down for dinner. On a recent afternoon, they stopped in at the Four Sisters Winery in Belvidere and stepped up to the tastings bar.
As he sampled glass after glass of vidal blanc, cherry Melissa and Leon Millot, a dry, full-bodied red, Mr. Risco, who used to be a boiler superintendent, recalled crushing grapes as a child with his Italian-born father. Oohs and aahs alternated with the sound of pouring liquid, all of it capped by the sound of a ringing cash register. The two of them carried out a half-dozen bottles, for prices ranging from $8.95 to $11.95.
Mr. Risco promised to come back. "To be honest, I usually buy jug wines and then put them in small bottles," he said, holding up a fruity goblet of chambourcin red. "But this stuff, I could get used to."

HEADLINE: CITY POLICE WORK LOSING ITS APPEAL AND ITS VETERANS 

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
Police departments in cities across the nation are facing what some call a personnel crisis, with the number of recruits at record lows, an increasing number of experienced officers turning down promotions to sergeant or lieutenant and many talented senior officers declining offers to become police chiefs, executive recruiters and police officials say.
 Making the situation worse, in some cities a growing number of police officers are quitting for higher-paying jobs in suburban departments or private businesses. 
 These problems have come at a time when crime is at its lowest levels since the late 1960's and the police should be feeling good about themselves. But, the experts say, many officers from the lowest to the highest rank are questioning their occupation, tempted by higher pay in the private sector after a decade-long economic boom and discouraged by seemingly constant public and news media criticism about police brutality and racial profiling.
"I would absolutely not take a job as a police chief," said John Diaz, an assistant police chief in Seattle, who at 44 already has a good national reputation and is sought after by recruiters for a chief's post. 
"The politics of being police chief have become so insane no one wants the job," said Mr. Diaz, who is particularly attractive to recruiters because he is Hispanic. "I work an 11-hour day, but our chief is here before me every day and doesn't leave until I'm gone, and all he gets is attacked in the media all the time."
The malaise felt by those from potential police recruits to chiefs "is a major crisis all over the country," said Cynthia Brown, the publisher of American Police Beat, the largest- circulation newspaper for law enforcement officers.
The difficulties are illustrated in her publication. Until a year ago, Ms. Brown said, she had never run an advertisement from a police department looking for recruits, because police forces could still find all the applicants they needed in their own communities. But in the current issue, there are advertisements for police recruits from a dozen cities, including Portland, Ore., and Seattle, and smaller cities like Santa Cruz, Calif., and Sheridan, Wyo. 
There has been little public attention to the police departments' troubles, but Jeremy Travis, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and a former deputy police commissioner in New York City, said, "If this was a business, we'd be in a panic mode."
There are no nationwide statistics on the problem. But figures from several cities show the magnitude of the drop in applicants for the police examination, the first step in becoming a police officer. In Chicago last year, 5,263 people signed up for the exam, despite months of recruiting at college campuses, military bases and churches throughout the Midwest, said Cmdr. Bill Powers, the head of the Chicago police personnel division. That is down from 10,290 people who signed up in 1997 and 36,211 applicants in 1991. Traditionally, only a tiny fraction of people who apply are eventually accepted, making a large applicant pool important.
In New York City, more than 1,700 officers left the 41,000-member force last year through retirement or resignation, a third more than the year before. The retirement rate is expected to accelerate, with concerns about morale and pay taking their toll and with a large portion of the force soon to complete 20 years of service, when officers can retire with a full pension.
The number of captains leaving the New York Police Department tripled in the 2000 fiscal year from the year before, and over the next four years, more than half of the force's 2,100 captains and lieutenants will be eligible to retire.
While the number of people signing up to take the test to become New York City police officers rose modestly this year over last year, the overall number of applicants has dropped sharply in recent years. In 1996, 32,000 people signed up. This year, 13,136 did. 
In Los Angeles, where the police have been buffeted by scandals since the Rodney King beating in 1991, there were only 19 recruits in the police academy class in June, a record low, said Amira Smith, an officer in the employment opportunity development division. When Ms. Smith joined the force four years ago, there were 70 recruits in her class, and not long before that there were 100 recruits per class. This month Los Angeles canceled the police academy because there were not enough recruits.
In Seattle, the police department is having trouble finding officers to take the sergeants' examination, and sergeants to take the exam for promotion to lieutenant. Only 86 officers took this year's sergeants' test, down from 134 in 1997, and only 10 sergeants took this year's exam for lieutenant, compared with 33 in 1997, department figures show. 
Many officers with seniority do not want to start over in a higher rank, risking having to work nights or weekends, officers say. And some sergeants do not want the promotion because lieutenants, unlike sergeants, do not get overtime pay. 
"There has been a big change in the culture of policing in the past few years, as lifestyle becomes more important than the sense of public service," said Carroll Buracker, the head of a management and consulting firm in Harrisonburg, Va., and a former police chief in Fairfax County, Va. Detectives in many police departments now work only from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, Mr. Buracker said, and therefore are unavailable to contact a victim when a crime occurs in the evening or over the weekend.
"So why would a detective want to give up that work schedule when they have a family," he asked, "in order to be a sergeant without seniority and face working nights and weekends?" 
To attract and retain officers, some police departments are resorting to even more radical changes in the work week that Mr. Buracker, among others, thinks undermine the goals of good policing. In Tacoma, Wash., all police officers work on Thursday, he said, so officers on a rotating basis can get six days off in a row, from Friday through Wednesday. The new mayor of Los Angeles, James K. Hahn, won the endorsement of the city's police union by promising to institute a three-day work week, with 12-hour shifts.
But if officers work only three days a week, Mr. Buracker said, they would often not be available to go to court, an essential duty in everything from settling traffic tickets to felony trials. And they might start making fewer arrests to avoid having to show up to testify, he said.
Attrition is a growing problem from New York to Los Angeles. In Detroit, where the police department is under a federal investigation for charges that the police routinely violate citizens' civil rights, 600 to 700 officers have resigned in the last five years, according to department figures, many to take better-paying jobs in suburban forces. In addition, more than 1,000 other officers have retired in the last five years, and 1,000 more are eligible to retire in the next two years, a large proportion of Detroit's 4,000-member department.
Low pay is often a factor. In Detroit, the starting salary for a police officer is $28,865; in Houston, it is $26,000. 
In Miami, the police department has only 883 officers, well below its authorized strength of 1,045 officers. "Because of the economy, people are not really interested in law enforcement as a career," said Sgt. David Ramras of the Miami police recruiting unit.
"We are not getting people coming out of the military," as police forces long did, Sergeant Ramras said. "It's easier for them to get a job working with computers making a lot more money, with evenings and weekends off." 
Sgt. John Rivera, the president of the Miami-Dade County Police Benevolent Association, offered another explanation. "This is increasingly becoming a more miserable job by the day," Sergeant Rivera said. It has not helped, he said, that the Miami police have been stung by accusations of abuse, corruption and cover-ups, and that the department is under investigation by federal prosecutors.
Most officers are good people, he said, "so to risk your life for increasingly ungrateful people isn't worth it." 
The hardest part of the problem to quantify is the number of highly qualified senior police executives who are passing up offers to become police chiefs, and as a result, the number of cities that are having to settle for their second or third choice. Among cities that have had difficulty recently are Denver, Ann Arbor, Mich., Riverside, Calif., and Prescott Valley, Ariz., some recruiters and chiefs said.
"We are down about 35 percent in the number of qualified candidates when we do chief searches now," said Jerry Oldani, president of the Oldani Group, a search firm in Bellevue, Wash.
"Up until five years ago, people broke their necks to be big city chiefs," Mr. Oldani said. "But now there are a lot of senior police officials who just don't want to be chief."
There are several reasons for this, said Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, an organization of police executives that does recruiting and training. Pay for police chiefs is relatively low -- from $70,000 to $150,000 -- so low that some officers or sergeants, with overtime, earn more than their bosses, Mr. Wexler said. 
Chiefs usually cannot take their retirement benefits with them from job to job, unlike many corporate executives, and they face hardships in relocating since cities do not offer the same help businesses do for their senior officers, Mr. Wexler said. Then there is the difficulty of going through a public examination by the local city council, or civilian advisory bodies, so an applicant's whole life can suddenly appear in the news media.
Moreover, Mr. Wexler said, "the expectations for chiefs are higher than ever, because of the new belief that chiefs can do something about reducing crime."
So for a mayor, picking a police chief "has become like drafting a star quarterback," Mr. Wexler said, "but with these expectations, there is danger, because you can't expect to get those crime drops forever."
"When people add up all these costs, it often isn't worth it to take a chief's job," Mr. Wexler said. 
In Seattle last year, when the city was looking for a new chief in the aftermath of the violent demonstrations at the World Trade Organization meeting, none of the assistant chiefs applied. 
Mr. Diaz was one of those assistant chiefs. "It's really odd, because the usual route is to want to get promoted and become the head," he said, "but being chief is a thankless job."
The eventual choice was Gil Kerlikowske, a former police commissioner in Buffalo. 
Last Sunday, Chief Kerlikowske went out for a run from police headquarters and came across a crowd surrounding a woman who had passed out -- from a heroin overdose, it turned out. The chief, in his jogging gear, stopped to give her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, then, when she began to breathe again, took her to the hospital. Later, Chief Kerlikowske had to go to the hospital himself, for hepatitis B shots. 
But on the evening news, Mr. Oldani said, the chief's good deed merited just a few seconds. The major item, he said, was about the police chase of a stolen car, which struck a pedestrian, and the criticism that the police were to blame for the injured pedestrian.
"It's a good example of what's wrong," Mr. Oldani said. "He was being a good cop, and that just got lost."

HEADLINE: Far From Mexico, Making a Place Like Home 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: EAST POINT, Ga., July 26 

 BODY:
Here, the Mexicans live in run-down apartment complexes rather than in small houses of sun-baked brick. They work in a factory casting toilets and sinks rather than fishing for tilapia in Chapala Lake. They practice soccer on a lush high school field rather than on a dusty pebble-strewn pitch.
 And yet, for Mexican immigrants who have moved here from the village of Ejido Modelo in the state of Jalisco, East Point feels much like home. In this city of 40,000 people, just under the flight paths of Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, former residents of Ejido Modelo have essentially recreated their old hometown by moving by the hundreds into a neighborhood of a few square blocks. 
 Neighbors there are now neighbors here, and the same holds true for classmates, co-workers and team members. Los Pumas, a local soccer team that recently won a prestigious regional tournament, consists almost entirely of Ejido Modelo natives. Half of the students in some classes at Oak Knoll Elementary School here were born in the village. Even a local youth gang, the Trece Locos, or 13 Crazies, recruits its members almost exclusively from Ejido Modelo families. 
"When I walk on the street, I see all of my people," said Sigifredo Rodriguez, 42, the first of 11 siblings to move from Ejido Modelo to the same two-block stretch of East Point. His younger brother, Daniel Rodriguez, 36, nodded in agreement. "Sometimes," he said, "I feel like I'm in my country."
It is not a new phenomenon. For more than a century, immigrants to America, particularly those from non-English-speaking countries, have settled close to one another, forming enclaves of familiarity in an alien culture.
But the practice has become particularly pronounced among Hispanic newcomers here in the South, where a huge wave of migration in the 1990's has created large pockets of Latino culture where there had once been none. 
Elsewhere in Georgia, for instance, nearly 100 natives of the small town of Janicho have settled in Gainesville, a poultry-processing center, while the carpet mills in Dalton are kept running by Mexicans from the state of Guanajuato.
"In many ways, history is repeating itself," said Nancy Foner, an anthropologist at the State University of New York at Purchase and the author of "From Ellis Island to JFK: New York's Two Great Waves of Immigration" (Yale University Press, 2000). "Like today, immigrants a hundred years ago often settled near their relatives and friends from their home communities -- in the same neighborhood and sometimes on the very same block. In New York's Little Italy a century ago, you might have found people from one small district clustered on one side of a city block while people from another district lived on the opposite side."
It is hard to know precisely how many natives of Ejido Modelo live in the apartment complexes and clapboard houses along East Point Avenue and its side streets. A safe figure, several residents say, would be 400, though some put the number at more than 1,000. Many are illegal immigrants, but a number of others have been here long enough to have qualified for the 1986 amnesty granted by the Reagan administration and to have become citizens.
Their pilgrimage began in 1984, several residents said, when a few men from the village heard of good jobs and reasonable rents here. The farm economy at home was stagnant at best, with pollution killing the fishing industry and irrigation made difficult by the draining of Chapala Lake by nearby plants. The pioneers gradually summoned wives and parents and children, and before long word had spread throughout Ejido Modelo that this town just south of Atlanta was a welcoming destination.
Last Saturday, two childhood friends from Ejido Modelo, Alfredo Fonseca and Carlos Rodriguez, sat in the stands at a middle school football field, sipping from cans of beer as they watched Los Pumas decimate a team of Salvadoran immigrants. In their younger, more agile days, the two men both played for the team.
Now they work as casters for Japanese-owned Toto USA Inc., making $13.50 an hour to pour clay into molds for toilets and sinks. Half of the 65 workers at the plant were born in Ejido Modelo, and supervisors say the bond among them has made for a productive, cooperative work force.
On the field, in the neighborhood and on the job, the men said, they have found comfort in being with their fellow villagers.
"We're feeling great because we've stayed together with our people, with our friends," Mr. Rodriguez, 32, said. "You have a feeling of security."
Mr. Fonseca, 35, said: "If you lose your job, you have someone to lean on. If you need money you can ask your friends. If you need a ride, if you need someone to take care of your child, someone will do it."
The men explained that the community gathers frequently to celebrate weddings, saints' days, soccer victories and quinceaneras, when girls pass into adulthood at the age of 15. 
"When someone's family member dies," Mr. Rodriguez explained, "we all get together and pool resources to send the body back to Ejido Modelo." 
Part of the Mexicans' comfort in East Point is racial. Three-quarters of the city's population is black, and some of the newcomers said they felt less hostility from black Americans than from whites. Several black neighbors said there had been no trouble between them and the Mexican community, and an East Point police captain, Patricia A. Boyce, said there had been few complaints other than occasional calls about loud music or public drunkenness.
The 2000 census found that 7.6 percent of East Point's population was Hispanic, almost all of it Mexican. Throughout metropolitan Atlanta, where the Hispanic population increased by 133 percent in the 1990's, Mexicans now form the foundation of trades like construction, landscaping and roofing. Signs in hardware stores, commercials on sports radio stations and automated messages on directory assistance lines now come in English and Spanish.
Along East Point Avenue, many apartments and houses sport tiny satellite dishes so that residents can receive up to 20 Spanish-language television channels, as opposed to the two available on conventional cable. Amplified mariachi music flows from open windows and from the booming stereos of passing trucks.
For blocks and blocks, Spanish can be heard under the shade trees and raised car hoods where Mexican men congregate. On steamy front porches, young mothers offer their toddlers bits of chocolate and strips of spiced pork while waiting for their husbands to return from construction sites and road-paving jobs. Children, the most bilingual members of the community, race scooters along the sidewalks and coast on bicycles with their feet propped nonchalantly on the handlebars.
Today, Maria Hernandez, a 58-year-old mother of 10 with an infectious laugh, was sitting in the un-air-conditioned kitchen of her apartment in Beverly Manor, grating onions with a knife into a large plastic bin. Ms. Hernandez would use them to spice the pork tacos that she sells from the apartment on the weekends to help her husband pay their $600 monthly rent. Back home in Ejido Modelo, she sold enchiladas and tostadas from a table in front of her house.
"When I am making my food here it reminds me of Mexico because you can't really compare the restaurant food," she said. "So it's like a real taste of Mexico. Even the blacks and whites around the neighborhood come by and say they are the best tacos they ever had." 
Just down the block is El Progreso, a small commercial mall distinguished by a brightly painted mural of the Virgin of Guadalupe. The teeming center, where pinatas hang from the ceiling, features a taqueria, a beauty parlor, a music store selling the latest Mexican releases, a money-changing booth and a market that sells a variety of merchandise, including tortillas and glittery crowns for the quinceaneras of neighborhood girls. A clinic advertises in Spanish that "we worry about your health, not your legal status."
The impact of the migration is just as clear in Ejido Modelo, a farming village that does not appear on many maps. 
The Mexicans here say the population of the village is being gradually depleted, though high birth rates have compensated somewhat for the loss. It is, they say, as if much of the town of about 3,000 people had simply been lifted from Jalisco and transplanted to Georgia.
"The town is getting abandoned," said Mr. Fonseca, who came here in 1988, "because everybody is coming here."
And yet Ejido Modelo has also benefited from the dollars sent home from East Point, helping farming families build houses of brick to replace those of adobe. At Christmastime, many of the transplants return to Ejido Modelo to visit relatives. Often the visitors will form a soccer team to challenge the locals. "Sometimes we win, sometimes they win," Mr. Fonseca said.
Similarly, it is common for people from Ejido Modelo to visit family members in East Point. Patricia Donan, who was cooking pork for her son at the end of a monthlong visit, said she was amazed at how many people she knew here.
"At least 50 percent of the population of Ejido Modelo has moved to East Point," Ms. Donan said. "Once you're accustomed to being here, you don't really miss your town because everybody from your town is here."

HEADLINE: City Homeownership Plans Lift Neighborhoods, Study Says 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
A survey of home sales in what were among the city's most desolate neighborhoods indicates that new construction and renovation of existing housing through city-subsidized programs that promote homeownership significantly increased property values on neighboring blocks.
 The study of more than 234,000 home sales was commissioned by the Fannie Mae Foundation, an affordable-housing advocacy group, and conducted by three New York University professors and a researcher for the United States Census Bureau. It focused on the two largest homeownership programs, the Nehemiah Plan and the New York City Housing Partnership. 
 "What New York really did differently was use housing policy to rebuild neighborhoods, and our study tests whether the programs it pioneered had that effect," said one of the study's authors, Michael Schill, director of the N.Y.U. Law School's Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy. "It sure looks like it did." 
Housing specialists praised the results of the study and pointed to its policy implications, including the fact that the resource that made the programs possible -- thousands of tax-foreclosed properties donated by the city -- has largely been used up.
According to the study, before a city-subsidized homeownership development was built, sale prices of homes within 500 feet of the intended project were, on average, 8.4 percent lower than those of comparable homes outside the 500-foot ring around the project, but within the same ZIP code. "That's because the city typically sited the projects in some of the city's most distressed neighborhoods," Professor Schill said. Within a year of a project's completion, the study found, the price gap narrowed to only 2 percent.
The study also found that the programs helped increase the sales value of homes more than 500 feet away, although the effect was not as great. Before construction, homes within 1,000 feet of a project site sold for 8.6 percent less than houses beyond 1,000 feet. After completion, that gap was reduced to 5.3 percent.
"But these estimates of the impact on nearby property values are actually quite conservative," Professor Schill said. Using a slightly different model, he said, the study's authors found that sale prices of houses within 500 feet of a soon-to-be-constructed project were 13.3 percent lower than prices outside 500 feet. "After construction, the gap closed by 11.4 percentage points, to only 1.9 percent." 
The study examined prices for more than 234,000 homes sold between 1980 and 2000 in 34 of the city's 59 community districts. The figures were adjusted for inflation, as well as for factors like the building's age, its square footage, whether it was single-family or multifamily, and whether it had commercial space. In addition to Professor Schill, the report's authors were Ingrid Gould Ellen and Amy Ellen Schwartz, both of N.Y.U.'s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, and Scott Susin of the Census Bureau. 
Under the Nehemiah and Housing Partnership programs, the city donates tax-foreclosed buildings and vacant land -- most often for $1 per lot -- then provides construction subsidies and noninterest-bearing mortgages. During the Koch, Dinkins and Giuliani administrations, the city has allocated more than $5.1 billion to rebuilding housing stock.
Jerilyn Perine, the city's commissioner of housing preservation and development, was understandably pleased by the study's findings. "It's terrific to have independent research corroborate the success of our programs," Ms. Perine said. "This is a very important way for poor families to build wealth. But we also do it to re-establish a functioning marketplace in the communities. Remember, these are neighborhoods that suffered abandonment and disinvestment, and were ravaged by crime."
Maria Rosado, who lives in a brownstone in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, two blocks from a 162-unit Housing Partnership project completed in 1997, needs no study to be convinced of the positive effects of the new three-story buildings with wrought-iron gates and rosebushes.
"It's been a blessing," Ms. Rosado said. "All that land was vacant for 20 years. People used to dump garbage there. Now you walk home from the subway and there are people on the street, kids playing, trees and flowers."
Housing specialists said the study demonstrated that the city's subsidies had been cost-effective, that the programs created homeowners with a stake in their communities and inspired neighbors outside the projects to improve their homes -- all of which, consequently, motivates banks to make more and larger mortgage and home improvement loans in the community.
The new and rehabilitated homes become the "comparables" upon which lenders base their calculations, said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the New York City Partnership and former president of its subsidiary, the Housing Partnership.
"I think the study is absolutely accurate in terms of documenting the positive impact of what was often the first privately financed homeownership housing built in these communities in 50 years," Ms. Wylde said. "I also think its estimates are very conservative because of our own experience with partnership homes often doubling in value within a period of three years."
Ms. Wylde cited a development of three-family homes built by the Housing Partnership in the South Bronx "that were valued at $180,000 in the early 90's and reached prices as high as $300,000 by the end of the 90's."
On Van Siclen Avenue between Belmont and Sutter Avenues in East New York, Brooklyn -- a community once labeled "the murder capital of the city" -- a 42-unit Nehemiah project was completed in May 1991. A year earlier, the study showed, a three-family walk-up within two blocks of the project sold for $68,000. Two years later, it sold again, for $137,000. 
The results of the study, said George W. McCarthy, a housing economist at the Ford Foundation, "are consistent with an emerging body of knowledge regarding the benefits of supported housing projects."
"There is the willingness of the people who live there to invest in their homes, and increased demand for housing from people who want to buy into these resurgent neighborhoods."
The homeownership projects range from scatter-site rehabilitation of derelict buildings to large-tract developments with hundreds of new homes. The study found, perhaps not surprisingly, that the larger projects tended to have a greater impact. Before a project with 1 to 50 units was built, prices within the 500-foot ring were 8.4 percent less than prices outside the ring. After construction, the price gap narrowed to 4.6 percent. For projects with 51 to 100 units, a 9.5-percentage-point jump in prices left them 1 percent higher within the ring than outside it. And for projects with 101 to 200 units, the jump was even greater -- 18.9 percentage points -- leaving prices within the ring 10.4 percent higher than those outside the ring.
Isaac Megbolugbe, vice president for research at the Fannie Mae Foundation, said the study was commissioned, in part, because the foundation wanted "to have a way of anticipating the impact of these kinds of investments so we can develop mechanisms to capture some of their value and address the problem of gentrification" prompted by the programs' success. 
"Then we can know," Dr. Megbolugbe continued, "where to provide more assistance to low-income households, to form projects that are permanently affordable in the neighborhood. We want to make sure that when the tide comes in, all boats are lifted."
The city has built or rehabilitated more than 20,000 units through the homeownership programs, with at least 5,000 more in the pipeline. But most tax-foreclosed buildings have already been transferred, according to a report by the city's Rent Guidelines Board this year. In 1985, the city held title to 10,376 residential buildings; by the end of the 2000 fiscal year, it held 2,917 buildings.
"We are still working off the inventory of buildings and land that was abandoned between 1970 and 1987," Commissioner Perine said. "But we have basically gotten to the end of the cycle of abandonment."
The city's housing department has already shifted to a strategy of preventing further abandonment, Ms. Perine said, "by intervening earlier when property owners are in trouble" and by changing its method of foreclosure on tax-delinquent properties through what it calls a third-party transfer program, which transfers title directly to "a new, responsible owner."
"We're not going to let these communities go through another cycle of abandonment and loss," the commissioner said.
Still, as Dr. McCarthy at the Ford Foundation said: "These large-scale developments require large tracts of inexpensive land, and they are being used up. I don't know what the city is going to do. That's the challenge."

Cable's Instinct For the Racy And Repetitive

BYLINE:  By JIM RUTENBERG 

 BODY:
July 17 was an uneventful day in the investigation into the disappearance of Chandra Ann Levy, the Washington intern.
 But on the Fox News Channel's "The Edge," Sylvia Browne, a psychic who does readings over the phone for $700, was closing in on the case. 
 "It's a marshy area," Ms. Browne said. "This is where the body is. This girl -- I am sorry to tell you this -- but this girl is not alive." 
On CNN, a panel assembled by Larry King scrutinized the facial expressions of Representative Gary A. Condit. 
"If somebody you knew was missing and no one knew what happened, why would you always be having this big grin on your face?" remarked Barbara Olson, a former federal prosecutor and now a lobbyist, alluding to recent pictures of Mr. Condit, a California Democrat, who is said by members of the missing intern's family to have had an affair with Ms. Levy.
Mr. King added: "Come on. It doesn't look good."
In the dual world of Condit-saturated television, there is, on one side, Dan Rather of CBS barely reporting the Levy case, on principle. On the other are the cable news networks, which seem to be talking about almost nothing else all day, even though the police say that Mr. Condit is not a suspect.
The cable networks seem to have ample motivation. With the racy story, they have significantly increased their share of the television audience in the last month. The combined average daily audience for CNN, the Fox News Channel and MSNBC is 40 percent larger than it was a year ago. In prime time, Fox and CNN have seen even larger increases, a period when they are estimated to draw up to 40 percent of their ad revenue -- no small matter in a bearish advertising market.
Dawn-to-dawn coverage of juicy stories is not new in cable news. Even so, the media flame beneath the Levy case seems unusually intense. It takes on an added dimension because coverage of the story is being played out against the backdrop of an increasingly visible struggle between Fox News and CNN for cable news supremacy.
Asked if the sheer volume of coverage does not all but convict Mr. Condit, cable executives say that it does not. They say that the Levy case is simply good television, with a compelling narrative and possible misdeeds by a federal official.
Their arguments involve the nature of the cable medium. Blanket coverage on cable TV, they say, has a different meaning than equivalent treatment in a newspaper, or even on network news. Cable's viewers are a rotating audience. They flit in and out. Repetitive coverage, they say, is warranted because the story needs to be on screen whenever the audience is ready to watch it.
Like the top news executives at MSNBC and Fox, Sid Bedingfield, executive vice president of the CNN domestic network, noted that his network is covering other news, too.
But critics say that the sheer repetition of speculation that Mr. Condit might have been involved in the Levy case creates irrevocable damage. While cable news audiences represent only about 3 percent of all people watching television at any particular moment, the cable television medium has a powerful ability to keep a story in play, even when developments are slight or nonexistent,
"The ruling vision for daily coverage on cable news is to find one story, two at the most, and give them wall-to-wall coverage," said Alex S. Jones, director of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. "And in this case, the story they've picked is one in which a person's reputation is being ground up to mincemeat on the presumption of guilt that the police don't support."
Yet there is an audience for the coverage. And it is a boon for cable networks in need of viewers to attract the advertising spending that remains in an economic slowdown.
In prime time, audiences have soared for Fox's "The Edge," led by Paula Zahn, CNN's "Larry King Live" and CNBC's "Geraldo Live" have all soared. Perhaps more significant, Fox News's prime-time line-up of talk shows is outdrawing that of CNN even though Fox is available in about 15 million fewer homes. For the month ended last Tuesday, the Fox News Channel's nightly schedule was watched, on average, by 683,000 people, more than twice as many as in the comparable period last year. CNN's prime-time audience increased 40 percent from the year before, to 662,000 people.
Some journalists at CNN have wondered if the network would be reporting so heavily on the Levy case if it were not under such intense competitive challenge from its cable rivals -- a theory that CNN management rejects.
But in their musings, these journalists acknowledge that CNN, long before the Levy case, has draped blankets of coverage over big breaking news events. (Remember O. J. Simpson, or JonBenet Ramsey?)
Some CNN journalists expressed distaste for the Levy case. Bob Franken, a Washington correspondent and the network's point man on the case, said that at first, he "raised hell about what I thought the quality of the story was."
"I thought that the story started based on innuendo," Mr. Franken said.
But he said he warmed to the idea of covering the case when the network told him that it indeed wanted to proceed carefully. "I was told, like it or not, this story has gained people's attention, and 'we want you because we want responsible coverage,' " he recalled.
At a CNN staff meeting, another correspondent, Jonathan Karl, questioned whether cable coverage of the Levy case was too heavy. But Walter Isaacson, the new CNN chairman, said he did not want his reporters and producers to "hold their noses" while reporting the case, several CNN staff members recalled.
In an interview, Mr. Isaacson said: "I told them it was a very interesting, fascinating story and we should be pursuing it vigorously."
But keeping the story going is easier said than done. Developments in the case have been scarce.
During a production meeting at Fox on Thursday, Ms. Zahn sat with the producers Bill Shine and Dave Brown, plotting out that night's show. "My challenge is to make sure that we are not redundant," she said.
The audience for Ms. Zahn's program has grown to 635,000, compared with 227,000 in the period a year earlier.
Even when new information is at a premium, she said, the case gives her plenty of issues and angles to pursue. "This is not a one-dimensional story," Ms. Zahn said. "Do politicians and celebrities get treated differently by the authorities? Was the D.C. police investigation compromised because it gets its funding from Congress? Where's the outrage from feminists who see this repeated pattern of the powerful having affairs, consensual relationships, with starry-eyed interns?" 
Ms. Zahn said she had been careful to stress that Mr. Condit is not a suspect. That is a common refrain in cable news these days. 
"We are making every effort, and I'm sure we fail from time to time, not to speculate," said Erik Sorenson, president and general manager of MSNBC.
By now, cable executives like Mr. Sorenson say they are getting tired of having to defend their coverage, especially from criticism by journalists who "have cable news channels on in their office all day -- they're the only ones who watch like that."
"Cable news channels dine on crisis, on major sustained stories," he said. "This is what we do. We find big stories and interesting stories and run with them."

TV Works in Mysterious Ways for Pat Robertson

BYLINE:  By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
Three years ago, the televangelist Pat Robertson turned his wrath on the city of Orlando and Disney World, which was hosting an event called "Gay Days."
 Mr. Robertson said tolerance of homosexual activity "could bring about earthquakes, tornadoes, and possibly a meteor." He warned Orlando, then festooned with flags marking the gay celebration: "You are right in the way of some serious hurricanes and I don't think I'd be waving those flags in God's face if I were you." 
 Now, in one of the most star-crossed alignments in the continually consolidating media universe, Mr. Robertson finds himself in business, if not quite in bed, with his old nemesis, the Walt Disney Company. Last week Disney agreed to spend $5.3 billion to acquire the Fox Family Channel -- a deal that came with an apparently ironclad commitment to continue carrying Mr. Robertson's daily talk show, "The 700 Club."
The deal creates a union of family-oriented media companies with almost nothing in common, and it would seem inevitably headed for rapid annulment. Certainly the Disney Company has every reason to seek a quick exit from the arrangement, not only for philosophical reasons but also because Mr. Robertson's show occupies several important sections of real estate -- 10 a.m. and 11 p.m. every weekday -- that Disney would prefer to fill with programs from its broadcast network, ABC.
Disney had made its attitude about "The 700 Club" clear back in 1997, when it made a bid to buy the Family Channel from Mr. Robertson, who then owned the channel. Disney stipulated at the time that "The 700 Club" be excluded from the deal. 
A senior executive who was close to those negotiations said that Disney bid $300 million more than Fox. But Mr. Robertson refused Disney's conditions, choosing to sell out to Fox for about $2 billion.
This time, desperate to acquire a secondary cable outlet for its expensive programs, Disney was willing to spend $3 billion more for "The Family Channel," knowing it was getting Mr. Robertson as an inextricable part of the deal.
Publicly Disney executives expressed no concern about the association with Mr. Robertson. But privately some acknowledge that they would like to rid themselves of "The 700 Club" -- perhaps even pay Mr. Robertson a huge fee, as much as $75 million, to sever his ties to the channel.
The problem is that the channel's mass exposure may be too valuable for Mr. Robertson to give up -- at any price.
"The guy has a deal that keeps him on the air in perpetuity," one senior Disney executive said. The executive described the deal as a series of five-year contracts renewable at Mr. Robertson's discretion.
A spokeswoman, Angell Watts, said Mr. Robertson would decline to comment himself. She denied the contention that he had a perpetual deal.
But the executive who followed the first negotiation said that Fox did agree to give Mr. Robertson a spot on the schedule in perpetuity.
The arrangement, whatever its terms, did not faze Fox; but Disney and Mr. Robertson have that fractious history between them.
"This is a totally bizarre marriage," said Barry W. Lynn, who as the executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, is a persistent critic of Mr. Robertson. "Robertson hates Disney," Mr. Lynn added.
That would clearly be far too strong a word for Mr. Robertson. In an official statement, the Christian Broadcasting Network, Mr. Robertson's flagship company, declared itself "optimistic about Disney acquiring Fox Family." The statement went on to praise Disney for its "tremendous library of family programs."
The words were in stark contrast to Mr. Robertson's previous denunciations of Disney, which also included a remark on a "700 Club" broadcast in September 1997: "Disney, which is the family organization, is becoming the family of homosexuality and anti-religious bigotry."
Michael D. Eisner, the Disney chairman, apparently let those episodes slip his mind when he said that Mr. Robertson had never been one of the members of the religious right who had criticized Disney. "He is not that far to the right," Mr. Eisner said.
There are many reasons for the cautious words of rapprochement on both sides: about 81 million of them. That is how many homes the Family Channel reaches, one of the highest totals in cable television. Disney sees the acquisition as crucial to the economic future of its television investments, headed by ABC.
ABC plans to use the channel for second airings of many of its shows, a way of getting more revenue for its programs. "Program costs are atrocious," a senior ABC executive said, adding that the plunge in the advertising market this spring "burst that bubble we'd all been living in for years."
But if the Family Channel is crucial to ABC's future, it is no less vital to Mr. Robertson. "The 700 Club," a mix of reports on news events, commentary, prayer and faith-healing, is his lifeline to the community of followers who have supported him, many with monthly donations of $20 and more, for 35 years.
Mr. Lynn said that Mr. Robertson "needs the show more than ever" after a series of business reverses. His most prominent political invention, the Christian Coalition, has been losing both membership and influence. In recent years he has struggled with businesses in such things as gold mines in Liberia, mud packs from the sea of Galilee, and an Internet banking site.
The latter was a promising partnership with the Bank of Scotland, but it led to explosive protests from investors over Mr. Robertson's political views. At one point he called Scotland a "rather dark land" and said, "In Scotland, you can't believe how strong the homosexuals are."
Later Mr. Robertson said his comments had been misconstrued by the liberal media, a point he also made after his remarks about hurricanes hitting Disney World. 
Of course, ABC News is often lumped into the liberal media mix by conservative critics. And ABC intends to use ABC News programming extensively on the Family Channel.
That may actually please Mr. Robertson, however. The executive who was privy to the original negotiations with Fox said that Mr. Robertson had objected to being surrounded in the Fox Family lineup by cartoons. "If he is led into or followed by news, that will make a lot more programming sense," the executive said.
ABC's best move, the executive said, might be to pay Mr. Robertson to give up the 11 p.m. version of the "700 Club" because that show kills any plan to build a late-night program lineup. "They should be able to live with the day-time version," he said.
They may have to. "I don't think we can make the programming environment so inhospitable that he'd walk away," the senior ABC executive said.
"I don't see an easy resolution," Mr. Lynn said. "I can't see anything Disney could offer him that would make him willing to give up that daily access on cable. And if they don't know this by now, then they really are in Fantasyland."

HEADLINE: New Software, New Scrutiny For Microsoft 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Three years ago, Microsoft was preparing to introduce a new version of its Windows operating system. The personal computer industry was eagerly awaiting the new offering. But federal and state antitrust regulators worried that Windows 98 would tighten Microsoft's grip on the computer industry and inhibit competition in ways they believed were illegal.
 The government faced a difficult choice: Sue to force Microsoft, the dominant company with the industry-standard operating system, to alter offending features of its product and risk unsettling a major industry, or stand aside, let the product be shipped and risk allowing a monopolist to march ahead unfettered? 
 Federal and state regulators are again considering legal action to force Microsoft to alter a new system, Windows XP, which tightly integrates Internet services like music, instant messaging and shopping into this basic operating system.
They face the same troubling alternatives as before. As Microsoft gets ready to ship Windows XP, antitrust regulators fear that the new operating system represents a rerun of the company's tried-and-true tactics -- some of which a federal appeals court agreed in June were illegal.
"No strategic decision" has been made on asking a court to block or force modifications to Windows XP, said one person involved in the discussions. 
If the federal government and states are going to move, it would likely be soon. Windows XP is scheduled to go on sale Oct. 25, but the "final" code will be shipped to personal computer makers for installing on machines in August, Microsoft says.
It is often forgotten that the Justice Department and a number of the states did take legal action to try to force Microsoft to alter the earlier Windows 98. When they filed their antitrust suit against Microsoft in May 1998 -- a month before Windows 98 went on sale -- the federal and state authorities also sought a preliminary order forcing Microsoft to change its new system. The judge hearing the case combined the antitrust case and the motion to alter Windows 98, allowing the software to be shipped without modification and on time. 
"It's the same situation as last time," said Andrew Gavil, a professor at Howard University law school in Washington. "The difference, though, is that now Microsoft has been found to be a monopoly and to have violated antitrust laws." 
Yet going to court could prove complicated and time-consuming. A preferred path, according to government officials, would be to prod Microsoft into settlement talks to modify certain planned features in Windows XP.
The prospect of that happening is uncertain. A preliminary meeting on settlement was held by representatives of the Justice Department, states and Microsoft last week, and the session, which was brief, dealt mainly with procedural matters. No settlement talks are now scheduled this week, a person close to the talks said yesterday.
The last time the Justice Department and states tried to force changes in Windows, the issues were Microsoft's bundling of Internet browsing software into the operating system and the company's contracts with PC manufacturers.
The 1998 filing sought to give Microsoft a series of options, such as removing its browsing software from Windows, or carrying a competitor's browser. Microsoft found all of the government's suggested options unpalatable. The Justice Department and states also requested that Microsoft bear most of the costs that the changes would have imposed on the computer industry.
Now, because of the antitrust ruling against Microsoft, the government and states think that "the bar has moved substantially" in their favor since 1998, according to one person involved in the antitrust case against the software maker. "At the time, there was a lot of uncertainty about how the legal arguments would play out," he said. "The legal issues are a lot clearer now."
But to force Microsoft to alter Windows XP and unbundle some features, a court would presumably have to find that the media playing, instant messaging and other software have some of the same characteristics as Internet browsing software and the Java programming language -- that similar features offered by competitors could weaken Microsoft's operating system monopoly.
While it has been found to have violated the nation's antitrust laws, Microsoft replies that the ruling against it should have no impact on its plans to ship Windows XP. The ruling, Microsoft says, focused in large part on its contracts with industry partners, and Microsoft recently gave personal computer makers greater flexibility in putting competitors' software on the Windows XP desktop.
The court decision did find, in a couple of respects, that the way Microsoft integrated its browser with Windows was illegal. But Microsoft is asking the appeals court, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to reconsider its finding that the company illegally blended, or "commingled," browsing and operating system codes.
The appeals panel vacated a ruling by the federal district court on "tying" new features to the operating system, and sent it down to a new district court judge to reconsider. The appeals judges also defined a standard for weighing competitive harm against consumer benefits in deciding whether a product-bundling decision of a monopolist, like Microsoft, should be permitted.
Microsoft says that the new features in Windows XP -- the media player, instant messaging, shopping and personal identification software -- would pass muster. Some rivals might suffer, in Microsoft's view, but users and the broad economy would benefit.
"Windows XP is a great product loaded with consumer innovations," said Vivek Varma, a spokesman for Microsoft. "And the entire PC industry is looking forward to the launch of Windows XP."
Should the government and states seek a court order to force Microsoft to modify the new operating system, the economic effect would be a consideration for the court. A federal judge would presumably weigh the likelihood that Windows XP violates the law, and the anticompetitive harm that would result from allowing Microsoft to proceed, against the economic harm that might result from forcing changes in Windows XP.
The personal computer industry, suffering through a downturn and laying off workers, is undoubtedly looking forward to the new operating system. "The PC industry wants any reason it can find to encourage people to buy more PC's," said Richard Shaffer, a principal of Technologic Partners, a consulting firm, "and Windows XP is seen as the best hope on the horizon."
Just how difficult it might be for Microsoft to alter its operating system in time to meet its release date, ensuring that there would be no disruption in the marketplace, is uncertain and a highly technical matter. 
"And Microsoft won't change unless it is absolutely forced to," Mr. Shaffer said.

Satellite Radio's Bet on Dissatisfied Listeners

BYLINE:  By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
After years of audience stability in radio, listeners are now impatiently switching off far more quickly than they used to. Listening has slipped 11 percent since the early 1990's, according to Arbitron audits.
 Critics blame the economics of corporate consolidation and the pressures on managers to take few risks and stick to programming that pleases advertisers by drawing the largest possible audience. Commercials now take up to a third of every hour. There is little room for niche formats like all-opera. 
 Two rival start-ups, XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. and Sirius Satellite Radio Inc., hope listeners -- especially motorists -- are dissatisfied enough with mainstream radio to pay for a 100-channel menu of varied music and talk.
The competing services will each offer a different array of mostly commercial-free music channels, with musicians and D.J.'s who are specialists in genres ranging from symphonic to Tejano music compiling the playlists and serving as hosts.
Each service will also offer an array of commercially sponsored news and information channels devoted to a particular subject like religion, comedy or theater. The nonmusical programming is obtained in alliances with established broadcasters and entertainment sources. Only some of the channels will be original content, like the programming developed by National Public Radio exclusively for Sirius.
By delivering a digital version of an old medium, XM and Sirius hold the promise for signals that never fade from coast to coast.
But succeeding will not be easy. To become profitable, each company says it needs four million subscribers by 2004. Doing so will require matching the growth of satellite television while creating programming with the originality of HBO, cable television's standout programmer.
Also, the business could start more slowly than anticipated if the radio receivers perform poorly or reception crackles in cities. "I think they have a real marketing challenge convincing people to spend $130 a year," said Paul-Jon McNealy, a Gartner Group analyst, who says satellite radio will shortly face competition for dashboard space from other broadband services.
Other analysts, though, are optimistic, forecasting higher profit margins in satellite radio than for cable or satellite television.
"This isn't a slam-dunk, but this is as close as you can get," said Michael Alpert, a Washington satellite consultant.
XM intends to charge subscribers $9.99 monthly, while Sirius will charge $12.95. In addition, customers will be required to buy new radios and receivers costing hundreds of dollars, although satellite-ready radios will become available in some new cars next year.
XM expects to start first, on Sept. 12, with broadcasts from its Washington-based studios to San Diego and the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The New York-based Sirius plans to start by year-end.
Each company expects to spend $100 million over the next 18 months on advertising to build brand awareness. Timed to coincide with holiday purchasing, XM's advertising campaign is to unfold in November featuring the artists Snoop Dogg, B. B. King and David Bowie. No doubt Sirius will counterattack with bragging rights over its alliances, which include Sting, M. C. Lyte and Grandmaster Flash.
The companies promise CD-level quality. To hear it, listeners must retrofit their cars with top-end $300 radios that are equipped to decode the satellite signal along with an antenna and a receiver that together cost about $240. An alternative is the $299 portable home-or-car model that connects through a cassette deck.
Satellite-receiving radios offered as a factory-installed option will first be available in some 2002 Cadillacs. Subscriptions are to be included in the car's financing from General Motors, which owns 12 percent of XM's stock. Sirius's partners, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler, will also offer vehicles equipped with comparable radios early in 2003, but both automakers declined to discuss any details. By 2004, car radios will be available that will receive either company's signal.
The primary audience is commuters and truckers. The companies hope consumers will be won over by programming atypical of commercial radio. At XM, that will include live concerts. At Sirius, music channels will include artist interviews, recordings of live performances and airplay beyond top-selling records.
"I knew what I didn't want," said David Margolese, the founder and chief executive of Sirius. His vow is to keep music channels commercial free. He also rebuffed investments from traditional radio broadcasters.
XM will permit commercials on only about half of its 71 music channels. "We feel there are channels that lend themselves to a commercial-free environment, like jazz and classical," said XM's chief executive, Hugh Panero.
Nine XM channels are to be programmed by Clear Channel Communications Inc., the nation's No. 1 owner of radio stations and the leading concert promoter, an XM investor.
The musical architects behind each company arrived at the same spot from different paths.
XM's programming chief, Lee Abrams, 48, a former programming consultant, has reshaped the formats of 200 stations and his work was widely copied and envied throughout the industry.
"We have to reinvent radio," he said. Part of his formula to draw fans is to hire leading figures as hosts, including Bill Mack, a late-night host well-known among truckers, and Wynton Marsalis, the jazz trumpeter.
Joseph S. Capobianco, 52, the programming chief at Sirius, also endured the nomadic career of a radio consultant. In 1991, though, he shaped programming at another start-up, Music Choice, which now provides music channels to 19 million cable television customers.
The biggest loser may be traditional radio, said Robert Unmacht, an independent media analyst. Growth expectations will come up short if XM and Sirius together win a 10 percent market share. "It's too much to lose," Mr. Unmacht said. "Wall Street will cream them."

HEADLINE: A Democratic Primary Is Primarily a Turf War 

BYLINE:  By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, July 29 

 BODY:
Democrats slightly outnumber Republicans in Pennsylvania, but Republicans have been more adept in recent years at winning elections. The state's governor, lieutenant governor and most cabinet members are Republicans, as are both United States senators and 11 of 21 House members. Republicans also control both houses of the Legislature.
 Yet Democrats figure that if precedent holds, next year will be their turn to elect a governor. Since the end of World War II, Democrats and Republicans have alternated control of the governor's office every eight years. And the current governor, Tom Ridge, is a Republican. 
 Two of the best-known Democrats in Pennsylvania are competing for their party's nomination -- Auditor General Robert P. Casey Jr., the quiet-spoken son of a popular former governor, Robert P. Casey, and Edward G. Rendell, the gruff former mayor of Philadelphia and former chairman and fund-raising leader of the Democratic National Committee.
The primary is still 10 months off. But the two men, moderates on many issues, are already in an aggressive fight, waist deep in the old regional feud between the Philadelphia area (mostly Rendell turf) and the rest of the state (mostly Casey turf).
Republicans also are preparing for a primary between their party's major figures, Attorney General Mike Fisher and Treasurer Barbara Hafer. But the Casey-Rendell fight has the marquee names.
In the Democratic primary, it all comes down to this: Can Mr. Rendell hang onto his base in Philadelphia, the state's largest trove of votes, and then invade Casey territory to find the other votes needed to capture the nomination? Conversely, can Mr. Casey, who comes from Scranton, hang onto his base and find the votes he needs in Philadelphia?
The aversion between Philadelphians and many other Pennsylvanians is genuine. It is not really a city slicker vs. country hicks rivalry -- there are plenty of cities beyond Philadelphia -- but it is nevertheless there, most often finding voice in the Legislature in Harrisburg. That is where Philadelphia says it is not getting its fair share of money and attention and where others say the city is being greedy as usual.
Not since Martin Grove Brumbaugh, a Republican, won in 1914 has a Philadelphian broken the "Philly curse" and been elected governor. 
Mr. Rendell's challenge is to convince voters that he can do for the rest of the state what he did for Philadelphia from 1992 to 2000. What he did was put a city back on its economic feet, an accomplishment that won him national plaudits.
At the moment, Pennsylvania is on wobbly economic footing.
Mr. Casey's challenge is to convince skeptics in Philadelphia that he has learned enough in two terms as state auditor to manage the state and, in particular, to look after Philadelphia's interests.
"It's been a long time since we've seen a more interesting governor's election than this one," said Al Neri, editor of The Pennsylvania Report, a nonpartisan publication that tracks state politics. "There's genuine anticipation and excitement out there, especially among Democrats." 
No independent polls of the primary contests have been taken recently. But most political professionals consider the Democratic contest too close to call. In the Republican primary, the experts give Mr. Fisher the edge, pointing out that because he is a conservative, he is probably more acceptable to his party's rank and file than Ms. Hafer, a moderate. 
Beyond regionalism, the overarching issue in the election is how to get the Pennsylvania economy moving again. But other issues also are in play, notably abortion. On the Democratic side, Mr. Rendell favors abortion rights and Mr. Casey opposes them. On the Republican side, Mr. Fisher opposes abortion rights while Ms. Hafer favors them. 
Mr. Rendell says he is confident he can break the Philly curse.
"I've got the experience," he said the other day at his campaign headquarters here. "People know I can bring in industry, create jobs, improve schools."
He has also been working hard to raise money, more than $6 million by most estimates. The expectation is that because he is such a formidable fund-raiser, he will have well over $10 million to pour into the May 21 primary.
Much of his money almost certainly will go into a statewide television advertising blitz designed to increase his name recognition. Mr. Casey, having won several statewide elections and being the son of a governor, is better known than Mr. Rendell outside of Philadelphia but less well known in Philadelphia.
"I expect to hold my own in Philadelphia and then beat Ed in the rest of the state," Mr. Casey said while touring a child care center in downtown Philadelphia recently. "He may have been a mayor, but he has never held statewide office and he has no feel for statewide issues."
In the Republican primary contest, Mr. Fisher professes to be so confident of victory over Ms. Hafer that he is already concentrating on the fall race.
"Barbara is going to lose because she's way too far over on the left," he said. "She's pro-choice and our party is pro-life, as I am, and as I believe the state is. No way she can win."
Ms. Hafer counters that Republicans in an East Coast state like Pennsylvania are much more moderate than Mr. Fisher wants to admit.
"Republicans in this state are not going to nominate someone from the right wing like Mike Fisher," she said. "That's a sure recipe for defeat in the fall, a guarantee that a Democrat will occupy the governor's office next and the change-chairs-every-eight-years tradition will continue."

HEADLINE: President of Urban League Calls for Review of Inequity 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29 

 BODY:
The head of the National Urban League called on the Bush administration today to conduct a comprehensive review of the "pervasive racism" in the criminal justice system, from racial profiling to the number of blacks on death row.
 Hugh B. Price, president of the Urban League, said at the group's annual conference, "Tonight, I say to President Bush what I once said to President Clinton: race relations won't improve in America until racism in the criminal justice system subsides." Mr. Price praised Mr. Bush and Attorney General John Ashcroft for expressing concern about the issue but asserted, "It's time they move beyond empathy to aggressive corrective action." 
 They could begin, he said, by creating a panel of criminal justice experts to "scrutinize every facet of the federal, state and local criminal justice system" for the influence of race.
He also called on the administration to participate in the United Nations conference on racism in South Africa. Administration officials had indicated that they would not send representatives if organizers focused on reparations for slavery or equating Zionism with racism. "America must not be missing in action at the World Conference come September," Mr. Price said.
The Urban League, a 91-year-old civil rights group with chapters in more than 100 cities, opened a four-day session here that will feature appearances by President Bush and several top administration officials. Mr. Price said he welcomed Mr. Bush's participation and was "deeply honored by it." But he also issued a scathing review of the policies produced by Washington in recent months and years.
"I say it's cruel for Washington to end welfare as we knew it, tell poor people they must work, then argue bitterly year after year about raising the minimum wage and extending the earned income tax credit for the working poor," Mr. Price said to applause. "It's heartless to enact a tax cut that sends $600 rebates to millionaires, yet gives nary a dime to low-wage workers who earn too little to pay federal income taxes, but pay plenty of other taxes."
Such policies only underscore the need for "a development revolution" among black Americans, "to eradicate the economic gaps that separate far too many African-Americans from the American mainstream," Mr. Price said.
"Develop we must because with its shifting ideologies and agendas, government cannot and should not be counted on to do it for us," he said, adding, "We must show America that we have so much value to contribute, educationally, economically and politically, that it's foolhardy to ignore us."
This new revolution should include greater political pressure for "a livable wage" for the working poor; greater responsibility among rap musicians and entrepreneurs to "help illuminate the way out" rather than "dragging impressionable young audiences down into depression and despair"; and a new focus on education.
Part of the answer is more parental involvement at home and higher expectations of the schools, he argued, saying, "we must have zero tolerance for failing schools."
Earlier in the day, Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's delegate to the House, called for a new focus on African-American boys and men. She also said: "Our issues and our people must never depend on who is president of the United States or who controls the Congress of the United States. We must continue to move forward regardless of who's in charge."
