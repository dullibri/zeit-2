HEADLINE: Panel Votes To Broaden Oversight Of the Fed

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In a display of populist anger toward the Federal Reserve, a House panel voted on Thursday to let Congress carry out sweeping new oversights of the central bank's policy decisions and operations.
 The House Financial Services Committee approved a measure proposed by Representative Ron Paul of Texas that would allow Congress to order audits of all the Fed's lending programs as well as of its basic decisions to set monetary policy by raising or lowering interest rates.
 If the measure becomes law, it would expose the Federal Reserve to far more political pressure than it has faced for decades. Fed officials have adamantly opposed the measure, saying it would undermine the central bank's political independence and gravely threaten its credibility as a bulwark against inflation. 
 The vote on Thursday occurred despite the opposition of Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who had wanted to shield the Fed's decisions on monetary policy from political pressures.
 Mr. Paul, a libertarian Republican who has called for abolishing the Fed entirely, has introduced a version of his bill in every session of Congress since the early 1980s and never made any progress. But the Fed's trillion-dollar efforts to bail out major banks and rescue the financial system provoked a popular firestorm that ignited both right-wing Republicans and left-wing Democrats.
 Mr. Paul's amendment would instruct the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to carry out audits of all the Fed's operations. Those include an array of emergency lending programs, bailouts of giant financial institutions, dealings with foreign central banks and the central bank's efforts to drive down interest rates by intervening in bond markets.
 Mr. Frank had already agreed that the G.A.O. should be authorized to audit all of the Fed's rescue programs, but he had wanted to wall off the Fed's more basic job of setting interest rates to steer the economy.
 Mr. Paul's bill would abolish a longstanding exemption that shielded the Fed from Congressional audits of its monetary policy. Supporters of the Fed's independence have argued the shield provided crucial insulation from political pressure, which would make it much harder for Fed officials to take unpopular action aimed at heading off inflation.
 ''This is a political warning shot,'' said Vincent R. Reinhart, a former top Fed official who is now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. ''It says that Congress has a mechanism to opine about monetary policy. The fear is that every time there's a threat of higher interest rates, someone in Congress will ask for a study of the costs of higher interest rates.''
 The Fed was not the only institution exposed to political wrath on Thursday. Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, came under fire from both conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats at a hearing of the Joint Economic Committee. Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, told Mr. Geithner he should resign.
 At the House Financial Services Committee, which was working on a sweeping bill to overhaul financial regulation, Mr. Frank had argued that Mr. Paul's amendment went too far and would damage the Fed's credibility. 
 Fed officials have argued that global investors would immediately become more skeptical about the central bank's willingness to fight inflation by raising interest rates, which in turn would force the Fed to raise interest rates higher to accomplish it owns goals to keep prices stable. The result, they have warned, could be both higher inflation and slower growth.
 But Mr. Paul and his supporters argued that the measure would do nothing to undermine the central bank's independence. Its only purpose was to force the Fed to be more transparent and accountable to the public.
 In a surprising display of political rebellion, about half the Democrats present and all the Republicans voted for Mr. Paul's bill instead of a compromise measure drafted by Representative Mel Watt, Democrat of North Carolina. 
 In a related move on Thursday, the House Financial Services Committee also approved an amendment by Representative Paul E. Kanjorski, Democrat of Ohio, that would give the government new power to restrict financial institutions deemed too big to fail.
 But Mr. Frank surprised some of his colleagues by postponing a vote on the overall bill until after Thanksgiving. Mr. Frank said he wanted time to address concerns raised by members of the Congressional Black Caucus.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about a House committee's approval of a measure that would expand Congressional oversight of the Federal Reserve misidentified the state represented by Paul E. Kanjorski, who offered an amendment that would expand government power over large financial institutions. It is Pennsylvania, not Ohio.

HEADLINE: Big Problems in the Big House

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
Late last week, Bruce Springsteen took the stage at a sports arena north of Detroit and greeted his Michigan audience with a cheerful ''Hello, Ohio!''
 After several more references to the Buckeye State, a bandmate whispered a location correction, and Springsteen (who was born in New Jersey) apologized to the Michiganders.
 His timing was ironic. The faux pas came about a week before the annual college football showdown between Michigan and Ohio State, ancient rivals who will play Saturday in Ann Arbor, Mich. 
 Springsteen's confusion seemed to underscore the current malaise affecting the Great Lakes State and one of its most prestigious teams.
 Michigan has fallen on hard times. As General Motors has declared bankruptcy and unemployment has soared, the Wolverines have suffered a football recession.
 ''It does seem to be the perfect storm,'' Bob Forman, the former executive director of the U-M Alumni Association, said of the football turbulence. ''Whether we have the patience to weather this storm, we'll have to see.''
 Michigan (5-6, 1-6 Big Ten) has dropped six consecutive games in the conference and has lost its last five meetings with Ohio State.
 If the Buckeyes (9-2, 6-1) win Saturday, Michigan could finish last in the league and out of the postseason bowl picture with its first two consecutive losing seasons since 1962 and 1963.
 Behind the scenes, the problems are equally serious. Bill Martin, the director of athletics for 10 years, recently announced his resignation, which will take effect next September. The announcement followed allegations that Martin twice this season made physical contact with young stadium workers who asked to see his credentials before entering a private area for university regents and their guests.
 The university said the events were ''in no way linked'' and that Martin ''had been thinking about retirement for a long time.''
 There are other problems. Early this week, the university announced that it could not locate log records of practice and workouts for the football team from the 2008 season, its first year under Coach Rich Rodriguez.
 The university and the N.C.A.A. are investigating allegations, originally reported in The Detroit Free Press, that Rodriguez and his staff overworked players with extra training sessions.
 ''I don't know how anybody could envision this much stuff,'' Rodriguez said on Monday during his weekly news conference. ''A lot of it did catch me off-guard. That's not something you see in a manual.''
 One of the Buckeyes facing Michigan on Saturday will be offensive lineman Justin Boren, a former Wolverine who transferred to Ohio State shortly after Rodriguez arrived.
 Boren, the son of the former Wolverine player Mike Boren, said in an e-mail message to reporters at the time: ''Michigan football was a family built on mutual respect and support. Those family values have eroded.'' Boren was unavailable for interviews this week. 
 At Michigan, Martin and Mary Sue Coleman, the university's president, did not respond to requests for comment about the issues surrounding the program.
 ''I don't think it's very appropriate to talk now, because of the N.C.A.A.,'' said Olivia P. Maynard, one of Michigan's eight-member Board of Regents, who was reached by telephone.
 ''Think of it from the university's perspective. There's all kinds of stuff going on. It doesn't help to have a thousand voices speaking at the same time.''
 More than 100,000 voices will fill Michigan Stadium on Saturday beneath two towers of luxury boxes and club seats that are rising behind the old grandstands. The plush sections will open next season. Opposed by some traditionalists, they will accommodate 16 persons apiece in 82 suites in addition to 3,000 club seats. The top price for a suite is $85,000 annually.
 Joe Parker, Michigan's senior associate athletic director, said by telephone that the university has commitments for 55 of the 82 suites and for 2,300 of the 3,000 club seats, which are being added in a $226 million expansion.
 Parker added that ''no one has paid in full,'' and that the money is not due until Jan. 31, 2010.
 Along with the team's performance, the state's economic condition could be a factor in eventual sales, he said. He expressed optimism, adding, ''Michigan is a brand that expands beyond the borders of our state.'' 
 The university, which has a wide alumni base, has been a football power since Fielding Yost became coach in 1901 and later served as athletic director. One Michigan backer who opposed the expansion is Yost's grandson, Fielding Yost III, who goes by Duke and works in residential construction, lives in Midland, Mich., and still has two season tickets.
 In a telephone interview on Thursday, Yost said the investigation of the football program has been ''really a disappointment'' because ''the football program has always been above reproach.''
 But Yost, who has a masters degree in public policy from Michigan, added, ''Let's presume innocence until found guilty.''
 He said the new luxury boxes already have increased the volume inside the stadium because sound reverberates off them, although he added that the cheering has decreased considerably since the team's 4-0 start.
 Yost, whose grandfather built the stadium, opposed the luxury seating on grounds of what he called ''elitism and stratification,'' as well as the practical question of marketing them now.
 He said Thursday that he hoped to be proved wrong. ''The luxury boxes are a fait-almost-accompli,'' Yost said. ''Will they be able to sell them? I hope they do.''
 Of both the suite sales and Michigan's football fortunes in general, Yost said, ''I hope for success.''

HEADLINE: A Belgian Is Chosen As President For Europe

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and STEVEN ERLANGER; Stephen Castle reported from Brussels, and Steven Erlanger from Paris.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
Leaders of the 27 countries of the European Union on Thursday night chose Herman Van Rompuy, the Belgian prime minister, as the European Union's first president, and Catherine Ashton of Britain, currently the bloc's trade commissioner, as its high representative for foreign policy. The vote was unanimous.
 Both officials are highly respected but little known outside their own countries. After the European Union's eight-year battle to rewrite its internal rules and to pass the Lisbon Treaty that created these two new jobs, the selection of such low-profile figures seemed to highlight Europe's problems instead of its readiness to take a more united and forceful place in world affairs. 
 In a sense, Europe seemed to be living down to expectations. Earlier, the foreign minister of Sweden, Carl Bildt, warned against a ''minimalist solution'' that would reduce the union's ''opportunity to have a clear voice in the world.''
 ''It is quite astounding,'' said Olivier Ferrand, president of Terra Nova, a center-left research institute in France. ''It is jaw-dropping. It is the end of ambition for the E.U. -- really disappointing.''
 The deal that produced the two choices emerged as a result of backroom negotiations among leaders jockeying for future and more important economic portfolios that could be more powerful in the enlarged European Union, which is still more of an economic union than a political one and looks to remain so.
 Mr. Van Rompuy (pronounced ROM-pow), 62, an economist, has been Belgium's prime minister for less than a year. Ms. Ashton, 53, has next to no foreign policy experience and has never been elected to anything.
 They are expected to take up their jobs on Jan. 1. Ms. Ashton still needs the endorsement of the European Parliament.
 Both emerged when Britain's choice for president, Tony Blair, met with overwhelming opposition, stemming from his past pro-American policies, support for the Iraq war and star qualities. 
 The British prime minister, Gordon Brown, finally bowed to the inevitable late Thursday afternoon and dropped his backing for his predecessor. By supporting Mr. Van Rompuy -- a Roman Catholic and a Christian Democrat from the center-right, who supported the positioning of American nuclear weapons in Belgium -- Mr. Brown opened up the foreign policy job to the center-left. With support from fellow center-left leaders, he pitched Ms. Ashton for the job. 
 A fresh opportunity for European leadership appeared to be the great promise of the Lisbon Treaty, which created the jobs of president and foreign policy chief and was approved earlier this month after years of political struggle. The idea had been to simplify the management of an enlarged European Union and to appoint senior European figures who could speak for the group.
 But the leaders of Europe's most powerful countries, France and Germany, did not want to be overshadowed. Nor apparently did their foreign ministers.
 Thursday night, Mr. Van Rompuy told reporters, mixing English, French and Dutch, that ''I did not seek this job.''
 ''But from tonight,'' he added, ''I will do it with conviction and enthusiasm.''
 He said that he was reluctant to abandon the stewardship of Belgium, but that ''Europe is a union of values and has the responsibility of playing an important role in the world.''
 The selection of Ms. Ashton -- formally Baroness Ashton of Upholland -- was particularly striking given the deep foreign policy experience of both officials whom she will succeed in the European Union: Javier Solana, who had been Spain's foreign minister and then secretary general of NATO, and Benita Ferrero-Waldner, who had been Austria's foreign minister.
 By contrast, Ms. Ashton has had jobs in domestic policy and was appointed to the House of Lords in 1999. She was named leader of the House of Lords, in charge of steering government legislation through the chamber, in 2007. She was then appointed to the European Commission in October 2008. As European commissioner for trade, she has negotiated with foreigners and impressed her colleagues.
 Ms. Ashton told reporters that ''it is a measure of my surprise that I have not prepared a speech.'' She said that she was Britain's first female European Union commissioner and the first woman to be trade commissioner, and was proud to be the first high representative. ''Am I an ego on legs? I am not,'' she said. ''Judge me on what I do, and I think you will be proud of me.''
 If the point of the Lisbon Treaty was to create a more prominent face for Europe, the result on Thursday was the opposite. It appeared to be a political deal that would do little to reduce the power, stature and influence of big nations or their foreign ministers. 
 ''It's going to be difficult to explain to the public why there was so much fuss about the Lisbon Treaty if all we get is someone no one has heard of,'' said one European Union official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
 Mr. Van Rompuy, who likes bowling duckpins and writing haiku, has earned respect for calming ethnic tensions in Belgium in his 11 months as prime minister. Someone who met him recently described him as intelligent and humorous, but ''timid.'' He only reluctantly took on the job of prime minister, and did not push himself forward for this one.
 One recent Van Rompuy haiku went this way: ''A fly zooms, buzzes; Spins and is lost in the room; He does no one harm.''
 In a sign of how little respect the foreign policy job appeared to attract, the most prominent person mentioned previously to fill it, David Miliband, the British foreign secretary, chose instead to work domestically to revive the fortunes of the Labour Party, widely expected to lose the next election to the Conservatives. His decision not to pursue a lucrative job in Brussels has only helped him in Britain.

HEADLINE: A Tilt Away From Social Issues

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: LOST PINES, Tex. 

 BODY:
After two bleak years, Republican governors gathered here on Thursday to assess their political future -- and they liked what they saw. With 37 governors' seats open in 2010, the party is looking to topple some big-name Democrats.
 What was most striking about the Republican governors was not simply their sense of optimism -- a sentiment that would draw no Democratic quarrel these days -- but exactly how they saw their road back to power and unity. The talk here was of the health care plan being debated in Congress, increased spending under President Obama, the climbing deficit and concern among Americans about jobs and the education of their children. 
 ''The focus should be on bread-and-butter, kitchen-table, quality-of-life issues,'' said Robert F. McDonnell, the Republican who was this month elected governor of Virginia, a seat that had been held by a Democrat, and whose victory is being held up as a formula for Republican reconstruction. ''I think that really helped us. We ended up with a two-to-one margin with independent voters because of our focus on the economic problems.''
 Mr. McDonnell's mantra was echoed throughout the day, and it was easy to forget that this gathering was taking place at a secluded resort in the hills just outside of Austin, the city where former President George W. Bush and his chief political lieutenant, Karl Rove, began their effort to remake the Republican Party 10 years ago. There was little talk of the divisive social and political issues that Mr. Bush and Mr. Rove embraced as a way to attract independent and moderate Democratic voters and build a lasting Republican majority.
 Thus for all the discussion about what it would take to build on this month's victories of Mr. McDonnell in Virginia and another Republican, Christopher J. Christie, in the gubernatorial race in New Jersey, there was barely a whisper about abortion, gay marriage or gun control. The question of terrorism -- Mr. Rove's defining theme for much of the Bush presidency -- barely came up, even in the week when Republicans in other places were attacking Mr. Obama's Justice Department for deciding to hold the trial of four 9/11 suspects in a federal court in New York.
 At one point, Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi warned the audience -- a group of governors, their aides and lobbyists -- against attacks on Mr. Obama, suggesting this was a path to defeat. (Mr. Barbour showed no hesitation about critically invoking the names of two other Democrats who are not blessed by Mr. Obama's popularity, Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker, and Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader.)
 To a considerable extent, the tilting of these scales reflect the fact that governors tend to run different races than members of Congress, dealing with state and local concerns. Yet governors and Republican leaders said the tenor of the discussion also reflected the recognition that social issues no longer carried the punch they once might have. 
 No one here was about to rebuke Mr. Rove or Mr. Bush. Yet their names were mentioned so infrequently that it was hard not to conclude that the party has moved beyond two men into a still uncertain future.
 Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, a likely presidential candidate in 2012, said: ''In my case, and I think it's true in most areas that are politically competitive, what most people want to know about candidates and officeholders is this: 'Will you keep my taxes reasonable, hopefully decreasing; can you help me get my kid to a school so he or she can get a decent education?' ''
 Indeed, as a political issue -- and also as a policy issue -- these governors were much more likely to be focused on what Democrats were trying to do with health care than on gay marriage. Mr. Barbour said that he thought that Democrats were making a major miscalculation in assuming that getting a health care bill through Congress would, ultimately, prove to be a political advantage.
 ''The Democrats seem to believe that cramming this down the American people's throat will make them more popular,'' Mr. Barbour said. ''I think the American people will be livid if a political party on a partisan vote crams an enormous change down their throat.''
 As Mr. Barbour noted, next year's gubernatorial elections are particularly important because governors elected in 2010 will help oversee the redrawing of state and Congressional district lines, based on the results of the 2010 census. That would give them significant impact on the political makeup of Congress and many state houses. And there are reasons for Republicans to be bullish: 19 of the 37 seats that are being contested next year are held by Democrats.
 Democrats face tough races in at least seven of those states, though Nick Ayres, the executive director of the Republican Governors Association, said he believed that number would increase. He said nine Democratic governors face electorates as restive as the one confronted by Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey, who lost to Mr. Christie. 
 Beyond that, he said, they would also have to cope with the same problem as R. Creigh Deeds, the Democrat who lost to Mr. McDonnell in Virginia.
 ''They are going to face Deeds's problems, where they really have two options going into their re-election: Do they stand with Reid and Pelosi on issues like national health care and appease their base or do they stand with taxpayers in their states unhappy with this plan,'' he said. 
 Still, however tough it may be to be a Democrat these days, it is tougher to be a governor, at the front lines of cutting services and raising taxes. While Republicans kept talking about the 9 or 10 Democratic seats they have in their sights, they were well aware of the fact that just as many Republican gubernatorial seats are equally vulnerable going into next year.

HEADLINE: A Forceful Entry by Christie, and a Sober Exit by Corzine

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY 

 BODY:
In a vivid contrast of their styles and standing, a soft-spoken Gov. Jon S. Corzine delivered a choked-up goodbye here Thursday while Governor-elect Christopher J. Christie vowed to ''force change'' on New Jersey even if it meant dragging his adversaries to the table.
 Mr. Christie, a Republican, said that he was no miracle worker, but that he was inspired by the challenges ahead and impatient to tackle the state's problems. 
 ''Hard decisions are going to be made,'' he told thousands of public officials and interest-group leaders at the New Jersey League of Municipalities convention, many of whom may face cutbacks in state aid or services. ''I am not here to wait one or two or four or eight years for change to come. Change is going to come, and it's going to come now.''
 The back-to-back speeches by the former rivals, who greeted each other warmly, were their first since Nov. 3, when Mr. Christie defeated Mr. Corzine, a Democrat, by a margin that was surprisingly comfortable, given the heavy Democratic advantage in the state.
 Mr. Christie, 47, whose advisers have been grappling with a budget deficit they say could easily exceed $8 billion, shed no light on his plans but served up plenty of blustery sound bites. He opened by telling anyone expecting good news to ''hit the exits,'' and later said that failure was ''not in my vocabulary.''
 He said he welcomed the fight on issues people care about.
 ''Some I'll win, some I won't; I'm prepared for that,'' he said. ''But we have to focus on those things that can no longer wait. Fiscal responsibility in New Jersey can no longer wait. Tax relief can no longer wait. Urban education improvement in New Jersey can no longer wait.''
 Beyond the broader economic crisis, he said, New Jersey's problems stem from its leaders' continually asking ''What's in it for me?'' -- personally or parochially.
 ''When times are good, we can survive 'What's in it for me?' '' he said. ''We can paper it over. We can even kid ourselves that we're doing the right thing. But when times of challenge come, as they have come, there is no more hiding.''
 Mr. Christie said the state's problems could no longer be addressed ''by everybody retreating to their respective corners, saying: 'This is mine. I'm going to protect it.' ''
 ''Everyone must retreat from that attitude, and in fact must move forward to the center of the room,'' he said, demanding bipartisanship and a ''what's in it for us?'' spirit. He added: ''If you don't, we're coming into that corner to drag you out.''
 Mr. Corzine, 62, gave a downbeat valedictory, describing dire times ahead and offering little more than his prayers that New Jersey will rise to what he called enormous, daunting challenges.
 He ticked off several accomplishments -- eliminating 26 school districts, slowing property-tax growth to its lowest rate in a decade, reducing total government spending -- but bluntly conceded: ''Steps in the right direction, but mission not accomplished.''
 He called the state's soaring property taxes a burden ''that will overwhelm us and does, time after time.'' He said that the state's unfunded pension and health fund liabilities were ''extraordinary,'' and that revenues would probably keep falling even after the economy recovered.
 His successor will need everyone's cooperation, and a lot of luck, Mr. Corzine said.
 ''Bold and unpopular actions are the only way to deal with these issues,'' he said, since the choices come down to cutting or consolidating services or raising taxes, tolls or fees. 
 ''We wish we could have thought of more palatable options,'' he added.
 Mr. Corzine left his audience with one plea, to embrace consolidation and shared services at the local level. He said the state's population of 8.5 million was about the same as that of New York City, which has one police commissioner and school system instead of hundreds.
 ''We negotiate 600 times,'' he said of costly municipal contracts. ''We negotiate against ourselves.
 ''We don't need to be New York City. But we need to address the proliferation and fragmentation of the government we have.''
 Mr. Corzine, his voice breaking, promised to cheer on New Jersey from the sidelines. ''Serving the people of this state as a United States senator and as governor,'' he said, ''has been the highest honor in my life.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Teaches Carmakers Capitalism

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris

 BODY:
When the American auto industry was owned by investors, it acted like a government enterprise. 
 Now that the government controls it, will it act like a capitalist business?
 The idea is heretical, but it may be happening. And that says something good about the Obama administration's rescue of General Motors and Chrysler. 
 Back in the bad old days, when supposed capitalists were running Detroit, the game plan seemed to be about pushing up volume. There were big price cuts when sales weakened. There were rebates. There were sweet lease deals that made sense financially for the companies only if they used wildly optimistic assumptions about used-car prices when the leases ended. 
 The idea was to keep cash coming in to cover the variable costs of producing more cars, and to protect market share. The former leadership of G.M., in particular, seemed to be focused on that question, not on profitability.
 The alternative strategy would have required the managements to slash production, close plants and fire workers. That was simply deemed not possible. The union was powerful, and contracts meant the costs would not come down that much even if the companies had fewer cars to sell.
 Anybody who ever took microeconomics can understand the attraction of the strategy used by Detroit. In the short run, it makes sense to sell a car for any price greater than the added cost of producing that extra car. But if prices are so low that fixed costs are not being covered, then the company goes farther and farther into debt, until the lenders finally realize what is happening and turn off the spigot.
 That is just what happened.
 One rap on socialism has always been that governments are much more worried about jobs than profits. No politician wants to be responsible for layoffs, so the government is happy to rely on optimistic assumptions to avoid painful decisions.
 That is how the term ''lemon socialism'' was coined.
 So what happened this year? 
 First, the Obama administration demanded G.M. and Chrysler come up with believable strategies for getting out of the mess they were in. When those plans came back with the usual rose-tinted perspective, the administration demanded changes.
 The result was a lot of job cutting, not something you might have expected from an administration elected with union support. The unions lost their generous pay for laid-off workers. To be sure, the union health plans were not treated as harshly as some creditors were, but in the end creditors and workers all paid for the sins of past managements.
 Evidence of what is going on came this week in the consumer price figures for October. The index for new autos was up 1.6 percent for the month, and 3.8 percent for the last 12 months. It has been more than a decade since that index rose by nearly that much. That is what can happen when companies focus on raising margins, no matter what the impact on volume.
 The Consumer Price Index numbers need not be viewed as gospel. They are adjusted for quality, which is no easy job. (How much more is a 2010 model worth than the previous year's? How big an adjustment is called for if the engine is larger, or the gas mileage is better, or the interior more comfortable?) But that issue has been around for a long time. There is no reason to think the government is doing a worse job on the C.P.I. than it did in years past.
 Then there is the question of how the cash-for-clunkers program may have affected the numbers. That program may have allowed dealers to raise prices temporarily. If so, that impact could wear off soon. 
 Because of such things, many analysts have assumed that rising car prices in recent months were a statistical fluke.
 ''This significant price increase does not make any sense at all in an environment in which car sales are close to a 27-year low,'' wrote Harm Bandholz, an economist for UniCredit Research, after the October C.P.I. numbers were released. ''To me,'' he told me later, ''it is a statistical anomaly'' that is likely to vanish in coming months.
 Another possible explanation is the decline of the dollar since March. German, Japanese and Korean carmakers need to raise prices here to offset the appreciation of the euro, yen and won, and that gives Detroit some room to raise prices as well. But as Mr. Bandholz pointed out, import prices for cars are rising, but not that rapidly. ''Higher import prices can explain part of the increase in selling prices, but by far not everything,'' he said.
 If car prices do not fall soon, we may have to conclude the higher prices are real, and are happening because Detroit really is operating differently now. If so, the Obama administration deserves praise for how it handled the auto bailout, producing the unlikely combination of market discipline and government ownership.
 But in the short run, it will do the president no good politically. Unemployment is higher than it would have been if the administration had been willing to assume that things were going to get better quickly and not forced Detroit to change. And higher prices presumably will have some negative effect on sales, making the economy look a little worse.
 Detroit has vowed to curtail discounting before, of course, and has seen those vows crumble in the face of disappointing business. When the dollar stabilizes, pressure from imports may well grow. It is far too early to declare a complete success.
 Still, it is interesting to speculate on what would have happened to Wall Street if the government had been willing and able to impose market discipline on the banks, so that creditors took large losses and shareholders were wiped out even as the banks kept operating and performing their economic functions.
 Officials saw no way to accomplish that, and given what happened after Lehman Brothers collapsed, they were probably right. But if that had happened, the chances of getting real financial reform through Congress would have been a lot greater than they now appear to be.

HEADLINE: A Gift to Credit Card Companies

 BODY:
Congress left consumers extremely vulnerable when it gave the credit card industry as long as 15 months to end the deceptive predatory practices outlawed in the spring in the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act. The credit card industry, which clearly wants to make a killing in the Christmas season, used this unnecessarily long grace period to intensify its predations, doubling interest rates on people who pay on time and driving up rates by an industry wide average of about 20 percent. 
 These ravages seemed not to have registered with Senator Thad Cochran, a Republican of Mississippi, who represents the nation's poorest and most economically vulnerable state. On Wednesday, Mr. Cochran blocked a vote on a bill introduced by Senator Christopher Dodd, a Democrat of Connecticut, that would have immediately frozen credit card interest rates and fees.
 Mr. Cochran said through his office that he objected to the bill on behalf of unknown Republican colleagues who had their own objections. But it is difficult not to see his maneuver in yet another act of obeisance by Senate Republicans to the banking and credit card industries. 
 The same was true of Congress's decision in May to delay implementation of the original credit card reform bill. Had the act gone into effect immediately, credit card issuers would have been forced to end many of the practices that have trapped millions of Americans in debt that they had no hope of repaying. 
 Arbitrary increases like the ones that appear to have become even more common since the spring would have been immediately outlawed. So would the practice of penalizing customers who are late paying an unrelated bill -- known as universal default -- and the rip-off in which companies charge cardholders new interest on debts that they have paid a month or two earlier. And the companies would have been forced to end the outrageous practice of burdening teenagers with credit cards without first judging their ability to pay the bills or getting a signature from a responsible adult. 
 The Dodd bill appears to be off the table for the moment. But a stronger bill that would move up the effective date of the credit card law to Dec. 1 has already passed the House. The Senate version has been introduced by Mark Udall, a Democrat of Colorado. With December almost upon us, the measure should long since have become law.

HEADLINE: Stimulus Watchdog Says White House Jobs Numbers May Not Be Accurate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The government watchdog overseeing the federal stimulus program testified Thursday that he could not vouch for the Obama administration's recent claims that the money had saved or created 640,000 jobs. He suggested that the administration should have treated the number with more skepticism. 
 The 640,000 figure, announced by the White House with some fanfare last month, came from reports filed by recipients of the stimulus money, many of which have been shown to be inaccurate or overstated since they were made public. But the watchdog, Earl E. Devaney, the chairman of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board, said that it was also possible that the figure understated how many jobs were affected. Up to 10 percent of the recipients had not filed the required reports showing how many jobs they had created or saved, he said. 
 ''I have no doubt that there's a lot of jobs being created,'' Mr. Devaney said at a hearing of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ''I think it could be above or below 640. I think missing reports might drive the job numbers up, and I think there's enough inaccuracies in here to question if the 640 number might go down.''
 When the White House announced the figures three weeks ago, officials hoped to reassure people that the $787 billion stimulus program was working in the face of rising unemployment. Many economists credit the stimulus with helping the economy, but tallying the actual jobs has proved difficult. A series of embarrassing reports -- of raises being counted as new jobs, of jobs claimed in Congressional districts that do not exist, of school districts claiming to have saved the jobs of more teachers than they employ -- may have ended up undermining confidence in the stimulus program.
 This week, Representative David Obey of Wisconsin, an influential Democrat who helped write the stimulus bill, issued a blistering statement calling the mistakes in the data ''ludicrous'' and ''outrageous.'' 
 ''Credibility counts in government, and stupid mistakes like this undermine it,'' he said. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was even quizzed about the figures when he sat for an interview on ''The Daily Show.''
 Also Thursday, a report issued by the Government Accountability Office identified ''significant'' problems with the jobs numbers. It found that 58,386 of the jobs were being claimed by recipients who had not reported spending any money; on the other hand, recipients who had received nearly $1 billion had claimed no jobs at all. 
 Administration officials have said that they believe that mistakes overcounting jobs are likely to be offset by mistakes undercounting them. 
 Representative Darrell E. Issa, the ranking Republican on the committee, read the Oxford English Dictionary's definition of propaganda at the hearing, and suggested that the administration was using the faulty jobs figure to promote its policies. 
 He read a series of statements of administration officials trumpeting the figure, and asked Mr. Devaney if it would have been better to have simply acknowledged that the data came from recipients and could not be verified. 
 Mr. Devaney, who has warned for months that the data was likely to contain inaccuracies, seemed to agree, saying that he liked that statement. The data is all publicly available on the government's Web site, www.recovery.gov, which he oversees.
 Elizabeth A. Oxhorn, a White House spokeswoman, said that Mr. Biden had warned publicly that the data was not 100 percent accurate and would require corrections.
 Mr. Devaney said that the mistakes were coming to light because of the effort toward transparency, and said, ''My expectation is that any embarrassment suffered will encourage self-correcting behavior and lead to better reporting in the future.''

HEADLINE: South Korea Trade Pact Is Revived By Obama

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama opened a potentially bruising battle within the Democratic party on Thursday when he pledged to complete a long-stalled trade agreement with South Korea that he inherited from President George W. Bush. 
 At a news conference in Seoul, South Korea, Mr. Obama and the president of South Korea, Lee Myung-bak, both declared their desire to renegotiate elements of the agreement and to have both countries ratify it as soon as possible.
 ''I am a strong believer that both countries can benefit from expanding our trade ties,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I have told President Lee and his team that I am committed to seeing the two countries work together to move this agreement forward.'' 
 But within hours, Democrats from big manufacturing states were already accusing the president of emulating his Republican predecessor and undermining American workers.
 ''I can't for the life of me understand why we would want to extend the Bush economic and trade policies,'' said Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio. ''It's unacceptable to say we'll put in some side agreements. It's still Bush trade policy, which is as bankrupt as Bush fiscal policy.''
 As if anticipating criticisms that a trade deal would usher in another flood of imports at the expense of American jobs, Mr. Obama tried to distinguish between trade with South Korea and trade with other Asian powerhouses. 
 ''There's a tendency to lump all of Asia together when Congress looks at trade agreements and says, 'It appears this is a one-way street,' '' Mr. Obama said in Seoul. South Korea, he said, does not have nearly as big a trade surplus with the United States as other Asian countries do. 
 But South Korea is one of the United States' largest trading partners. It is one of three countries, along with Colombia and Panama, that negotiated trade-opening deals with the Bush administration. None of those agreements have been ratified by Congress, and many Democratic lawmakers are opposed to them.
 The main opposition to the South Korea deal comes from automobile companies and other industrial manufacturers, like Whirlpool, which complain that the agreement does little to remove South Korea's regulatory and tax barriers on imported products.
 The United States exports about 7,000 cars a year to South Korea, barely 1 percent of the number of Kia and Hyundai cars that South Korea exports to the United States.
 Democrats from Michigan, Illinois and other big car-producing states have long complained that the South Korea trade deal would simply aggravate the American automobile industry's crisis. 
 ''The U.S.-Korea trade agreement is the last thing our nation can afford,'' Representative Phil Hare, Democrat of Illinois, said statement on his Web site Thursday. ''I am troubled that we even discussing another job-killing trade agreement.''
 One senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said White House officials had several reasons for trying to reach a new deal if they could persuade South Korea to open up its market to American goods.
 For one thing, he said, South Korea has already negotiated a separate trade agreement with the European Union. If that deal were ratified, American exporters would be at a competitive disadvantage to European rivals. 
 Beyond that, President Lee of South Korea made it clear he was willing to revisit elements of the deal negotiated with the Bush administration. Until now, South Korean officials have insisted that a deal is a deal.
 Unlike China and other Asian countries, South Korea has a relatively small trade surplus with the United States -- about $13 billion last year out of $80 billion in total trade between the two countries.
 Representative Sander Levin of Michigan, the influential Democratic chairman of the trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, had a nuanced reaction to Mr. Obama's initiative with South Korea.
 Mr. Levin has warned the trade deal had no chance of passage unless South Korea agreed to make reductions in import restrictions. But he welcomed Mr. Lee's apparent willingness to re-open those discussions.
 ''My hope is that, because of President Obama's visit, they are serious about opening up,'' Mr. Levin said on Thursday. As recently as last week, Mr. Levin said, he met personally with South Korea's trade minister and was told there was ''nothing to discuss'' about the agreement.
 Administration officials said they were well aware that the idea of new trade-opening deals provoked emotional opposition in some quarters of the Democratic party. On Wednesday, a small group of Democratic lawmakers called for Mr. Obama to renegotiate the treaty that underlies the World Trade Organization.

HEADLINE: A Family That Plays Together Onstage, Offstage and in Ads

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
IT'S all in the family, Madison Avenue style: a product aimed at families is teaming up with a famous name in family entertainment for an elaborate effort fronted by one of the biggest family acts in music.
 The Xbox 360 gaming system, sold by the Microsoft Corporation, is being endorsed by the Jonas Brothers rock band in a campaign that appears in properties owned by the brothers' media partner, the Walt Disney Company. Xbox 360 joins a short list of brands to be promoted by the Jonases, whose music appeals to the teenagers, preteenagers and mothers composing the target audience for the gaming system. 
 The multimillion-dollar campaign, created internally at Disney, is part of a larger initiative for Xbox 360 that carries the theme ''It's more fun time,'' which is created by T.A.G. in San Francisco, part of the McCann Worldgroup division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
 The Jonas-centric ads are being introduced along with work from T.A.G. like commercials and video clips featuring the actress Jane Lynch of the hit Fox series ''Glee,'' which are on television and online.
 The Jonas campaign is also on television and online, as well as in print and on radio. It is timed to reach consumers just as they are thinking about what, if anything, they are going to buy during the coming holiday shopping season.
 ''We're optimistic for the holidays,'' said Robert Matthews, senior director of global marketing communications for the interactive enterprise business at Microsoft in Redmond, Wash.
 ''Interactive entertainment tends to be a little more recession-resistant,'' Mr. Matthews said, ''and we're certainly doing what we can to drive value for consumers.''
 Among those steps are a sale on the premium version of the game console, the Xbox 360 Elite, bundled with two games, for the same $299 price as the console typically costs alone, and an emphasis on the Xbox Live service, which enables users to play games, listen to music, watch movies and patronize Web services like Facebook, Last.fm and Twitter.
 (Microsoft is seeking to stimulate preholiday sales for the Windows 7 operating system as well as Xbox 360.)
 Among the aspects of the Jonas campaign is an opportunity to watch on Xbox Live a free episode of ''Jonas,'' the brothers' sitcom on the Disney Channel, with ''a custom opening'' segment produced with the brothers, said Tricia Wilber, executive vice president at the Disney media sales and marketing group in New York.
 The group oversees the company's ''kids- and mom-focused media,'' Ms. Wilber said, including the Disney Channel and the Disney XD cable channels, disney.com, disneyfamily.com, Disney Family Fun magazine and Radio Disney.
 Many of those media are taking part in the Jonas campaign. For instance, visitors to disney.com/morefuntime can learn about a sweepstakes with the grand prize being a chance ''to hang out'' with the Jonases and ''experience Xbox 360 together.''
 A commercial shows the brothers -- Joe, Kevin and Nick -- sharing a game console with visitors to their green room backstage. The plot is apparently, as they say in the movies, based on true events.
 Xbox is ''something they've grown up with,'' Kevin Jonas Sr., a manager of the band, said of his sons during a telephone interview on Thursday. 
 ''We've traveled with Xbox since the time it came out,'' he added. ''As long as it's in their dressing room, we're all good.''
 That was corroborated by Kevin and Nick, who joined Mr. Jonas for the interview. The brothers have ''a road case with the Xbox built right in,'' Kevin Jonas said. It accompanies them on tour.
 Mr. Jonas said he and his sons accepted the endorsement deal from Microsoft because they ''want reliable, family-friendly brands we can associate with.''
 ''The boys have been approached by so many companies; so many possibilities of doing commercials and endorsements,'' he added. ''We do say no every day.''
 Among those to whom they have said yes are Verizon Communications, a sponsor of the band's tours, and Burger King; the brothers appear in ads for a single menu item, apple fries, rather than the entire menu.
 Nick is diabetic, Mr. Jonas explained, so ''we make healthy choices, or represent healthy choices.'' 
 Nick Jonas also appears solo in ads for the Contour blood glucose monitor sold by Bayer HealthCare and takes part in a campaign meant to help fight juvenile diabetes (nickssimplewins.com).
 The family ''absolutely gets involved with all'' marketing partners, Mr. Jonas said, including creative approval of ads, which are screened by Mr. Jonas and the band's other managers ''and then we run it by the boys.''
 Microsoft did some screening of its own to make sure the campaign was not an example of play for pay.
 ''Yes, the Jonas Brothers, like any teenage and young adult folks, enjoy video games and enjoy Xbox 360,'' Mr. Matthews said. ''It's great when you can leverage experience with the brand that exists naturally.''
 As for concerns that the popularity of the endorsers could overwhelm the product being endorsed, Mr. Matthews said: ''At the end of the day, Xbox as a brand is an incredibly strong brand, with loyalty across all age groups. You've got two strong brands coming together. Certainly, there's no fear one overshadows the other in any way.''
 Make that three brands, counting Disney. Interestingly, Disney has ties to the Microsoft rival, Apple, through its chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, who serves on the Disney board. The battle between Apple and Microsoft may be the 21st-century version of the cola wars.
 ''We are not Apple,'' Ms. Wilber said. ''For us, this is an opportunity to partner with someone targeted to our audience.''
 Mr. Matthews echoed that. Disney has ''access to the audiences we're going after,'' he said, and ''we have products relevant to those audiences.''

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Up in 29 States, Hitting Records in 4 of Them

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
California, Delaware, South Carolina and Florida registered record rates of unemployment in October, the Labor Department said Friday.
 Joblessness rose in 29 states last month compared with 22 in September, the agency said in a monthly state breakdown. Michigan had the highest jobless rate at 15.1 percent, followed by Nevada at 13 percent and Rhode Island at 12.9 percent. 
 The unemployment rate fell in 13 states, including Massachusetts, where it declined to 8.9 percent from 9.3 percent; New Hampshire, with a drop to 6.8 percent from 7.2 percent; and West Virginia, which fell to 8.5 percent from 8.9 percent.
 The number of states with at least 10 percent unemployment held at 14 last month, the Labor Department's report showed. In the states reporting record jobless rates, California was at 12.5 percent; South Carolina, 12.1 percent; Florida, 11.2 percent; and Delaware at 8.7 percent. The District of Columbia also set a high with an 11.9 percent rate.
 ''Virtually every sector aside from the health care sector is losing jobs,'' said Sean Snaith, an economist at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Fla. ''Housing has been central to Florida's economic story throughout the entire cycle. Unfortunately, it has spread well beyond the sectors directly involved in the housing market.''
 Payrolls declined last month in 21 states, the report showed. New York showed the biggest drop, with 15,300 jobs lost. Florida had 8,500 job losses, followed by Georgia with 7,500 and Virginia with 7,100.
 Over the last year, California showed the biggest loss of jobs, with payrolls falling by 687,700 workers, the report showed.

HEADLINE: Ohio Sues Rating Firms For Losses In Funds

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
Already facing a spate of private lawsuits, the legal troubles of the country's largest credit rating agencies deepened on Friday when the attorney general of Ohio sued Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and Fitch, claiming that they had cost state retirement and pension funds some $457 million by approving high-risk Wall Street securities that went bust in the financial collapse. 
 The case could test whether the agencies' ratings are constitutionally protected as a form of free speech. 
 The lawsuit asserts that Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch were in league with the banks and other issuers, helping to create an assortment of exotic financial instruments that led to a disastrous bubble in the housing market. 
 ''We believe that the credit rating agencies, in exchange for fees, departed from their objective, neutral role as arbiters,'' the attorney general, Richard Cordray, said at a news conference. ''At minimum, they were aiding and abetting misconduct by issuers.'' 
 He accused the companies of selling their integrity to the highest bidder.
 Steven Weiss, a spokesman for McGraw-Hill, which owns S.& P., said that the lawsuit had no merit and that the company would vigorously defend itself. 
 ''A recent Securities and Exchange Commission examination of our business practices found no evidence that decisions about rating methodologies or models were based on attracting market share,'' he said.
 Michael Adler, a spokesman for Moody's, also disputed the claims. ''It is unfortunate that the state attorney general, rather than engaging in an objective review and constructive dialogue regarding credit ratings, instead appears to be seeking new scapegoats for investment losses incurred during an unprecedented global market disruption,'' he said.
 A spokesman for Fitch said the company would not comment because it had not seen the lawsuit.
 The litigation adds to a growing stack of lawsuits against the three largest credit rating agencies, which together command an 85 percent share of the market. Since the credit crisis began last year, dozens of investors have sought to recover billions of dollars from worthless or nearly worthless bonds on which the rating agencies had conferred their highest grades. 
 One of those groups is largest pension fund in the country, the California Public Employees Retirement System, which filed a lawsuit in state court in California in July, claiming that ''wildly inaccurate ratings'' had led to roughly $1 billion in losses. 
 And more litigation is likely. As part of a broader financial reform, Congress is considering provisions that make it easier for plaintiffs to sue rating agencies. And the Ohio attorney general's action raises the possibility of similar filings from other states. California's attorney general, Jerry Brown, said in September that his office was investigating the rating agencies, with an eye toward determining ''how these agencies could get it so wrong and whether they violated California law in the process.'' 
 As a group, the attorneys general have proved formidable opponents, most notably in the landmark litigation and multibillion-dollar settlement against tobacco makers in 1998. 
 To date, however, the rating agencies are undefeated in court, and aside from one modest settlement in a case 10 years ago, no one has forced them to hand over any money. Moody's, S.& P. and Fitch have successfully argued that their ratings are essentially opinions about the future, and therefore subject to First Amendment protections identical to those of journalists.
 But that was before billions of dollars in triple-A rated bonds went bad in the financial crisis that started last year, and before Congress extracted a number of internal e-mail messages from the companies, suggesting that employees were aware they were giving their blessing to bonds that were all but doomed. In one of those messages, an S.& P. analyst said that a deal ''could be structured by cows and we'd rate it.''
 Recent cases, like the suit filed Friday, are founded on the premise that the companies were aware that investments they said were sturdy were dangerously unsafe. And if analysts knew that they were overstating the quality of the products they rated, and did so because it was a path to profits, the ratings could forfeit First Amendment protections, legal experts say.
 ''If they hold themselves out to the marketplace as objective when in fact they are influenced by the fees they are receiving, then they are perpetrating a falsehood on the marketplace,'' said Rodney A. Smolla, dean of the Washington and Lee University School of Law. ''The First Amendment doesn't extend to the deliberate manipulation of financial markets.''
 The 73-page complaint, filed on behalf of Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund, the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System and other groups, claims that in recent years the rating agencies abandoned their role as impartial referees as they began binging on fees from deals involving mortgage-backed securities. 
 At the root of the problem, according to the complaint, is the business model of rating agencies, which are paid by the issuers of the securities they are paid to appraise. The lawsuit, and many critics of the companies, have described that arrangement as a glaring conflict of interest.
 ''Given that the rating agencies did not receive their full fees for a deal unless the deal was completed and the requested rating was provided,'' the attorney general's suit maintains, ''they had an acute financial incentive to relax their stated standards of 'integrity' and 'objectivity' to placate their clients.''
 To complicate problems in the system of incentives, the lawsuit states, the methodologies used by the rating agencies were outdated and flawed. By the time those flaws were obvious, nearly half a billion dollars in pension and retirement funds had evaporated in Ohio, revealing the bonds to be ''high-risk securities that both issuers and rating agencies knew to be little more than a house of cards,'' the complaint states.

HEADLINE: In Britain, Visions of Japan's Decade of Stagnation

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Britain may finally be emerging from recession, but many analysts warn that it is a false dawn. In fact, they argue, the economy here is so ravaged by growing debts and ruined banks that it could well be following in the steps of Japan's lost decade of the 1990s.
 The parallels are eerie: Like Japan, Britain enjoyed more than a decade of booming growth, fed by aggressive bank lending and real estate investments. Haunted by the comparison, policy makers have been extra aggressive in using fiscal and monetary levers in hope of preventing the stagnation and banking stasis that plagued Japan for so many years. 
 Some economic indicators over the last week have been positive: an uptick in retail sales, fewer jobs lost and an export revival. Yet analysts say they may well turn out to be teasers that cloak deeper, more structural flaws in the economy.
 In addition to rising debt, the tax base is collapsing and the crippled banking industry has yet to show it can generate profit by lending to companies.
 ''We expect 1 percent growth next year and 0.7 percent in 2011,'' said Douglas McWilliams of the Center for Economic and Business Research in London. ''Technically, it's a recovery -- but it's a very weak economy indeed.''
 Comparisons with Japan have been made in the United States as well, but some analysts say they think the more appropriate analogy is Britain, given the similarly pronounced contribution of the banking industry to their respective economies.
 The prospect of a period of Japan-like stagnation in Britain was publicly aired last month by a senior member of the monetary policy committee of the Bank of England, Adam S. Posen, who was appointed in June.
 An American and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, Mr. Posen was speaking as an outside expert on Japan's lost decade. He noted that his views were his alone and not those of the bank.
 But they carry the weight of one of the decision makers at the central bank, which has been buying billions of pounds worth of government bonds, known as gilts, to inject liquidity into the economy, a policy called quantitative easing. 
 ''The United Kingdom has an uncomfortable parallel with the Japanese financial system when the Japanese economy began to recover in the mid-1990s and was unable to sustain it,'' Mr. Posen said in his speech. 
 While defending the quantitative easing as necessary and noninflationary, Mr. Posen pointed out that the Bank of England's huge purchases of gilts -- it now owns 30 percent of those outstanding -- is in itself a consequence of the British financial system's inadequacy in providing credit to businesses through the issuance of corporate bonds.
 In another similarity to Japan, the capitalization of Britain's private-sector bond market as a proportion of gross domestic product is very low -- 0.16 percent, the smallest among the Group of 7 economies and well behind the 1.2 percent in the United States.
 For a financial system heralded as one of the world's most sophisticated, the statistic is eye-opening. It raises the possibility that credit-starved companies, dependent on still-wobbly British banks, may not get the capital they need. That potentially could bring about a double-dip recession or stagnation.
 Mr. McWilliams, of the Center for Economic and Business Research, forecast that bank lending to companies would decrease over the next two years. 
 Mr. Posen argued that the Bank of England's purchases of gilts were unavoidable because the bank needed to bring liquidity to the private bond market. 
 But a growing number of bearish analysts view the bank's buying spree as perilous to British public finances. 
 The severity of the problem was underlined this week when the government disclosed an $:11 billion ($18.3 billion) borrowing figure for October, which brought the half-year tally to $:86.9 billion, the highest level since public records began in 1946. That makes it almost certain that the government's forecast of $:175 billion of borrowing for next year will be exceeded. It would produce a budget deficit of about 13 percent of G.D.P., nearly twice the average in the euro zone. 
 Simon White, a partner at Variant Perception, a London research firm that caters to hedge funds and wealthy individuals, takes an especially dire view. In a note to clients this week, Variant broached the prospect of a debt or currency crisis as the collapsing tax base -- too dependent on real estate, financial companies and the highly taxed rich -- leaves the government gasping for revenue but unable to raise taxes without destroying growth.
 Taken together with the already high levels of spending, the result is a deficit that grows even beyond 13 percent of G.D.P., further harming the country's fragile creditworthiness. Both Fitch and Standard & Poor's view the British economy as the most vulnerable to a downgrade out of the 20 or so countries that carry a triple-A rating.
 The Bank of England has already spent about $:200 billion, or $330 billion, buying British bonds, an amount equivalent to 14 percent of annual G.D.P. Once it stops doing so, interest rates are expected to rise immediately, driving down bond prices. That could prompt already skittish foreign investors, who hold more than 30 percent of government paper, to sell.
 To be sure, such an outlook is based on the premise that British politicians will be like their counterparts in Japan in the 1990s and not have the political will to tackle these economic problems. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, whose thin hope of a victory in next spring's general election rests upon a bankable recovery, has declared a ''go for growth'' political strategy. The Conservative Party has staked its legitimacy on decreasing debt.
 But it has not detailed its program, and some fear that the next government will have little time to get its house in order.
 ''The likelihood of a debt and sterling crisis is just not factored in,'' Mr. White said. On average, these events have occurred every 15 years since 1947, with the last one in 1992. ''If this gets out of control,'' he said, ''it will flip very quickly.''

HEADLINE: Albany Challenges Authorities

 BODY:
Gene Russianoff, a longtime advocate for New York City commuters, had a one-word reaction when he heard that state lawmakers had agreed to a measure reforming the state's 700-plus public authorities, including his special interest, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
 ''Hallelujah!'' Mr. Russianoff said. And we agree.
 Secretive and powerful, these agencies -- public, yet also independent -- have long been in desperate need of oversight. They govern and manage the state's public works, and they range from the transportation authority, which runs the city's subways, buses and trains, to the development agency for the town of Sidney, population 4,000. 
 The system of authorities was created almost 80 years ago to make it easier to build schools or operate public facilities without meddling by bureaucrats or the State Legislature. Robert Moses famously used them to create highways and other big-ticket ventures, and his abuses prompted modest reforms a few decades ago.
 But the authorities still do most of their business beyond public scrutiny, and it does not take long for secrecy to create problems. A few years ago, the authority running the Erie Canal quietly tried to sell development rights to some desirable land for a mere $30,000. The sale was swiftly canceled when it became public. 
 One of the most important aspects of the new measure, which has been approved by the Assembly but still needs to be passed officially by the Senate and signed by the governor, is that it would require vastly more transparency. It would create an independent budget office to oversee agency budgets and require the comptroller to review noncompetitive contracts. 
 Board members would be accountable only to the authorities and not to the politicians who appointed them. New guidelines would impose controls on authorities' enormous unofficial debt, estimated at $150 billion compared with the state's official debt of about $55 billion. 
 This important reform is a credit to Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester, and Ira Millstein, a prominent New York City lawyer and expert on corporate governance. Mr. Millstein headed a commission on authorities that outlined the need for this new law in 2006. Mr. Brodsky has been tenaciously pushing for it in Albany ever since.

HEADLINE: Hospital Falters as Refuge for Illegal Immigrants

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK; Yolanne Almanzar contributed reporting from Miami.

DATELINE: ATLANTA 

 BODY:
Each had crossed the border years before, smuggled across the desert by a coyote, never imagining the journey would lead to a drab and dusty clinic on the ninth floor of Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta. 
 Some knew before the crossing that they had diabetes or lupus or high blood pressure, but it was only after they arrived that their kidneys began to fail. To survive, they needed dialysis at a cost of about $50,000 a year, which their sporadic work as housekeepers, painters and laborers could not begin to cover.
And so they turned to Grady, a taxpayer-supported safety-net hospital that would provide dialysis to anyone in need, even illegal immigrants with no insurance or ability to pay. Every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday morning, the 15 or so patients would settle into their recliners, four to a room, and while away the monotonous three-hour treatments by chitchatting in Spanish. 
 That all changed on Oct. 4, when the strapped public hospital closed its outpatient dialysis clinic, leaving 51 patients -- almost all illegal immigrants -- in a life-or-death limbo. 
 For Grady, which has served Atlanta's poor for 117 years, it was an excruciating choice, a stark reflection of what happens when the country's inadequate health care system confronts its defective immigration policy.
 Like other hospitals, particularly public hospitals, Grady has been left to provide costly treatments to nonpaying illegal residents who most likely could not have obtained such care in their home countries. American taxpayers and health care consumers have borne the expense. 
 Over time, the mounting losses have compromised Grady's charitable mission, forcing layoffs, increases in fees and the elimination of services. 
 ''Years and years of providing this free care has led Grady to the breaking point,'' said Matt Gove, one of the hospital's senior vice presidents. ''If we don't make the gut-wrenching decisions now, there won't be a Grady later. Then, everyone loses.''
 But for the dialysis patients, the sudden end to their reassuring routine has prompted a panic.
 ''We didn't know what to do,'' said Ignacio G. Lopez, 23, who had been sustained by the clinic for more than three years. ''We can pass away if we stay like two weeks without dialysis. They were just sending us out to die.''
 The chairman of Grady's recently reconstituted board, A. D. Correll, has said the hospital would not let that happen. ''We made a commitment right up front that people are not going to die on the street because of these actions,'' said Mr. Correll, a former chairman of the Georgia-Pacific Corporation and a prominent civic leader here.
 Soccer and Telenovelas
 In fact, the future for many of the patients remains uncertain. Like most of the country's estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, they have little access to continuing health care, a reality not addressed by the legislation now under discussion in Washington. 
 Across the years, the Grady dialysis patients had forged a community, a family, really, of people who share a history and language, as well as a life-threatening condition. As the machines cleansed the toxins from their blood, they would talk about the scarcity of work, the ruthlessness of their disease and their hopes for a transplant. Some would sleep, while others crooned folksongs to drown out the snores. 
 Any given morning might find Mr. Lopez bickering with Fidelia G. Perez about whether to watch their soap operas, or telenovelas, in English or Spanish. From another chair, Rosa Lira, a frail grandmother, would look up from her prayer book to boast of the previous night's exploits by Club America, her favorite Mexican soccer team. Rosa Palma de Gamez, from El Salvador, would grin when Ismael Sagrero arrived with his trademark greeting -- ''Hola-hola!'' -- which had become his nickname.
 Now the patients are trying desperately to figure out their next steps. 
 With limited exceptions, illegal immigrants are ineligible for public insurance programs like Medicaid and Medicare and often cannot afford private coverage. When major illness strikes, they have few options but to go to emergency rooms, which are required by federal law to treat anyone whose health is deemed in serious jeopardy.
 Officials at Grady, which will provide more than $300 million in uncompensated care this year, estimate that as many as a fifth of its uninsured patients are illegal immigrants. Although the numbers are elusive, a national study by the RAND Corporation concluded that illegal immigrants account for about 1.3 percent of public health spending. 
 The recession has prompted some state and local governments to pare programs that benefit illegal immigrants. And although illegal immigrants may account for about seven million of the country's 46 million uninsured, the health care bills being negotiated by Congress exclude them from expansions of subsidized public insurance. (The House bill that passed on Nov. 7 would allow illegal immigrants to buy policies at full cost on government-run exchanges, while legislation being considered in the Senate would forbid it.)
 Calling it ''a horrible situation,'' Mr. Correll said that governments at all levels had decided that immigrants were not their problem. ''But somehow,'' he said, ''they've become Grady's problem, which seems totally unfair.''
 Some of the Grady dialysis patients have chosen to return to their countries, encouraged by the hospital's offer of free airfare, cash payments, three months of paid dialysis and assistance in seeking insurance or other long-term remedies. Others are trying their luck in states where Medicaid policies may be less restrictive.
 But most remain in Atlanta, taking full advantage of a last-minute offer by the hospital, in response to a lawsuit, to pay for three months of dialysis at commercial clinics. They are hopeful that the reprieve will buy time for the lawsuit to progress or for private dialysis providers to take them as charity cases.
 What they fear, however, is that their already fragile lives will soon be reduced to a frenzied search for their next dialysis, most likely in an emergency room after a descent into crisis. 
 Looking for a Better Life
 They need only look to Ms. Perez to see what the future may hold.
 After hearing that the clinic would close, Ms. Perez, 32, set out for Alabama on Sept. 6 because cousins told her they might be able to procure dialysis there. Grady was not yet offering its deal for three months of treatment, and instead gave her $1,300, enough to cover dialysis for a week or two. 
 Ms. Perez said the money was quickly spent on rent, food and transportation. After going without dialysis for 16 days, she walked into an emergency room near Birmingham, which found that the potassium levels in her blood were high enough to require immediate filtration. Eight days later, she did the same at another Birmingham hospital.
 ''They said this was the first and last time they would help me,'' she said. ''They told me I didn't have any right to be there.''
 She went back to the first hospital, where she was dialyzed again, and then found a third hospital that was willing to provide three treatments. A doctor there tried to find a private dialysis clinic that would accept her but came up empty, she said. 
 So she returned to Atlanta on Oct. 11, and underwent one more emergency treatment before agreeing to fly home to Mexico with assistance from Grady and a California company, MexCare, that the hospital has hired to helprepatriate interested patients. 
 Ms. Perez's parents live in Mexico and can care for her, but in many cases the patients' families and sources of support are in the United States. Some do not want to uproot their American-born children, or abandon their spouses or jobs. Often they do not trust the quality or availability of dialysis in Latin America. 
 Like other patients, Adolfo D. Sanchez, 31, said he was astonished to learn when his kidneys failed in 2004 that Grady would provide him ongoing dialysis without charge. A subsistence farmer in Mexico, he said he had paid a coyote $1,500 in 2001 to lead him on an eight-day trek across the Arizona border to Phoenix and then to Atlanta, where his sister had settled.
 Three years later, while working in construction, he found he could not keep down the small tacos he ate for lunch. A local clinic referred him to Grady, which diagnosed his kidney failure and placed him on dialysis.
 ''No place in Mexico would have offered dialysis for free,'' he said, sitting in the spare apartment he shares with his girlfriend and their 13-year-old son. ''It was better to be here. I am really grateful that this is possible in this country, because if I were in my country I would already have died'' 
 Bertha A. Montelongo, a 59-year-old widow who said she entered the United States illegally in 2005, started having seizures and shortness of breath about a month after arriving in Atlanta. 
 ''I came to look for a better life,'' she said, ''but then I became sick, and that was it.''
 A diabetic, Ms. Montelongo has survived for four years on dialysis, but lost her vision last December. That has made her dependent on her daughter, who baby-sits and sells homemade tamales; her son-in-law, an out-of-work landscaper; and her granddaughters. They live in a rented house in the suburbs where the mantel is lit with votives.
 For a blind woman, returning to Mexico, where few family members remain, is not an option, Ms. Montelongo and her family said. 
 ''All the people here on dialysis think the same thing,'' said her daughter, Letecia. ''They all think that if they go back to Mexico, they will die sooner. In Mexico, it's different. There, you have to pay.''
 Creating a Crisis on Purpose
 It has been different for the 25 or so United States citizens who were patients at the dialysis clinic. They were either already on Medicare or about to become eligible, and are thus being readily treated by private dialysis clinics. After a three-month waiting period, the federal insurance program covers anyone with end-stage renal disease, regardless of age, and pays 80 percent of the cost of dialysis. 
 But illegal immigrants are not eligible for Medicare, and legal immigrants must wait five years to qualify. A few states use emergency Medicaid programs to cover ongoing dialysis for certain illegal immigrants, but Georgia discontinued the practice in 2006. 
 That sent waves of uninsured dialysis patients from across the region to Grady, which is supported by direct appropriations from Fulton and DeKalb Counties, ostensibly to care for their own residents. The hospital lost $3.5 million on the dialysis clinic last year, said Mr. Gove, the Grady spokesman. Its 88 dialysis patients accounted for a 10th of total losses at a hospital with more than 800,000 patient visits a year, he said.
 The board acted, Mr. Correll said, because Grady's dialysis equipment had become obsolete, requiring heavy investment. It was evident, given that so many patients were undocumented and uninsured, that the losses would never stop.
 ''It was just financially hopeless,'' Mr. Correll said. ''For every vacancy that opened up, another nonpaying patient would walk in the door, so it was going to last forever.''
 Mr. Correll said the hospital ''had to precipitate a crisis'' in the hope that other hospitals, dialysis centers and governments might pitch in. 
 Each of the remaining patients has signed an agreement stipulating that Grady will pay for private dialysis provided by Fresenius Medical Services for no more than three months, Mr. Gove said. The patients agreed to work with the hospital during that period to devise long-range plans for their care, possibly including repatriation.
 What Grady has not told the patients is that its contract with Fresenius, which sets a price of $280 per treatment, covers their care for up to one year. Mr. Gove said the contract gave Grady the flexibility to continue paying for patients who fail to make other arrangements by Jan. 3. But he said the hospital's offer to arrange repatriation would end at that point.
 ''As patients, they are ultimately responsible for their care,'' Mr. Gove said. 
 The hospital's agreement with MexCare, obtained through a state open records request, calls for Grady to pay $18,000 for every patient relocated -- $6,750 in travel expenses and escort fees, a $750 administrative fee, and payment for 30 dialysis treatments at $350 each. 
 Two years ago, the Grady board, then dominated by political appointees, undercut its chief executive's plan to close the dialysis clinic. The new board, now led by business leaders, hopes to save the hospital by convincing corporations and other potential donors that its fiscal discipline is worthy of support.
 Mr. Correll said closing the dialysis clinic was ''important to the future financial and operational success of Grady, because people have confidence now that the board will make a tough decision if it has to, and do it in the most humane way possible.'' 
 When Mr. Lopez first showed up at Grady in 2006, five years after he had crossed into Arizona at age 15, his disease had turned his skin a pallid gray. The doctors told him he was lucky he had not waited another day. 
 The charge for the initial hospital stay ran to $40,000; he said his stack of bills now totaled more than $100,000. ''I try to pay little by little,'' he said, ''but I'm never going to finish.''
 He said he had never expected such generosity from American health care, calling it ''very humane.'' After each dialysis treatment at Grady, he said, he would thank the nurses. 
 ''You saved my life,'' he would tell them. ''One more time, you saved my life.''
 THE BREAKING POINT: This is the first in a series of articles about closing the dialysis unit at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta.

HEADLINE: At $145 a Session, Tips for the Admission Test ... to Kindergarten

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN

 BODY:
Kayla Rosenblum sat upright and poised as she breezed through the shapes and numbers, a leopard-patterned finger puppet resting next to her for moral support. 
 But then came something she had never seen before: a visual analogy showing a picture of a whole cake next to a slice of cake. What picture went with a loaf of bread in the same way?
 Kayla, who will be 4 in December, held her tiny pointer finger still as she inspected the four choices. ''Too hard,'' she peeped. 
 Test preparation has long been a big business catering to students taking SATs and admissions exams for law, medical and other graduate schools. But the new clientele is quite a bit younger: 3- and 4-year-olds whose parents hope that a little assistance -- costing upward of $1,000 for several sessions -- will help them win coveted spots in the city's gifted and talented public kindergarten classes. 
 Motivated by a recession putting private schools out of reach and concern about the state of regular public education, parents -- some wealthy, some not -- are signing up at companies like Bright Kids NYC. Bright Kids, which opened this spring in the financial district, has some 200 students receiving tutoring, most of them for the gifted exams, for up to $145 a session and 80 children on a waiting list for a weekend ''boot camp'' program. 
 These types of businesses have popped up around the country, but took off in New York City when it made the Otis-Lennon School Ability Test, or Olsat, a reasoning exam, and the Bracken School Readiness Assessment, a knowledge test, the universal tests for gifted admissions beginning in 2008.
 Kayla's session at Bright Kids was an initial assessment; her mother, Jena Rosenblum, had not decided whether to put her through a full course of tutoring. She was considering it at the suggestion of Kayla's preschool teacher. ''Even though we live in the West Village and there are great public schools, obviously, any opportunity to step it up a notch in caliber, we would like to try,'' Ms. Rosenblum said. 
 Melisa Kehlmann said her main concern was that her 4-year-old son, Adrian, would be shut out of the well-regarded but overcrowded schools in her Manhattan neighborhood.
 ''It's quite pricey, but compared to private school, which averages about $20,000 for kindergarten, the price is right,'' she said of the tutoring. ''I just want the opportunity to have a choice.''
 Private schools warn that they will look negatively on children they suspect of being prepped for the tests they use to select students, like the Educational Records Bureau exam, or E.R.B., even though parents and admissions officers say it quietly takes place. (Bright Kids, for example, also offers E.R.B. tutoring.)
 ''It's unethical,'' said Dr. Elisabeth Krents, director of admissions at the Dalton School on the Upper East Side. ''It completely negates the reason for giving the test, which is to provide a snapshot of their aptitudes, and it doesn't correlate with their future success in school.''
 No similar message, however, has come from the public schools. In fact, the city distributes 16 Olsat practice questions to ''level the playing field,'' said Anna Commitante, the head of gifted and talented programs for the city's Department of Education.
 As for parents doing more -- like hiring a tutor -- Ms. Commitante said she finds ''anything else a little too stressful for young kids'' but that ''we can't dictate what parents choose to do.'' 
 There is no state registry or licensing for these services, but an Internet search turns up numerous companies with names like Another Young Scholar, Junior Test Prep and Thinking to Learn. Harley Evans, the owner of Manhattan Edge Educational Programs, raised prices this year to $90 a session from $65, but still has his maximum load of 70 children. Daniel C. Levine, the founder of Exclusive Education, based in Manhattan, said that a few years ago, 2 percent of his clientele were children under 6. Now it is about 10 percent.
 ''It's the same phenomenon as with the SATs: a gradual rise in test prep, until it becomes the norm,'' said Emily Glickman, a Manhattan educational consultant. ''Given that the demand for high-stakes schools outstrips supply, that's what's happening.''
 Some of the thousands of students registered to take the gifted tests in January are also preparing at home. Bright Kids is selling a few hundred $90 workbooks per month, said Bige Doruk, the company's founder. Dr. Robin MacFarlane of Thinking to Learn said she was on track to sell more than a thousand $60 Olsat prep kits this year, though she advises parents against intensive cramming.
 Tutoring preschoolers is not quite the same as drilling high school students for the SAT. At Bright Kids, Kayla was initially stumped by the visual analogy, but once the tutor, Meredith Resnick, explained that she was looking at a whole-to-part relationship, she easily found the right answer: a slice of bread. ''You can see that when I scaffolded her, she knew it,'' Ms. Resnick said.
 Children often have to be trained to listen to questions from strangers and to sit still for about an hour, the time it takes to complete the two tests.
 ''If their mind isn't keyed into listening, the whole question can fly over their heads,'' said one tutor, a retired teacher in gifted programs. 
 She spoke on condition of anonymity because she has administered the test for the city and wants to do so again. 
 ''Some kids can do well without preparation, but children who are familiar have an edge,'' the tutor said. From an equity perspective, she said, ''it's ridiculous.''
 Ms. Commitante said the city had not noticed any bias due to test preparation. For this year's kindergarten class, 3,231 students scored in at least the 90th percentile, the minimum to qualify for a gifted program, a 45 percent increase from the year before. 
 But that rise was attributable to ''a variety of factors,'' including increased participation, she said: 14,822 took the tests, an increase of 19 percent. The percentage scoring 90 percent or higher rose to 22 percent from 18 percent.
 ''I would hope that parents make decisions around this program because they feel that this is an educational option that their child really needs, as opposed to, 'I have to get my child into this program because that's the only place where they are going to get a good education,' '' she said. ''I just don't think that's true -- we have a lot of really good schools.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 25, 2009

 CORRECTION:
Because of editing errors, an article on Saturday about an increase in test preparation programs for New York City preschoolers misstated the occupation of Meredith Resnick of Bright Kids NYC, who helped a 3-year-old with a visual analogy, and referred incorrectly to Robin MacFarlane, who said she expected to sell more than a thousand prep kits for a reasoning exam this year. Ms. Resnick is a supervisor of tutors, not a tutor herself, and Dr. MacFarlane developed a test study system for kindergartners; she does not work for Thinking to Learn, a company that sells enrichment materials.

HEADLINE: Protect the Farm, Tax the Manor

BYLINE: By RAY D. MADOFF. 
Ray D. Madoff, a professor at Boston College Law School, is the author of the forthcoming ''Immortality and the Law: The Rising Power of the American Dead.''

DATELINE: Newton, Mass. 

 BODY:
 HOW do you tell a wealthy heiress from a family farmer? It sounds like the setup for a joke. But in fact it is the fundamental problem underlying sensible reform of the federal estate tax. 
 Members of Congress are hoping to revise the current law on the estate tax by the end of this year; if they don't, the estate tax will disappear for a year. Lawmakers should use the opportunity to solve the farmer/heiress riddle once and for all and move our tax system closer to the values on which the country was founded -- that hard work should be rewarded and power should not be conferred by birth. 
 The last time the estate tax was changed was in 2001. At that time, President George W. Bush and the Republican Congress sought to repeal the estate tax immediately, but settled for establishing gradual changes, which over eight years increased the amount of an inheritance that could pass free of tax to $3.5 million from $1 million, and reduced the maximum estate tax rate to 45 percent from 55 percent. Next year, the law calls for there to be no estate tax at all. Then, in 2011, everything is to abruptly reverse course, returning to pre-2001 tax act levels: a $1 million exemption and a 55 percent tax rate. 
 Policymakers agree that this here today, gone tomorrow and back again structure should not stand. But what should be done? 
 Proponents of the estate tax, mainly Democrats, argue that we should return to lower exemptions and higher rates so that the wealthy can contribute much-needed dollars to the nation's recovery.
 Opponents, mainly Republicans, argue that there should be no estate tax at all, not just next year but forever, because of the burden on small-business owners. 
 President Obama has proposed a middle course: blocking the scheduled 2010 repeal but making permanent the $3.5 million exemption and the 45 percent tax rate we have now. That would mean less revenue from estate taxes over the next 10 years than if Congress did nothing to change the 2001 law -- an estimated $233 billion less. Moreover, this approach would leave in place the Achilles' heel of the estate tax -- its potential harm to family farms and small businesses -- while providing an unnecessary giveaway to Americans who least need it. 
 Instead, Congress and the president should forge a different compromise that would respond to the concern for the family farmer and business owner, but still impose appropriate taxes on the wealthy heiresses -- and heirs -- of America. 
 What's needed, to begin with, is a special rule to facilitate the transfer of family farms and small businesses from one generation to the next. While experts disagree on whether the estate tax has in fact impeded such transfers, the idea that it could is bothersome to Americans. It is important to us that children be able, if they so desire, to carry on the work of their parents. Thus, it is appropriate for the estate tax to have a large exemption for family businesses -- perhaps as much as $10 million, and indexed to rise with inflation. 
 In order to ensure that this benefit goes to the right taxpayers, the law should require that both the transferring and receiving generations participate in the business or farm for several years and that the enterprise make up a significant portion of the estate. 
 Sound complicated? Fortunately, the hard work in drafting this provision has already been done. From 1997 to 2001, the law included a similar rule for family-owned businesses. Its protections were too limited, however, providing a maximum exemption of only $675,000 -- not enough to cover many farms and small businesses. By raising the maximum exemption, President Obama and Congress could resolve the family-farmer and small-business problem for good. 
 Then, we could have a meaningful debate about the appropriate tax for inherited wealth. There is a big difference between wealth acquired through hard work and creativity and wealth bestowed as an accident of birth, and Congress should not be afraid to make this distinction. Keep in mind that inherited wealth is completely free of income taxes. Thus, while a person who earns $200,000 by working must contribute more than $50,000 in federal taxes, a person who inherits $200,000, or even $200 million, pays no income taxes at all. 
 The estate tax system provides an essential counterpoint to this giveaway. American estate tax rates have been as high as 77 percent, so 55 percent would be reasonable when coupled with a general exemption of $1 million to $2 million.
 For too long, the family farm and business issue has served as a distraction, preventing sensible estate tax reform. Congress should get this issue off the table, so that wealthy heirs can contribute their fair share.

HEADLINE: An American Catastrophe

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

DATELINE: Detroit 

 BODY:
 In many ways, it's like a ghost town. It's eerily quiet. Driving around in the middle of the afternoon, in a city that once was among the most productive on the planet, you see very little traffic, minimal commercial activity, hardly any pedestrians.
 What you'll see are endless acres of urban ruin, block after block and mile after mile of empty and rotting office buildings, storefronts, hotels, apartment buildings and private homes. It's a scene of devastation and disintegration that stuns the mind, a major American city that still is home to 900,0000 people but which looks at times like a cross between postwar Berlin and the ruin of an ancient civilization. 
 Detroit was the arsenal of democracy in World War II and the incubator of the American middle class. It was the city that taught mass production to the rest of the world. It was a place that made cars, trucks and other tangible products, not derivatives. And it was the architect of the quintessentially American idea of putting people to work and paying them a decent wage. It's frightening to think seriously about what we've allowed to happen to this city and what is now happening to the middle class and the American economy as a whole.
 I was in Detroit with Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who specializes in labor issues. He grew up in Detroit and his love for the city and its people are palpable, as is his grief for the horrors the city has endured.
 The popular narrative of what happened to Detroit contains a great deal of truth but its focus is too narrow to account for the astonishing decline of this former industrial colossus. Yes, there were the riots of 1967, and white flight; and political leadership that was not just shortsighted but at times embarrassingly incompetent and corrupt. And, yes, the auto industry was a case study in self-destruction.
 But as Mr. Shaiken points out, Detroit was still viable enough for the Republican Party to hold its convention here in 1980, when it nominated Ronald Reagan. And it was not the riots, but the devastating recession of the early '80s that really knocked the city senseless. ''That's when the place really cracked,'' said Mr. Shaiken, ''and that was about aggressive globalization and the lack of an industrial policy, not the riots.''
 Detroit and its environs are suffering the agonies of the economic damned because of policies, crafted at the highest national and corporate levels, that resulted in the implosion of crucially important components of America's manufacturing base. Those decisions have had a profound effect on the fortunes not just of Detroit, or even Michigan, but the entire U.S. economy.
 ''We've been living with the illusion that manufacturing -- making things -- is so 20th century,'' said Mr. Shaiken, ''and that we could succeed by concentrating, for example, on complex financial instruments while abandoning the industrial base that sustained so many American families.''
 The idea that the fallout from the wrongheaded economic concepts of the past 30 or 40 years could be contained, with the damage limited to the increasingly troubled urban areas while sparing prosperous suburbia, has now proved as phony as Bernie Madoff's fortune. Americans, whether they live in big cities, suburban towns or rural areas, need jobs, and when those jobs are eliminated (for whatever reasons -- technological advances, globalization) without being replaced, the national economy is guaranteed at some point to hit a wall.
 Professor Shaiken and I drove past vast lots filled with rubble and garbage and weeds, past the old Michigan Central Terminal, which was once Detroit's answer to New York's Grand Central Terminal but which has long since been abandoned; past a onetime Cadillac manufacturing plant that is now an empty lot.
 We stopped at an old Ford plant and stood in a stiff, cold wind, reading a plaque put up by the Michigan Historical Commission: ''Here at his Highland Park plant, Henry Ford began the mass production of automobiles on a moving assembly line. By 1915 Ford built a million Model T's. In 1925 over 9,000 were assembled in a single day. Mass production soon moved from here to all phases of American industry and set the pattern of abundance for 20th century living.''
 Professor Shaiken's grandfather, Philip Chapman, took a job at the Highland Park plant in 1914, earning five dollars a day, and worked on production at Ford until his retirement in the mid-1950s.
 We're at a period no less significant to the U.S. than Mr. Chapman's early years at Ford. We need a revitalized industrial policy, including the creation of whole new industries, if American families are to prosper in the coming decades. If there is any sense of urgency about this in the hearts and minds of our corporate and government leaders, I've missed it.

HEADLINE: U.S. FEARS IRAQIS WILL NOT KEEP UP REBUILT PROJECTS

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS; Duraid Adnan contributed reporting from Basra, John Leland from Baghdad and Iraqi employees of The New York Times from Basra, Hilla and Kut.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
In its largest reconstruction effort since the Marshall Plan, the United States government has spent $53 billion for relief and reconstruction in Iraq since the 2003 invasion, building tens of thousands of hospitals, water treatment plants, electricity substations, schools and bridges.
 But there are growing concerns among American officials that Iraq will not be able to adequately maintain the facilities once the Americans have left, potentially wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and jeopardizing Iraq's ability to provide basic services to its people.
 The projects run the gamut -- from a cutting-edge, $270 million water treatment plant in Nasiriya that works at a fraction of its intended capacity because it is too sophisticated for Iraqi workers to operate, to a farmers' market that farmers cannot decide how to share, to a large American hospital closed immediately after it was handed over to Iraq because the government was unable to supply it with equipment, a medical staff or electricity.
 The concern about the sustainability of the projects comes as Iraq is preparing for pivotal national elections in January and as rebuilding has emerged as a political imperative in Iraq, eclipsing security in some parts of the country as the main anxiety of an electorate frustrated with the lack of social, economic and political progress. American forces are scheduled to begin withdrawing in large numbers next year. 
 In hundreds of cases during the past two years, the Iraqi government has refused or delayed the transfer of American-built projects because it cannot staff or maintain them, Iraqi and American government officials say. 
 Other facilities, including hospitals, schools and prisons built with American funds, have remained empty long after they were completed because there were not enough Iraqis trained to operate them.
 ''As large-scale construction projects -- power plants, water-treatment systems and oil facilities -- have been completed, there has been concern regarding the ability of Iraqis to maintain and fund their operations once they are handed over to the Iraqi authorities,'' said a recent analysis prepared for Congress by the Congressional Research Service. 
 The Government Accountability Office and the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction have also issued reports in the past several months about the potential failure of American-financed projects once they are transferred to Iraq.
 Stuart W. Bowen Jr., inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, said his watchdog agency had ''regularly raised concerns about the potential waste of U.S. taxpayer money resulting from reconstruction projects that were poorly planned, badly transferred, or insufficiently sustained by the Iraqi government.''
 The blame is shared, officials said. While Iraq has often been guilty of poor management, American authorities have repeatedly failed to ask Iraqis what sort of projects they needed and have not followed up with adequate training. 
 And whether or not the American-built health centers and power plants are ever used as intended, the American companies that won the lion's share of rebuilding contracts from the federal government have been paid.
 The Iraqi government, prodded by American officials here, has pledged to begin spending more of its own money on reconstruction, but the country is facing a substantial budget deficit because of declines in international oil prices.
 Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has insisted that reconstruction is the next task. What is not clear is where the $400 billion the government says it needs will come from.
 ''We will use the revenue we have from oil, but the government feels it has to do more than that to rebuild,'' said Ali al-Alak, an adviser to Mr. Maliki. 
 In the meantime, the Americans -- military and civilian reconstruction specialists alike -- continue to depart in large numbers, taking with them their money, equipment and expertise. 
 Despite the $53 billion spent by the United States, many Iraqis have criticized the rebuilding effort as wasteful. Ali Ghalib Baban, Iraq's minister of planning, said it had not had a discernible impact. ''Maybe they spent it,'' he said, ''but Iraq doesn't feel it.'' 
 Iraqis, for whom bombed-out buildings are an unremarkable part of urban existence, also say they have seen little evidence of rebuilding.
 ''Where is the reconstruction?'' asked Sahar Kadhum, a resident of Kut, about 100 miles southeast of Baghdad. ''The city is sleeping on hills of garbage.'' 
 Indeed, despite the billions in American funds, more than 40 percent of Iraqis still lack access to clean water, according to the Iraqi government. Ninety percent of Iraq's 180 hospitals do not have basic medical and surgical supplies, according to the aid organization Oxfam. Iraqis also have disproportionately high rates of infant mortality, cerebral palsy and cancer. 
 Exacerbating the problem, Iraqi and American officials say, is that hundreds of thousands of Iraq's professional class have fled or been killed during the war, leaving behind a population with too few doctors, nurses, engineers, scientists and the like. 
 In Hilla, 60 miles south of Baghdad, a recently completed $4 million maternity hospital built by the Americans is open, but the staff members cannot operate much of its equipment. 
 ''The building is fairly good and the Americans have provided the hospital with a variety of high-tech medical devices, but they did not pay attention to the training of doctors in how to use them,'' said Jawad al-Jubouri, a district officer.
 In Falluja, west of Baghdad, a $98 million wastewater treatment plant built by the United States serves only one-third of the homes it was intended to serve, because the Iraqi government has not supplied it with sufficient fuel, ''raising the possibility that the U.S. effort has been wasted,'' according to a special inspector general's report. 
 At Ibn Sina Hospital in Baghdad, which had been the American military's largest medical center in the country, Iraqi security forces took up guard positions even before the conclusion of a ceremonial transfer to the Iraqi government last month. The hospital, however, has been closed because the Health Ministry lacks the staff and equipment to reopen it, though the American military said it left $7.9 million in equipment behind.
 Iraq's most notorious reconstruction project might be the $165 million Basra Children's Hospital in the south, championed by Laura Bush when she was the first lady. Its completion has been delayed by more than four years, and the project is $115 million over budget. 
 Once the hospital opens -- perhaps next year -- there will be too few doctors and other medical staff members to take advantage of much of its modern equipment. 
 ''It was supposed to open in March, but I don't think it will be ready,'' said Ahmed Qassim, the hospital's director. He added: ''Maybe July, but we don't know. Maybe not July.''

HEADLINE: Shares Finish Lower on Doubts About Recovery

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The stock market finished slightly lower on Friday as investors worried about the speed of the economic recovery and questioned the fast rise of technology stocks.
 It was a relatively quiet day on Wall Street, with no economic reports on the calendar, but traders still found reason for caution.
An earnings report from the computer maker Dell on Thursday showed a 54 percent drop in third-quarter profit and a 15 percent decline in revenue, falling short of expectations. Those results shook investors, who had come to expect spectacular gains in technology shares. Dell's stock fell 10 percent. 
 Technology stocks, with shares of luxury-goods and energy companies like General Electric, drove the declines on Wall Street.
 The major indexes fell in the morning and then made up some ground as health care stocks posted gains. The Dow Jones industrial average briefly crossed into positive territory in the last half-hour of trading, but by the closing bell, it had fallen 14.28 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,318.16. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 3.52 points, 0.3 percent, to 1,091.38, while the Nasdaq composite index dipped 10.78 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,146.04.
 The dollar rose against other world currencies, hitting slightly below $1.49 against the euro. Treasury prices fell as yields rose. Oil fell slightly to $76.72 a barrel, contributing to declines in energy stocks. Gold climbed to $1,150 an ounce even as the dollar gained strength, a trend analysts attributed to speculation that the dollar would continue to weaken.
 Worries over the strength of the underlying economy seemed to make investors cautious, leaving some analysts wondering whether a remarkable eight-month rally might be showing signs of retreat.
 Joseph Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading, noted that while the number of shares trading hands on Wall Street was up from a year ago, much of the activity could be attributed to high-frequency traders, not longer-term investors.
 ''We have a market that is propped up on hope and short-term-type trading,'' Mr. Saluzzi said. ''Once investors start to lose confidence, and people realize you're not necessarily going to see a vibrant economy soon, this could unravel quickly.''
 He noted, however, that the market had been extremely volatile recently. ''We've seen market character change a few times, only to change and run right back up,'' he added.
 But Carmine Grigoli, chief investment strategist at Mizuho Securities USA, said there was little evidence that the stock market had turned overly optimistic.
 ''We have yet to see the widespread optimism and the high levels of public participation characteristic of a speculative market,'' he wrote in a research note on Friday. ''In fact, the public remains remarkably uninvolved and skeptical about the bull market.''
 Technology stocks declined as investors began to doubt whether 2010 profits would meet expectations. David G. Dietze, president and chief investment strategist at Point View Financial Services, said investors flocked to technology stocks in recent months because those stocks tended to be globally diversified and insulated from the booms and busts of particular countries.
 ''There has been a fabulous run,'' Mr. Dietze said. ''Now these earnings estimates are making investors think maybe the market has pushed these stocks too far too fast.''
 He said concern over the fundamental health of the economy was also driving stocks lower, pointing to news on Friday that D. R. Horton, the home builder, projected a dim outlook for the housing market. Shares of D. R. Horton fell more than 15 percent, closing at $10.38. 
 In addition, the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, signaled that it might be time for policy makers across the world to gradually reduce injections of emergency cash into struggling economies.
 ''Emergency treatment and strong medicines are sometimes necessary, but if their use is prolonged, they can lead to dependence and even addiction,'' Mr. Trichet said, according to Reuters.
 An odd quirk of the markets startled some traders on Friday, as the yield on three-month Treasury bills briefly turned slightly negative. It hovered near zero for most of the day.
 On Thursday, the yield slipped below zero for the first time since the height of the financial crisis in 2008. The negative yield last year was a sign of desperation as investors rushed to a haven in Treasury bills, in effect paying to keep money secure.
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 8/32, to 100 2/32, and the yield rose to 3.37 percent from 3.34 percent.
 Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average closed down 0.5 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.3 percent, Germany's DAX index declined 0.7 percent and France's CAC-40 dropped 0.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Ann Taylor Reports Profit, But Sees Soft Holiday Sales

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The clothing retailer Ann Taylor Stores posted a better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter profit on Friday, but shares fell as the company forecast soft sales for the holiday shopping season. 
 Sales missed expectations, with both the Ann Taylor and Ann Taylor Loft chains reporting declines as its mature female customers continue to spend cautiously. Shares fell 1.4 percent.
 The company said fourth-quarter sales and margins would be slightly below those of the third quarter because it expected to increase promotions to drive sales throughout the holiday shopping period.
 Still, margins will be higher than a year earlier, when the financial crisis led to steep markdowns for the whole industry.
 Ann Taylor said net profit was $2.1 million, or 3 cents a share, in the quarter, in contrast to a net loss of $13.4 million, or 24 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding one-time items, profit was 20 cents a share, topping Wall Street forecasts of 7 cents a share.
 Sales in the period, which ended Oct. 31, fell 12 percent, to $462.4 million, missing analysts' estimate of $473.9 million.
 The company's gross margin was 57.3 percent, 8.5 percentage points higher than in the year-earlier period.
 Stock in Ann Taylor, which is based in New York, fell 19 cents, to $13.62 a share.
 The chief executive, Kay L. Krill, said third-quarter sales were weakest in August, when inventories were lightest before new fall merchandise entered stores.
 For the fourth quarter, the company said it expected comparable-store sales to fall at a low- to mid-teen percentage rate at Ann Taylor and to range from flat to slightly up at Loft.

HEADLINE: From Leader to Laggard In Just Over a Decade

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE American stock market has soared 64 percent since it hit bottom eight months ago. 
 And that leaves it just where it was more than 11 years ago.
 The United States stock market was the world leader in the great bull market of the late 1990s, but more recently it has been a laggard, in large part because of the weakness of the dollar. As the accompanying charts show, a stock investor looking for a part of the world to invest in back in 1998 -- and to hold onto until now -- could not have done worse than to choose the United States. 
 The charts show the movement of the Standard &Poor's 500 and the S.& P. International 700 in the period since the American index first reached 1,100 on March 24, 1998. The International 700, which encompasses the non-American stocks in the S.& P. Global 1,200, rose much faster in the middle of this decade, then fell faster in the global recession. But since prices bottomed, it has leaped more than 80 percent.
 For the entire period, an investor was better off in emerging markets than in the developed world. The segments of the global index representing Latin America, Australia and emerging Asian countries have soared. The Canadian index also more than doubled, thanks largely to natural resources stocks.
 But prices, as measured in local currencies, are lower now than in 1998 for both the S.& P. Europe 350 and the S.& P./Topix 150, covering Japan. Measured in American dollars, as shown in the charts, those markets posted gains of 20 percent and 7 percent, respectively, because of currency movements.
 On a sector basis, the best place to be over that period, both in the United States and globally, was in energy stocks. Oil prices fell to just above $10 a barrel in late 1998, and few investors saw value in the area. More recently, oil company profits set records as crude soared well above $100 a barrel, and even after the global downturn the price is more than $70.
 Financial stocks have suffered more in the United States than in the rest of the world, but the credit crisis brought down many banks in other regions as well.
 The charts also show 15 well-known companies from around the globe whose share prices are at least 300 percent higher than they were in 1998, and 15 such companies whose prices are less than half what they were then.
 Those lists show that performances can vary wildly within an industry. While British Airways and All Nippon Airways make the losers list, Ryanair of Ireland was a big winner. Fiat and Ford were losers, while Hyundai shares leaped. Makers of communication equipment include Research in Motion, the producer of BlackBerry phones, which is up more than 8,000 percent, and Alcatel-Lucent, which is down almost 90 percent.

But other major stocks around the world, included in the S. & P. International 700, are now about a third higher than they were in 1998. (Sources: Standard & Poor's, Bloomberg)

HEADLINE: How to Find Mental Health Care When Money Is Tight

BYLINE: By LESLEY ALDERMAN

 BODY:
IMAGINE this situation. You fall into a deep malaise. Friends say you need help, but you don't have insurance (or the insurance you do have has very limited mental health benefits), and you worry that extra bills will only add to your malaise. So you do nothing.
 And that's what many people do. According to a recent survey by the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (Samhsa, pronounced SAM-suh) , the leading reason that people with mental health issues don't seek treatment is cost. They fear the fees. 
 ''There's a misperception that care is always expensive, but that's not the rule,'' said John Draper, a psychologist and the project director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (800 273-TALK), a free 24-hour service supported by the federal government. ''There are plenty of ways to get help,'' he said. ''Some of them are very affordable.'' 
 But while affordable mental care exists, it's not always easy to find or get immediate access to.
 Two weeks ago, I wrote about how people with insurance can navigate the mental health system to get the help they need at prices they can afford. This week, I offer advice for those without insurance, or with only minimal coverage, on how to find low-cost mental health care.
 MILDLY STRESSED? ''Not all mental health problems require a professional therapist,'' says Michael B. Friedman, a social worker and an adjunct professor at Columbia University's School of Social Work in Manhattan. For instance, if you just lost your job and you're worrying constantly and sleeping poorly, you may be in a transient state of unease that will abate once your job hunt gains traction.
 If you're feeling depressed or anxious, but still coping relatively well, try making changes on your own (rather than spending money on a pro). 
 ''Committing to one small change a week, like getting an extra hour of sleep or walking for 30 minutes a day, can go a long way toward improving your state of mind,'' said Karina Davidson, a clinical psychologist and director of the Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health at Columbia University. 
 The change itself, combined with making the commitment to change, can have a subtle but profound effect on your mental health, said Ms. Davidson, who conducts research on the effect that depression has on cardiovascular disease.
 Another low-cost but very effective strategy, Mr. Friedman said, is to join a support group that addresses the problem you are struggling with, whether it's job loss or an eating disorder. ''People get tremendous benefit from interaction with others,'' he said. To find support groups in your area, contact the local affiliate of the nonprofit group Mental Health Americaand ask for a referral. 
 If a close relative has a drinking problem, consider attending Al-Anon meetings where you can share your feelings and listen to the stories of others in a similar situation. Or if you yourself have a drinking problem, attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings can be incredibly useful.
 If time is an issue or you can't find a support group near you, consider an online group. Psych Central, a mental health resource site, is host to 150 online support groups and monitors each one to ensure that they are protected and secure, according to the site's founder, John Grohol. Notably, over the last year, activity on the site's unemployment and job search groups has increased to about 750 a day, Mr. Grohol said, up from 500 or so previously.
 If you want a more intimate therapeutic relationship, and you belong to a congregation, do consider seeing your pastor. Pastors typically take courses in counseling, and some even have counseling degrees. 
 ''It's not medical care, but it can be very therapeutic,'' says William J. Hudock, a special expert at the Center for Mental Health Services, a division of Samhsa. 
 TROUBLE COPING? How do you know when it's time for professional help? ''If you can't get your act together,'' said Mr. Friedman. 
 For instance, you should be job hunting, but you're sitting in front of the TV all day. Other signs are symptoms like chronic insomnia, overeating or undereating, or lack of interest in your favorite activities or sports teams.
 If you are employed and your company offers an employee assistance program, take advantage of it. It's free, and they can typically set you up with three or so sessions with a therapist.
 If you have a good relationship with your primary care physician, you could see him or her. Your doctor may be able to refer you to a local mental health center for therapy, and maybe consider medication to help you out of your immediate funk. Doctors may also know of psychologists who see patients on a sliding fee scale.
 If you don't have a doctor you like or you want an evaluation by a mental health professional, look for local universities that have graduate programs in social work or clinical psychology. You can often get treated by graduate students who are being closely supervised, at less than the going rates.
 Some private counseling centers also offer variable fees. For instance, at the Ackerman Institute for the Family, a nonprofit counseling center in Manhattan, families with limited means are charged fees based on their income. 
 ''We are not going to turn someone away based on their ability to pay,'' says Lois Braverman, president of the institute.
 If your child is having trouble, seek out the child psychologist at his or her school. This can be a great first-line treatment and it doesn't cost a thing, said Mr. Hudock. Or talk to your pediatrician, who might know of affordable parenting classes or sources of low-cost care in your area.
 If the problem relates to substance abuse, call 1-(800) 662-HELP, a federal help line for obtaining information on substance abuse treatment services.
 IN CRISIS OR SUICIDAL? When you or someone you know is in crisis, you can go to the nearest emergency room for immediate help. You can also call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (800-273-TALK) where you will be connected to the nearest crisis center in your area. 
 The Web site for Lifeline also has valuable information on how to cope with mental health crises, like how to arrange for an involuntary psychiatric evaluation or spot warning signs for depression.
 You can use the Lifeline for any type of mental health crisis -- not just suicide, says Mr. Draper, who adds that ''70 percent of callers are not suicidal.'' The people answering the calls can determine what help you need and also refer you to a facility for treatment, whether it's a local hospital or a government-run mental health clinic. 
 In New York City, callers are referred to LifeNet (800 LIFENET). LifeNet answers about 10,000 calls a month. 
 In some areas of the country, dialing 211 can connect you with mental health crisis services in your area or help you find where to seek immediate help.
 A word of warning: When you are looking for low-cost care, you might face longer waits than when you are paying full fare (or your insurer is). But don't let this deter you from staying the treatment course. Untreated mental health issues can very often lead to serious (and even more costly) medical problems.

HEADLINE: Audit Finds Acorn Received Some Federal Grant Money Through Its Affiliates

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Justice Department has not awarded any federal grant money directly to the antipoverty group Acorn over the last seven years, but about $200,000 has made its way to the organization or its affiliates, according to an internal audit released Friday. 
 Acorn, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, is the largest neighborhood-based antipoverty group in the country, and has become a prime target for conservative critics. In recent months, government agencies have moved to distance themselves from the organization, and Congress has voted to ban future grants to it.
 The review added only a relatively minor amount of money to the $53 million in federal aid from other sources that Acorn was already known to have received since 1994. 
 The review was undertaken by the department's inspector general at the request of Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee.
 It found that Acorn had directly applied for five department grants since 2002, but that all five were denied. Still, some money reached the group or its affiliates through other grantees who sub-awarded it to Acorn to help carry out a program.
 For example, in 2008, Congress used an earmark to require the department to provide $290,663 for the Citizens Committee for New York City Inc., to run a crime-stoppers program. The committee in turn subcontracted with 21 groups, including a $20,000 contract with Acorn, to help coordinate meetings with the police and local communities. 
 And in the 2005 fiscal year, an Acorn affiliate, the New York Agency for Community Affairs Inc., received a Congressional earmark for a $138,130 department grant to provide youth leadership training to students in New York, to form ''ACORN Youth Union'' chapters, and to coordinate student campaigns on issues like neighborhood safety and school governance. 
 The review also found three other instances since 2002 in which grant recipients subcontracted to Acorn affiliates for thousands of dollars to provide assistance with anticrime and community revitalization efforts in poor neighborhoods of Chicago, Phoenix and St. Louis. 
 The department did not directly audit the subcontracts to Acorn or its affiliates, the inspector general found, although there were signs that some spending might not have been documented properly. It did, however, audit the New York Agency for Community Affairs grant, finding no significant problems.
 Acorn, which describes itself as a nonprofit social justice group, has offices across the country. It conducts voter registration drives and provides financial services to the poor.
 Conservatives have long complained about Acorn's voter drives in poor neighborhoods, citing instances in which workers filled out the paperwork fraudulently, like registering ''Mickey Mouse'' Acorn has argued that it is the real victim of such incidents, which its employees have often brought to the attention of the authorities.

HEADLINE: In Survey, Hard Times Before Slump

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Even before the recession, more than one in five Americans could not pay for basic needs without help from family, friends or outsiders, according to a survey by the Census Bureau. 
 Fourteen percent of all Americans and 26 percent of blacks who responded to the 2005 survey reported that at sometime in the preceding year they were not able to meet essential expenses on their own, like paying bills for basic needs, avoiding foreclosure and buying sufficient food.
 ''Presumably, this would be more severe than just being late with your utility payment,'' said Kurt J. Bauman, a bureau analyst.
 In addition to household income, a variety of measures of well-being were recorded in the bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation, which was released on Thursday.
 While 99 percent of the nation's 113 million households reported having a refrigerator and a stove, that means that more than a million households lacked those appliances. Ninety-nine percent also said they owned a television.
 The survey found that more American households had air conditioners and microwave ovens than computers. 
 Since 1998, the share of households with a personal computer increased to 67 percent, from 42 percent. The poor, the elderly and people without a high school diploma were least likely to own one. 
 Ninety percent owned landline telephones (down from 96 percent in 1998) and 71 percent owned cellphones (up from 36 percent). Among households headed by people under age 30, more owned cellphones (81 percent) than landlines (71 percent).
 Since the survey was conducted well before the recession started in December 2007, presumably many measures of economic well-being have since gotten worse. Still, 9 percent of households over all and more than 25 percent of those below the poverty line could not afford nutritionally adequate food without resorting to food pantries or other emergency supplies, or to scavenging. 
 Compared with the 1990s, people over all said they were more likely to expect help if they needed it from family, friends, social services agencies or religious institutions. Black and Hispanic respondents, though, were a little less likely to expect such help; blacks were a little more likely to have received it.
 Generally, people surveyed were more likely than in the 1990s to say they were satisfied with the safety and overall condition of their neighborhoods. Still, in 2005, 20 percent of blacks said they stayed at home because they were concerned about their safety, and 32 percent of blacks said they were afraid to walk alone at night.
 Because respondents were not asked to elaborate, some of the results seemed anomalous. Almost the same proportion of householders lacking medical insurance said they were as satisfied with health services as those who were insured.

HEADLINE: Putting The Fond In Farewell

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Few people have spent more time contemplating The Journey of Life than Oprah Winfrey, and on Friday she provided another useful tip in navigating it: Quit while you're ahead.
 At the current moment, this is not necessarily a thought for the masses. Unless something dramatic happens on the economic front, most of us are not going to be able to quit -- period.
But the greatest decision a stellar public figure can make is to resist the temptation to keep doing the same thing forever. Even if the fans don't want you to stop. 
 One day you're the champion of the world, the people's choice. Then, next thing you know, you're losing a unanimous decision to Trevor Berbick. Or putting ''Dictator for Life'' on your business cards.
 We are talking here about a timely and well-planned leave-taking -- like George Washington, refusing a third term. Or the end of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' 
 This is not to be confused with its evil twin sister, the Abrupt Rogue Departure. You cannot get yourself elected governor, serve for two and a half years, disappear for the better part of another and then announce you're quitting because nobody likes a lame duck. Well, it turns out you can, but it is a really, really bad idea.
 ''I love this show. This show has been my life. And I love it enough to know when it's time to say goodbye,'' Winfrey told her fans tearily. She's not actually leaving until the end of season 25, nearly two years from now. Talk about long-term planning. 
 However, if she really wanted to drive home how much her viewers were going to be losing, she might have picked a more inspiring lead-in to her announcement than a 20-minute interview with Ray Romano. (Along with a promo for an upcoming interview with a woman whose husband was addicted to porn.)
 It's been quite a run for the Oprah brand. The uber-guests, the good works. The Obama campaign. Her forays into books (we will really miss the book thing) and spirituality (not so much). She never coasted. 
 Her next step seems to involve a new cable TV channel. But since Winfrey has -- I believe this is an exact figure -- a trilliondy-billion dollars, she probably has more than one option.
 Her audience, of course, doesn't want her to move on. Americans are congenitally attached to too much of a good thing: ''Law & Order.'' Professional sports. Christmas. (The national calendar seems to be divided into two seasons: Baseball and Holiday Shopping.) 
 The idea that anything popular should stay around until we turn green at the sight of it is not, of course, confined to our culture. The British have Tony Blair and The Spice Girls Reunion Tour. 
 We do hate change. Even though we know that our demand for more of the same is a treacherous road that will eventually lead to Sharon Stone in ''Basic Instinct 2.'' 
 Nowhere is the need for the graceful exit more apparent than in our politics. This week Senator Robert Byrd turned 92. He has been in office for more than 50 years. That's an all-time record for Congress. In fact, it is probably a record for every deliberative body since Athens in the Age of Pericles.
 To be fair, this was not entirely his idea. The Democratic Party begged Byrd to stay and hang onto a seat that will probably fall to the opposition when he leaves. But still, this is not a record that we want to encourage other people to aspire to break.
 Nothing becomes a politician like a timely departure. If Rudy Giuliani had quit after 2001, we'd still think of him as America's Mayor instead of the worst presidential candidate in the history of the world. 
 Imagine how much better Joe Lieberman would look if he had called it a day after the vice presidential run. Or Ross Perot if he had stopped in 1992. 
 Mayor Michael Bloomberg hasn't even begun his controversial third term and already he seems to have shrunk to a pocketsize. 
 And what a revered figure Ralph Nader would be if he had called it quits back in the 1990s. He'd be an icon -- the pioneer of consumerism who had the corporation's number from the get-go, instead of the guy who robbed Al Gore of the presidency and then just wouldn't stop talking. He could have spent the last 15 years giving inspiring lectures to college students and now it would be time for the comeback tour. People would be flocking to hear him explain how the structure of the American economy failed its people in last year's collapse. 
 By the way, you can have a comeback tour if you retire gracefully. Just not one every single year.

HEADLINE: Unsteady Future For Broadcast

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO and BILL CARTER

 BODY:
Oprah Winfrey is fleeing broadcast television for cable. NBC, once arguably the biggest cultural tastemaker in the United States, is being shopped to Comcast, the country's largest cable company.
 Have we finally reached a tipping point that suggests a remarkable decline in the fortunes of broadcast television in America?
 In the NBC Universal deal, in which General Electric is negotiating to sell a majority stake of its media business to Comcast, it is the cable channels -- USA, Bravo, SyFy, MSNBC and CNBC -- that are seen as the most valuable, not the NBC broadcast network, which is mired in fourth place in the ratings among the four major networks.
 Most analysts and many executives agree that the economic model of broadcast television -- which relies much more heavily on advertising than cable -- is severely fractured. What they are wondering now is if it is irreparably broken. 
 ''It's in a period of huge transformation,'' said Horace Newcomb, a professor of telecommunications at the University of Georgia and the director of the Peabody Awards, which are awarded annually for excellence in radio and television broadcasting. ''It's in a state of confusion.''
 The business model of the big three networks -- which became four when Fox began prime-time programming in 1987 -- has for decades relied on a simple formula: spend millions on original programming that will attract advertiser dollars and later live on as lucrative reruns in syndication. 
 But ratings are going down. In the 1952-53 television season, more than 30 percent of American households that owned televisions tuned in to NBC during prime time, according to Nielsen. In the 2007-8 season, that figure was just 5.2 percent.
 The mass audience -- the bread and butter of broadcast networks -- has splintered into niches as viewers flock to alternative entertainment choices on the Internet, to video games and to cable channels dedicated to individual tastes, like Ms. Winfrey's forthcoming OWN, the Oprah Winfrey Network.
 And yet, programming remains expensive -- a network drama costs about $3 million for one hour -- and advertisers are becoming reluctant to pay ever-rising premiums for prime-time shows. All the networks have tried to adjust, putting on more reality programming, for example, that is cheaper to produce. 
 NBC made perhaps the biggest bet of all -- moving Jay Leno to prime time each night at 10, saving the millions it would have cost to develop a scripted show in that time spot. The Leno move has been the subject of intense scrutiny by the media, because Mr. Leno's ratings have lately fallen on several nights well below even the modest guarantees NBC made to advertisers.
 Nicholas P. Heymann, an analyst at Sterne, Agee & Leach who follows G.E., said that the consistently ineffective efforts to rebuild the prime-time portion of the NBC network might have led G.E. to begin thinking it was time to exit the entertainment business. And this one particular decision may have pushed G.E. over the edge, he said.
 ''I think the Leno move was the last straw,'' Mr. Heymann said, ''the last roll of the dice for G.E.'' 
 Mr. Heymann acknowledged that it seemed unlikely on its face that such a huge deal could hinge on one decision in one slice of an enormous company. But he said, ''It's the domino effect of the move, on the shows in front of 'Leno' and the late-night shows after it. I think G.E. decided, 'We can't go on doing this.' ''
 While networks have found it difficult to charge ever-higher advertising rates in the face of declining ratings, big cable channels -- like USA, TNT and TBS -- have flourished with the millions of dollars in subscription fees from cable operators that they receive, on top of advertising.
 ''The cable players have a robust affiliate fee stream that allows them to better finance original programming,'' said Anthony DiClemente, a media analyst at Barclays Capital. ''The main structural issue right now with broadcast is that the vast majority of revenues are from advertising.''
 Profit margins for cable networks are also much better than broadcast networks'. Derek Baine, a senior analyst at SNL Kagan, said big cable networks earned profit margins of 40 to 60 percent, while a good year for a broadcast network is a 10 percent profit margin.
 Illustrative of this is a comparison of NBC to ESPN, one of the most popular cable channels. Last year, revenue for the two networks was roughly equal. NBC, according to SNL Kagan, generated about $5.6 billion in advertising dollars; ESPN generated a total of about $6 billion in revenue -- $1.6 billion from advertising and $4.4 billion in subscriber fees. But ESPN was vastly more profitable. Its cash flow was about $1.4 billion, while NBC's was $304 million.
 ''The viewership continues to migrate from broadcast to cable,'' Mr. Baine said. ''Over time, advertisers have continued to pay premium prices for prime time, but over time the audiences continue to go down. Eventually you are going to hit an inflection point.''
 Perhaps the most steadfast defender of the broadcast model is Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS. He says he believes broadcasters can survive without the additional subscription fee revenue that goes to cable networks. He frequently points to the power of broadcasters both to reach mass audiences and to create assets unmatched by anything on the cable side of the business.
 Though he declined to comment for this article, Mr. Moonves, in an appearance at the Paley Center for Media in Manhattan earlier this week, said he had recently closed a deal for a new CBS drama, ''NCIS: Los Angeles,'' to sell its repeats for the impressive price of $2.35 million an episode. The buyer? USA network, which happens to be owned by NBC.
 The original ''NCIS'' is the most successful program on USA -- in repeat episodes.
 Mr. Moonves noted that the two NCIS editions taken together ''are a billion-dollar property.'' No show created on any cable network has been able to approach that level of revenue. ''My model isn't broken,'' he said.
 CBS executives have pointed out recently that the advertising market has started to show signs of revival. The so-called scatter market, where advertisers buy time on an individual commercial basis, is up about 25 percent, the CBS executives said.
 But the cultural implications of the decline of broadcast television may be as profound as the business forces at play. Gone are the days when the nation gathered around television sets in the evening to watch, say ''The Cosby Show'' or ''All in the Family'' and then chat about it the next day at work.
 Broadcast television was ''a place, an arena, where ideas were presented in a fashion in which people could become attached to or explore,'' said Mr. Newcomb, the professor.
 ''Issues with civil rights and the women's movement were embedded into entertainment programs and people would see them and either accept it or reject it,'' he said. ''Today, you can watch TV and not have to be challenged.''

HEADLINE: NEW CONSENSUS VIEWS STIMULUS AS WORTHY STEP

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Now that unemployment has topped 10 percent, some liberal-leaning economists see confirmation of their warnings that the $787 billion stimulus packagePresident Obama signed into law last February was way too small. The economy needs a second big infusion, they say.
 No, some conservative-leaning economists counter, we were right: The package has been wasteful, ineffectual and even harmful to the extent that it adds to the nation's debt and crowds out private-sector borrowing.
 These long-running arguments have flared now that the White House and Congressional leaders are talking about a new ''jobs bill.'' But with roughly a quarter of the stimulus money out the door after nine months, the accumulation of hard data and real-life experience has allowed more dispassionate analysts to reach a consensus that the stimulus package, messy as it is, is working.
 The legislation, a variety of economists say, is helping an economy in free fall a year ago to grow again and shed fewer jobs than it otherwise would. Mr. Obama's promise to ''save or create'' about 3.5 million jobs by the end of 2010 is roughly on track, though far more jobs are being saved than created, especially among states and cities using their money to avoid cutting teachers, police officers and other workers. 
 ''It was worth doing -- it's made a difference,'' said Nigel Gault, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, a financial forecasting and analysis group based in Lexington, Mass. 
 Mr. Gault added: ''I don't think it's right to look at it by saying, 'Well, the economy is still doing extremely badly, therefore the stimulus didn't work.' I'm afraid the answer is, yes, we did badly but we would have done even worse without the stimulus.''
 In interviews, a broad range of economists said the White House and Congress were right to structure the package as a mix of tax cuts and spending, rather than just tax cuts as Republicans prefer or just spending as many Democrats do. And it is fortuitous, many say, that the money gets doled out over two years -- longer for major construction -- considering the probable length of the ''jobless recovery'' under way as wary employers hold off on new hiring.
 But there are criticisms, mainly that the Obama team relied last winter on overly optimistic economic assumptions and oversold the job-creating benefits of the stimulus package. 
 Optimistic assumptions in turn contributed to producing a package that if anything is too small, analysts say. ''The economy was weaker than we thought at the time, so maybe in retrospect we could have used a little bit more and little bit more front-loaded,'' said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers, another financial analysis group, in St. Louis. 
 While some conservatives remain as skeptical as ever that big increases in government spending give the economy a jolt that is worth the cost, Martin Feldstein, a conservative Harvard economist who served in the Reagan administration, said the problem with the package was that some of its tax cuts and spending programs were of a variety that did little to spur the economy. 
 ''There should have been more direct federal spending that would have added to aggregate demand,'' he said. ''Temporary tax cuts and one-time transfers to seniors were largely saved and didn't stimulate spending.''
 Even the $787 billion price tag overstates the plan's stimulus value given changes made in Congress, economists say. Nearly a tenth of the package, $70 billion, comes from a provision adjusting the alternative minimum tax so it does not hit middle-income taxpayers this year. That routine fix, which would do nothing to stimulate the economy, was added in part to seek Republican votes. But to keep the package's overall cost down, provisions that would stimulate the economy -- like aid to revenue-starved states and infrastructure projects -- got less as a result. 
 Among Democrats in the White House and Congress, ''there was a considerable amount of hand-wringing that it was too small, and I sympathized with that argument,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Economy.com and an occasional adviser to lawmakers. 
 Even so, ''the stimulus is doing what it was supposed to do -- it is contributing to ending the recession,'' he added, citing the economy's third-quarter expansion by a 3.5 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate. ''In my view, without the stimulus, G.D.P. would still be negative and unemployment would be firmly over 11 percent. And there are a little over 1.1 million more jobs out there as of October than would have been out there without the stimulus.''
 Politically, however, the president is saddled with his original claim that, with the stimulus, the jobless rate would peak at 8.1 percent -- a miscalculation that Republicans constantly recall. While the administration has said its economic assumptions were in line with private forecasts, most of which also underestimated the recession's punch, it was more optimistic than most.
 ''That was a mistake,'' said Jeffrey A. Frankel, a Harvard University economist and former Clinton administration official who is a member of the National Bureau of Economic Research panel that judges when recessions start and end. ''I thought so at the time.''
 Christina D. Romer, chairwoman of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, said attention to that too-rosy projection ''prevents people from focusing on the positive impact of the fiscal stimulus. So of course I find that frustrating.''
 Much federal infrastructure money has gone not to new job-creating projects but to finance existing plans, which otherwise would be unaffordable to states. 
 So the stimulus has not ''supercharged'' transportation construction as was hoped, said Charles Gallagher, an asphalt company owner, speaking for the American Road and Transportation Builders Association, but it has nonetheless been ''a welcome Band-Aid'' to offset state cuts.
 ''Many contractors across the nation have been able to sustain, if not add to, their work force,'' he said.
 That sort of impact is what makes federal aid to state governments rank high in economists' reckoning of the stimulus value of various proposals. Every dollar of additional infrastructure spending means $1.57 in economic activity, according to Moody's, and general aid to states carries a $1.41 ''bang'' for each federal buck.
 Even more effective are increases for food stamps ($1.74) and unemployment checks ($1.61), because recipients quickly spend their benefits on goods and services.
 By contrast, most temporary tax cuts cost more than the stimulus they provide, according to research by Moody's. That is true of two tax breaks in the stimulus law that Congress, pressed by industry lobbyists, recently extended and sweetened -- a tax credit for homebuyers (90 cents of stimulus for each dollar of tax subsidy) and extra deductions for businesses' net operating losses (21 cents). 
 Economists said Republicans' recent proposals to rescind unspent money would be a mistake. 
 James Glassman, a senior economist at JPMorgan Chase & Company, said: ''If we could be absolutely convinced that the growth we're getting is for reasons beyond the help the government is giving, then that would make sense. But the fact is we can't be certain of that.''

HEADLINE: In Departure, ATP Chief Adds Subtlety to the Job

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

 BODY:
Adam Helfant made a whirlwind pilgrimage last December to meet some of his potential employers.
 First stop: Dubai for a rendezvous with Roger Federer at his training base. Next stop: Majorca for a get-acquainted chat with Rafael Nadal on his home island. Final stop: Monaco for a tete-a-tete with Novak Djokovic, the cosmopolitan Serb who resides officially -- like many sports stars before him -- in the low-tax, high-rent principality.
 ''It was three places in I think three days, and it ended with dinner Christmas Eve,'' said Helfant, the former Nike executive who in January became the executive chairman and president of the men's tennis tour. 
 ''I knew Roger from my Nike days,'' Helfant said. ''I didn't really know Rafa. I had met him once before but certainly couldn't claim to have had a relationship, and I didn't know Novak at all. So it was instructive.''
 Helfant, a self-deprecating 44-year-old New Yorker, has deliberately kept a low public profile -- ''Just with the media, not with anybody else,'' he said -- and sounds as if he is in no hurry to embrace the role of talking head.
 That is a stylistic shift from recent tennis leaders, including Larry Scott, the former head of the women's tour, and Etienne de Villiers, the irreverent former Disney executive who, as Helfant's predecessor, ran afoul of Federer, Nadal and other top players for some of his reforms.
 Helfant, raised in Brooklyn, is a globalist even if he speaks just one language -- ''Unless you count Brooklynese,'' he said. He is not, by his own admission, much of a tennis player or a true tennis insider, but he is a sports insider. An M.I.T. graduate, he went on to Harvard Law School and later worked in the N.H.L.'s legal department. He eventually moved to Nike, where he became vice president in the global sports marketing division.
 As the lead negotiator before leaving Nike in 2007, Helfant was part of hammering out deals with FC Barcelona and Tiger Woods as well as Maria Sharapova shortly after she won Wimbledon in 2004. Direct negotiations with Federer and Tony Godsick, Federer's agent at International Management Group, were less fruitful, but Godsick, along with Sharapova's agent, Max Eisenbud, still proposed Helfant's name to the ATP board of directors after De Villiers announced plans to resign.
 ''He is the type of guy who you could have heated negotiations with and want to have dinner with later,'' Eisenbud said of Helfant. 
 De Villiers -- a proverb-spouting Rhodes scholar from South Africa -- was no intellectual lightweight, either. Helfant has spent some of his first year managing the change and frustration that De Villiers helped generate, including a revamped calendar that has reshuffled the top tier of tour events and left some tournament directors at smaller events wondering where the stars have gone.
 But with the exception of Shanghai last month, the top eight events, now branded as ''the ATP World Tour Masters 1000s,'' have enjoyed strong fields, with the world's top four men -- Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Andy Murray -- hoarding the trophies.
 ''The fact our top players are showing up consistently on our biggest stages and performing well, by that measure alone I think our system is working,'' said Helfant, who is nonetheless well aware of the back-beat of complaint about the length of the season.
 But Helfant is certainly open to revisiting the near-eternal debate. And with Federer, Nadal and Djokovic all on the players council, the stars are now more involved in governance than at any time since the ATP was formed in 1990.
 ''We are serious about a lot of different issues, and of course the biggest issue is the length of the season,'' said Djokovic, who expressed support for Helfant. 
 With Helfant's negotiating skills and the current visibility of the men's game, one might think that he would already have secured the title sponsor the tour has lacked since Mercedes declined to renew last year. (That long-term deal reportedly paid the tour as much as $13 million annually.) But the global economy has not helped.
 ''I'm not operating with some sort of artificial timeline when it comes to anything I do,'' Helfant said. ''I'm mindful of the need, and it is a need because it's a mechanism for us to return money to our tournaments. But it is a very valuable proposition, and we're certainly not going to give it away.''
 Nor, despite spending Christmas Eve with Djokovic last year, is Helfant prepared to spend another holiday season networking for business. ''As great an experience as that was last year, I'm looking forward to that week this year with my family,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Assessing the China Trip

 BODY:
President Obama has faced a fair amount of criticism for his China trip. He was too deferential; he didn't speak out enough on human rights; he failed to press Beijing firmly on revaluing its currency; he achieved no concrete results. The trip wasn't all that we had hoped it would be, but some of the complaints are premature. 
 The trip was a template for rising American anxieties about the rising Asian power. President Obama went into his meetings with President Hu Jintao with a weaker hand than most recent American leaders -- and it showed. He is still trying to restore the country's moral authority and a battered economy dependent on Chinese lending. Yet the United States needs China's cooperation on important and difficult problems, including stabilizing the global financial system, curbing global warming, persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear program and preventing Iran from building any nuclear weapons.
 On the positive side, the two leaders hinted in a joint statement that there may have been enough agreement on climate change to give momentum to the Copenhagen negotiations. An American government source said there also may have been some unannounced progress on North Korea.
 But publicly, Mr. Obama pulled his punches on China's exchange rate, saying only that Beijing had promised previously to move toward a more market-oriented rate over time. Despite its indebtedness, the United States has the world's largest economy; Mr. Obama should have nudged Beijing to move faster. We hope he did so privately.
 We were especially disappointed that China made no discernible move to join with the United States and other major powers in threatening tougher sanctions if Iran fails to make progress on curbing its nuclear weapons program. President Obama should have made clear in his private talks that the United States and Europe will act anyway if Beijing and Moscow block United Nations Security Council action.
 It was also dispiriting that Mr. Obama agreed to allow China to limit his public appearances so markedly. Questions were not permitted at the so-called press conference with Mr. Hu, and his town hall meeting with future Chinese leaders in Shanghai not only had a Potemkin air, it was not even broadcast live in China. It's obvious that the last thing Mr. Hu wanted was to get questions about issues like his brutal repression in Tibet and Xinjiang. That doesn't explain Mr. Obama's acquiescence in such restrictions.
 Mr. Obama did not meet with Chinese liberals. In Shanghai, he spoke of the need for an uncensored Internet and universal rights for all people, including Chinese, and at the press conference he called for dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama. He delayed a meeting with the Dalai Lama until after the China summit and should schedule it soon.
 President Obama was elected in part because he promised a more cooperative and pragmatic leadership in world affairs. We support that. The measure of the success (or failure) of his approach won't be known for months, and we hope it bears fruit. But the American president must always be willing to stand up to Beijing in defense of core American interests and values.

HEADLINE: Hearing Set On New Term For Bernanke

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke's nomination to a second term as Federal Reserve chairman will be the subject of a Senate Banking Committee hearing next month, the panel's chairman said Friday. President Obama nominated Mr. Bernanke to another four-year term in August. The nomination is subject to Senate approval. Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said Mr. Bernanke's nomination hearing would be held on Dec. 3. Mr. Dodd, who has been critical of the Fed's failures to spot problems that contributed to the financial crisis, has proposed legislation stripping the central bank of its long-standing authority to regulate banks. That approach runs counter to what the Obama administration wants to see as Congress revamps the nation's financial rule book and oversight to safeguard against future financial crises.

HEADLINE: A Fake Pet Is the Season's Hottest Toy

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Who's laughing now, Elmo? 
 The hottest toy this holiday season is not a ticklish red monster. It's a fake hamster.
Known as Zhu Zhu Pets, the artificial rodents have some advantages over the real thing. They do not stink, chew electric wires, or run around their cages making noise at night. In fact, they do not need cages.
 Children are delighted at how they coo and scoot about unpredictably. Parents are delighted not to have to clean up after them. And at $7.99 each, the hamsters are recession-friendly. 
 The trouble is, Zhu Zhu Pets are so popular that stores cannot keep them in stock. The critters are routinely sold out at the likes of Toys ''R'' Us, Wal-Mart and Target, though more will hit the shelves the day after Thanksgiving, when deal-seekers wake up early to shop for bargains. In the meantime, the hamsters are being sold at a premium on the Internet. 
 ''Beware of the price-gouging on Amazon and eBay, which we don't condone,'' said Natalie Hornsby, director of marketing for Cepia, the St. Louis company that created Zhu Zhu Pets. 
 The five different battery-operated hamsters -- Chunk, PipSqueak, Mr. Squiggles, Num Nums and Patches -- are mainly coveted by girls, according to toy industry professionals. This possibly makes sense; Jim Silver, editor in chief of TimetoPlayMag.com, pointed out that girls also own the majority of live hamsters.
 Boys, it appears, are wild this year for Bakugan Battle Brawlers, a game that uses cards and action figures hidden inside small spheres. The goal is to be the first player to capture three of your opponent's cards, known as Gate cards. (The name comes from the Japanese words ''baku,'' meaning ''to explode,'' and ''gan,'' meaning ''sphere.'') Yet as popular as Bakugan is, the hamsters are upstaging that game and everything else in toy land this season.
 ''It clearly is the hottest phenomenon of the year,'' said Gerald L. Storch, chairman and chief executive of Toys ''R'' Us. ''There's no doubt about that.'' 
 After seeing a commercial in October for Zhu Zhu Pets, Tracey Henry of Safety Harbor, Fla., decided to buy one for her 6-year-old daughter, even though the girl wanted a real hamster for her birthday. Ms. Henry considered a fake hamster a better idea, so she went to Toys ''R'' Us. 
 ''The shelves were empty,'' she said, ''and there were these signs that said, 'Limit four Zhu Zhu Pets per day.' '' 
 Ms. Henry, who writes the blog SuburbanDiva.com, returned home and began calling local toy stores and scouring the Web sites of Toys ''R'' Us, Wal-Mart and Target, with no luck. In the end, she bought a Zhu Zhu Pet (pronounced zoo zoo) on Amazon, marked up to $34.99. ''We got the yellow one,'' Ms. Henry said. ''We should rename it 'greenback.' '' 
 The nation's stores, which have become familiar with these sorts of tales, are trying to round up enough hamsters for the holidays. 
 Toys ''R'' Us said this week that it would have tens of thousands of Zhu Zhu Pets in stock on the Friday after Thanksgiving. But consumers will have to drink coffee with their turkey if they want a hamster: Toys ''R'' Us stores will open on Thanksgiving at midnight, and the first 100 customers in line will receive a ticket for a Zhu Zhu Pet, with a limit of one for each household.
 ''Others may try to make a lot of noise out of a few hamsters,'' Mr. Storch said, ''but we have by far the most inventory and opportunity to find Zhu Zhu at any retailer.'' (Next month, Toys ''R'' Us plans to offer an exclusive $100 Zhu Zhu Pets set that includes -- brace yourself -- two hamsters, an exercise wheel, a fun house, a car and garage, an adventure ball and a sleep dome.) 
 Melissa O'Brien, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart Stores, declined to comment on the chain's Black Friday hamster plans, though she said the chain had more Zhu Zhu Pets on the way. 
 ''At this time, we're even air-shipping them in some markets,'' she said. But she warned that when the hamsters do arrive, ''a lot of them don't spend the night in a store.''
 Indeed, Cepia has found itself increasing hamster production and fielding phone calls from parents desperately seeking Zhu Zhu Pets, as well as their slightly pricier accessories, like a ramp with slide and a garage with car. There is even a surfboard. 
 Ms. Hornsby said the hamsters take their name from ''zhu zhu,'' or ''little pig'' in Chinese, which the folks at Cepia thought was fitting, given that hamsters are known for making messes.
 Mr. Silver of TimetoPlayMag.com said a toy hamster had not been this hot for at least a decade, when Americans became enamored of one that danced to ''Kung Fu Fighting.''
 Cepia is relatively new. Founded in 2002, it has 16 employees in the United States and 25 in China. Ms. Hornsby, the marketing director, said Zhu Zhu Pets were the company's breakthrough toy. ''This is definitely our big fish,'' she said, forgetting the hamster lingo for a moment. ''Every day, we are humbled by what's going on.''
 The creators of Bakugan have more experience with this sort of craze. Bakugan, a Japanese import that some industry professionals have likened to the Pokemon phenomenon, was a hit last Christmas. The must-have addition to the toy line this year is Bakugan 7-in-1 Maxus Dragonoid, which, at $39.99, enables children to connect several game pieces to form one intimidating creature. Toys ''R'' Us has an exclusive 7-in-1 Bakugan, New Vestroia Maxus Helios, also for $34.99. 
 Harold Chizick, vice president of global communications and promotions for Spin Master, the creator of Bakugan, said the toys were all the rage because children liked collecting the cards and action figures just as much as battling. There is also a hit Bakugan Battle Brawlers anime television show that has fueled sales. ''We have increased manufacturing and expedited shipment to be here for the holiday season,'' Mr. Chizick said.
 While it is the second Christmas for Bakugan, Mr. Silver of TimetoPlayMag.com noted that ''when you have a hot item like this, usually Year 2 is bigger than Year 1.'' That is primarily because the toy companies are able to ramp up to meet demand the second year. 
 Josh Green, chief executive of Panjiva, which tracks water-borne goods, said shipments of Zhu Zhu Pets to the United States skyrocketed for the three months ended in October. 
 But a warning to mischievous children everywhere: Mr. Green noted that shipments of coal were also up, by 6 percent, over last year.

HEADLINE: New Rival to Atlanta Art Scene

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
THE warehouses and industrial buildings to the west of downtown Atlanta have not had the benefit of a concerted attempt by the city at urban revitalization. Instead, the West Side has lately given rise to a sort of ad hoc group of contemporary art galleries that have styled themselves as a more intellectual alternative to the city's designated downtown art district, Castleberry Hill.
 ''We do our art walks on Saturday during the day because we don't want to have that party atmosphere,'' said Christina Caudill, the associate director of Saltworks Gallery, which relocated to the area in 2008. (The Westside Arts District walks are on the third Saturday of each month; www.wadatlanta.org.) 
 Saltworks (664 11th Street SW; 404-881-0411; www.saltworksgallery.com) shows art by locals like Kojo Griffin, a Whitney Biennial alumnus, and Brian Dettmer, who carves old books and other media into three-dimensional sculptures, as well as international artists. 
 With its furniture showrooms and salvage companies, the neighborhood can feel less than welcoming. Even the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center (535 Means Street NW; 404-688-1970; thecontemporary.org), a pioneer that moved to the West Side in 1989, is on a side street in a former truck repair facility. In response to the increased foot traffic, though, the Contemporary recently opened a shop that sells art books, jewelry and recordings.
 Other galleries have also responded to the shift, including Get This! (662 11th Street; 678-596-4451; www.getthisgallery.com), which has stretched beyond its original skate-punk aesthetic since moving to the neighborhood, and Kiang Gallery (1011-A Marietta Street NW; 404-892-5477; www.kiang-gallery.com), which shows American and Chinese artists. 
 The West Side's transformation isn't limited to galleries. The coffee shop Octane (1009-B Marietta Street NW; 404-815-9886; www.octanecoffee.com) serves as the meeting place for the Atlanta chapter of Pecha Kucha (from the Japanese phrase meaning chitchat; www.atlantapechakucha.com), where once a month or so members of the city's creative class present their work. 
 Food has long been a West Side draw, thanks in large part to Anne Quatrano and Clifford Harrison, arguably Atlanta's premier restaurateurs, who reign over a small fleet of restaurants clustered in what they call the Westside Provisions District. Their latest offering is the surprisingly affordable Abattoir (1170 Howell Mill Road; 404-892-3335; www.starprovisions.com), which serves fresh chicharrones ($4), pickled shrimp in a jar ($10) and an array of locally sourced meats and offal. 
 At Flip Burger Boutique (1587 Howell Mill Road; 404-352-3547; www.flipburgerboutique.com), Richard Blais, a one-time ''Top Chef'' contestant, specializes in high-concept takes on classics like the foie gras milkshake ($9). Visitors can pick from 1,500 beers at Hop City Craft Beer & Wine (1000 Marietta Street, Suite 302; 404-350-9998; www.hopcitybeer.com) or join the Georgia Tech students at Sublime Doughnuts (535 10th Street; 404-897-1801; sublimedoughnuts.com) for creatively shaped offerings like the A-Town Mocha ($1.75). The goal at Sublime, said Kamal Grant, the pastry chef, is to make doughnuts good enough ''for someone's last meal on death row.''

HEADLINE: The Business Must Go On

 BODY:
I'm one of nine sisters. My parents were dairy farmers in Wisconsin. My father didn't believe in girls doing farm work. Girls did housework, and he hired young men to do farm work. I would have preferred to be outside.
 When I was 9, we moved to Osseo, Wis., where we owned a couple of hundred acres. My father was well respected in town. Years later, people would come up to me and say, ''Wally was always worrying about the schools and the community.'' 
 I became pregnant by my first love at 17 and did what my parents thought was the right thing. I married him. My first husband and I moved to Janesville, Wis., where he worked in a Chrysler plant. I went to work on the assembly line of Parker Pen. 
 I knew I didn't want to work in a factory and three months later got a job selling new construction. It didn't require a real estate license. But I started studying to get my broker's license. I knew I had to find a way to support myself alone. I never had any doubt I could raise my son. I filed for divorce a week after I was 21. 
 Soon a man named Ken Hendricks, whom I had never met, called me on the phone trying to arrange a blind date for me with one of his friends. His friend had told him about me, and he called me every night for three weeks. We talked about ourselves, but not about his friend. He said, ''I really want to meet you.'' By the time he walked up to my front door, I felt I had always known him.
 He was a roofing contractor, and we started doing business together within weeks. Within three years we had bought about 100 homes in the Beloit area. About 10 were single-family homes. The rest were two- to four-unit apartments. At the time, we could buy a three-bedroom home for $10,000 and fix it up. We did most of the work on the homes ourselves, with the help of Ken's father. I painted about 200 units myself. We married in 1975.
 At the time, Ken wanted to get into roofing distribution. There were three roofing stores for sale in Springfield and Belleville, Ill., and in Muskegon Heights, Mich. This was 1982 and a recession was on. We used the line of credit from our homes and a portfolio of real estate investments and other holdings to finance the purchase. This was the beginning of ABC Supply Inc., which now has more than 350 locations and 5,000 employees nationwide.
 Ken died from injuries after a fall on a construction site in December 2007. I hadn't prepared for a future without him. We have 30 companies that are part of the Hendricks Holding Company and separate from ABC Supply, and include businesses in manufacturing, transportation and logistics, and insurance. 
 I knew the businesses had to go on. It was our life's work. I worked out of my home for the first year after his death, and senior employees came there to conduct business.
 Of our seven children, five are at ABC Supply. The three older daughters went to college. The boys went into construction, and I wasn't disappointed they didn't go to college. Their high school graduation presents included $100, a bag of nails and a hammer. The gift was humorous but it had a serious intent. 
 The earlier recession, when we started the business, was nothing compared with what we are going through now. We've slowed down the pace of our ambitions. We're still doing acquisitions, but we're being more selective about them. I'm looking to do capital repairs instead of capital replacements. If we can fill pot holes in a parking lot rather than replace the entire parking lot, that's the choice we're making now. Progress is a lot of simple little decisions.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Finds Profits Again, Now by Reducing Mortgages

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
As millions of Americans struggle to hold on to their homes, Wall Street has found a way to make money from the mortgage mess.
 Investment funds are buying billions of dollars' worth of home loans, discounted from the loans' original value. Then, in what might seem an act of charity, the funds are helping homeowners by reducing the size of the loans. 
 But as part of these deals, the mortgages are being refinanced through lenders that work with government agencies like the Federal Housing Administration. This enables the funds to pocket sizable profits by reselling new, government-insured loans to other federal agencies, which then bundle the mortgages into securities for sale to investors. 
 While homeowners save money, the arrangement shifts nearly all the risk for the loans to the federal government -- and, ultimately, taxpayers -- at a time when Americans are falling behind on their mortgage payments in record numbers. 
 For instance, a fund might offer to pay $40 million for a $100 million block of mortgages from a bank in distress. Then the fund could arrange to have some of those loans refinanced into mortgages backed by an agency like the F.H.A. and then sold to an agency like Ginnie Mae. The trick is to persuade the homeowners to refinance those mortgages, by offering to reduce the amounts the homeowners owe. 
 The profit comes when the refinancings reach more than the $40 million that the fund paid for the block of loans.
 The strategy has created an unusual alliance between Wall Street funds that specialize in troubled investments -- the industry calls them ''vulture'' funds -- and American homeowners. 
 But the transactions also add to the potential burden on government agencies, particularly the F.H.A., which has lately taken on an outsize role in the housing market and, some fear, may eventually need to be bailed out at taxpayer expense. 
 These new mortgage investors thrive in the shadows. Typically, the funds employ intermediaries to contact homeowners and arrange for mortgages to be refinanced. 
 Homeowners often have no idea who their Wall Street benefactors are. Federal housing officials, too, are in the dark. 
 Policymakers have encouraged investors and banks to put more consumers into government-backed loans. The total value of these transactions from hedge funds is small compared with the overall housing market.
 Housing experts warn that the financial players involved -- the investment funds, their intermediaries and certain F.H.A. approved lenders -- have a financial incentive to put as many loans as possible into the government's hands. 
 ''From the borrower's point of view, landing in a hedge fund or private equity fund that's willing to write down principal is a gift,'' said Howard Glaser, a financial industry consultant and former official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
 He went on: ''From the systemic point of view, there is something disturbing about investors that had substantial short-term profit in backing toxic loans now swooping down to make another profit on cleaning up that mess.''
 Steven and Marisela Alva say they do not know who helped them with their mortgage. All they know is that they feel blessed. 
 Last December, the couple got a letter saying that a firm had purchased the mortgage on their home in Pico Rivera, Calif., from Chase Home Finance for less than its original value. ''We want to share this discount with you,'' the letter said. 
 ''I couldn't believe it,'' said Mr. Alva, a 62-year-old janitor and father of three. ''I kept thinking to myself, 'Something is wrong, something is wrong. This sounds too good.' ''
 But it was true. The balance on the Alvas' mortgage was ultimately reduced to $314,000 from $440,000. 
 The firm behind the reduction remains a mystery. The Alvas' new loan, backed by the F.H.A., was made by Primary Residential Mortgage, a lender based in Utah. But the letter came from a company called MCM Capital Partners. 
 In the letter, MCM said the couple's loan was owned by something called MCMCap Homeowners' Advantage Trust III. But MCM's co-founders said in an interview that MCM does not own any mortgages. They would not reveal the investor that owned the Alvas' loan because they had agreed to keep that client's identity confidential. 
 Michael Niccolini, an MCM founder, said, ''We are changing people's lives.'' 
 In Washington, mortgage funds are lobbying for policies that favor their investments, particularly mortgages held in securitized bundles. They want more mortgage balances to be lowered, which might help mortgage bonds perform better. Big banks generally oppose such reductions, which lock in banks' losses on the loans. 
 In April, about a dozen investment firms formed a group called the Mortgage Investors Coalition to press their case. One investor who is speaking out is Wilbur L. Ross, who runs a fund that buys mortgages and owns a large mortgage servicing company. 
 Mr. Ross said modifications that simply lower interest rates or lengthen the duration of a loan, as is typical in the government modification program, do not work well. 
 ''They make a payment or two, but then one night the husband and wife will sit down at the table and say, 'Do we really want to make 140 monthly payments into a rat hole?' '' Mr. Ross said. 
 The Fortress Investment Group, a hedge fund in New York, is one of the firms at the forefront of picking through mortgages. Fortress created a $3 billion credit fund in 2008 partly to buy loans from banks like Citigroup, which were under pressure to purge loans to raise cash.
 ''They're going ahead and they are refinancing them and getting their money out right away,'' said Roger Smith, an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton. ''What Fortress is doing is actually good for the borrower.'' Congress, however, may not be happy that hedge funds are making money this way, Mr. Smith said.
 Fortress, which declined to comment, typically buys batches of loans and works with other companies to evaluate which ones might qualify for F.H.A., Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac refinancing.
 Sometimes Fortress works with Nationstar, a mortgage servicer and originator that it owns. Other times, Fortress uses an outside partner like Meridias Capital, a lender in Henderson, Nev., that once originated Alt-A loans, which are just above subprime.
 After the mortgage market imploded, Meridias began dissecting portfolios of troubled loans for investment funds. 
 Because firms like Fortress purchase blocks of mortgages at distressed prices, they are able to reduce the principal amount of the loans. Nick Florez, president of Meridias, calls such transactions an ''incentive refinance.'' He said he would not agree to take a loan unless he could help the homeowner. He said he was able to reduce the loan amount by 11 percent on average. 
 ''I'm giving money away,'' said Mr. Florez, who is a 35-year-old Las Vegas native. ''It's really a feel-good business.''
 It is too early to know how the new loans will work.
 David H. Stevens, the new commissioner of the F.H.A., said he was monitoring F.H.A. lenders but did not have thorough information about which ones work with distressed investors. So far he has not seen a problem from loans coming from hedge funds. 
 ''They're helping to protect people in their homes and they're refinancing people from a distressed situation,'' he said. 
 But he acknowledged that funds have an incentive to aggressively push homeowners into federally guaranteed loans, since the investors get their money back as soon as they complete the refinancing. 
 Seth Wheeler, a senior adviser in the Treasury Department who specializes in housing policy, declined to say whether the investment firms that are lowering principal for homeowners are altruistic or not.
 ''Investors are doing it where it both benefits the investor and the borrower,'' he said.
 Part of the risk may be determined by how the funds compensate the F.H.A. lenders and whether the lenders are beholden to the funds for business. 
 David Zitting, the chief executive of Primary Residential Mortgage, the company that refinanced the Alva family's loan, said his company did not receive fees from the hedge funds.
 ''They have all sorts of motivations that, frankly, we don't understand,'' he said. ''We don't do anything special for them because that's not fair lending.''
 The Alvas had to dip into their savings to qualify for their new federally insured loan, since the biggest F.H.A. mortgage they could get was for $285,000, they said. They paid off $21,000 in credit-card and car loans, and put up an additional $29,000 for their new mortgage, depleting their already meager savings. 
 Brian Chappelle, a mortgage consultant, said loans to people like the Alvas, with modest incomes and scant savings, could turn out to be risky.
 ''It does raise risk concerns for F.H.A.,'' he said. 
 The Alvas are grateful for the help. Their home is, Marisela said, a dream come true. ''I'm very happy,'' she said. ''We never thought this was possible.''
 Shifting the Risk: Articles in this series are examining the battles being fought in the aftermath of the economic crisis to reshape the financial industry.

HEADLINE: A Break For Builders

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Home Builders (You Heard That Right) Get a Gift'' (Fair Game, Nov. 15), in which Gretchen Morgenson described a new tax break for builders: 
The column said that ''once again, at the front of the government assistance line, stand some of the very companies that contributed mightily to the credit crisis by building and financing too many homes.''
 Meanwhile, many of our nation's economic builders -- middle- and lower-class family breadwinners -- remain unemployed or underemployed. And many future builders -- our teenagers -- are also without jobs.
 It is deeply disappointing to learn that the Obama administration is only now about to convene a jobs summit. This should have been the first order of business last January. 
 Would Americans please notice where we should be focusing our anger and energy? We need to put the current administration and the Congress on high alert: it's jobs, stupid. Yes, we can. And we must. Sybil Schlesinger

HEADLINE: A Smaller Ford in Your Future?

BYLINE: By JAMES G. COBB

 BODY:
DISARM the Patek Philippe. Park the Bugatti. Drain the last drops of Cristal. The party's over.
 That, at least, is what Ford's futurists are thinking. ''Our view is, the era of excess has reached a tipping point,'' George Pipas, the company's sales analyst, told journalists last week in Manhattan. ''People are moving from conspicuous consumption to more careful consumption.'' 
 Mr. Pipas's numbers show significant recent shifts from large vehicles, including truck-based sport utility vehicles, to cars and car-based crossover utility vehicles, and he cited surveys showing that the size of new homes shrank last year after a long march toward McMansions.
 Such changes -- what he called a pattern of seeing consumers align their consumption with their needs -- have big implications for a company like Ford, which amassed record profits earlier this decade on sales of Explorers, Expeditions and Excursions. Now, Ford is betting that the future -- its future -- depends to a large extent on compact and subcompact cars.
 ''Small cars are going to continue to grow,'' Mr. Pipas said, whatever happens to gas prices. While small cars (which in the United States he considers ''B class'' subcompacts like the Ford Fiesta or the Toyota Yaris and ''C class'' compacts like the Ford Focus or the Honda Civic) accounted for 21 percent of sales in 2003. That jumped to 31 percent in 2008, and Ford expects them to reach 36 percent by 2013, perhaps surpassing midsize cars.
 While conceding that gas prices play a big role in consumer choices, especially the uncertainty that arises when prices are unstable, Mr. Pipas's numbers tell a bigger story. As pump prices were plunging 30 percent from last year, small-car sales continued to rise.
 In Ford's view, the new interest in smaller cars isn't necessarily because of fuel economy or a bad economy, it's also a matter of shifting demographics. Two huge groups largely determine what kinds of consumer products are produced, from soft drinks to software to sedans. These are the baby boomers and their children, the Millennials, and both are gravitating toward small cars.
 Half of Millennials are buying subcompact or compact cars now, Mr. Pipas said, while just one in five chooses midsize models like the Ford Fusion. He predicts that their parents, who are ''downsizing, streamlining and simplifying'' their lifestyles as they become empty-nesters, are also likely to shrink their vehicular footprint.

HEADLINE: Chronicle of a Changing City

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
BOOK CULTURE, on Broadway and 114th Street, across from Columbia University, is the latest in a long line of independent bookstores at this busy corner location. Preceded by Morningside Books, and by Papyrus before that, this store departs from their erudite inventory with more commercially viable best sellers, literary novels and mysteries. A co-owner, Chris Doeblin, 48, owns a scholarly bookstore, also named Book Culture, two blocks away. After Morningside closed in May, Mr. Doeblin contacted Columbia, which owns the space, imploring every professor he knew to put in a good word. The university offered a five-year lease at a ''slight increase'' from the previous monthly rent of about $9,000, he said. Soon to open is a basement level with Spanish-language and science fiction sections, children's books and a play area with a spacious bathroom -- ''our secret weapon,'' Mr. Doeblin said. 
 THE PIZZA SHOP, just off Tompkins Square Park on Avenue A near Seventh Street, put the punk in pizza when four rock musician buddies opened it two years ago. It gained local renown for its slices (tasty), beer (cheap), music (raging punk), hours (open till 5 a.m.) and boxes (designed by Arturo Vega, who designed the Ramones' presidential seal logo). It also featured free movie nights, with hip showings of surf films and kung fu movies. But the recession took a toll, as did customers' continuing exodus to Brooklyn's cool neighborhoods -- and the $11,000 monthly rent. ''It's hard to be competitive on this strip, and we just weren't doing the volume anymore,'' said Kevin Cole, 39, one of the four owners and an experienced pizza maker, as well as the front man for the rock band the Turbo A.C.'s.

HEADLINE: At a Software Powerhouse, The Good Life Is Under Siege

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

DATELINE: CARY, N.C. 

 BODY:
 A TOUR of its carefully tended, 300-acre corporate campus here leaves little doubt why surveys, year after year, rate the SAS Institute, the world's largest private software company, among the best places to work. 
 There is the subsidized day care and preschool. There are the four company doctors and the dozen nurses who provide free primary care. The recreational amenities include basketball and racquetball courts, a swimming pool, exercise rooms and 40 miles of running and biking trails. There is a meditation garden, as well as on-site haircuts, manicures, and jewelry repair. Employees are encouraged to work 35-hour weeks.
 Academics have studied the company's benefit-enhanced corporate culture as a model for nurturing creativity and loyalty among engineers and other workers. Six years ago, in a report on ''60 Minutes,'' Morley Safer called working at SAS ''the good life.''
 But that good life is under threat today as never before. SAS's specialty, a lucrative niche called business intelligence software, is becoming mainstream. Free, open-source alternatives to some of the company's products are increasingly popular. On the other end of the spectrum, the heavyweights of the software industry -- Oracle, SAP, Microsoft and, especially, I.B.M. -- are plunging in and investing billions of dollars. 
 ''It will be a dogfight,'' says Bill Hostmann, an analyst at Gartner. ''SAS has never faced a competitor like I.B.M. And I do think I.B.M. sees SAS as a big, fatted cow.'' 
 The term ''business intelligence software'' applies to a wide range of products and services, but all the technology is aimed at helping businesses mine nuggets of insight from mountains of data. SAS has traditionally specialized in advanced software to analyze huge data sets and to generate predictive statistical models for large corporations and government agencies. 
 Credit card companies, for example, use SAS to detect unusual buying patterns in real time, and to spot potentially fraudulent charges. Giant retail chains use SAS to tailor pricing and product offerings down to the store level. Telecommunications companies use SAS to identify the few thousand customers, among millions, most likely to switch to another cellphone carrier, and to aim marketing at them. SAS software is also used to parse sensor signals from North Sea oil rigs, combined with weather and structural data, to predict failure of parts before it happens. Of the 100 largest companies worldwide, 92 use SAS software.
 But as the stream of companies' collected data turns into a torrent, SAS and other software companies are trying to find new ways to harness it. The information is generated not only by computerized systems for tracking operations, customers and sales. It also comes from new data sources like Web site visits, social network chatter and public records accessible over the Internet, as well as genome sequences, sensor signals and surveillance tapes, all in digital form. 
 This data explosion, experts say, is an untapped asset at most companies, which lack the tools and skills to exploit it. Yet the long-range potential, they say, is to use this data for far more fine-grained analysis of markets, customer behavior and operations, making business more of a science and less a seat-of-the-pants art. 
 ''Now, the data is available so business can move toward evidence-based decision-making,'' says Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist and director of the Center for Digital Business at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''This market is a huge opportunity.''
 That opportunity is not lost on SAS. ''Our advantage is the incredible depth of our technology, developed over years and applied to specific industries,'' says James H. Goodnight, the chief executive and a co-founder of SAS. ''No one can match our toolbox.'' 
 Indeed, no one underestimates SAS's technical prowess. The big question is whether the company's seemingly pampered culture can embrace the higher-octane institutional metabolism that it will need to succeed. 
 ''We know we have to change -- no question about it,'' says Jim Davis, 51, a senior vice president at SAS. ''Our market space has changed dramatically in the last 18 months or so, more than at any time over the 33-year history of the company. We can't sit back. Things are only going to get faster.''
 THE company traces its roots to a time when computing was costly and for the few. Originally called Statistical Analysis System, it was founded in 1976 by Mr. Goodnight and three colleagues from the agricultural statistics department at North Carolina State University. Its techniques were initially used to calculate the intricacies of soil, weather, seed varieties and other factors to improve crop yields. 
 To build an audience, Mr. Goodnight spent nights packing up boxes of computer tapes and manuals, which he sent to university and corporate researchers. Soon, companies wanted him and his academic colleagues to develop software tools tailored for industry. In 1976 at a users' conference, 300 or so people showed up, many from business. 
 ''That was pretty much an 'aha' moment for us, that it was time to expand beyond the university,'' Mr. Goodnight recalls. ''It was a little scary, cutting the academic umbilical chord. But I was convinced we could do it.'' 
 He and his colleagues at SAS developed their own programming language and software tools, and designed them for eggheads like themselves. Users were analysts with Ph.D.'s, working with programmers and employed by the largest companies at the forefront of using computing in their businesses, including banks, national retailers, insurers and drug companies.
 SAS invested heavily in research and development, and even today allocates 22 percent of the company's revenue to research. The formula has paid off in steady growth, year after year. Revenue reached $2.26 billion in 2008, up from $1.34 billion five years earlier. 
 Yet the company also faces the classic challenge of being the innovative pioneer -- enjoying rich profit margins but facing new competition from rivals seeking to gain market share with lower prices and substitute technology. 
 In the last two years, the major software companies have scooped up companies in the business intelligence market. Among the larger moves, SAP bought Business Objects for $6.8 billion, I.B.M. bought Cognos for $4.9 billion and Oracle picked up Hyperion for $3.3 billion.
 Still, those companies compete in the broad swath of the business intelligence market for reporting and analysis products. Such data on sales, shipments, customers and operations amount to a numbers-laden portrait of the recent past. The SAS stronghold is a more sophisticated kind of software typically called ''advanced analytics and predictive modeling,'' which uses historical and current data to try to peer into the future and model likely outcomes. 
 The competitive thrust that really grabbed SAS's attention came in late July, when I.B.M. announced that it planned to pay $1.2 billion for SPSS, a maker of predictive modeling software. I.B.M. has placed SPSS and Cognos into a new business analytics and optimization group. That business will be supported by 200 scientists, and the company has said it will retrain or hire 4,000 consultants and analysts to work in the group. 
 ''This is the big growth strategy for I.B.M., the company's next big play for this decade,'' says Ambuj Goyal, a computer scientist who is general manager of I.B.M's business analytics software unit. ''SAS comes from the legacy world of statisticians and programmers. The real opportunity is in deploying this technology broadly in corporations.''
 To counter I.B.M. and others, SAS is looking to forge a tighter relationship with a big technology services company. It is also shortening product development cycles to 12 to 18 months, down from 24 to 36. ''That's what the market expects,'' Mr. Davis says.
 The most sweeping change is the company's move toward the Internet model of software delivery -- as a service that customers tap into over the Web, much as Google and other Internet companies do. SAS has dipped its toe in, with some initial products. But a major expansion is planned, supported by a sprawling $70 million data center scheduled to begin operating next year.
 The remotely delivered software is part of a drive to broaden the market for SAS technology beyond an elite corps of quantitative analysts and into the rank-and-file of corporate professionals. 
 Analysts say the company's strategy looks sound, even if the outcome is uncertain. ''SAS has to do a lot of things right to succeed,'' says Peter Sondergaard, senior vice president of research for Gartner. ''But if it executes correctly, it could be a winner.'' 
 ACROSS its campus here, there are signs that the SAS culture is evolving with the times. Rick Langston, 54, a senior software manager who joined the company 29 years ago, smiles and shrugs when asked about the 35-hour workweek. After leaving the office, Mr. Langston routinely checks on work e-mail at home. 
 These days, he explains, SAS is a global company with far-flung project teams, and overnight e-mails can resolve problems and speed things along. Deadline work to meet product development schedules, he adds, can mean long hours at times. ''But this is certainly not a place where you are working 60-hour weeks, week in and week out,'' he said.
 To be sure, the corporate cocoon in Cary can breed insularity. SAS, for example, was slow to recognize the brewing challenge from free, open-source alternatives to some of its products. A free programming language and set of software tools for statistical computing, called R, has become increasingly popular at universities and labs. 
 The company shifted course earlier this year and modified its software so programs written with R work seamlessly with SAS technology. ''Shame on us for not engaging more with the open-source community,'' says Keith Collins, senior vice president and chief technology officer. ''But we're committed to doing that now.''
 THE architect of the SAS culture is Mr. Goodnight, a lanky, laconic billionaire. The benefits have built up gradually over the years as a series of pragmatic steps, he says. The day-care program began after a valued employee was about to leave to take care of her young child. The on-site medical checkups grow out of the belief that ''good health is good business,'' he says.
 Today, SAS estimates that its health care center saves the company $5 million a year, by providing care more cheaply than an outside insurer and by not having employees leave the campus for doctor's visits. Employee turnover at SAS averages 4 percent a year, versus about 20 percent for the overall software industry.
 The office atmosphere is sedate. There are no dogs roaming the halls, no Nerf-ball fights, no one jumping on trampolines -- no whiff of Silicon Valley. The SAS culture is engineered for its own logic: to reduce distractions and stress, and thus foster creativity. 
 ''The SAS model is sensible and durable; there's nothing faddish or ephemeral,'' says Richard Florida, a professor at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, who has studied SAS and is the author of ''The Rise of the Creative Class.''
 During the technology boom at the start of this decade, SAS considered a drastic change in its model: going public. Goldman Sachs bankers were brought in as advisers, and in 2000 SAS recruited a former Oracle executive, Andre Boisvert, as its president.
 Under Mr. Boisvert, SAS installed a new financial reporting system and paid the sales force incentive commissions rather than salary only. But when technology stocks plummeted, the appeal of selling shares to the public also receded. Mr. Boisvert resigned from SAS in 2001 and is now an independent investor and consultant.
 Mr. Goodnight recalls those days as a brief period of New Economy surrealism, and going public as a path wisely avoided. SAS, he says, is a culture averse to the short-term pressures of Wall Street, which he characterizes as ''a bunch of 28-year-olds, hunched over spreadsheets, trying to tell you how to run your business.''
 Unlike many other tech companies, SAS has had no recession-related layoffs this year. ''I've got a two-year pipeline of projects in R & D,'' Mr. Goodnight says. ''Why would I lay anyone off?''
 Mr. Goodnight, though 66, has no plans to retire himself. His fingerprints, colleagues say, remain all over the business, especially in meeting with customers and in overseeing research. 
 He is not only a statistician, but also a bit of gambler who enjoys calculating his chances. For example, he is co-author of a paper that simulated millions of possible outcomes in blackjack. 
 Mr. Goodnight regards his new rivals the way a confident card player might. He likes the odds, and he likes his hand.
 ''We're pushing as fast as we can to stay ahead -- on the cutting edge of everything,'' he says. ''We'll do fine.''

HEADLINE: Start Small and Think Long-Term: Saving Energy

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
NEW YORKERS get to feel smug about a lot of things. We have great food, arts and culture, the Yankees. We can also feel good about our relatively low use of energy, thanks to public transportation and our small living spaces. But sometimes -- sometimes -- we fail to notice where there's room for improvement. 
 Thirty-nine percent of New York City's greenhouse gases come from residential buildings. And there are New Yorkers who have looked hard at their homes, in buildings of all ages and sizes, and found ways to make them more energy efficient. Others are watching their operating costs rise (along with global temperatures), and want to know what to do about it.
 ''With new developments, it's easy,'' says Marc Zuluaga, a senior engineer at Steven Winter Associates, a consulting firm that works on energy issues. ''But in almost any building, there are low-hanging opportunities.'' 
 Every building is different, and predicting the return on an investment in efficiency can be tricky. Older buildings are not necessarily bigger energy hogs than their newer neighbors, and some buildings that went up in the last 10 years should be ashamed. But the size and age of a structure can tell an expert where to start looking for savings.
 ''You have to start with conservation,'' Mr. Zuluaga said. ''Once you squeeze every last ounce of efficiency out of a building -- until you can't make it more efficient without knocking it down and building a new one -- then it makes sense to add solar.''
 To find out where energy savings might be found in your building, an energy audit is in order. These are available from private consultants or utility companies like Con Edison. 
 A good place to begin is to make sure that all systems are working as efficiently as they can. 
 ''If you have the right thermostat in place but the temperature sensor is in the wrong place, that can have a huge impact on energy performance,'' said Jeffrey Perlman, the president of Bright Power, an energy consulting group. ''But it doesn't cost a lot to fix.''
 From there, you can get more ambitious: you can try to balance the temperature.
 ''Generally, buildings are heated to the tenant who's complaining the most because they're cold,'' Mr. Perlman said. ''To be more energy-efficient, you want the whole building to get to be roughly the same temperature at roughly the same time. A well-balanced system can work wonders. And it can save money as well.''
 Last year, Mr. Perlman worked with Carl Wallman, who owns a 19-unit rental building on East 70th Street in Manhattan. 
 ''For years,'' Mr. Wallman said, ''it really got me to see windows open in the building and the heat blasting away. Surely, I'm interested in the savings, but really having the building run more energy efficiently was important.''
 Mr. Perlman's team made some small fixes, like adjusting the controls on the boiler and installing a new thermostat for the ground floor, which had its own heating system and was always cold.
 In the 2007-8 heating season, the building used 11 percent less energy than it had the previous year, before the changes. Mr. Wallman spent almost $19,000 on energy bills for all of 2007; if the tweaks had been in place then, he would have saved about $2,000. 
 ''These are small buildings,'' Mr. Wallman said, ''so the savings are not going to be in the tens of thousands.'' 
 But, he pointed out, New York is home to thousands of small buildings. ''These little buildings are going to make a big difference.''
 Mr. Perlman charged about $1,500 for the initial energy audit, $1,200 for boiler upgrades and $500 annually for continuing monitoring and maintenance. And with savings of just over $2,000 a year, the project should pay for itself in less than two years.
 An enormous amount of energy is spent heating buildings, and an enormous amount is wasted when someone throws open a window to cool off a boiling apartment.
 Another way to bring building temperatures under control is to regulate the heat in individual rooms. A gadget called a thermostatic radiator valve attaches to some steam and hot-water radiators and automatically senses the temperature of the room. If it gets too toasty, the valve clamps down.
 These valves were installed in a 102-unit co-op building on Fourth Street in the East Village about 10 years ago with the help of Henry Gifford, an energy consultant in New York City. The co-op's yearly consumption of oil has decreased by 15 percent. 
 ''I don't think it was so much an energy conservation thing at that time,'' said Tom Ostrowski, the president of the co-op board. ''It wasn't quite in vogue at that point. But it was just a more efficient way to do it.''
 In the years since, however, Mr. Ostrowski's co-op has looked into a solar hot water system and batted around the idea of replacing all the windows and insulating the building. All of these options were deemed too expensive.
 So, for now, the co-op is replacing windows with more efficient models one by one, and it has a plan in place to install motion-sensing lights in interior stairwells and trash rooms. But at the moment, No. 1 on the agenda is to finish repair work on the building facade. 
 ''If I was an individual homeowner, I could say, 'I don't care if I make my money back on solar panels,' '' Mr. Ostrowski said. ''But I can't. I can't say, 'Hey, one hundred other people! Follow my dream!' '' 
 Other buildings have had more success getting larger projects under way. 
 The Winston Churchill, a large postwar co-op at 2500 Johnson Avenue in Riverdale in the Bronx, is making 12 upgrades, including adjustments to the air-conditioning system, ventilation improvements and new lighting. 
 To cover the cost, the building secured a $1.695 million loan, and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority brought down the interest rate from 6.5 percent to zero percent with a payment of $336,122 to the lender. This program, the Multifamily Performance Program, is not currently accepting new applications while it re-examines the criterion used to evaluate projects. The authority says it will resume the program but does not have a target date.
 ''We had been working under the assumption that the energy savings would be such that the loan could be paid back by those savings,'' said Steven M. Hochberg, the board president. ''It looks like that is, in fact, going to be the case.'' 
 So far, the building has completed 5 of the 12 planned upgrades. It has, for example, switched to natural gas from No. 6 oil, an extraordinarily dirty fuel. ''It's like the garbage of oil,'' said Mark Singh, the building superintendent at the Winston Churchill. 
 The co-op has also installed a new mechanism for making hot water, separating that system from the one that generates energy to heat the air. 
 ''Mark would have to run his large boilers all summer long to make hot water for the building,'' said Michael Scorrano, the managing director of the En-Power Group, which is overseeing the project for the co-op. ''It's just way oversized for what you need.'' 
 These new systems were installed this summer, so the building has yet to go through a full heating season. But Mr. Scorrano estimates that in the summer the building will experience a 50 percent reduction in fuel use, which had cost about $700,000 per year. In the winter, he expects that reduction will be closer to 15 percent. The cost of the new hot water system for the 333-unit building was $300,000. 
 ''You read a lot of articles on saving the environment,'' Mr. Hochberg said. ''But most people are only going to save the environment if they can save some money in the process. And it seems to have come together.'' 
 For some people, however, making their homes as green as can be is a goal in itself.
 Stephen Vernon is the president of a 112-unit co-op in Inwood called Nagle Apartments that has tried hard to become more environmentally responsible. The residents of the three-building complex started simply about five years ago by upgrading the lighting with motion sensors and more efficient bulbs. Then they moved on to larger projects. 
 ''Our goal,'' Mr. Vernon said, ''was to do green projects that made fiscal sense.''
 Almost all of the windows were replaced and new radiator valves were installed, at a cost of about $860,000. To cover the costs of these and other upgrades, the building took out a two-part loan and the development authority brought down the interest, leaving the residents with an average rate of 4.31 percent. 
 Through a combination of selling apartments that the co-op owned, interest on investments (it owns some Treasury bonds), and energy savings, the improvements were made without an assessment or maintenance increase.
 These days, the building's boiler spends a great deal of time resting comfortably on the lowest setting, and gas consumption has decreased by around 40 percent. 
 Now, the building is looking into putting in a green roof -- layers of plantings and soil. 
 Green roofs keep the top of a building cool and provide a layer of insulation. They also retain rainwater, which can help keep the city's sewer system from being overwhelmed in a heavy rain. But some consultants say that you'll get more bang for your buck keeping the roof cool with white or silver paint and that a building will be better insulated with traditional materials like fiberglass. Green roofs are, however, much nicer to look at -- and hang out on -- than the alternative.
 Another initiative that the co-op is undertaking is environmentally friendly renovations. As rental apartments become vacant, the co-op makes them over for sale. It uses recycled materials where possible, installs energy-efficient appliances and decorates with low- or nontoxic paints and finishes. One of these apartments, a 900-square-foot two-bedroom, is on the market for $359,000.
 The sales agent, Matthew Bizzarro of Stein-Perry Real Estate, who also lives in the building, says that he has priced it a bit higher than comparable apartments in the area. Traffic has been good, he says, and has included people who say the green factor appealed to them. 
 Some energy consultants are skeptical of renovations that focus on using recycled materials rather than the best materials for long-term energy savings.
 ''It's always good to use paints that are low in volatile organic compounds,'' Mr. Zuluaga of Steven Winter Associates said. ''Where I do sort of take issue with those types of projects is when the focus is on recycling rather than using materials to make a better building.'' 
 At this point, it's hard to say whether people will pay a premium for a home that's been retrofitted to be green. 
 ''I think over time there will be a modest premium associated with this because of the lower operating costs,'' said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal group Miller Samuel. ''But right now the reason it's hard to discern whether there's a premium is because it's usually one component of an extensive renovation.'' 
 Lisa Detwiler, a broker at the Corcoran Group, has a listing for a property that matches that description: a town house in Brooklyn Heights. The owner, Doug Mcdonald, gutted it and then put it back together with energy-efficiency in mind. 
 The house is on the market for $5.95 million, a lot of money for a brownstone in Brooklyn Heights. But Mr. Mcdonald says that he is confident his home will command a premium, in part because he has been able to charge $4,000 a month for its two-bedroom garden apartment, more than comparable places in the neighborhood.
 He said he got that price because tenants liked the idea of living in a place that is well insulated and low in volatile organic compounds, chemicals commonly found in paints and finishes. 
 Throughout the brownstone, the lights, windows and electrical system are all designed to conserve as much energy as possible. The materials used in construction were recycled wherever possible, and the roof is painted white to keep it cool. 
 The house is also wired for solar power, but Mr. Mcdonald said that while he expected the price of solar panels to come down soon, the economics did not yet make sense to him. And before you worry about making your own energy, he added, you have to be sure you're wasting as little as possible.
 Two of the biggest energy savers in the town house involve temperature. Each floor of the five-story house has its own heating and cooling system, so only the areas that need adjustment get a blast of warm or cold.
 The insulation is also an energy-saver. Mr. Mcdonald used a spray-on foam called Icynene and a fluffy blue material made from recycled denim called Bonded Logic, and says he usually heats just the bottom floor and lets the warm air rise. 
 The electric bill for four stories of the five-story brownstone averages $183 per month -- the rental unit is metered separately. And the gas bill, which includes heat and hot water, averages out to $83 per month. 
 ''Waste reduction should be part of the purpose of good design,'' Mr. Mcdonald said. ''It's like in golf: you don't want to waste any energy at all. It's a long sport, and anything you waste ends up coming back and working against you.'' 
 Because You Can't Knit the Building a Sweater
 Making an old building more efficient can be a daunting prospect. Here are a few tips: 
 One place to find energy savings is to avoid venting out more air than necessary -- the boiler will just have to work extra hard to replace the temperate air. A leaky elevator shaft, for example, can act as a chimney, sucking warm air up and out of the building. And in many postwar buildings, ventilation and exhaust fans suck more air out of the building than necessary. 
 An important part of long-term conservation is using equipment properly. The Thomas Shortman Training Fund, the arm of a building workers' union that provides classes to its members, offers a 40-hour class for superintendents on energy-efficient building management (www.1000supers.com). 
 Simple, inexpensive adjustments to consider:
 Low-flow shower heads and faucet aerators.
 Motion-sensor light switches and efficient bulbs. 
 Thermostatic radiator valves, which keep rooms from overheating by regulating the heat coming out of radiators. 
 White or silver paint for the roof to keep it cool.
 Insulation on exposed pipes.

HEADLINE: Cold Rush

BYLINE: By KEVIN GRAY

 BODY:
I didn't want to be famous, but the Norwegians insisted. The smiling weatherwoman, the thumbs-up cameraman standing in the snow, even the delighted caterer, who really should not have cared one way or the other, each wanted me to sit on a half log draped in reindeer fur and say things in English to their morning TV audience.
 To be honest, I felt ashamed. And a little embarrassed. I had only come to Norway to ski, and maybe write some words about it, not to make a fuss or have makeup put on me in front of little skiing children. But here I was, seated next to a beautiful Norwegian Katie Couric, at the base of a little Hobbit hill, a frozen valley beneath us, a staged cooking fire at my back, unsure of what these people wanted from me. I considered running off but wondered how that might look. 
 A day earlier, the weather lady had spotted me in a blue-and-white-shuttered cafe, eating strudel as a soft snow fell on Geilo, a small resort village in the center of the southern bulge of Norway. She was amazed that an American journalist had arrived in her country, and she offered her guidance. ''We Norwegians,'' she said, ''have a profound love of the outdoors. It is our myth we tell ourselves.'' They are, like our Coloradoans, a race of hikers, bikers, skiers and conscientious caretakers of the global environment.
 It would be a coup if she could bring back an American to her producer and host. But now the host, sheathed in a Bond-girl snowsuit, her face encircled by a nimbus of what resembled the white fur of a polar bear cub, had turned to me with dazzling blue eyes that caught me off guard. ''So,'' she said. ''What do Americans think of Norway?''
 Why must they always ask that question?
 I waffled and said something about eating raspeballer, the nation's culinary take on mashed potatoes shaped like meatballs and stuffed with salted pork. What I should have said is, we approve -- since I seemed to be the sole United States representative to the entire kingdom. As beautiful and dramatic as Norway is, with its magical fjords and snow-globe fishing villages, it does not seem to be on many people's to-do lists. Which is a nice thing indeed if you like your travel to be free of people like yourself and you don't mind being treated as a curiosity.
 Geilo is a mountain town halfway between Oslo in the east and Bergen, the country's second-largest city, on the west coast. Once a small community of farmers and blacksmiths, the modern town was born in 1909 with the arrival of the Bergen Railway. On the same day the railway was inaugurated, Dr. I. C. Holm, Norway's top respiratory therapist, opened a sanitarium here, offering dry mountain air to clients from both coasts. Today two ski areas flank the broad Ustedalen valley, with 40 slopes covering 21 miles, all of which make up the Geilo Skiheiser.
 There are six resort hotels, including the Dr. Holms Hotel. It sits across the road from a little mustard-colored train depot that once received the worried wealthy and now welcomes about 120,000 people during the busiest months, many of them families with small kids. I arrived midweek before a big national holiday and found myself sharing the hotel and the slopes with a smattering of people, all excited about the coming ski hordes.
 If you've seen ''The Shining,'' you have a fair idea of what the Dr. Holms Hotel looks like inside and out. It was once occupied by the Nazis, who used it as a retreat for submarine officers and as a place to rear the children of soldiers and the Norwegian girls who fell in love with them. Its 127 rooms, clapboard exterior, hipped red roofs and columned entry dominate the little town, which is not much more than a tourist-friendly strip of shops for ski wear and groceries. There are dark oil paintings in the lobby and a grand staircase. In the carpeted lounge upstairs, which hosts a busy apres-ski scene, little pigtailed girls in snow pants look like they popped off a cocoa label. The hotel is popular for drinks and dinner and provides the village its emotional center.
 ''My daughter and I both love racing -- we ski for several hours during the day with only our packs, some water and oranges,'' said Oystein Maeland, an athletically trim 60-year-old former police officer who had formally introduced himself to me in the hotel's chandeliered dining room one night. He was staying there with his 22-year-old daughter and was speaking, of course, of cross-country skiing. ''We don't do the lazy skiing,'' he said. 
 By that he meant downhill, where gravity does much of the work. I could see his point. Norway is a perfectly nice place for downhill skiing, with plenty of intermediate blue and green runs. But its five black diamonds offer only short bursts. If you want the adrenaline rush of alpine skiing, you're better off in the Alps or Aspen, Colo.
 I had spent my first day practicing turns and working on speed but not working up much of a sweat. And since I had the broad, well-groomed slopes practically to myself, and could stop whenever I liked to take in the view, I felt satiated in only a few hours. The real charm here is the gradual pace of it all, and the dramatic wide-open landscape.
 The heart of the region is the Hardangervidda, reached via ski lift from Geilo, a treeless moor 3,500 feet above sea level and one of the most beautifully desolate landscapes on the planet. A former mountain range leveled by ice age glaciers, it is the largest eroded plain in Europe, some 2,500 square miles of undulating snow fields with glassy frozen lakes in winter and mossy, craggy rocks in summer. It is home to Arctic fox, snowy owl and Northern Europe's largest herd of reindeer, which migrate from one end to the other. The bedrock is mostly Precambrian, and its highest point, the Hardanger glacier, reaches 6,112 feet.
 Norwegians are understandably proud of this natural birthright and the independence it affords. It's amazing to see a dozen of them out 
 on the barren plateau, 100 miles from civilization, each veering off in a different direction, arms and legs pistoning, a sled attached by ropes 
 to their waists, a shovel on their backs, heading out to the buried roof of a cabin to dig and sit and ponder. 
 ''It's a very weird culture,'' Magnus Nyborg, a 19-year-old snowboarder, explained to me on the train ride in from Bergen. Four trains make the three- to four-hour trip daily from both Bergen and Oslo, passing desolate snow fields dotted by solitary figures and the tiny jet trails of their skis. ''We travel all this way just to walk around in the snow and then maybe sit and hang out.''
 Nyborg was a friendly and polite kid whose father develops rural land for vacation houses. He wore a knit cap with Kurt Cobain bangs sticking out. He enjoyed what he considered my misconceptions about his country. ''We do not call them fjords,'' he said. ''We call it the sea because that's what it is. Fjords is a nice exotic tourist name.'' He pointed out a guitar-shaped house in the snow, owned by Kurt Nilsen, the plumber-turned-Norwegian-''Idol''-star who won the ''World Idol'' title in 2004, beating out a runner-up named Kelly Clarkson. We passed a teenager on a potato wagon pimped out with speakers blasting Norwegian hip-hop. ''The farms are all losing their kids because they don't want to farm,'' he told me.
 Norway's oil economy has left many Norwegians wealthy -- and conflicted about how their new status fits with their old values. This is a country where, until the 1970s, the main export was salmon and other fish. Resort villages like Geilo have seen explosive growth in large weekend homes. ''Posh cabins,'' Nyborg called them, decked out with flat-screens, Internet and high-speed fiber optics. ''For me,'' he said, ''that's kind of wrong.''
 The cabin boom, which started in 2000, has added about 100 new houses a year to a town of only 2,500 inhabitants. Where once were swaths of pristine snow and tracks, there are now the brown roofs of cabins. The story is typical (farmers sold big plots and got out), but it seems to befuddle the slow-to-change Norwegians. The community can feel overwhelmed when the holiday crowds arrive. And there is anxiety about how these modern lives are changing familial, tied-to-the earth traditions. 
 ''Many people, like myself, feel it went a little too fast,'' said Jon-Andreas Kolderup, a 69-year-old former oil worker who spent childhood weekends nearby in a simple cabin with six beds, a living room and a small kitchen. ''We see people come on Friday to work from the cabin for two days. It makes no sense.'' It was Saturday afternoon, and Kolderup and I were standing on the back porch of Hallingstuene, a traditional restaurant behind the depot, down the street from the small Geilo Hotel, where coach drivers changed horses at the turn of the last century. The place was cozy, done up in painted logs and canopied booths, themselves like little cabins inside. The 54-year-old owner, Frode Aga, often makes the rounds in a cook's coat, telling off-color jokes that everyone hopes to hear. A former chef on a popular TV show, Aga uses only Norwegian meat, like reindeer, elk, grouse and wild lamb -- ''the same race from when the Vikings were here,'' he told me. 
 Kolderup, a county councilman, and Aga are neighbors. The restaurant was empty as they stood on the porch discussing the need to upgrade the state road and improve train service. Both are things that increase growth, not slow it, and so they were conflicted. It turns out most of what they were feeling is the dissolution of community and of a collective destiny. ''Those who sold have not been good enough to reinvest in things like a new grocery,'' Kolderup said. ''I drive to the next town for groceries. We'd like to see people reinvest.''
 The town center was swarmed with SUVs -- the Norwegians had emerged and were stocking up on local salmon and goat cheese. I took a lift to the top of the mountain and found a wonderland of hundreds of skiers. Trails into the Hardangervidda looked like a conga line at points. There were men who were shirtless and sweating. Families were having picnics, set up on lichen-cushioned rocks, eating oranges, while grandmothers aerobically glided past, pulled by golden retrievers. At the top of a long incline, there was suddenly no one and I was alone with my thoughts, as if I were on top of the world all by myself. Then I crested another ridge and there were dozens of cabins sprouting like mushrooms in snow.
 I ran into a lanky 40-year-old carpenter named Rune Bakken, a former board member of Geilo's cross-country ski club. He and several other people were off on a six-hour run and invited me along. I declined. Six hours was a long time to be gliding around in the snow. And besides, I hadn't brought my oranges or my shovel. ''People are building huts as big as possible,'' he said, standing there in his black spandex and pointing over the ridge. ''Over 1,000 square meters. And what for? Everything you want is out here. It is a waste.'' 
 On another crisp morning, I headed to the train depot and joined the colorful crowds, decked out in their snow bibs and polarized goggles, to head west, across the northern edge of the Hardangervidda, to see more of Norway. First stop, the highest point of any railway in Scandinavia, the tiny outpost of Finse. The 40-minute ride was surreal: as the train gradually climbed 1,400 feet, whipped-cream snow fields were tinted pink and orange as I sipped espresso in the cafe car and squinted hard to be sure I really did see a lone figure a mile off, heading into a whiteout nowhere. To the north, the Hallingskarvet mountain range reared up like a buried mastodon.
 When the train reached Myrdal, some of us boarded a train on the Flam Railway, one of the world's steepest, which corkscrews through misty mountain passes, past cliff-hugging hamlets draped in rainbows, and skirts the Kjosfossen waterfall, pausing long enough for us to snap pictures. In spring the falls are a powerful 305-foot wall of rushing snow melt; in winter they're a frozen curtain strewn with lights. As we glided down toward the village of Flam, the tracks leveled out into lush green valleys, as if winter had suddenly turned into spring.
 We had an hour in Flam before the ferry took us across the Aurlandsfjord. I sat on the dock, ringed by majestic mountains that plunge into the icy blue fjord, the village of 350 quiet and empty except for the 30 or so tourists sifting through the troll and Viking dolls at the dock-side shops. Morten Seim, a local taxi driver who was drinking coffee near me, said he had wasted 20 years of his life driving a cab here and should have left when he was young. I hadn't expected such candor. ''What can I do?'' he said. ''The boats come and the boats go. I just wait.'' Behind a cafe serving burgers and fries, I found three local guys hanging out by a parked car. One of them, Torjus Hilstad, had graduated from college two years ago, had married and was back home working in tourism. ''Life here is like a light switch. Mid-May, turn on, mid-September, turn off,'' he said, referring to the crowds that come and go with the seasons. ''I snowboard in winter and go on welfare. My wife and I have two 165-pound South African Boerboel dogs to keep us company in the boring months. You need plenty of hobbies here to survive.''
 Soon the ferry horn blew, and we abandoned the locals for the trip down the fjord. On either side of us, 6,500-foot snow-tipped mountains wreathed in clouds created Rorschach images in the mirrored water. The fjord, carved by glaciers during the last ice age, rolled past and revealed behind blind turns isolated communities no bigger than a few wooden houses sitting on spits of grass or rocky land. Thin waterfalls threaded the cliff face. There were no people around. The ferry passengers became silent, as if we were passing backward through time or through a somber cathedral. 
 Back in Geilo, the hotels started getting loud. Even though the Norwegians have their cabins, they hit the hotels at night, sometimes for dinner but, for the younger crowd, mostly just to party. The scene is nothing like it is in the Alps, in places like St. Anton in Austria, which resemble a European disco in ski wear. On this particular night, the Dr. Holms upstairs lounge and its smoking balconies were jampacked as the stereo blasted 1970s Eric Clapton. 
 But the place to be was down the hill, past the now sleeping town center, at the Thon Hotel Highland. Snowboarders from all over Europe had turned out earlier in the day for a competition hosted by Andreas Wiig, Norway's Winter X Games gold medalist. The place was packed with 300 20-somethings there to see the Swedish hip-hop artist Timbuktu.
 Norway's newfound wealth has created an underclass of service workers, many of them from neighboring Sweden, where the economy is tanking. As a result, there is a lot of class anxiety among the young Swedes who flock here to work in the hotels and bars, most of it aimed at their youthful and privileged Norwegian counterparts. ''They're lazy and think they don't have to work,'' a young Swedish waitress at the Dr. Holms told me. About 20 yards away, Timbuktu strutted across a stage, belting his reggae hip-hop. ''Look at this dumb girl right here,'' she said. A drunk girl had knelt down behind a friend, trying to get another friend to push her over. ''This is a fun thing to Norwegians. Why?'' 
 For their part, the Norwegians -- whose country was once part of Sweden -- remain stoically Viking about it. As Nyborg said to me, ''We are people of nature. They are not.'' 
 I ran into Rune Bakken, the carpenter and cross-country-skiing enthusiast, standing by the stage in a gray hoodie and baggie pants. He handed me a beer. Over the thump of Timbuktu's ''Tack for Kaffet'' (''Thanks for the Coffee''), he asked how my day had been. I told him it was glorious. ''We have the best nature!'' he said, staring at the strutting rapper. ''What can I say? We have the best, best nature.'' KEVIN GRAY

HEADLINE: How Can We Help?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
Nicholas D. Kristof is an Op-Ed columnist at The Times and the author, with Sheryl WuDunn, of ''Half the Sky: Turning Oppression Into Opportunity for Women Worldwide.''

 BODY:
The number of bleeding hearts has soared exponentially over the last decade. Celebrities embraced Africa, while conservatives went from showing disdain for humanitarian aid (''money down a rat hole'') to displaying leadership in the fight against AIDS and malaria. Compassion became contagious and then it became consensus.
 Yet all the wringing hands never quite clasped. Just as the bleeding hearts seemed victorious, they divided in a ferocious intellectual debate about how best to help poor people around the world. One group, led by Bono and the indefatigable Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University, argues that the crucial need is for more money. After all, aid for development is quite modest: for every $100 in national income, we Americans donate just 18 cents in ''official development assistance'' to poor countries. Sweden donates five times as much. Sachs's book ''The End of Poverty'' is the bible of this camp. 
 The rival camp, led by William Easterly of New York University, argues that more money doesn't necessarily help, and may hurt. Easterly, whose powerful and provocative book ''The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good'' appeared in 2006, is still rocking the world of do-gooders. His book was a direct assault on Sachs's, and it has been influential because, frankly, much of his critique rings true, even among aid workers. 
 Easterly has been joined this year by Dambisa Moyo, a Zambian economist who wrote ''Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa.'' Moyo attracted attention in part because of the novelty of an African denouncing aid to Africa, and her book has set off another wave of bitter, personal feuding between the two camps. Few people fight as savagely as humanitarians.
 The Easterly/Moyo camp notes that anybody who has traveled in Africa has seen aid projects that have failed, undermined self-reliance and entrepreneurship, even harmed people. Economists find no correlation between countries that received aid and those that grew quickly. Indeed, the great economic successes in modern times (mostly in Asia) often received little aid.
 It's also clear that doing good is harder than it looks. For example, abundant evidence suggests that education can be transformative in a poor country, so donors often pay for schools. But building a school is expensive and can line the pockets of corrupt officials. And in my reporting I've found that the big truancy problem in poor countries typically involves not students but teachers: I remember one rural Indian school where the teachers appeared only once or twice a year to administer standardized tests. To make sure that the students didn't do embarrassingly badly on those exams, the teachers wrote all the answers on the blackboard. The critics can cite similar unexpected difficulties in almost every nook of the aid universe.
 If Sachs represents the Hegelian thesis and Easterly the antithesis, we now have hope of seeing an emerging synthesis. It would acknowledge the shortcomings of aid, but also note some grand successes. For example, the number of children dying each year before the age of 5 has dropped by three million worldwide since 1990, largely because of foreign aid. Yes, aid often fails -- but more than balancing the failures is quite a triumph: one child's life saved every 11 seconds (according to my calculations from United Nations statistics).
 Moreover, pragmatic donors are figuring out creative ways to overcome the obstacles. Take education. Given the problems with school-building programs, donors have turned to other strategies to increase the number of students, and these are often much more cost-effective: (1) Deworm children. This costs about 50 cents per child per year and reduces absenteeism from anemia, sickness and malnutrition. A Kenya study found, in effect, that it is only one twenty-fifth as expensive to increase school attendance by deworming students as by constructing schools. (2) Bribe parents. One of the most successful antipoverty initiatives is Oportunidades in Mexico, which pays impoverished mothers a monthly stipend if their kids attend school regularly. Oportunidades has raised high school enrollment in some rural areas by 85 percent.
 I don't mean to imply that building brick-and-mortar schools is an outmoded idea. My wife and I built a school in Cambodia, through American Assistance for Cambodia, because we were able to establish that teachers do show up there, that the bottleneck in rural Cambodia is school construction, and that our donation would be highly leveraged. Likewise, Greg Mortenson's famous school-building efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan, described in his superb book, ''Three Cups of Tea'' (written with David Oliver Relin), makes a huge difference on the ground. The point is to be relentlessly empirical.
 One of the challenges with the empirical approach is that aid organizations typically claim that every project succeeds. Failures are buried so as not to discourage donors, and evaluations are often done by the organizations themselves -- ensuring that every intervention is above average. Yet recently there has been a revolution in evaluation, led by economists at the Poverty Action Lab at M.I.T. They have designed rigorous studies to see what actually works. The idea is to introduce new aid initiatives randomly in some areas and not in others, and to measure how much change occurred and at what cost. This approach is expensive but gives a much clearer sense of which interventions are most cost-effective.
 The upshot is that we can now see that there are many aid programs that work very well. We don't need to distract ourselves with theoretical questions about aid, so long as we can focus on deworming children and bribing parents. The new synthesis should embrace specific interventions that all sides agree have merit, while also borrowing from an important insight of the aid critics: trade is usually preferable to aid. 
 I was recently in Liberia, a fragile African democracy struggling to rebuild. It is chock-full of aid groups rushing around in white S.U.V.'s doing wonderful work. But it also needs factories to employ people, build skills and pay salaries and taxes. Americans are horrified by sweatshops, but nothing would help Liberia more than if China moved some of its sweatshops there, so that Liberians could make sandals and T-shirts. 
 Paul Collier, an Oxford University economist who exemplifies the emerging synthesis in his brilliant book ''The Bottom Billion,'' has lately argued that the best way to rescue Haiti is for America to encourage a local textile manufacturing industry, which could export to the United States, creating jobs and a larger tax base.
 As these ideas spread, we're seeing more aid organizations that blur the boundary with business, pursuing what's called a double bottom line: profits but also a social return. For example, the New York-based Acumen Fund is a cross between a venture capital operation and an aid group: it invests ''patient capital,'' accepting below-market returns and offering management help in a Tanzanian company that makes antimalaria bed nets, for instance, and in a hospital company in India that offers a for-profit model to fight maternal mortality. The founder of Acumen Fund, Jacqueline Novogratz, recently published a memoir, ''The Blue Sweater,'' that argues for this kind of approach.
 In the 1960s, there were grand intellectual debates about whether capitalism was heroic or evil; today we simply worry about how to make it work. At last, we may be doing the same with foreign aid.

BYLINE: By JEFFRIES BLACKERYBY

 BODY:
They'd been sleeping on Pirate's Bay beach for three days. About a dozen of them -- white guys with dreadlocks, their bikinied girlfriends and a golden retriever. They had come from Tobago's busy south end, where they lived, to this quiet corner of the island for a long weekend of sleeping under the stars. A few hammocks were strung up between the mangroves, and bottles of Beefeater, cigarettes, food and supplies littered a folding table. They said they were originally from Trinidad, Tobago's sister island 22 miles away. A couple of them tended to the campfire while a group played Frisbee fetch with the dog. After a time, a few more friends showed up on a boat idling out in the pale green Caribbean water. ''Hey!'' one of them yelled from the deck. He held up a pair of flippers and a snorkel mask to the applause of the crowd onshore. 
 Pirate's Bay, in the far northwest fishing village of Charlotteville, sits at the end of a half-mile hike up and over a grassy ridge guarded by goats. It's as close to an idealized scenario of ''The Blue Lagoon'' meets ''The Beach'' as there is within five hours of New York, and though the beach was lively, I felt entirely hidden from the world. And it was a perfect spot for snorkeling. On the other end of the beach, an Austrian man was slowly kicking his way around the rocks and reefs. When I asked him how the visibility was, he told me to go ahead and use his gear for a while, he didn't mind. I could have lived for a couple of days on Pirate's Bay and been well looked after.
 There are plenty of Caribbean islands with secluded beaches, but none quite like Tobago. Try winding up as a guest at a beach campfire in Jamaica or St. Martin or Grand Cayman -- or, for that matter, try getting any real sense of how a local spends his time when he's not working in your hotel or driving your taxi. Tourism may be the lifeblood of many Caribbean islands, but to be the fantasy vacation destination of global sun seekers is both a blessing and a curse. 
 The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago does not, strictly speaking, need anyone to visit. The former British colony, sovereign since 1962, sits at the southern edge of the Caribbean Sea on rich reserves of oil and natural gas. It's the chief supplier of liquefied natural gas to the United States, and if you use anything with ammonia, urea or methanol, it probably comes from here, too. Warren Solomon, Tobago's director of tourism, says that while the focus on energy production has financed the country's infrastructure, it hasn't created jobs. On Tobago, the more visitor-friendly counterpart to industrial Trinidad, tourism employs more than half the island and makes up roughly half the gross domestic product. 
 As much as the government has stepped up its effort to attract visitors, it also finds itself in the privileged position of being able to take it slow. The government encourages new hotels on Tobago to have no more than 75 rooms, and it restricts them from being more than two or three stories. (''No taller than a coconut tree,'' Solomon says.) It also supports entrepreneurs who want to jump into the tourism business; currently about 90 percent of the hotels and resorts on the island are locally owned.
 Gloria Jones-Knapp is one of those entrepreneurs. A former model who grew up on Tobago, she now owns the Bacolet Beach Club, the island's newest boutique hotel. Jones-Knapp built the property on a small bluff across from Half Moon Blue, the hotel that she opened 17 years ago, and filled it with the same kind of four-poster beds she remembers from her grandmother's house. The 22 rooms and infinity pool sit on a cliff side that rambles down to a tight cove on the Atlantic, the same spot where as a young girl Jones-Knapp used to climb through the bush and over the rocks to reach the beach. ''A lot of locals didn't even know there was beach there,'' she says. She was careful to preserve the natural terrain and its wildlife and, along with that, the sense of being let in on an old secret.
 Tobago has self-preservation in its DNA. The Main Ridge Forest Reserve, 17,000 acres in the middle of the island, is one of the oldest protected rain forests in the Western Hemisphere, designated in 1776. Much of the island's landscape -- hilly and lush, with dramatic rocky outcroppings that give way to dozens of hidden cove beaches -- looks unchanged since then. Only in the southern part, around Crown Point, and the capital of Scarborough will you find anything that resembles a crowd. The rest is little more than clusters of small houses, lone general stores and beach shacks serving ''shark and bake'' sandwiches. Visiting Tobago, unlike so many islands, means being nose to nose with the real life of the place, even if the authenticity can be jarring. This is the first place I've visited that has both a 3.5 percent unemployment rate and stray dogs and chickens roaming free.
 ''It's not about representing the Caribbean here,'' Jones-Knapp says. ''They do that all over the islands.'' More infinity pools may come to Tobago, but it will be a long time before sleepovers end on Pirate's Bay. ''A lot of islands create a facade. It's about keeping the money inside of those all-inclusive places. But in Tobago, everything is so free.'' JEFFRIES BLACKERYBY

HEADLINE: 50 Years Ago, the Last Edsel

BYLINE: By RICHARD S. CHANG

 BODY:
IT was 50 years ago Thursday that Ford announced it was ending production of the Edsel. (Insert joke here.) 
 The Edsel was the original Yugo. The first Aztec. It was the colossal failure to which all future failures would be compared.
 But the car wasn't just a lemon. It was also a catastrophe of marketing and was panned by the public. 
 Among other things, it was mocked for having a grille that looked like a toilet seat. Time magazine said it resembled an Oldsmobile sucking a lemon. That distinguishing feature was more affectionately known as the horse-collar grille.
 The Edsel was introduced on Sept. 4, 1957, or E-Day. Based on the standard Ford body, the Edsel was a big car that could seat six people in comfort and guzzle gas with similar ease. The Edsel was styled to portray more of an upscale look. The problem, according to historians, was that the United States was entering a recession, and the public's appetite for conspicuous luxury was on the wane. The Edsel was a failure from the start, and Ford knew it. 
 By 1959, the Edsel was on its last legs, and the final car -- one of just 2,846 1960 models -- came off the assembly line on Nov. 19. 
 Ford was said to have lost about $125 million on the Edsel, and its failure has only grown in stature since then. Just as Cadillac is synonymous with luxury, Edsel equates to spectacular failure.RICHARD S. CHANG

HEADLINE: Shifting Priorities

BYLINE: By JOYCE COHEN

 BODY:
FOR more than five years, Jack Wu and his wife, Chiyomi Uchino Wu, lived rent-free in a two-family house owned by Mr. Wu's parents in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn. It was ''the perfect way to save money,'' Mr. Wu said.
 But the commute ''was killing us every morning,'' he said. The trip to work -- they own a floral design shop, Adore (adorenyc.com) on Lafayette Street in NoHo -- was 20 minutes with no traffic but an hour during the morning rush. ''Every morning,'' Mr. Wu said, ''I would curse in the car driving to Manhattan.''
 What's more, the two were eager to move to a neighborhood with restaurants, stores and night life. In Dyker Heights, there were ''never people going by, just cars,'' said Ms. Wu, who had lived with roommates in Brooklyn and Manhattan before meeting her husband. 
 ''Usually people go to Dyker Heights to see Christmas decorations,'' she said. ''All we had was houses, houses, houses. I missed living somewhere something is happening.'' 
 As a teenager, Mr. Wu, now 33, immigrated from China with his family. He and Ms. Wu, 32, a native of Nagasaki, Japan, met through friends shortly after she immigrated seven years ago. They married soon afterward. 
 Two years ago, they began hunting for a one-bedroom apartment closer to their shop. But they couldn't find a nice place in their price range: $600,000 to $700,000. One apartment was above a noisy bar on busy East 23rd Street. The seller of a small Chelsea condo ''tried to make it look bigger with a mirror on the wall, but it was not working,'' Ms. Wu said. 
 They could have bought an 850-square-foot unit at LaGrande Condominium, a 1990 building at Grand and Baxter Streets, for $650,000, Mr. Wu said, but they were ambivalent. 
 ''I tried to compromise because the price was O.K. compared to other prices,'' Ms. Wu said. But she didn't like the location on the edge of Chinatown. The view included piles of trash from the elementary school next door. 
 Still, they considered it, until a friend suggested exploring other parts of Brooklyn. Williamsburg, with plenty of new condos near the waterfront, was especially convenient. The more they drove around, the more ''we could see ourselves living there,'' Mr. Wu said. They tested the drive to work via the Williamsburg Bridge. At its worst, it was just 20 minutes.
 They preferred a relatively small building where they would be likely to know their neighbors. In most cases, they could afford only the smallest units on low floors. They loved the high-end finishes of the Edge, but it was nowhere near ready for occupancy. 
 But 125 North 10th, six stories tall, seemed worth the wait. The couple chose a south-facing 820-square-foot one-bedroom with a balcony. Ms. Wu decorated it in her head. The price was $695,000, with a parking spot for $55,000. Monthly charges were a bit over $700. The Wus were early buyers, signing a contract a year and a half ago.
 ''We figured we were going to live in Williamsburg and party every Friday and Saturday night, hang out with friends, drink, go on a vacation every now and then,'' Mr. Wu said. Then, a year ago on Halloween, ''the scary moment came.'' They found out that Ms. Wu was pregnant.
 They didn't intend to have a baby for two years or so, possibly relocating to a bigger home then. Their priorities immediately shifted. They thought about adding a living-room partition to create a second bedroom, but that would have eliminated light in the living area.
 ''I had no idea how much space a baby would need,'' Ms. Wu said. But she knew it was more than a closet, so she refused to house the baby there. 
 By now the economy was worsening. Their flower business has many corporate accounts, and customers were slashing their spending. Lobbies and restaurants were going flower-free. 
 ''It was the worst time in my life,'' Mr. Wu said. A baby and a condo closing were imminent, and the family income was down by nearly half.
 So they negotiated hard, and were able to upgrade to a 1,000-square-foot two-bedroom. The list price was $860,000, and they paid $800,000. Monthly charges are around $800. They gave up the balcony and the parking spot but gained a second bathroom. ''I need to do what I can for my baby,'' Mr. Wu said. 
 It was tough to get a mortgage, too, with lenders wary of new developments. The Wus were able to get financing if they left a 30 percent down payment, up from the expected 20 percent. The closing costs for a new condo were higher than expected. 
 They were grateful that the closing was delayed for nine months, which gave them time to scrounge up the necessary funds. ''The first person we call is Mom and Dad,'' Mr. Wu said.
 His parents, who own a plant and flower shop, lent $150,000. ''I am lucky to have my parents,'' Mr. Wu said. ''Without them, I don't think I would be able to purchase this condo.''
 Little Tyson was born in June. The couple moved to their new home in August. 
 Of the 86 units, 44 are sold or in contract while 42 are unsold, said Doug Bowen, a vice president of Core, the building's sales agent. Prices of the remaining units were reduced by 15 percent, on average, in early October, he said.
 The Wus aren't thrilled about that, ''but we understand,'' Mr. Wu said. ''Whatever the sponsor can do to attract more buyers, we are O.K. with it.''
 They are enjoying their new apartment, where Tyson doesn't yet take up much room. They park their car, which they use for flower deliveries, on the street. They are relieved that business has recently perked up. The responsibility of a baby means ''a new chapter for us,'' Mr. Wu said.
 They are concerned about schools, which they never thought about before. The neighborhood now feels young, and not especially baby-friendly. 
 The Wus wish they could take more advantage of their new neighborhood. ''When we see people having fun eating at the restaurants, just kind of hanging out,'' Mr. Wu said, ''we feel like, man, this is what we should be doing! We feel we missed out on the night life here.'' 
 It's just as well. Their budget is still tight. ''I haven't been to a lot of restaurants yet,'' Ms. Wu said. ''We do takeout.''

PERSON: Thomas J. Graff 

HEADLINE: Thomas J. Graff, 65, an Expert on West Coast Water Use

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Thomas J. Graff, a leading environmentalist who championed the idea of offering financial incentives for environmentally friendly behavior, an approach that had far-reaching impact on state and federal policies, especially on water use in the drought-prone West, died Nov. 12 in Oakland, Calif., where he lived. He was 65.
 The cause was thyroid cancer, his family said. 
 Mr. Graff, who founded the first California office of the Environmental Defense Fund and led it for 37 years, dealt with a host of environmental issues, including AB 32, the first-of-its-kind legislation, adopted in 2006, that sets limits on greenhouse gas emissions in California. But he made his biggest impact in the realm of water use, a constant source of vexation in the West. 
 Mr. Graff's early support for using market forces to encourage environmentally friendly behavior was a somewhat radical idea at the time. But it has since become increasingly common in environmental negotiations nationwide and has echoes in ''cap and trade'' policies around the world involving things like airborne pollutants and carbon emissions. 
 ''If a resource is scarce, we ought to put a price on it that reflects its value,'' Mr. Graff said in an interview in 2008. ''Otherwise there's an incentive to over-consume.''
 Mr. Graff's theory was put to wide use in 1992, when he cajoled federal lawmakers into passing the Central Valley Project Improvement Act, a landmark bill that established a new accounting system to assure that diversions of water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, whose waters help irrigate millions of acres of farmland to the south, would not outstrip the delta's own ecological needs. 
 The bill also established a groundwork for a so-called water market, which allowed agricultural interests to sell excess water to cities and other users for a profit. This process rewarded farmers for conservation and simultaneously helped protect the delta, where salmon and other fish are sometimes endangered by giant pumps and low water levels in tributaries. 
 ''On the Central Valley Improvement Act, no person was more important than Tom Graff,'' Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, said in a statement after his death. ''It wasn't just his knowledge of water. It was his knowledge about the stewardship of the environment and what this state had to consider if it really thought about its future.'' 
 Mr. Graff also played a major role in Project 88, an influential, privately financed 1988 report to President-elect George Bush, which focused on ways to use market forces to protect the environment and led to the development of market-oriented controls on acid rain.
 Born in Honduras to Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany and educated in law at Harvard, Mr. Graff learned the art of politics and persuasion in Washington and New York, serving as a clerk for a federal judge in the capital and a legislative assistant to Mayor John V. Lindsay of New York. In 1970, a private law practice drew him to San Francisco, but his love of the environment quickly led him across the bay to Berkeley. 
 In 1971, Mr. Graff established the first California office of the Environmental Defense Fund in Berkeley, near the law library of the University of California campus. He was joining an organization that had staked out a science-based middle ground in the growing and often polarized environmental movement. 
 Mr. Graff's own philosophy combined equal parts pragmatism and personal charm. In Berkeley, he used economists and computer analysts to break down energy and water issues, believing that hard data were a singular tool for winning arguments, whether in boardrooms or courtrooms. (His obsession with statistics was also personal; he kept a running tally of his free-throw percentage during his down-time basketball games.) 
 While corporations and public utilities had long been viewed as the enemy in the environmental movement -- an early motto at the defense fund was ''Sue the bastards'' -- Mr. Graff showed a willingness to work with potential combatants. 
 Indeed, last week, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California hailed Mr. Graff's accomplishments even as he signed a new state water reform law, calling him a friend to ''even those who would normally be considered adversaries.'' 
 Mr. Graff is survived by his wife, Sharona Barzilay of Oakland; two daughters, Rebecca Graff of Cambridge, Mass., and Samantha Graff of Oakland; a son, Benjamin Graff of San Jose, Calif.; a sister, Claudia Bial of Fort Lee, N.J.; and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: After Katrina, Struggle for High Ground

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MASCIA

 BODY:
In her dream, Jennifer Hero is walking down the same sunny New Orleans street. It is not until she reaches St. Charles Avenue that she realizes the city is destroyed, and she is walking among ruins. 
 ''Everyone's family was gone, their social networks were gone,'' Ms. Hero, 48, a New Orleans native, said of the sudden devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. ''Your life is up in the air.''
 Ms. Hero's life will always be divided into before the flood and after, and memories of its aftermath infuse her thoughts, even after her relocation to higher ground. 
 ''We live on a hill,'' she said of the two-bedroom apartment in Park Slope, Brooklyn, she now shares with her son, Wells, 12. ''The chance of flooding is nonexistent -- it would really have to have a freak of nature. And we live on the second floor. Believe me, I've thought about this.''
 Her apartment in the Esplanade Ridge neighborhood of New Orleans was the only one on the block that flooded during Katrina. She estimates that 25 percent of her possessions were salvageable, and she was given two days to take what she could and throw away what she could not.
 ''It was surreal,'' she said. ''Imagine packing and cleaning your house in two days, and having the better part of it covered in mold.'' 
 She and her mother and sister then drove to Jackson, Miss., before continuing to a friend's house in Atlanta, then on to an uncle's house in Kansas before returning to Brooklyn, where Wells had been born. In the three months after the storm, he had attended three schools in three states.
 ''I had to make quick decisions and settle,'' Ms. Hero said, realizing that the serial migration was demoralizing for him. ''I'm not going to move my son again anytime soon.''
 Her displacement, followed by her struggle to get back on her feet in the four years since, has given her a unique perspective on poverty in America. 
 ''No one planned for the poor people,'' she said of the evacuation. ''And nobody questioned that -- not the media, not the residents.'' She contends that the errors committed by government at local, state and federal levels after the storm exposed not deep-seated racism, but classism. 
 ''If New Orleans had been 70 percent white people, then poor white people would have been left behind,'' she said. ''People don't want to associate themselves with poor people, no matter what their race.''
 In New Orleans, Ms. Hero had worked in real estate sales, and she found a similar job in New York. A $17,000 commission from one sale lasted five months, and during that time she searched for freelance computer work. But the economy was so stagnant that ''people were only hiring computer people for emergencies,'' she said. 
 Ms. Hero received financial help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency until this year, when the Disaster Housing Assistance Program was terminated. Child support nets her $700 a month, and she quickly fell behind on her $1,700 rent. 
 ''You feel like giving up,'' she said. ''I mean, how many times can you pull yourself up by the back of the collar and start again?''
 Ms. Hero seems to have a knack for being in the wrong place at the wrong time: The real estate business in New Orleans was ''just starting to rock and roll'' when Katrina hit, she said, and she arrived in New York in time for the subprime mortgage crisis and subsequent crash. At a City Hall reception for New York-based Katrina victims, she said, a social worker told her, ''Call Catholic Charities; they'll help you.'' 
 In July, Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, gave her a month's rent, and later paid $395 for an online course to obtain her real estate broker's license. She now works for a Park Slope-based firm. 
 ''Since Hurricane Katrina, there's been a lot of times that I vacillated between being strong and giving up,'' she said. ''But my son motivates me.''

HEADLINE: The True Price of Admission

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
THIS is college application season for a lot of teenagers, an apt time to pose questions to Sandy Baum, a former professor at Skidmore College and an economist at the College Board. She is the lead author of the College Board's closely followed annual report on college tuition.
 Ms. Baum answered questions by e-mail. Following are excerpts: 
 Q. What's the most common misperception about college costs?
 A. Families and students consistently overestimate the price of college. Headlines frequently focus on the most expensive colleges, but the United States' system of higher education includes a wide variety of institutions offering diverse educational experiences and a wide array of prices. Public two-year colleges -- typically known as community colleges -- generally have much lower tuition than public four-year colleges. Public four-year colleges cost less than private colleges. However, even among private colleges, prices differ by thousands of dollars.
 The other major confusion is between the published price, sometimes called the ''sticker price,'' and the net price that students actually pay after taking grant aid into consideration. Federal and state governments distribute billions of dollars in grants (also known as scholarships), but the largest part comes from colleges and universities themselves. They are essentially discounting their prices. Grant aid covers a large part of tuition for many students, particularly those from low- and moderate-income families.
 Q. Can you break down the differences between the average sticker price and average net price in the three big categories -- public two-year colleges, public four-year colleges and private colleges?
 A. The average grant aid for full-time students at public two-year colleges is more than enough to pay the $2,544 published tuition price. So the average net tuition price at these schools is actually zero. At public four-year colleges, the average net price is about $1,600, compared with a list price of $7,020. At private four-year colleges, it's about $11,900, compared with a list tuition price of $26,273. Of course, each student's circumstances are different, so most students are paying more or less than these average amounts -- and these prices do not include room and board.
 The differences between list tuition and net tuition are so large because about two-thirds of full-time college students receive some grant aid. 
 Q. What have been the long-term trends in net price? Have they differed much among the categories, or are they broadly similar?
 A. The net tuition price paid by students at public two-year colleges has been declining steadily for at least 15 years, after adjusting for inflation. At public and private four-year colleges, the average net price is lower this year than it was five years earlier -- despite significant increases in published prices. The federal government has recently increased Pell Grant financing quite a bit, after a number of years without increases. 
 We don't have good data yet for state and institutional awards in the current year, but aid from these sources has also been rising in recent years. The average net prices student pay, considering all the grant aid they get, have declined at public colleges and risen very slightly relative to general inflation at private colleges over the past decade. This is a real contrast to the published prices, where the most rapid increases have been about 5 percent a year beyond inflation at public four-year colleges.
 Q. So sticker prices have increased a lot more rapidly than net prices?
 A. Yes. At public four-year colleges, the sticker price rose by 20 percent over the past five years (these are inflation-adjusted dollars, as are all historical comparisons I'm making), but the average net price fell $400 --to $1,600 from about $2,000. At private four-year colleges, the sticker price rose by 15 percent, but the average net price fell 9 percent, or about $1,100. 
 It is important to note that these figures are just for tuition and fees. Students also have to live, eat, buy books and cover other expenses while they are in school. 
 Q. Do you think those other costs have become larger or smaller in recent years? Could that be why people feel college is so much more expensive than it used to be?
 A. Despite the declines in actual net tuition prices, college feels more expensive to people for a number of reasons. First, a third of all full-time students pay the full published price, without the benefit of grant aid. College truly has become more expensive for upper-income families.
 Second, room and board and other living costs have increased faster than inflation over time. 
 Another very important reality is that family incomes have been stagnant for the past decade for people at all but the highest income levels. This means that it feels more and more difficult for people to maintain their standards of living and certainly more difficult to finance the major expense of going to college.

HEADLINE: Evolutionary Road

BYLINE: By JOHN BOWE

 BODY:
The first person I asked about life in Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, was Julia Fesenberg, then an executive with Raffles Hotels. Driving from the airport on a muggy, dark gray afternoon, we passed through miles of grim, crude, cinder block construction. Fesenberg waxed in a winsome German accent about her enthusiasm for the city. After years in Angkor Wat, she'd had the option of transferring to a hotel in Europe or the United States. But all of those places were too built up and boring, she said. Cooked. Done. ''My mother's having a hard time understanding my vision,'' Fesenberg said with a shrug. ''But when am I ever going to get the chance to be somewhere less developed?'' 
 I'd been hearing about Phnom Penh since at least the early 1990s, when a group of journalists from New York were hired to staff the just-introduced Cambodia Daily. Dispatches they sent to acquaintances sounded hellish and exciting, in that young-man-meets-failed-state sort of way, with reports of land mines, military checkpoints, handguns, machine guns, coup attempts, cratered streets, opiates and amputee teen prostitutes. 
 At that time, Cambodia was like the floor 
 of a forest scorched by wildfire. Its culture, economy and history had been razed during the 1970s by the political and genocidal experiments of the Khmer Rouge and subsequent occupation by Vietnamese forces. But then waves of outsiders began to arrive, the first bent on regenerating the country (United Nations soldiers, de-miners, consultants, NGO staff), the second with less noble motivations (international lowlifes in search of cheap sex, housing, alcohol and drugs). And in a surprisingly positive way, they created a kind of economic topsoil in the city that is now enabling a newer class of entrepreneurs to take root as the country surges unevenly back to life.
 Alexis de Suremain, 43, is a hotelier and the proprietor of the Pavilion Hotel, down the street from the Royal Palace. It's comfortable but chic, tasteful but not too trendy, and very popular among the growing portion of Cambodia's two million visitors who now add a once-unthinkable stop in Phnom Penh to their Angkor Wat itinerary.
 De Suremain, who came to Cambodia eight years ago with a French NGO, admits that when he first arrived in the city, he hated it. He found the Khmer population easygoing but painfully shy and ruefully uneducated. (No surprise in a country where not so long ago, in an attempt to wipe out ''counter-revolutionary influences,'' government policy was to kill anyone wearing glasses.) However, he also discovered that the place was stunningly free of most regulatory baggage. 
 Sitting at dusk by the palm-fringed pool in his hotel, fielding queries from his staff while eating khmer curry and greens, he said, ''Name any country that allows you to come in with only your passport in your pocket. In a month and a half, you have a business visa, business license, driving license and bank account.'' Suremain's own lack of development -- he'd never even worked at a hotel before -- proved irrelevant. The Pavilion opened its doors in August 2006, and within six weeks he'd achieved 90 percent occupancy. 
 The sentiment was echoed by Ashley Young, a Chinese-Cambodian returnee whose family escaped to Australia in 1979 after the genocide years. After returning with her family 11 years ago to run a garment business, Young, still in her 20s, has found time recently to start three magazines (since folded), an advertising agency, a sofa shop and an apartment rental business. She is now in the proces of opening not one but five cafes. ''Businesses here are so transient,'' she said. ''It's easy to start something for almost nothing here. But that's why I like it.''
 The flip side of free rein from government interference, of course, is corruption. But Cambodia's ranking by the Berlin-based Transparency International as the 11th most corrupt country in the world doesn't seem to trouble Phnom Penh's entrepreneurs. ''People talk a lot about corruption,'' de Suremain explained, ''but have you been to Eastern Europe?'' He recalled a friend's attempt to start a bakery in Russia, where municipal officials demanded $700,000 to connect the electricity. ''At least in Cambodia,'' he said, laughing, ''the corruption is inexpensive.''
 None of the expats I met in Phnom Penh seemed to make much of a profit. But for de Suremain, who plans to expand into seaside resort development and has just opened a ''Chinese lounge'' along the Tonle Sap river, success or failure is secondary to the pleasure of freedom. ''You come here with an idea you've been dreaming of all your life, and you make it happen,'' he said. ''You might hardly make any money, but you get to do what you want.'' 
 Phnom Penh, with two million of Cambodia's 14.5 million inhabitants, still feels fragile. Annual per capita income is an abysmal (but growing) $2,000. Long-awaited war crimes tribunals are grinding away. The capital seems secure, if threadbare, throbbing with honking horns and teeming with urchins. Prior to the global economic downturn, Cambodia's economy, led by tourism and garment manufacturing, was growing at 10 percent per year. Post-downturn it's hard to tell, but on a sunny day you can feel the heartbeat of a place where the lion's share of the populace seems engaged, busily trading, cleaning, repairing, building. 
 Most of the city's expat entrepreneurs are Chinese, Koreans and Malaysians, who tend toward opaque karaoke bars and Johnnie Walker Black. The influx of Western consumers, however, both tourists and residents, has created a distinct and, one suspects, permanent beachhead of polyglot Franken-culture: D.J.'s, classical music festivals, salsa lessons, tapas bars with half-price mojitos. Perhaps the most telling sign of Phnom Penh's gradual evolution toward destination status is the arrival of design-heavy bars playing Radiohead and serving cocktails with unlikely infusions.
 One night I met Anthony Galloway, a native of Perth, Australia, and the founder of Expat Advisory Services, a global Web forum. He suggested we meet at the American-owned Metro Cafe, one of the city's handful of ''hip'' hangouts. (Another is Chow, home of the grapefruit basil martini.) The street-side glass was fashionably curvy; a shifting, rear-bar plasma light segued from fuchsia to aqua, saffron to purple. The sound system played electronica; the menu offered ''gourmet teas'' and chocolate martinis. If not for the group sitting next to us -- ''Hun Sen's people,'' Galloway whispered a little nervously, referring to the country's notoriously shadowy strongman leader -- the place would be interchangeable with any other self-consciously cool bar in the world, circa three or four years ago. 
 When Galloway took me to his house, a few blocks away, the attractions of Phnom Penh became more enviably down-to-earth. We stood on his balcony overlooking Sisowath Quay and the Tonle Sap. The breeze blew in at the perfect temperature. Warm, sliding liquid light from boats and shore played across the river. I had a strong, wistful feeling I've had before -- in northeastern Brazilian surf towns, on the coast of Montenegro -- that this place is too nice to stay the way it is for much longer. 
 If global yuppie culture is creeping into Phnom Penh, it has yet to wipe out the city's subtler, more authentic delights. French colonial restaurants like La Residence (with an entire page of foie gras specialties) continue to exist in a time-frozen, butter-drenched way. Khmer food thrives, notably at the riverside Bopha Phnom Penh Titanic restaurant. Try the banana leaf salad with fried fish, watch the boats ply the Tonle Sap, and listen to the calls from -- yes -- the mosques across the river at prayer time. Spas, from skeezy to exquisite, are ubiquitous, including one place I found near the Sovanna mall that offers ''fish massage treatment.'' 
 This involves suiting up in a cheap Speedo-style bathing suit and soaking in a tank while hundreds of minnows nibble whatever dead skin you dare submerge. It's unforgettable and not for the faint of heart. (I will never forget a hungover Galloway, all beefy 210 pounds of him, shrieking, leaping to his feet and dashing out of the pool several times while the Cambodian attendant pretended not to smirk.) 
 The boozy, decrepit Phnom Penh of earlier lore lives on, in defiant health. At Walkabout Bar, a raunchy, two-story girlie bar on the notorious Street 51, a k a ''the Strip,'' withered Caucasian dipsomaniacs sporting rattails and tattoos clutched their beers with one hand and glassy-eyed, amphetamine-thin prostitutes with the other. The bar, built like a Parisian brasserie, with sliding doors and wobbly tables, smelled at 3 p.m. like a combination of Foster's lager, urine and jaundice.
 One night toward the end of my visit, I trekked out to the InterContinental Hotel, where 50 or so of the city's newest foreign inhabitants had met up. The occasion: Nouveau Beaujolais Night.
 The InterContinental moons about the nether regions of Mao Tse Toung Boulevard, on the Yakutsk end of town. It's a generic zone, low on trees, high on dust, miles from anything discernibly fun. Inside Ballroom 3, I found an assortment of post-graduate-looking business arrivistes from Europe, the United States, India and Singapore, chatting knowingly of ''investments,'' ''projects'' and, most popularly, ''potential.'' Cheese-wise, the event offered few surprises: some Gruyere, Roquefort, a little chevre. 
 Our host, Maxence Goinere, a business development coordinator with Les Celliers France Asie, a wine distributor, wore a dress shirt and close-cropped hair, a look one could call ''eager casual.'' What type of people were these, I asked, clamoring to sample temperature-abused Beaujolais and Camembert in the least interesting part of town? ''Expats,'' he said, squinting his eyes ever so faintly. ''Newly arrived.'' He surveyed the room like a hunter. ''An event like this is good to know the market.'' 
 Not long before my trip, I'd interviewed a Khmer for a project I was working on, who described life under the Khmer Rouge. A monk since the age of 16, he'd been herded by government soldiers into a labor camp and nearly starved to death. He survived by eating bugs, geckos and grass before one day being forced at gunpoint into marriage and sex. I wondered what he or the average Khmer would think of Nouveau Beaujolais Night.
 I found a server, a Khmer woman. I asked her if she liked wine. She waved her hand, shyly, as if to say, ''Sorry, good girls don't talk to strangers.'' I tried again, and realized that her hesitation concerned admitting the fact of drinking alcohol. With one more request, she suddenly began to hold forth. I found that her response spoke volumes about the distance traveled economically and culturally by the Khmers themselves in two generations from the killing fields to Ballroom 3.
 Well, yes, she said, after work, after a long day, she did in fact like to settle down to a drink. Not too much, and certainly not hard liquor, or local whiskeys, but wine. Not white, but red. And French, preferably. Sounding as much the oenophile as her customers elsewhere in the room, half folk doctor, half newly born consumer, she explained, ''It's good for the heart.'' JOHN BOWE

HEADLINE: Survey of Pakistan's Young Predicts 'Disaster' if Their Needs Aren't Addressed

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: LAHORE, Pakistan 

 BODY:
Pakistan will face a ''demographic disaster'' if it does not address the needs of its young generation, the largest in the country's history, whose views reflect a deep disillusionment with government and democracy, according to a report released here on Saturday. 
 The report, commissioned by the British Council and conducted by the Nielsen research company, drew a picture of a deeply frustrated young generation that feels abandoned by its government and despondent about its future. 
 An overwhelming majority of young Pakistanis say their country is headed in the wrong direction, the report said, and only 1 in 10 has confidence in the government. Most see themselves as Muslim first and Pakistani second, and they are now entering a work force in which the lion's share cannot find jobs, a potentially volatile situation if the government cannot address its concerns.
 ''This is a real wake-up call for the international community,'' said David Steven, a fellow at the Center for International Cooperation at New York University, who was an adviser on the report. ''You could get rapid social and economic change. But the other route will lead to a nightmare that would unfold over 20 to 30 years.''
 The report provides an unsettling portrait of a difficult time for Pakistan, a 62-year-old nuclear-armed country that is fighting an insurgency in its western mountains and struggling to provide for its rapidly expanding population. The population has risen by almost half in just 20 years, a pace that is double the world average, according to the report.
 The despair among the young generation is rooted in the condition of their lives, the report found. Only a fifth of those interviewed had permanent full-time jobs. Half said they did not have sufficient skills to enter the workplace. And one in four could not read or write, a legacy of the country's abysmal public education system, in which less than 40 percent of children are enrolled in school, far below the South Asian average of 58 percent.
 While most do not trust their government, they attach their loyalty to religion. Three-quarters identified themselves primarily as Muslim, with just one in seven identifying themselves as Pakistani. 
 The demographic power of this generation represents a turning point for Pakistan. Its energy, if properly harnessed, could power an economic rise, as was the case in many East Asian countries in the 1990s, Mr. Steven said in a telephone interview. 
 But if the opportunity is squandered by insufficient investment in areas like education and health care, the country will face a demographic disaster, the report said. To avoid that, the authors of the report calculated that Pakistan's economy would need to grow by 36 million jobs in the next decade -- about a quarter the size of the United States economy -- an enormous challenge in an economy that is growing by about a million jobs a year. 
 Pakistan has a long way to go. The study interviewed 1,226 Pakistanis ages 18 to 29, from different backgrounds across the country, in March and April. More than 70 percent said they were worse off financially than they were last year. This year's budget earmarks just 2 percent of the economy for education, about half the percentage spent in India and Turkey. Life in rural areas is rudimentary. The report cites data showing that 40 percent of households have no electricity, and that animal dung and leftover waste from crops account for more than 80 percent of the country's energy use. 
 Young people's biggest concern -- far above terrorism -- was inflation, which rose to 23 percent in 2009, pushing 7 percent of Pakistanis back into poverty, the report said. More than 90 percent agreed better quality education was a priority.
 There were bright spots. The young people were civic-minded, with a third saying the purpose of education was to create good citizens. They were also more interested in collective action and volunteer activities than their parents. But they were deeply disillusioned with politics, which they saw as corrupt and based on a system in which personal connections mattered more than merit. That sentiment is borne out by the global competitiveness index of 133 countries produced by the World Economic Forum, which in 2009 put Pakistan in slot 101, two notches below Nigeria. 
 ''Here a student struggles day and night but the son of a rich man by giving money gets higher marks than him,'' the report quoted a young man in Lahore as saying. 
 That led to one of the report's most surprising findings: Only a third of those polled thought democracy was the best system for Pakistan, equal to the fraction preferring Islamic law, in what David Martin, director of the British Council in Pakistan, called ''an indictment of the failures of democracy over many years.'' 
 Only 1 in 10 said they were ''very interested'' in political events in Pakistan, while more than a third said they were not interested at all. The highest-ranking institution was Pakistan's military. Sixty percent of those interviewed said that they trusted it. Second highest was religious educational institutions, trusted by about 50 percent of respondents. The national government came last at 10 percent. 
 If the government has failed to channel the energy of Pakistan's youth, militant groups have succeeded, drawing educated and uneducated young people with slogans of jihad and, in some cases, of social justice. 
 The findings were sobering for Pakistani officials. Faisal Subzwari, minister of youth affairs for Sindh Province, who attended the presentation of the report in Lahore, said: ''These are the facts. They might be cruel, but we have to admit them.''
 But young Pakistanis have demonstrated their appetite for collective action, with thousands of people taking to the streets last spring as part of a movement of lawyers, who were demanding the reinstatement of the chief justice, and Mr. Steven argued that the country's future would depend on how that energy was channeled. ''Can Pakistan harness this energy, or will it continue to fight against it?'' he said.

HEADLINE: Go Ahead and Yell. He's Everyone's Punching Bag.

BYLINE: By DEVIN LEONARD

DATELINE: ESTERO, Fla. 

 BODY:
 Norman J. Radow brings out the worst in some people. They scream at him. They sue him. He has even been punched in the face. 
 What has he done to deserve this? In a word: workouts.
 As founder of Radco Development Solutions, Mr. Radow is on the firing line in the continuing battle over failed residential real estate deals. Banks hire him to resurrect developments gone awry, particularly those half-empty condominium towers and gated communities that sprang up like weeds during the boom and are now in foreclosure. 
 Mr. Radow, a lawyer turned developer, has been plying his trade for 15 years. Day in, day out, he has to negotiate with unpaid contractors and architects, face enraged homeowners deprived of heat and hot water, and field calls from bankers anxious for solutions. Ride-alongs with him, then, essentially amount to tours through the still-tangled detritus of the real estate crisis -- with all accompanying venom, tantrums and raw emotions.
 The last year, he says, has been utterly different from all the rest. It's not just that foreclosures and distressed properties are more numerous. 
 ''People used to fight over the value of these projects,'' Mr. Radow says. ''It was almost like someone was throwing a $20 bill in the fire. Everybody jumped for it. Now nobody knows what they are worth.'' 
 Despite being constantly slagged, Mr. Radow -- encased, it would seem, in an invisible sheet of Teflon -- is thriving.
 ''He is the guy who will take a bullet for the lenders without blinking an eye,'' says Dennis J. Powers, a lawyer in the Chicago office of DLA Piper who has defended Mr. Radow in numerous lawsuits. ''It doesn't affect him the way it would you or me. It's just another day in the distressed real estate business for Norm.''
 Mr. Radow estimates that his privately held company is trying to salvage $2 billion worth of distressed property around the country. One of his biggest clients is Lehman Brothers, which is liquidating its huge real estate portfolio to satisfy creditors after declaring bankruptcy last year.
 Radco manages two residential communities for the Lehman estate. One is the Mark, a 244-unit high-rise in San Diego, where 30 percent of the units are unsold. The other is the West Bay Beach and Golf Club here, an exclusive tropical haven with lavish amenities -- four restaurants, an 18-hole course, clay tennis courts and a Zen garden -- conceived for the thousands of people originally expected to buy homes. 
 Unfortunately, the West Bay Club has sold only 617 of the 1,054 dwellings originally planned. 
 Mr. Radow has been working for Lehman for a decade. Now he is branching out to hedge funds and private equity firms. Most of them praise him in private but are reluctant to do so publicly, as it would mean acknowledging they've made some grave errors that he's trying to fix for them.
 An exception to this rule is TriLyn, a real estate investment firm in Greenwich, Conn. Mark Antoncic, its founding partner, says it recently persuaded a judge to hire Radco to manage Balsam Mountain Preserve, a residential community in western North Carolina, while TriLyn tries to remove the original developer. This private community offers owners of its $2 million ''homesteads'' activities including golf and horseback riding.
 There's one problem: only 280 of the 400 lots in this rustic Shangri-La have been sold.
 ''There are a lot of hedge funds who bought high interest notes on properties like these never thinking that they'd wind up with the keys,'' says Mr. Antoncic. ''What are they going to do with these assets now? That's where Norm's business is going to grow.'' 
 It certainly looks that way. Lenders are desperate to avoid the fate of Corus Bankshares, an aggressive condominium lender that federal regulators shut down in September after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation concluded that the bank's $4 billion in assets were worth less than 60 cents on the dollar. 
 And there is more distress to come. Foresights Analytics, a real estate consulting firm, estimates that 42 percent of the $25 billion in outstanding condo construction loans were delinquent in the third quarter this year.
 ''Single-family homes are the largest piece of the overall problem,'' says Matthew Anderson, a partner at Foresight Analytics. ''But the severity of the condo sector is much worse.''
 A lot of would-be real estate titans are now rebranding themselves as workout specialists, but Mr. Radow's competitors may lack his tolerance for abuse. A divorced 52-year-old father of two, he grew up in the projects in East New York before moving to Atlanta in 1987. He is a gossipy, backslapping guy who mixes Yiddishisms with folksy Southern euphemisms. ''That dog don't hunt'' is one of his catchphrases.
 Given the tattered housing market, it may take years for him to generate enough sales for clients to get their investments back. So he advises patience.
 ''In the last few years, developers would put out for-sale signs and they would sell these buildings out in three days,'' he sighs. ''Then they would put together a litigation budget in case they got sued and move on to the next deal. They didn't try to create a sense of community in these places. That's what we do.''
 This, of course, is Mr. Radow's sales pitch to prospective clients. Yes, it is self-serving. But we have seen what happens when real estate developers and their financial enablers take short cuts. Maybe the time has arrived for a dose of his medicine. 
 SHERYL DEERING, the sales director at the West Bay Club, is behind the wheel of one of her club's silver Ford Explorers. She's a little uneasy. Mr. Radow, her relatively new boss, is riding along. 
 The signs of yesteryear's real estate boom surround her. Almost every shopping center, every office building and every church appears to have risen from this flat, swampy terrain in the last decade -- making the evidence of the bust even more surreal. 
 It's no coincidence that President Obama chose Fort Myers, north of Estero, to pitch his $787 billion economic stimulus proposal in February. The unemployment rate here in Lee County is 15 percent. Across the street from a new Super Wal-Mart, a nicely dressed young woman holds a cardboard sign up for passersby. It says: ''Out of work. Homeless.''
 Before heading to the West Bay Club, Mr. Radow decides to take a detour through a competing luxury community where nervous residents are squaring off against a developer that had been hammed by the recession: the TwinEagles development of the Bonita Bay Group. It has a Jack Nicklaus golf course and a clubhouse fashioned after a Scottish manor. There are hiking paths and gardens where homeowners can see deer and wild turkey. 
 But the landscaping in TwinEagles is reverting to its natural state. The links are turning brown, and tiny spruce trees are sprouting in the sand traps. The Bonita Bay Group is trying to sell the golf course to its residents to raise money. Owners in TwinEagles have stopped paying their dues in protest. 
 ''It's going to take a couple of million dollars to bring this back,'' says Mr. Radow. ''Sheryl, could you sell anything in here today?''
 Ms. Deering shakes her head. She knows this all too well. She owns two overgrown TwinEagles lots and the sight of them makes her forlorn. For Mr. Radow, Twin Eagles reminds him of exactly what he wanted to avoid when he took over the troubled West Bay Club for Lehman Brothers a year ago. (In November, Brian Lucas, vice chairman of the Bonita Bay Group, acknowledged the strife at TwinEagles, but said the golf club had reopened.) 
 West Bay was started by Atlantic Gulf Communities, a highflying Miami company that began construction with a $22.5 million loan from Lehman a decade ago and then defaulted, leaving the mess in its lender's hands.
 Lehman put West Bay in the hands of Carmine Visone, one of Lehman's managing directors, and he set out to turn it into a pleasure dome with five condominium towers. The club unveiled its plans for the first two towers in 2005, holding a lush party for brokers. It presold 90 percent of the first one in two weeks. 
 But by the time those towers were finished in 2007, the market had turned. ''People started walking away from their deposits,'' says Ms. Deering. ''We'd never seen that before in the high-end market.''
 Mr. Visone, who declined to be interviewed for this article, didn't seem particularly worried. He bought a $1.4 million condo and boasted last year to Executive Golfer about how much he enjoyed it. ''I'm an early riser,'' he told the magazine. ''I can't imagine a better way to start the day than to sit back with my wife on our 20th-floor terrace and enjoy a morning cup of coffee and watch the sunrise.''
 Everything changed when Lehman imploded on Sept. 15, 2008. Mr. Visone lost his job and the bankrupt firm summoned Mr. Radow, who says he is still flabbergasted by Mr. Visone's work. 
 As Mr. Radow tours the towers with Paul A. Benson, the chief operating officer of the West Bay Club, a disagreement erupts. Mr. Benson oversaw construction of the two towers -- the other three were never built -- and he's proud of his work. Mr. Radow, on the other hand, keeps pointing out what he considers overly extravagant touches. 
 ''No expense was spared in this place,'' he sighs, shaking his head and tapping the granite countertop in one of the bathrooms. 
 ''Paul, what is this stuff?'' Mr. Radow asks.
 ''It's Bahia granite,'' Mr. Benson says. ''It's imported from Brazil.'' 
 ''It must have cost a fortune,'' says Mr. Radow.
 ''You can't blame Carmine for this,'' Mr. Benson protests. ''This is nothing compared to what everybody else was doing. We had to be competitive.''
 ''Yeah, right,'' says Mr. Radow, under his breath. ''We all had to be stupid together. That's no defense.'' Mr. Benson steps into another room and begins yelling into his mobile phone at an underling. 
 ''We have to get rid of this guy,'' Kevin Price, Radco's vice president of condo operations, whispers to Mr. Radow. ''He's too emotional.''
 Mr. Radow acts as if he doesn't hear him. A few weeks later, Mr. Radow says Mr. Benson is leaving West Bay to start his own company, and both he and Mr. Benson say the departure is amicable. Mr. Radow praises Mr. Benson in an e-mail message for doing ''an amazing job'' but adds that he thinks he ''doesn't see the bigger picture.'' 
 Mr. Benson, however, argues that the project will ultimately succeed because he didn't cut corners. 
 THE residents of West Bay were understandably skeptical when Mr. Radow first arrived. Some feared that he had come to Estero to break up the club and sell it off in pieces. 
 ''At the first meeting, there was a lot of tension,'' recalls David Nevins, president of the West Bay Club Property Owner Association.
 Mr. Radow tried to dispel the hostility and tackle the club's $2.5 million annual operating deficit. He opened the books to members, showing them that red ink flowed almost entirely from the unprofitable golf course and four money-losing restaurants. The property owners reluctantly conceded that some perks had to go.
 Radco closed the restaurants in the main clubhouse and the golf club and opened the course to guests from hotels like the Ritz-Carlton in Naples.
 West Bay is now expected to end the year with a deficit of only $31,000. That pleases Mr. Nevins, 62, who has been Mr. Radow's fiercest critic at West Bay. Mr. Nevins is quick to point out that he knows something about the real estate business himself. He rents apartments in State College, Pa., to Penn State students and, as an avid golfer, he regularly e-mails Radco executives with complaints at 5 a.m., before he hits the links.
 Mr. Nevins calls Mr. Radow a ''schmoozer.'' Mr. Radow describes his sparring partner as a ''nudge.'' But these days, they are getting along better. ''I want to give Norm credit,'' says Mr. Nevins. ''He has done some major things in his first year.'' 
 Mr. Nevins, however, says ''the jury is still out'' on Radco. The firm is in delicate negotiations with PB Capital, West Bay's condo construction lender. The club's $17 million loan came due in March. Mr. Radow is confident that he can get an extension but concedes that the bank isn't making it easy for him.
 PB Capital, which did not respond to interview requests, might feel more comfortable if Radco was selling more condos at West Bay. But though it has discounted prices 35 percent and offered ''developer paid'' golf club memberships, it sold only five homes in the third quarter.
 ''West Bay may be a good community with a beautiful golf course,'' says Timothy S. Becker, director of the Kelley A. Bergstrom Center for Real Estate Studies at the University of Florida. ''They are doing O.K. But they are selling condos, and condos sales in Florida are not doing O.K.''
 Mr. Radow is undaunted. He says he expects sales to increase in the next few months as more snowbirds arrive. 
 FEW people set out to spend their days being harangued by condo owners. Mr. Radow certainly didn't. He found his true calling as a workout guy relatively late in life. He put himself through law school by fixing up and selling an apartment building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. 
 It never occurred to him that he might have a talent for turnarounds until he worked similar wonders with a down-on-its-luck hotel in Atlanta in 1994. His lender was Lehman Brothers. The bank started parachuting Mr. Radow into its floundering residential real estate projects. 
 ''Norman has the ability to work with general contractors and ornery homeowners who are filing frivolous lawsuits,'' says David Broderick, a former managing director in Lehman's Global Real Estate Group and now a lawyer at Allen & Overy. ''He can handle all the dirty work.''
 Some of Mr. Radow's assignments might as well have been combat duty. He mopped up a botched Chicago condo project after the developer defaulted on the mortgage and Lehman accused her in court records of taking buyers' deposits. A bankruptcy court judge later ruled in the investment bank's favor. 
 In 2003, Lehman sent him to Boston to rescue a failed condo tower. There had been a fire after the bank foreclosed on the mortgage. Radco repaired the damage and quelled labor unrest. At one point, Mr. Radow says, a union elevator operator punched him in the face when he absent-mindedly pushed the button for his floor. ''He said, 'This is a union job!' '' Mr. Radow remembers, massaging his jaw.
 There were some things his company couldn't fix. Ceilings in the tower were seven and a half feet high, about a foot and a half less than typically found in luxury condos. ''He tried to squeeze an extra floor into the building,'' Mr. Radow says of the project's developer, William Matt. Mr. Matt declined to comment.
 To help solve the height problem, Mr. Radow hired only sales people who weren't much taller than 5 feet. He sold all the units, and Lehman Brothers was thrilled.
 ''We ended up making some money,'' says Chris Westfahl, a former Lehman managing director who oversaw the deal, sounding as if he still couldn't believe that it had happened. 
 But Mr. Radow's long association with Lehman has its downside. He says he may be deposed by SunCal, a major land acquisition company in Irvine, Calif., in Lehman's bankruptcy proceeding. SunCal accuses Lehman, which lent it more than $2 billion, of trying to ''usurp'' its property in a ''self-serving scheme.'' 
 What does Radco have to do with any of this? Lehman, which disputes the accusations, brought it in to settle up with some SunCal creditors as part of a workout.
 ''Welcome to my world,'' Mr. Radow shrugs. 
 Earlier this year, he says, he found himself in a room full of angry homeowners at the Met Warner Center a condominium project in Woodland Hills, Calif., which he has been managing for a Lehman Brothers private equity fund. Mr. Radow said there was one guy who wouldn't stop badgering him about, well, something. It might have been the rule forbidding residents from installing their own air-conditioners. Or he might have been protesting the Met's outdoor smoking ban. 
 ''It was one of those three-hour meetings that tested your bladder,'' says Marty Golden, a board member of the condominium owners association there. ''This guy just wouldn't let up.''
 Finally, Mr. Radow grabbed a chair and pushed it into the center of the room. ''The answer is no,'' he remembers telling his adversary. ''It's not going to change. But it seems as though you've got a lot more to say.''
 Mr. Radow said he then sat down and loosened his tie. ''I've got all night,'' he warned.

HEADLINE: Lots to Spend, Little to Buy

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
PITY the long-suffering brokers of luxury Manhattan real estate. They endured a lonely spell, waiting for the phone to ring. Few properties sold and few buyers were even looking. Now with the Wall Street bonus season about to begin, they are suffering again, they say, but this time because of a drought in inventory. 
 After a bump-up in sales over the last few months, brokers say, more wealthy buyers have come back to the table, looking for fabulous apartments at a bargain. But there are precious few listings. ''I have clients who feel this is the time to buy,'' said Felise Gross, a broker at Brown Harris Stevens, ''but there is very little prime property to show them.'' 
 The listing drought, they say, is most pronounced in large condominiums in the most celebrated new buildings, but also significant in the town house market. And even in the luxury co-op market, where there are more listings, only a fraction have been priced competitively enough to attract buyers, brokers said.
 Last week, Thomas P. DiNapoli, the New York State comptroller, gave brokers cheer in a report suggesting that Wall Street had begun to rebound faster than expected. 
 The report said total compensation at the six largest banks could exceed the $163.9 billion that was paid in 2007, before the financial crisis. But some Wall Street segments like hedge funds are still weaker than before, and the securities industry is down 28,300 jobs in the city (though the number of jobs rose slightly in September). State budget officials are predicting a 22 percent decline in total cash bonuses across New York State, the report said. 
 In short, with employment down, a smaller number of Wall Streeters could be dividing up a larger bonus pool, though some of it will be in deferred earnings. 
 These buyers are joining a market already crowded with wealthy foreigners looking to take advantage of the weak dollar, brokers said. 
 Robby Browne, a Corcoran broker, said he had several wealthy clients seeking trophy properties but had nothing to show them that was ''good to buy.'' He noted that a town house at 92 Charles Street, owned by Armon Bar-Tur, a founder of SafeHarbor Capital Partners, a real estate investment firm, went into contract less than two weeks after it was listed late last month.
 When sales first began to pick up over the summer, brokers say, some of the best-priced listings were sold; they have not been replaced by a new supply of similar listings. 
 Buyers who might have been self-conscious about buying luxury apartments in the midst of the recession are now back in the market, said Kirk Henckels, the director of Stribling Private Brokerage. ''Now when you can say you bought it at a third off of its previous value, it is not quite so embarrassing,'' he said. ''You look smart.'' 
 Nowhere is the luxury drought more apparent than at 15 Central Park West, the new condo at West 62nd Street, which not long ago had a listing for $80 million. That unit, a 5,200-square-foot four-bedroom, finally sold in September for $37 million.
 A three-bedroom owned by Beny Alagem, the founder of Packard Bell Electronics, was listed for $24 million and sold at the end of September for $19.9 million. An apartment listed for $15.5 million is now in contract. 
 Now only 11 smaller apartments are on the market, with asking prices ranging from $3.2 million to $13.9 million. At the recent sales rate, that would amount to a three or four months' supply. 
 The buyer of Mr. Alagem's unit, Stuart Peterson, an investor in YouTube before it was sold to Google, also wanted a staff apartment. So, property records show, he paid $1.625 million for a 463-square-foot studio in the building, which works out to $3,510 a square foot. That comes close to matching the original sale prices for some smaller one-bedrooms facing Broadway rather than Central Park.
 Arthur Zeckendorf, who developed the property with his brother, William Lie Zeckendorf, said they had decided to sell one of their own two staff apartments because ''they approached us.''

HEADLINE: After Years of Development, Miami Ponders Whether the Good Outweighs the Bad

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
The office of Mayor Manny Diaz smelled of fresh paint and departure. He had only a few hours left before term limits pushed him out, but when the city's planning director mentioned a development by a large Spanish bank, the mayor's eyes lit up. 
 ''I'd love to see it,'' Mr. Diaz said. ''Will you call me?''
 It was a telling exchange for a mayor who oversaw one of Miami's most extensive physical transformations. The city he served for eight years now has cafes where prostitutes used to strut. There are more trees and art offerings, too, but mostly there are buildings. More than 100 million square feet of residential and commercial space has been added since 2001 -- mostly towers and not just downtown, but also across neighborhoods with one-story homes. 
 And in assessing these additions, which range from diamonds to rhinestones, Miami has come to exemplify a deep, national ambivalence about the boom's lasting impact. 
 This month's mayoral election was in many ways a referendum on the idea that more construction means progress. And as was the case in Seattle, where the incumbent lost in a primary, and in New York, where Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg won, but not by much, the results pointed to retrenchment: Tomas Regalado, after campaigning against grand plans, beat a protege of Mr. Diaz's, Joe Sanchez, winning 72 percent of the vote. 
 ''It was wild,'' Mr. Regalado said, describing the Diaz era. ''And many times, irresponsible.'' 
 The causes, of course, are complicated. In a time of easy credit, experts said, Mr. Diaz inherited a laissez-faire zoning code that let developers rule. By legal right, they could build a 40-story building beside a retiree's 1950s ranch-style home. In terms of design, the city could only request alterations. 
 ''It's a little like the Ten Commandments,'' said Arva Moore Parks, a historian and member of the Miami Planning Advisory Board from 2002 until this year. ''It's just suggestions.'' 
 Still, there is no doubt that Mr. Diaz, a registered independent, welcomed development. He said he came into office in 2001 with a sense of urgency because Miami had yet to experience a revival like New York City's or Miami Beach's. This was a city with a $140 million surplus where rusted-out cars filled empty lots and thunderstorms caused flooding, and politicians talked more about Havana than Tallahassee. 
 ''We were something of a laughingstock,'' Mr. Diaz said, adding, ''I wanted to turn that image around, and I think I did.''
 Those who saw his administration up close generally agree. Several former officials said Mr. Diaz, 55, a lawyer, modernized city government. His office did not even have a computer when he arrived; now Miami's police officers have laptops with voice recognition software in their cruisers. 
 For some residents, the good outweighs the bad. ''I'm thrilled that Miami has become a major international city,'' said Bert Silvestre, 51, a resident of the Roads neighborhood and a senior manager for I.B.M. ''Development is the price we pay.''
 But for now at least, Mr. Silvestre appears to be in the minority. With record unemployment, foreclosures and budget cuts -- in an area with one of the nation's largest gaps between rich and poor residents -- anger is the norm. 
 Like many others, John Thomas, 76, had one question: ''Where did all the money go?'' Though he lives on a street with new storm drains, near a park overhauled under Mr. Diaz, he criticized politicians as expecting bailouts after ''they spent themselves into the grave.'' 
 Just as common are the views of Miriam Galliana, 63, who said she voted for Mr. Diaz but now believes ''this is not New York City, and it shouldn't be.'' 
 Ms. Galliana lives in Mr. Silvestre's neighborhood, in a simple home just off Coral Way. And her opinion has been shaped by what she sees from her front door: a new 13-story apartment building. 
 ''This was a quiet, nice, beautiful neighborhood, and it's not like that anymore,'' she said. ''It's horrible.'' 
 Elvis Cruz, an activist with Miami Neighborhoods United, said the building exemplified the Diaz era. He said that because it was in a designated ''special district,'' which allows for more oversight, the city should have insisted that the design ''respond to the physical, contextual environment,'' as the zoning ordinance requires. 
 ''This is an illegal building,'' Mr. Cruz said. ''But the city allowed it.'' 
 Ms. Parks, who was chairwoman during her last four years on the planning board, said the problem of loose enforcement preceded Mr. Diaz, though during the building boom, the mechanisms of government were overwhelmed. The planning board sometimes met until 2 a.m., Ms. Parks said, and lawyers for developers held more sway than critics. Developers, after all, were major campaign contributors, who could drag the city into expensive lawsuits. 
 Even in the case of the large, controversial projects that did come before Miami's five-member commission and the mayor, ''yes'' votes carried the day. Mr. Diaz could have stepped in, for instance, to veto the commission's approval in 2007 of three condominium towers near Vizcaya, the historic museum in Coconut Grove. But he did not. Instead, the development died in the courts last year after preservationists (including Ms. Parks) sued to stop it. 
 Other divisive projects, like the new stadium under construction for the Florida Marlins on the site of the Orange Bowl, also received the Diaz signature. In eight years, he said, he did not veto anything. 
 He said he preferred transformation. It took four years, but in October, the City Commission approved his ambitious urban blueprint, Miami 21, which will encourage more mixed use and bring stricter height restrictions to residential areas. It also gives the planning board the power to reject projects based on their design and other criteria. 
 But for many, Miami 21 has come too late, leaving open whether Mr. Diaz will be remembered as a visionary or by the nickname he picked up along the way, Money Diaz. 
 He was, by his own admission, ''a deal man.'' At times, he said, he wondered if he did too much deciding and not enough explaining. His friends said he hated public relations and preferred sharing Scotch in his office with fellow insiders. 
 It is that culture that has left Miami with a bitter aftertaste. Two commissioners who were often Diaz allies have left office since the election because of corruption scandals, and the city today faces a fiscal nightmare -- partly because of pension obligations, partly because of declining revenue from property taxes. Both are now part of the Diaz legacy.
 ''In the time of the boom, you could do everything and anything, and no one would notice,'' Mr. Regalado said. Now, he added, it is time to emphasize different values: accountability and caution.

HEADLINE: Making a Living on the L.P.G.A. Tour Becomes Tougher by the Year

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Tex. 

 BODY:
Reilley Rankin is a college graduate who earned more than $400,000 two years ago plying her trade. Now she is merely another member of the L.P.G.A.'s middle class trying not to slip through the economy's cracks. 
 With her work schedule cut drastically this year and the bills piling up, Rankin lost her financial footing. In late September, after she missed her third straight tournament cut, Rankin's uncle Tom Reilley came to her rescue. Sensing her anxiety, he offered to cover her expenses for the last three events on her schedule, including this weekend's L.P.G.A. Tour Championship at Houstonian Golf and Country Club. 
 ''She was broke,'' Reilley said, ''and my wife and I just made the decision that we cannot let this young girl with her ability not finish the season.'' 
 Rankin, 30, responded with her best showing of the year, a tie for ninth, in her first tournament after her uncle's intercession. She was one stroke off the lead entering Sunday's twice-rain-delayed second round in the tour's season-ending event, which offers a purse of $1.5 million. The tournament has been shortened to 54 holes and will conclude on Monday, weather permitting.
 With a top-three finish, Rankin would climb high enough on the final money list -- she is at No. 100 -- to secure a spot into next year's limited-field events. Anything lower, and she is staring at the prospect of receiving her first L.P.G.A. Tour paycheck next year in late March, at the earliest. 
 The 2010 schedule will feature, at most, 24 tournaments, down from 34 in 2008 and 27 this year. The first two, in Thailand and Singapore, are limited to 60 golfers. ''You could put a lot of pressure on yourself to do well now so you're not playing catch-up next year,'' Rankin said, adding, ''I try not to think about it much because I'll just put myself further behind the eight ball.'' 
 For the top five dozen women -- the Lorena Ochoas and Michelle Wies and Natalie Gulbises -- the shrinking schedule is less of a concern than an inconvenience, obliging them to grace tour stops they would have skipped in the days when they had more options. For everybody else, it is cause to consider taking a part-time job to help stay afloat. 
 Tom Reilley and his wife, Diane, own five restaurants in the Hilton Head, S.C., area. Rankin said she was willing to work at one of them to supplement her income until the tour returns to the United States the last week of March, but her uncle will not hear of it. ''She's going to be spending that time working on her game,'' he said. 
 It rankles Tom Reilley to see the financial divide between the men's and women's professional golf tours. As a board member for the PGA Tour stop in Hilton Head, he has noticed that the No. 100 player on the men's money list, Ted Purdy, has made $838,707 to Rankin's $72,681. And the men's money goes further. L.P.G.A. players receive fewer perks, so they spend more to play, roughly $100,000 a year. 
 That is part of Reilley's motivation in helping Rankin, a six-year pro. ''I feel the L.P.G.A. is undersupported and underfinanced,'' he said. 
 The L.P.G.A. is a model of diversity and inclusion that has been at the forefront of globalization. And yet it is wobblier than it has been since its infancy in the early 1950s. In July, a player revolt led to the resignation of the commissioner, Carolyn Bivens, who had secured only nine contracts for 2010 events. 
 The interim commissioner, Marsha Evans, logged about 45,000 air miles to clean up after Bivens and salvage next season. Michael Whan was named the eighth commissioner in the organization's 59-year history in October and will officially take the reins in January.
 ''I think that we should be commending Marty for making a difference in getting some relationships back on track,'' Lorie Kane, a tour veteran, said of Evans.
 Whan, 44, met with the players last week and challenged them to channel the esprit de corps of the tour's founding members, who did more than show up and play. They set up the courses, decided the pairings, signed the checks and tithed earnings to the tour. 
 ''We've got a responsibility to think like our founders did in the first five years,'' Whan said Friday, ''and understand that these are tough times, but they will not define our future. I need our players to show that same spunk, the same aggressiveness, the same long-term vision.'' 
 His standard-bearer could be Jamie Hullett, who carries a cheery bag with ''Life is good'' stitched across its front. Given the times, it looks as incongruous on the L.P.G.A. Tour's fairways as a happy-face button at an antiwar rally. 
 Hullett, who was paired with Rankin the first two rounds, is sponsored by Bert and John Jacobs, brothers from Boston who created Jake, the stick figure with the woe-eating grin who graces T-shirts and other items with the ''Life is good'' mantra. 
 ''Life does get tough, but that doesn't mean it's not good,'' Hullett, 33, said. 
 In these times, Hullett, another player being squeezed by the shrinking schedule, finds inspiration in the brothers' mantra. Cold cash, too. Her family owns a store in Rockwall, Tex., that sells ''Life is good'' products, and Hullett will be working there the first three months of 2010 while the tour starts without her. 
 At the store, Hullett said, she will fold T-shirts and listen to customers' stories about relatives with cancer, husbands who have lost their jobs and others in need of a ''Life is good'' pick-me-up. Hullett does not mind the work.
 ''I think it helps keep things in perspective,'' she said.

LENGTH: 838 words

HEADLINE: The Prudence Of Mixing Eggnog And Advocacy

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
The Senate debate on health care, set to begin the week after Thanksgiving, is now on course to collide with the holiday season. One question for advocacy groups on all sides will be whether to keep up their barrage of pointed commercials, even as chestnuts roast and stockings are hung.
 The presidential primary candidates faced this same dilemma two years ago, when the Iowa caucuses were moved up to Jan. 3. The campaigns had to figure out how to stay visible during the crucial weeks before the vote, which overlapped with Christmas and New Year's, when the public was not really up for a political brawl. 
 Rather than go dark, most of the primary candidates dropped their attack ads and softened their messages.
 That experience may provide some guidance now, as health care advertisers mull their options along with their cider.
 Much at Stake
 All sides in the health care debate have already spent a combined $170 million on television advertising so far this year -- the most ever spent on single-issue advocacy commercials in one calendar year, said Evan Tracey, chief operating officer of the Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks television advertising.
 With so much at stake, neither side is likely to leave the airwaves just because of the holidays. The Senate will be debating until the Christmas break. And even if it manages to pass a bill before then, it would still need to produce a final bill with the House, which means the debate will almost certainly spill over into the new year.
 ''We will remain fully engaged,'' said R. Bruce Josten, the chief lobbyist for the United States Chamber of Commerce, the primary sponsor of advertising against a health care overhaul. 
 The Chamber, which has enlisted the support of numerous conservative groups, has fired off more than $24 million worth of advertisements in the last 30 days alone, arguing that an overhaul would cost jobs, raise taxes and increase the deficit in a shaky economy.
 Supporters of an overhaul, meanwhile, led by labor and affiliated liberal organizations, spent about $14 million in the same period, arguing that an overhaul would make health insurance more affordable and accessible and thanking members of the House who voted for the bill on Nov. 7.
 The two sides have much more on the way, and yet they are only beginning to grapple with how to adapt these messages to the holidays. One of the big factors at this time of year is the clutter of holiday promotions on television. But some on Madison Avenue say the holidays provide an opportune moment.
 ''It's like when a department store has a white sale around a holiday,'' said Richard Kirshenbaum, a branding expert and advertising executive. 
 ''Any time you have a national moment where people are getting together, it's a way to open a dialogue, whether it's about potato chips or health care reform.'' 
 Leading the Way
 The path-breaking candidate before the presidential primaries was Mike Huckabee, a Republican and a Baptist minister, who was the first in 2007 to tailor a new message for Christmas. 
 Wearing a red sweater, he identified with viewers who had been besieged by political advertisements: ''Are you about worn out from all the television commercials you've been seeing?''
 Then he branded himself the evangelical candidate, in a direct appeal to his base: ''What really matters is the celebration of the birth of Christ and being with our family and our friends.''
 Other candidates followed his lead but avoided religious references.
 Barack Obama's commercials dropped his campaign theme of ending the war in Iraq and instead showed him in a cozy setting with his wife and daughters.
 Hillary Rodham Clinton opened presents, one of which was labeled ''universal health care.''
 Hopes and Fears
 A positive message of supporting a health care overhaul may lend itself more easily to the soft sell than would a negative message opposing it.
 ''Fear is not a holiday message, and that's what they're selling,'' said Robert Creamer, a political consultant to liberal groups that support the overhaul. ''To the extent that the holidays dispose people toward hope and possibility, that's a good thing for us.''
 Of course, not all of the opponents' advertisements are negative (some thank the House members who voted against the bill) and not all of the supporters' are positive (many criticize the influence of the insurance industry).
 As a rule, experts say, the advertising between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day should make people feel good rather than bad, even though that flies in the face of studies showing that negative commercials are often more effective in politics. 
 ''Corporate brands always change their message during the holidays to tone down the rhetoric, to get people into the stores or to feel good about their brands,'' Mr. Tracey said.
 ''It will be interesting if we see combat ads over health care mixed in with Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' he said. ''I would think very hard before I tied those two things together.''

HEADLINE: Pundit Stakes Out a More Activist Role in Politics

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER; Amy Green contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Glenn Beck, the popular and outspoken Fox News host, says he wants to go beyond broadcasting his opinions and start rallying his political base -- formerly known as his audience -- to take action.
 To do so, Mr. Beck is styling himself as a political organizer. In an interview, he said he would promote voter registration drives and sponsor a series of seven conventions across the country featuring what he described as libertarian speakers.
On Saturday he held a festive campaign-style rally in The Villages in Florida, north of Orlando, in which he promoted his recently released book, ''Arguing With Idiots,'' and announced another book to come next August filled with right-leaning policy proposals gathered from the conventions. 
 Mr. Beck provided few details about his plans for the tour, making it unclear if he truly intends to prod his audience of millions into political action or merely burnish his media brand ahead of a book release.
 Mr. Beck did say the conventions would resemble educational seminars, and he emphasized that while candidates may align themselves with the values and principles that he espouses, he would not take the next step to endorse them. 
 In describing the conventions, he told the crowd on Saturday: ''You're going to learn about finance. You're going to learn about community organizing. You're going to learn everything we need to know if you want to be a politician.''
 His staff would not say whether particular candidates for office in the 2010 midterm elections would be invited to speak at the conventions or the August rally.
 As for the question of Mr. Beck's intentions, ''He might just be trying to sell books, but there are much simpler ways to sell books,'' said Ari Rabin-Havt, a vice president at Media Matters, the liberal media monitoring group. He said Mr. Beck sounded more like a presidential candidate than a pundit.
 Mr. Beck, having used his television and radio pulpit to lay out his list of the country's impending problems -- deficit spending, health care legislation that will ''destroy'' the economy, a dearth of ''personal responsibility'' -- says he now wants to also provide solutions. 
 In the interview, Mr. Beck, a frequent critic of President Obama, chose his words carefully but made clear that he intended to help elect politicians aligned with his limited-government world view. ''We'll be looking for ways to get people involved in politics,'' he said.
 Mr. Beck is not the only media firebrand trying to mobilize Americans disaffected with a Democratic-controlled government. The radio host Laura Ingraham is inviting candidates to sign a 10-point pledge on her Web site. Sean Hannity, on his afternoon radio show and prime-time Fox News program, is promoting ''Conservative Victory 2010,'' his name for the map on his site that will spell out questions for candidates. 
 And the former presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, who has a show on Fox News, has steered viewers to his Web site, where they can contribute money to his political action committee in support of conservative candidates.
 Pundits have used their media stages to encourage political action before, but people like Mr. Beck and Mr. Hannity are taking on outsize roles now, political experts and conservative commentators say. One reason, they say, is the weakened state of the Republican Party. 
 The media figures' roles may exacerbate the ideological feuds that are already roiling the party. For the diffuse tea party movement that taps into anti-government sentiments, ''the media guys are the closest things we even have to a leader,'' said Adam Brandon, the vice president for communications at FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group.
 These efforts are reminiscent of the Contract With America pledge made by conservatives during the 1994 elections, though some Republicans who are uncomfortable with media personalities taking on new political roles note that that effort originated with lawmakers.
 When asked about Mr. Beck at a conference last month, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said: ''Here's what I worry about. How many people in my business are going to be controlled by what's said on the radio or in a TV commercial?''
 It was not lost on Mr. Beck's fans that the Saturday rally and book signing were held in Florida, where the Republican governor, Charlie Crist, has been sharply criticized by conservatives as he runs for an open seat in the United States Senate. Mr. Crist's challenger, Marco Rubio, has already signed the pledge on Ms. Ingraham's Web site, as have a smattering of other conservative candidates.
 Already, Mr. Beck's page on FoxNews.com features what it calls ''In or Out 2010,'' a ''simple challenge'' for lawmakers. It includes a pledge to back a freeze in government spending; oppose all tax increases ''until our economy has rebounded''; and support stricter immigration enforcement.

HEADLINE: I Ordered the Ants!

BYLINE: By PHILIP GALANES

 BODY:
While finishing a meal at a French restaurant that we frequent, I spotted a three-inch water bug making its way down a wall, inches from my 14-year-old daughter's head. Happily, the bug ducked into a crevice. 
 I quietly told the headwaiter. After turning white, he thanked my wife and me for not creating a riot. But he did nothing else. Shouldn't we have received a token of appreciation: a 20-percent discount maybe, or a check torn in half? 
 Kevin McCauley, Brooklyn
 ''Waiter, there's a fly in my soup!'' 
 ''Don't worry, sir, that colossal cockroach should catch it.''
 I think we can agree that you suffered: The prospect of your daughter wearing a water-bug scrunchie is neither appetizing nor good for the digestion. But thanks to the four million food-chain books that have flooded the market in recent years, we're all a little more savvy about how disgusting our food is. It takes more than a bug to scare us these days. 
 So I'm afraid that an ambient pest crawling across the wall -- though decidedly gross -- is not enough to hit the jackpot. For that, you'll need the little varmint to creep across your plate of coquille St.-Jacques, or perhaps mistake it for a peppercorn on your steak a la metamorphosis. 
 Free meals probably weren't in order, and the economy has hit restaurants hard enough. But you were entitled to a round of free drinks (and tranquilizers) or a couple of desserts on the house. 
 Next time you're there, remind the headwaiter of your trauma, and hint at your expectation of a reward as broadly as necessary. Try: ''That creme brulee looks fit for a king -- or someone who didn't report you to the health department.''
 It may feel a little pushy, but doesn't your story give new meaning to the meek inheriting the earth (and its creepy crawlies)?
 Would a Good Friend Ask?
 A good friend has been gaining weight very rapidly -- faster than I have ever seen before. We only see each other every few months, because he no longer lives nearby. But each time, he is shockingly larger than the last. I am starting to worry about his physical and emotional health, but am unsure how (or if) to approach the subject. Should I say something?
 Elizabeth, New York
 There are a host of possible reasons for your friend's rapid weight gain: new medication, an abandoned exercise regime, Bouley Bakery moving in next door. And you may really want to know which explanation fits -- in which case, I say: Stop right there!
 Your friend is probably already terribly self-conscious about his expanding waistline, and your asking about it, unprompted, may upset him.
 So unless you believe that you are uniquely suited to handle this issue and are sure that your pal hasn't taken measures to address the packed-on poundage himself, leave it alone. His potential hurt trumps your curiosity. 
 That doesn't mean you can't go fishing. Ask him: ''Everything all right?'' -- the way you would any friend. Then let him take the lead. 
 A Cow in My Cubicle
 I share a desk with a co-worker who makes the most disgusting sounds when he chews, particularly when he chews gum, which is always. Sometimes it's so bad I must leave until he's finished. My not-too-subtle looks of disdain are not getting my message across. What should I do? 
 Anonymous
 Finally! The upside of layoffs and record unemployment: no more Chompin' Charlie.
 If this guy made it past his mother, teachers and significant others with his nasty gnawing still in place, you can shoot him dirty looks all day -- and make cud-chewing references till the cows come home. But subtlety will get you nowhere.
 Two choices: Either say: ''Sorry to get so personal, but your open-mouthed munching is really loud and distracting. Any chance you could lock those lips together when you chew?'' Or buy yourself some silicone earplugs -- the kind swimmers (and spouses of snorers) wear. What's more, they come in a wide range of fashion colors. 
 His Short-Shorts
 An eccentric neighbor, in his 80s, strolls around wearing short shorts without underwear. I was outside with my young niece, and he stopped to chat. She noticed nothing amiss, but I was alarmed by his unintentional exposure. Any advice?Anonymous
 How would you feel about moving?
 Sometimes there's no alternative to the awkward chat: ''I couldn't help seeing you in all your glory last week -- really. May I suggest some skivvies or a longer pair or shorts?'' Then, head straight home and hide in the closet.

HEADLINE: 68 Rules? No, Just 3 Are Enough

 BODY:
This interview withWilliam D. Green, chairman and C.E.O. of Accenture, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.
 Q. Tell me about important leadership lessons you've learned?
A. I'm a proud plumber's son from Western Massachusetts. In my family, working with tools is the highest honor. It isn't how many degrees you have. It's what you can do. So that had a big impact on me. What that says is, it doesn't matter what you look like, what you talk like, where you went to school, where you came from, any of that stuff. What matters is what you're capable of.
 Q.What else? 
 A. I was not a good student. I took what they call today a gap year, but back then it was called ''finding yourself.'' I did one of those, and I finally found my way into a two-year college. I went from an underperformer to a solid performer, with a little inspiration from some professors. That had a profound effect on me, to realize how much raw talent there is out there for us to exploit, leverage, take advantage of, and how much talent there is that people can give that organizations don't mine, they don't harvest, they don't get the best of, because of structure, because of strategy, because of rules.
 Q. So how do you break through?
 A. I once sat through a three-day training session in our company, and this was for new managers, very capable people who were ready for a big step up. I counted, over three days, 68 things that we told them they needed to do to be successful, everything from how you coach and mentor, your annual reviews, filling out these forms, all this stuff. 
 And I got up to close the session, and I'm thinking about how it isn't possible for these people to remember all this. So I said there are three things that matter. The first is competence -- just being good at what you do, whatever it is, and focusing on the job you have, not on the job you think you want to have. The second one is confidence. People want to know what you think. So you have to have enough desirable self-confidence to articulate a point of view. The third thing is caring. Nothing today is about one individual. This is all about the team, and in the end, this is about giving a damn about your customers, your company, the people around you, and recognizing that the people around you are the ones who make you look good.
 When young people are looking for clarity -- this is a huge, complex global company, and they wonder how to navigate their way through it -- I just tell them that. 
 Q. Talk about the challenge of running a big global company in this tough economy.
 A. We operate the company so that we keep one foot in today and one foot in tomorrow, regardless of what's going on. In an economy like this, everyone wants to look at their shoes. You can't. We've got to be doing as many things about tomorrow as we are today. We operate with a philosophy that says, never be afraid to change, even when we're at the top of our game. 
 In our company, usually in the summer, people ask me, ''When are you going on vacation?'' Because when I come back from a week's vacation, they know I've had time to think and reflect and have been strategizing about changes and it could be anything.
 Q.Does that usually happen?
 A. Happens every time. People even joke about it a little bit. Even my outside board members say, ''When are you taking the vacation, Bill?'' This year, in the middle of tough economic times for everybody, we built a human capital strategy for the future, we refreshed our corporate-wide strategy, and I moved my leadership people around into different positions and promoted some new people into leadership roles to infuse energy. 
 All of this is about energizing people, giving them broader scope and new experiences. This obviously helps build durability in terms of people being able to have multiple jobs, and it's an important part of succession planning, getting the athletes the experience they need in different spaces. 
 So just when you think all the cylinders are clicking and everything's right, that's the time you have to change, because that's the world we live in now. If you rest, it will cost you, because global competitiveness is here to stay, and it's not about the traditional competitors anymore. It's about new and emerging competitors that you've never heard of, and you just have to get your mind around the new normal, as they call it.
 Q.Can you elaborate on why you shift people around?
 A. If you look at why people in general leave companies, they often leave because they get bored. And high-performance people are learners by nature. And as long as they're learning, they'll stay where they are. When they start to think about leaving, when they start to respond to a headhunter's call, is when they haven't been learning.
 On my leadership team, I have 15 bona fide C.E.O.'s. These people are capable of running big companies. But as long as they're learning and engaging and on a mission, they don't need to be the C.E.O. They just need to be part of the ecosystem that leads the company.
 Q.What other basic messages do you have for all your employees?
 A. One of our other principles is that people who are successful are the ones who ask for help. It sounds simple, but to get an organization to believe that asking for help is a sign of strength, and not weakness, is a huge thing.
 Q. You have to make sure people aren't going to worry they might be criticized for asking.
 A. You want to challenge people to get them to raise their game, as opposed to criticizing them, which makes them raise their defenses. It's like learning. With a motivated learner, you can work wonders. In institutions, it's the same thing. Are there companies with the will and resolve to change -- that's the equivalent of a motivated learner. Or are there companies that are just sort of stuck where they are, and they like the status quo? In the end, that's the difference between winners and losers in corporate America and around the world. That's the contrast. So, the question is, how do you get motivated learners? So, I bring it back to me, and how did I become a motivated learner? Somebody inspired me. 
 Q.Was there anything that surprised you about the top job?
 A. The amount of responsibility you carry around on your back is unbelievable. It's not like you're a martyr -- it just comes with the territory. There's something going on around the globe in our place 24/7, and the sense of responsibility you feel for all those people and their families is profound. 
 I like taking the responsibility, but I had no idea about the spiritual part. The spiritual obligation to the lives of 177,000 people is a big deal. I'm a guy who had trouble being responsible for his own life in the early days, and now I've got 177,000 people that look up to me. That took a little getting used to. 
 Q.How has your leadership style evolved? 
 A. I used to be an orchestrator from behind the scenes. I could make stuff happen, but I never wanted to be on point. I could connect dots. I could catalyze activity. I could get other people to do things without being in the front. I sort of engineered it from the back.
 Q. And you preferred it that way?
 A. At the time I was comfortable with it because I was never comfortable with the spotlight. I took great pleasure and pride in seeing things get done that I knew I had made happen, and when it came time to taking bows, I didn't do the bow-taking part. I felt good about myself for that because it's just sort of where I came from. Now I lead a lot more from the front. I have a better appreciation of what people are expecting of me and how people are counting on me. 
 Q. How have you adjusted your leadership style based on feedback you've received?
 A. I needed to beef up my operator skills because I'm an instinctive and intuitive guy. I listen, I synthesize, I process, I make judgments. There's another school of thought -- that's analytics, and I needed to turn the dial a little more toward analytics and a little away from seat-of-the-pants. I didn't have to turn it a ton, but I have. I have purposely tried to get better grounding in the analytics behind the decision-making and used that to check to see if there was a huge disconnect between what my instinct told me and what the analytics told me. 
 Q. Let's talk about hiring. How do you do it?
 A. It's one of our core competencies at Accenture. We get two million C.V.'s a year and ultimately we hire between 40,000 and 60,000 people.
 I always say, in simple terms, we need people who are analytical, and have common sense, good judgment and the ability to get along with other people, because we're in a people business. 
 We're taking a more scientific approach to how we recruit. We do something called ''critical behavior interviewing.'' It's based on the premise that past behavior is the best indicator of future behavior. Essentially what we're looking for is, have you faced any adversity and what did you do about it? We also know the profile of successful Accenture people, and how do we learn from the people we have who have stayed, learned, grown and become great leaders, and how do we push that back into the recruiting process to find the best matches for Accenture?
 Q. That's what it comes down to?
 A. If you get down to it, it's what have you learned, what have you demonstrated, what behaviors do you have? Have you shown intuition? Have you shown the ability to synthesize and act? Have you shown the ability to step up and make a choice? How have you dealt with the hand in front of you, played it out? 
 I was recruiting at Babson College. This was in 1991. The last recruit of the day -- I get this resume. I get the blue sheet attached to it, which is the form I'm supposed to fill out with all this stuff and his resume attached to the top. His resume is very light -- no clubs, no sports, no nothing. Babson, 3.2. Studied finance. Work experience: Sam's Diner, references on request. 
 It's the last one of the day, and I've seen all these people come through strutting their stuff and they've got their portfolios and semester studying abroad. Here comes this guy. He sits. His name is Sam, and I say: ''Sam, let me just ask you. What else were you doing while you were here?'' He says: ''Well, Sam's Diner. That's our family business, and I leave on Friday after classes, and I go and work till closing. I work all day Saturday till closing, and then I work Sunday until I close, and then I drive back to Babson.'' I wrote, ''Hire him,'' on the blue sheet.
 He's still with us, because he had character. He faced a set of challenges. He figured out how to do both.
 Q.So what's that quality you just described? 
 A. It's work ethic. You could see the guy had charted a path for himself to make it work with the situation he had. He didn't ask for any help. He wasn't victimized by the thing. He just said, ''That's my dad's business, and I work there.'' Confident. Proud. 
 What critical behavior interviewing does is get at people's character, and you get to see where work fits in their value system, where pride fits in their value system, where making hard decisions or sacrificing fits in their value system. I mean, you sacrifice and you're a victim, or you sacrifice because it's the right thing to do and you have pride in it. Huge difference. Simple thing. Huge difference.

HEADLINE: Not Taking 'Not Hiring' for an Answer

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: Generationb@nytimes

 BODY:
BABY boomers have lived during an era of unparalleled prosperity. So when this deep recession hit -- at a time when boomers were advancing to middle- and late-middle age -- much was written about them being too spoiled to cope.
 Not so. A look at recent employment data indicates that boomers have persevered in these hard times, and are less likely to grow discouraged and quit the job hunt than younger workers are.
 ''Older adults are not giving up,'' said Steven Hipple, a Bureau of Labor Statistics economist. Despite the fact that the unemployment rate for baby boomers has doubled since the start of the recession, what the federal government calls their ''labor participation rate'' -- the number of 45- to 64-year-olds working or actively seeking work -- has remained unchanged. In contrast, every other age group has shown a decline. 
 ''Older workers don't have the choice of withdrawing from the labor force,'' said Mr. Hipple, pointing out that they have mortgages to pay, health issues and retirement to worry about, as well as children to put through college. 
 Tory Johnson, owner of Women for Hire, which for the last decade has run job fairs in America's 10 largest cities, has been struck by the toughness of the boomer work force. ''With the 20- and 30-somethings, the attitude is, 'No one is hiring, what's the point of going to a job fair?' '' Ms. Johnson said. ''With the boomers, it's, 'Even if there's one job, I'll try.' '' At her 16 job fairs so far in 2009, she said, attendance is up 10 percent over all, and it's because of boomers; every other age group has declined.
 A big shift she's seen is middle-aged workers turning to temporary employment to survive. ''It may not be the ideal scenario,'' she said. ''But there's a recognition you have to do what it takes, and it could lead to a full-time job.''
 Indeed, a growth in temporary work is one of the very few hopeful employment signs at this moment. When Keith Hall, the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, recently announced the 10.2 percent jobless rate for October, he noted only two sectors had shown growth: health care, with 29,000 new jobs, and temporary workers with 34,000. 
 Boomer-age workers are the only age group whose employment prospects have improved since last summer. For people over 45, joblessness was 6.8 percent in October, down from 7.3 percent in July (the highest for this age group since data was first collected 60 years ago). In contrast, for 25- to 34-year-olds, joblessness was 10.8 percent in October, up from 10 percent in July; for those 35 to 44, it was 8.5 percent in October, up from 7.9 in July.
 Thomas Lawrence, a vice president for Kelly Services based in New York City, has seen a growth in the number of skilled boomers like Joseph Paccione, 55, applying for temporary jobs. Mr. Paccione, a computer specialist from Queens, had spent 30 years working for two companies. But over a year ago he was laid off from his $60,000-a-year job at Lockheed Martin, where he was a technology specialist for 200 workers in 7 states. After having no luck finding anything full time, in September he took a seven-week assignment through Kelly, filling out spreadsheets for a Long Island firm. He made $17 an hour and said it was grunt work compared with his previous job.
 After a few days on the job, he said, he used his computer knowledge to reduce the time it took him and his three temporary co-workers to finish each report, to 30 minutes from two hours. He also taught his supervisor, so she could do it herself after he left. She was grateful, and offered to write a recommendation, but his hope that the job would extend beyond Oct. 30 was not realized. His wife of 27 years, his 26-year-old daughter with a master's degree in biology, his 24-year-old videographer son with a bachelor's degree from St. John's, are all working part time. His youngest is at Queens College, and not one of them has health insurance.
 ''It's scary,'' Mr. Paccione said. He turned down a recent job possibility from Kelly that paid $12 an hour as too low and is continuing to look. ''I have to get better at doing job searches,'' he said. ''I don't know, maybe I'm not looking in the right places.''
 Steven Berchem, vice president of the American Staffing Association, a trade group comprising temporary-help companies like Kelly, said studies have shown that during a recession, the first harbinger of employment recovery is growth of temporary jobs. That began in late July and has improved a little each month, with the addition of 3,000 temporary jobs in August, 7,000 in September and then the 34,000 last month. ''Typically, six months later you start to see improvement in general employment,'' Mr. Berchem said.
 The hope is that employers make those temporary jobs permanent. Mr. Lawrence of Kelly said that in the last several weeks, for the first time in over a year he's hearing employers say, ''I have a position to fill with potential to hire full time.''
 This is what John Cullum, 44, is hoping for. Mr. Cullum, who has a master's degree in French, worked as an executive assistant in investment banking for Cowen and Company in Manhattan for six years, earning $65,000, until he was laid off in April. After months of looking, he found a temporary job in September through Kelly, working for an engineering group in Westchester County, making $25 an hour. Though his wife has a job as a human resources director, they've had to renegotiate their debt with their credit card companies.
 ''You're hoping the employer will see your value and task you to be a full-time employee in the future,'' said Mr. Cullum, who has two children. Every few weeks, he calls the Kelly office in White Plains that placed him, just to stay in touch. ''You want to keep your name out there in case you have to start over again,'' he said.
 Wanda Matthews, 53, of Houston, an administrative assistant laid off in December 2008, took two short temporary jobs over the next six months that she hoped would lead to something better, but did not. ''I was just doing what I could to stay busy,'' said Ms. Matthews, who's been working since she was 16. ''You want to stay in the work force.''
 Then, last summer, she got a temporary position with a large international energy corporation. She began working three days a week, went to five, and in mid-September was promised a permanent job to start in a few weeks. ''Oh, my gosh, I was so excited,'' she said, ''but you don't want to get overly excited, you don't want to say too much until you've got it, until you go to that hiring table and you go through onboarding.'' 
 At her age, Ms. Matthews has learned the hard way about not counting her chickens. But on Oct. 1, right on schedule, she was onboarded, crossing from temporary to the promised land that Mr. Paccione and Mr. Cullum and so many Americans lie awake nights hoping for: an honest-to-goodness, full-time, permanent job.

HEADLINE: Survey Finds Hard Times Preceded Recession

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Even before the recession, more than one in five Americans needed help from family, friends or outsiders to pay for basic needs, according to a survey by the Census Bureau. 
 In addition, 14 percent of all Americans and 26 percent of blacks who responded to the 2005 survey reported that at some time in the preceding year they were not able to meet essential expenses on their own, like paying the mortgage and buying sufficient food.
 ''Presumably, this would be more severe than just being late with your utility payment,'' said Kurt J. Bauman, a bureau analyst.
 A variety of measures of well-being were recorded in the bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation, which was released on Thursday.
 While 99 percent of the nation's 113 million households reported having a refrigerator and a stove, that means that more than a million households lacked those appliances. Ninety-nine percent also said they owned a television.
 The survey found that more American households had air conditioners and microwave ovens than computers. Since 1998, the share of households with a personal computer increased to 67 percent, from 42 percent. The poor, the elderly and people without a high school diploma were least likely to own one. 
 Ninety percent had land-line telephones (down from 96 percent in 1998), and 71 percent had cellphones (up from 36 percent). Among households headed by people under age 30, more had cellphones (81 percent) than landlines (71 percent).
 Since the survey was conducted well before the recession started in 2007, presumably many measures of economic well-being have since gotten worse. Still, 9 percent of households over all and more than 25 percent of those below the poverty line could not afford nutritionally adequate food without resorting to food pantries or other emergency supplies or to scavenging. 
 Compared with the 1990s, people over all said they were more likely to expect help if they needed it from family, friends, social services agencies or religious institutions. Black and Hispanic respondents, though, were a little less likely to expect such help; blacks were a little more likely to have received it.
 Generally, people surveyed were more likely than in the 1990s to say they were satisfied with the safety and overall condition of their neighborhoods. Still, in 2005, 20 percent of blacks said they stayed at home because they were concerned about their safety, and 32 percent of blacks said they were afraid to walk alone at night.
 Because respondents were not asked to elaborate, some of the results seemed anomalous. Almost the same proportion of householders lacking medical insurance said they were as satisfied with health services as those who were insured.

HEADLINE: A Partly Cloudy Resolution

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
MUCH has been said about buyers at glassy new condominiums who signed contracts when the sun was shining on the market but demanded their deposits back when the weather turned. 
 Many filed applications with the state attorney general's office to get their refunds back, or filed lawsuits. Now a developer of a new condominium in SoHo is declaring victory over reluctant buyers. 
 The condo project, on West Broadway near Canal Street, went on the market in 2007. It was named SoHo Mews to evoke its fashionable neighborhood, and Charles Gwathmey was commissioned to design its two buildings, with large windows, connected by a landscaped interior courtyard. 
 Prices were even raised 5 percent soon after the building went on the market, with a top listed price of $11.6 million, or $3,300 per square foot, for a four-bedroom penthouse. 
 At the peak, 31 of the 68 apartments were in contract. But some buyers were hit hard in the financial crisis. Some lost their jobs, while others got cold feet and changed their minds. Seven filed complaints with the attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, asking for their money back. Now that the building is finished, property records show only 15 apartments have closed.
 But after a series of rulings handed down by the attorney general's office in the last few weeks, the developer, Albert Laboz, a principal of United American Land, said his company had prevailed in all claims decided to date. One of the seven claims was dropped by a buyer, who decided to settle, and another was not decided because it raised a question about federal law. Others went in favor of United American Land, and the escrow agent holding the deposits turned them over to the company. 
 In heavily redacted copies of the decision Mr. Laboz provided, the buyers and their lawyers raised questions about the accuracy of the condominium documents, including an error in a description of the property, and allegations of misrepresentations by the sponsor about the closing dates. 
 The rulings found that the error in the land description was insignificant. Any promises that may or may not have been made about closing dates were also deemed insignificant, unless they were made in the offering plan or in the contract. 
 The attorney general's office did not respond to a request for copies of the rulings by late last week, though it did not challenge Mr. Laboz's contention that his company had prevailed. 
 Several lawyers for buyers who are suing to get out of condo contracts in New York City, but not in the SoHo Mews, said they did not believe the rulings set a precedent for other claims still pending before the attorney general's office. They said many of those other claims involved serious errors in offering plans, including ones that should have forced developers to offer all buyers a chance to rescind their contracts. 
 But John D'Agostino, a lawyer who represents SoHo Mews, called the decisions a turning point. ''The attorney general is starting to realize that some of the arguments being made have no merit,'' he said. ''They were getting bogged down in something they never should have been involved in.'' 
 As for Mr. Laboz, he said that sales began to pick up after prices were cut 15 percent in September. So far, two of the buyers who complained to the attorney general have agreed to close, he said, and settlement talks with others are under way.

An article last Sunday about China's economic growth described the trade relationship between China and the United States incorrectly. China is America's biggest source of imports, not its biggest trading partner. (America's biggest trading partner, a category that takes account of American exports as well as imports, is Canada.)

''The best thing we can say about the labor market right now is that it may be getting worse more slowly.'' 
 Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, who warned last week that high unemployment and a continued reluctance by banks to make loans were likely to slow the economic recovery for the next year.
 ''We all could have done a better job.''
 Sheila C. Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At bank after bank, government investigators are discovering that state and federal regulators knew lenders were engaging in hazardous business practices but failed to act until it was too late.
 ''We apologize.''
 Lloyd C. Blankfein, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, who acknowledged that his firm made mistakes that helped lead to the financial crisis. The bank said it would spend $500 million to help small businesses recover from the recession.
 ''We have now gained access to thousands of taxpayers and bank accounts that we have never had before.''
 Douglas H. Shulman, commissioner of the I.R.S., which said that more that 14,700 Americans had been attracted to an amnesty program in recent months and disclosed their secret foreign bank accounts -- many more than had been attracted to a previous I.R.S. program.

HEADLINE: Enthusiasm for Palin, and Echoes of 2008 Divide

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

DATELINE: FORT WAYNE, Ind. 

 BODY:
When tickets to see Sarah Palin in Michigan ran out, people drove to her appearance here, three hours away.
 Thousands had lined up overnight, starting nearly 24 hours before she was to begin signing books, camping out in 39-degree weather for a moment with the woman many see as the great conservative hope, a role model, ''one of us.''
 They brought their sleeping bags, their children, homemade chocolate Cheerios bars, and balloons to twist into animal shapes and hats for the crowd. And they brought their anger -- about bailouts, jobs and health care.
 If Sarah Palin was the star attraction, Barack Obama was a constant presence in the clutches of conversation along the lines snaking to meet her. 
 ''It may not be this year, it may not be next year, but we're going to take our country back,'' said Sherry Haner, 54, who was standing in the cold on Wednesday outside a mall in Grand Rapids, Mich., hoping to make it into the overflow crowd after failing to get one of the 1,000 bracelets Barnes & Noble had handed out as tickets to the signing.
 ''My goal is to make him a half-term president,'' said Chris Schwartz, waiting inside with her daughter and friends, who had pitched tents outside the previous evening to get tickets. ''We need to get enough people in Congress to stop him in his tracks. One term is too long.''
 Ms. Palin's tour to promote her book, ''Going Rogue,'' has led to reams of publicity and high-profile television appearances, including interviews with Oprah Winfrey and Barbara Walters. But Ms. Palin, the former Alaska governor, has skipped the big cities authors usually visit in favor of smaller places in areas, not coincidentally, where she and Senator John McCain of Arizona performed well on last year's Republican presidential ticket.
 As the tour stopped in the political battleground states of the Midwest, on a campaign-like bus emblazoned with a billboard-size picture of her, it rekindled much of last year's political rancor.
 ''He isn't governing, he's still campaigning,'' said Joe Miller, a lab technician who had taken a vacation day to wait in line Thursday at a Meijer superstore in Fort Wayne. ''He's trying to convince us that he's doing a good job. He hasn't done anything, except spend money.'' 
 Kevin Witzigreuter, 38, a Fort Wayne firefighter waiting in line next to Mr. Miller, chimed in: ''And he can't even make a simple decision about what to do in Afghanistan. We've got men and women fighting overseas. Either man up and fight the war to win it, or get out.''
 Camped out in a mall and in the aisles of the superstore, decorated for Christmas, the fans created a carnival atmosphere, one where intense political discussions were interrupted with shouts of ''Dollar burger, anybody?'' by a waitress wandering out of Bar Louie. 
 Starbucks employees worked the line with urns of coffee, while fans passed around a life-size cutout of Ms. Palin so people could pose with her. On a table set out to receive gifts for her, someone had left red sweatshirts embroidered: ''In God We Trust, and in Sarah, and in De USA.''
 The crowds included stray disaffected Obama voters, as well as hard-core conspiracy theorists insisting that the president is a Communist who wants to send everyone to re-education camps. 
 But mostly, people were upset about ballooning budget deficits and health care.
 ''I was willing to give Barack Obama the benefit of the doubt, but the spending is out of control,'' said Gloria Taylor, 54, as she waited in line in Grand Rapids. ''It's going to be our downfall.''
 She and her sister-in-law, Robin Pintar, said they had liked Mr. Obama's campaign promises for their transparency. But they said they were suspicious now, after a government Web site claimed jobs had been created in Congressional districts that do not exist. And they were bothered by health care proposals that seem obscured in thousands of pages of legislation.
 ''You hear snippets,'' Ms. Pintar said, ''but you don't know what the big picture is, except the price, and that's terrifying.''
 Few people in the lines were reading Ms. Palin's book, despite having hours to wait.
 ''It's more fun talking politics with people who agree with you,'' said Lucy Vigmostad, who was celebrating her 18th birthday by being first in line in Grand Rapids. 
 Not so much for Wyn Eck, an Obama voter who had come at 2:15 a.m. ''for the spectacle.'' Ms. Eck was well rewarded, with a balloon sculpture hanging around her neck with a piece of yarn from a new friend knitting in the pop-up chair next to hers.
 She had tried a truth-squad approach with her new friends: When they repeated the book's claim that Mr. McCain's campaign had billed Ms. Palin for $50,000 in legal costs to vet her for the vice-presidential nomination, Ms. Eck pointed out that Mr. McCain had said that was not true. (The bill, he said, was for an ethics investigation involving Ms. Palin that had started before the campaign.) 
 ''It got a little icy for a few minutes,'' Ms. Eck said. 
 As she signed a book in Grand Rapids, Ms. Palin told one man that Michigan was ''a microcosm of America.''
 The places she visited were also ones where unemployment runs high, and many in the crowds that have turned out to see Ms. Palin said they had lost jobs, knew someone who had, or were working two or three jobs as they looked for one good one.
 ''There's a lot of talkers out there, that's what we're seeing now,'' said LeAnn Knudsen, 41, who had waited since 5 a.m. with her daughter, 10. ''This hope and change, hope and change, what hope? And if this is change, God help us.''
 As they wondered whether Ms. Palin would run for president, people here could not say exactly what they thought she would do differently to get the country out of its messes. But, they argued, she has common sense and understands how to run a family and a state. That seemed to be enough.
 ''I'm looking forward to her giving me hope,'' said Cheryl Geraty, waiting in the rain in Grand Rapids. 
 That sounded something like Mr. Obama, who had effectively started his own campaign for the White House on a book tour in 2006. No, Ms. Geraty said, shaking her head and smiling, ''It's a different kind of hope.''

HEADLINE: Leveraging the Obama Brand

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai writes on national politics for the magazine.

 BODY:
Earlier this month, almost a year from the day when Barack Obama rode the wave of history into Grant Park, he had one of those weeks that makes his presidency seem, at times, so confounding. First Obama endured an electoral embarrassment, watching his party lose off-year gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia, in part because many of the voters he had so successfully engaged in his presidential campaign, particularly younger voters, stayed home and made popcorn for ''Dancing With the Stars'' instead. The president had been exposed, the pundits solemnly declared, as having no ''coattails,'' which are something you really need, they said, if you want congressmen and senators to go along with you on hard votes. Then, just five days later, as Obama's manifest political weakness was still being dissected on cable TV, the president stood in the Rose Garden and hailed the passage in the House of Representatives of the most comprehensive health care bill in the nation's history -- a bill he had helped pass, narrowly but solidly, by making a rare weekend visit to the Capitol to lobby for it personally. It was, as Obama acknowledged, just a first step, but it was a step no other president had managed to scale, and it seemed to confuse this issue of how powerful a president Obama really is. 
If Obama has no coattails, then how was he able to pressure nervous lawmakers into making such a perilous vote? And if he had enough influence to get health care reform done, then why were his coattails missing?
 This whole conversation about coattails must baffle most voters under 40, who have no visual sense of what a coattail actually is, unless they've played a lot of Monopoly or overdressed for a prom. The term dates back to Abraham Lincoln, who accused his adversaries of hiding under the dangling coattails of a general's uniform. The modern idea is that candidates can grab onto the coat of a successful president and glide to victory. This makes some sense when it is used to refer to the years when a presidential candidate is actually on the ballot, the oft-cited demonstration being 1980, when Ronald Reagan's power at the polls helped unseat nine incumbent Democratic senators. But the coattails metaphor has now apparently been extended to refer to the basic transferable appeal of a president, whether he himself is up for election or not. In other words, if Obama is wearing sturdy coattails, then the same New Jersey voters who waited in line last year to elect an exciting young African-American president should have been willing to make the same sacrifice for an unpopular white governor, just because Obama himself told them they should.
In fact, though, some of the most successful navigators of the modern culture -- in advertising, sports, entertainment -- have come to realize that Americans are increasingly inured to the suggestive power of all celebrity, political or otherwise. A few years ago, for instance, when fans of the New York Yankees were relentlessly booing Alex Rodriguez, Derek Jeter, the team's beloved captain, refused to intervene. ''The only thing I'm not going to do is tell the fans what to do,'' Jeter explained. ''I don't think it's my job to tell fans to boo or not to boo.'' Columnists accused Jeter of shirking his responsibility to a teammate, but in fact he had displayed a remarkably shrewd appreciation for the limits of modern idolatry. Jeter understood that his relationship with the fans wasn't a transferable commodity that he could dole out to others as he wished.
 Like Jeter, the president probably should have known -- and maybe even did, judging from the almost dutiful way he campaigned -- that his own exalted stature wouldn't easily be conferred on others. Obama seems to understand that Americans in the satellite age tend to see the president more as a self-contained personality than as the boss of a top-down party organization, the kind of machine-era figurehead who once presided over conventions full of straw hats and placards. We care about his plans for health care and economic growth, and maybe even about the kind of movies he watches or whether his marriage is holding up under the strain, but we don't necessarily see much connection between his agenda and the fight over local toll rates.
 In fact, there's no evidence that Obama's failure to influence the 2009 elections will mean that he can't get his legislation passed -- or that he won't have an impact on the more-important national races in 2010. That's because, while Obama's personal brand may not be directly transferable to other candidates, it can still be leveraged into public support for his agenda. Increasingly, presidents of the television era have resolved to take their cases directly to the American people in order to pressure Congress into acting, rather than cutting parochial deals, in the style of a Lyndon Johnson, to round up votes. Obama is better positioned to do this than any president since Reagan. He has outsider credibility, a rare gift for explanation and a comfort level with all manner of pop culture. (Did the leader of the free world actually tape a promo for George Lopez's new late-night show?) Unlike his predecessors, Obama can use the Web to reach a new generation of voters and, at least theoretically, to mobilize an expansive network of campaign supporters. Those vulnerable Democrats who risked voting for Obama's health care bill in the House probably did so not because they hope he will stand next to them on a stage for a few minutes next fall but because they are betting that Obama -- whose approval rating runs more than 30 points above the Democratic Congress -- will ultimately persuade their constituents that it was the right vote to make.
 The real problem for Obama is that he hasn't really done that yet. The White House has, to this point, mostly directed its power to persuade toward committee chairmen and other lawmakers, turning its attention to a broader public campaign only sporadically, when pressed to defend its agenda by tea-party protesters and fading poll numbers. As a result, perhaps, public support for each of Obama's signature initiatives, including health care, remains lower than support for the president himself. In other words, without a sustained sales pitch to the voters, Obama has yet to convert his personal good will with the electorate into corresponding enthusiasm for his agenda. And as anxious congressmen study poll numbers and look toward their own re-election campaigns next year, that's bound to become a more pressing problem for the White House. Lawmakers may yet be persuaded to enact the president's ambitious agenda, coattails or not, but only if he gives them something else to which they can cling.

HEADLINE: Visceral Has Its Value

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD. 
Nicholas D. Kristof is off today.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 It's easy to dismiss Sarah Palin.
 She's back on the trail, with the tumbling hair and tumbling thoughts. The queen of the scenic strip mall known as Wasilla now reigns over thrilled subjects thronging to a politically strategic swath of American strip malls.
 The conservative celebrity clearly hasn't boned up on anything, except her own endless odyssey of self-discovery. And she still has that Yoda-like syntax. 
 ''And I think more of a concern has been not within the campaign the mistakes that were made, not being able to react to the circumstances that those mistakes created in a real positive and professional and helpful way for John McCain,'' she told Bill O'Reilly.
 Yet Democrats would be foolish to write off her visceral power. 
 As Judith Doctor, a 69-year-old spiritual therapist, told The Washington Post's Jason Horowitz at Palin's book signing in Grand Rapids, Mich., ''She's alive inside, and that radiates energy, and people who are not psychologically alive inside are fascinated by that.''
 Barack Obama, who once had his own electric book tour testing the waters for a campaign, could learn a thing or three from Palin. On Friday, for the first time, his Gallup poll approval rating dropped below 50 percent, and he's losing the independents who helped get him elected.
 He's a highly intelligent man with a highly functioning West Wing, and he's likable, but he's not connecting on the gut level that could help him succeed.
 The animating spirit that electrified his political movement has sputtered out.
 People need to understand what the president is thinking as he maneuvers the treacherous terrain of a lopsided economic recovery and two depleting wars.
 Like Reagan, Obama is a detached loner with a strong, savvy wife. But unlike Reagan, he doesn't have the acting skills to project concern about what's happening to people.
 Obama showed a flair for the theatrical during his campaign, and a talent for narrative in his memoir, but he has yet to translate those skills to governing.
 As with the debates, he seems resistant to the idea that perception, as well as substance, matters. Obama so values pragmatism, and is so immersed in the thorny details of legislative compromises, that he may be undervaluing the connective bonds of simpler truths.
 Americans who are hurting get angry when they learn that Timothy Geithner, as head of the New York Fed before becoming Treasury secretary, caved to the insistence of Goldman Sachs and other A.I.G. trading partners that they get 100 cents on the dollar when he could have struck a far better bargain for taxpayers.
 If we could see a Reduced Shakespeare summary of Obama's presidency so far, it would read: 
 Dither, dither, speech. Foreign trip, bow, reassure. Seminar, summit. Shoot a jump shot with the guys, throw out the first pitch in mom jeans. Compromise, concede, close the deal. Dither, dither, water down, news conference.
 It's time for the president to reinvent this formula and convey a more three-dimensional person.
 Palin can be stupefyingly simplistic, but she seems dynamic. Obama is impressively complex but he seems static.
 She nurtures her grass roots while he neglects his.
 He struggles to transcend identity politics while she wallows in them. As he builds an emotional moat around himself, she exuberantly pushes whatever she has, warts and all -- the good looks, the tabloid-perfect family, the Alaska quirkiness, the kids with the weird names.
 Just like the disastrous and anti-intellectual W., this Visceral One never doubts herself. The Cerebral One welcomes doubt.
 On Afghanistan, Palin says, W-like, that the president should simply give Gen. Stanley McChrystal a blank check. But Afghanistan is a wrenching decision, and we do need the closest exit ramp. So the president should get credit for standing back and studying the issue, and for not rubber-stamping the generals' predictable urge to surge. But the way he has handled the perception part has allowed critics -- including generals -- to cast him as indecisive.
 McChrystal and Gen. David Petraeus should have been giving their best advice to Obama -- and airing their view against scaling down in Afghanistan -- in confidence. Instead, McChrystal pushed his opinion in a speech in London, and Petraeus has discussed his feelings in private sessions with reporters. This creates a ''Seven Days in May'' syndrome, where the two generals are, in effect, lobbying against the president and undercutting him as he's trying to make a painfully complex, life-and-death decision.
 This time, Obama should adopt Palin's straight-from-the-gut approach, call the generals into the Oval and tell them, ''Your pie-holes you will shut or rise higher you will not. Because, dang it, the president I am!''

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SOLOMON

 BODY:
A first-term congressman from New Orleans, you are the one and only Republican in the House who voted in favor of the Democrats' health care plan. Have you been scolded by the Republicans for breaking rank? Not my party leadership, but only by Republicans all over the United States who are disappointed with my vote. But not at all from the party leadership. 
 So not by Eric Cantor, for instance, the House minority whip, who, just days before the vote, claimed at a rally that ''not one Republican'' would support the bill? Correct. Actually, I just had lunch with Eric Cantor down here in New Orleans, and he was very supportive of who I am and what I have to do to represent the district. He fully understands the politics of the district. 
 Did you support the bill to curry favor with your constituents? You represent a mostly black district that is among the poorest in the nation. This is a personal position of mine. I do believe that we need health care reform. I do believe that we as a government have a duty to help those who are in need but who cannot help themselves. 
 So you're saying you voted out of personal conviction, not politics? Correct. I spent six years in the Society of Jesus, training to be a priest. I always adhere to what I call ''the politics of the Gospel.'' You have to take care of the poor, take care of the widows, visit the sick, help those who cannot help themselves.
 Why did you become a Republican? Because of their strong pro-life stance. That alone. 
 Do you find it awkward being a Republican whose ideas on both economic and social policy diverge from those of your party? It's not awkward because we're all professionals. We know that we are a diverse group.
 Republicans need you precisely because they're not a diverse group. They like having you because you're not another pale white face. I believe that they like me for who I am, not because they want the Republican Party to look something different than just white. 
 Of the 177 Republicans in the House, are there any other Asian-Americans? There's one, Steve Austria. He's from Ohio. He is a Filipino-American. 
 You were born in Saigon, where your father, a soldier, was taken prisoner by the Communists, and your mother arranged to send you off to the States when you were 8 years old. My mother decided to send her only two boys because she feared that if we were to grow up in Vietnam, we would be drafted into the military by the Communists and probably sent off fighting some war and get killed. My parents came over to the U.S. in 1991, 15 years after I did. 
 You lived with an uncle in Indiana. What was school like for you? Instead of going to the third grade, they actually put me back in first. I was two years older than all of my classmates. 
 Was that difficult? No, because I am petite and I looked quite young. I'm 5-foot-2. Now I look 18, even though I'm 42. 
 Have you been back to Vietnam? 1994 was the first time. Then in 2001 after I got married. 
 On your honeymoon? Yes, which was a bad mistake. We stayed with relatives, and it was noisy, it was hot, kids were coming, people were coming, we didn't have any quiet time together.
 What is it like in South Vietnam now? Well, economically people are a lot better off, but there's still a great deal of religious persecution, human rights violations. I am working very hard to change that. 
 You were in New Orleans when Katrina struck. We had eight feet of water in the house. I decided to run for office because I thought that I could contribute to rebuilding this area.
 You won your House seat when you defeated William Jefferson, who had been accused of hiding bribe money in his freezer. Correct. 
 Louisiana is known for corruption. Not anymore. We are squeaky clean.

HEADLINE: The Pit Bull in the China Shop

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
AT last the American right and left have one issue they unequivocally agree on: You don't actually have to read Sarah Palin's book to have an opinion about it. Last Sunday Liz Cheney praised ''Going Rogue'' as ''well-written'' on Fox News even though, by her own account, she had sampled only ''parts'' of it. On Tuesday, Ana Marie Cox, a correspondent for Air America, belittled the book in The Washington Post while confessing that she couldn't claim to have ''completely'' read it. 
 ''Going Rogue'' will hardly be the first best seller embraced by millions for talismanic rather than literary ends. And I am not recommending that others follow my example and slog through its 400-plus pages, especially since its supposed revelations have been picked through 24/7 for a week. But sometimes I wonder if anyone has read all of what Palin would call the ''dang'' thing. Some of the book's most illuminating tics have been mentioned barely -- if at all -- by either its fans or foes. Palin is far and away the most important brand in American politics after Barack Obama, and attention must be paid. Those who wishfully think her 15 minutes are up are deluding themselves.
 The book's biggest surprise is Palin's wide-eyed infatuation with show-business celebrities. You get nearly as much face time with Tina Fey and the cast of ''Saturday Night Live'' in ''Going Rogue'' as you do with John McCain. We learn how happy Palin was to receive calls from Bono and Warren Beatty ''to share ideas and insights.'' We wade through star-struck lists of campaign cameos by Robert Duvall, Jon Voight (who ''blew us away''), Naomi Judd, Gary Sinise and Kelsey Grammer, among many others. Then there are the acknowledgments at the book's end, where Palin reveals that her intimacy with media stars is such that she can air-kiss them on a first-name basis, from Greta to Laura to Rush. 
 Equally revealing is the one boldfaced name conspicuously left unmentioned in the book: Levi Johnston, the father of Palin's grandchild. Though Palin and McCain milked him for photo ops at the Republican convention, he is persona non grata now that he's taking off his campaign wardrobe. Is Johnston's fledgling porn career the problem, or is it his public threats to strip bare Palin family secrets as well? ''She knows what I got on her'' is how he put it. In Palin's interview with Oprah last week, it was questioning about Johnston, not Katie Couric, that made her nervous. 
 The book's most frequently dropped names, predictably enough, are the Lord and Ronald Reagan (though not necessarily in that order). Easily the most startling passage in ''Going Rogue,'' running more than two pages, collates extended excerpts from a prayerful letter Palin wrote to mark the birth of Trig, her child with Down syndrome. This missive's understandable goal was to reassert Palin's faith and trust in God. But Palin did not write her letter to God; she wrote the letter from God, assuming His role and voice herself and signing it ''Trig's Creator, Your Heavenly Father.'' If I may say so -- Oy!
 Even by the standard of politicians, this is a woman with an outsized ego. Combine that with her performance skills and an insatiable hunger for the limelight, and you can see why she will not stay in Wasilla now that she's seen 30 Rock. The question journalists repeatedly asked last week -- What are Palin's plans for 2012? -- is a red herring. Palin has no obligation to answer it. She is the pit bull in the china shop of American politics, and she can do what she wants, on her own timeline, all the while raking in the big bucks she couldn't as a sitting governor. No one, least of all her own political party, can control her. 
 The fact-checking siege of ''Going Rogue'' -- by the media, Democrats and aggrieved McCain campaign operatives alike -- is another fruitless sideshow. Palin's political appeal has never had anything to do with facts -- or coherent policy positions. The more she is attacked for not being in possession of pointy-headed erudition, the more powerful she becomes as an avatar of the anti-elite cause. As Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review, has correctly observed, ''She represents less a philosophical strain on the right than an affect and a demographic.'' 
 That demographic is white and non-urban: Just look at the stops and the faces on her carefully calibrated book tour. The affect is emotional -- the angry air of grievance that emerged first at her campaign rallies in 2008, with their shrieked threats to Obama, and that has since resurfaced in the Hitler-fixated ''tea party'' movement (which she endorses in her book). It's a politics of victimization and sloganeering with no policy solutions required beyond the conservative mantra of No Taxes. Its standard-bearer can make stuff up with impunity: ''Thanks, but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere''; Obama's ''palling around with terrorists''; health care ''death panels.''
 After the Palin-McCain ticket lost, conservative pundits admonished her to start studying the issues. If ''Going Rogue'' and its promotional interviews are any indication, she has ignored their entreaties during her months at liberty. Last week, Greta Van Susteren chastised Oprah for not asking Palin ''one policy question,'' but when Barbara Walters did ask some, Palin either recycled Dick Cheney verbatim (Obama is ''dithering'') or ran aground. Her argument for why ''Jewish settlements'' should be expanded on the West Bank was that ''more and more Jewish people will be flocking to Israel in the days and weeks and months ahead.'' It was unclear what she was talking about -- unless it was the ''rapture'' theology that requires the mass return of Jews to settle the Holy Land as a precondition for the return of Christ. 
 The discredited neocon hacks who have latched on to Palin as a potential ticket back into power have their work cut out for them. But it's better for Palin's purposes to remain as blank a slate as possible anyway. Some of her most ardent supporters realize that she'll drive still more independent voters away if she fills in too many details. And so Matthew Continetti, the author of the just-published ''Persecution of Sarah Palin'' and her most persistent cheerleader after William Kristol, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that her role model for 2012 should be Bob McDonnell, the new Republican governor-elect of Virginia, who won on ''a bipartisan, center-right approach.'' 
 What Continetti means is that Palin could still somehow fudge her history as McDonnell did; his campaign kept his career-long history as a political acolyte and financial beneficiary of Pat Robertson on the down-low. Even the far right has figured out that homophobia is a turnoff to swing voters, which is why Palin goes out of her way in ''Going Rogue'' to remind us she has her very own lesbian friend. (What's left unsaid is that the book's credited ghost writer, Lynn Vincent, labeled homosexuality as ''deviance'' in her own writings for World, the evangelical magazine.) 
 But no matter how much Palin tries to pass for ''center-right,'' she's unlikely to fool that vast pool of voters left, right and center who have already written her off as unqualified for the White House. The G.O.P. establishment knows this, and is frightened. The demographic that Palin attracts is in decline; there's no way the math of her fan base adds up to an Electoral College victory.
 Yet among Republicans she still ties Mitt Romney in the latest USA Today/Gallup survey, with 65 percent giving her serious presidential consideration, just behind the 71 for her evangelical rival, Mike Huckabee. The crowds lining up in the cold for her book tour are likely to be the most motivated to line up at the polls in G.O.P. primaries. They don't speak the same language as Romney, Tim Pawlenty, Michael Steele, Mitch McConnell, John Boehner or, for that matter, McCain. They are more likely to heed Palin salesmen like Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh than baffled Bush administration grandees like Peter Wehner, who last week called Palin ''a cultural figure much more than a political one'' on the Web site of the establishment conservative organ Commentary.
 Culture is politics. Palin is at the red-hot center of age-old American resentments that have boiled up both from the ascent of our first black president and from the intractability of the Great Recession for those Americans who haven't benefited from bailouts. As Palin thrives on the ire of the left, so she does from the disdain of Republican leaders who, with a condescension rivaling the sexism they decry in liberals, belittle her as a lightweight or instruct her to eat think-tank spinach. 
 The only person who can derail Palin is Palin herself. Should she not self-destruct, she will doom G.O.P. hopes of a 2012 comeback. But the rest of the country cannot rest easy. The rage out there is larger than Palin and defies partisan labeling. Her ever-present booster Continetti, writing in The Weekly Standard, suggested that she recast the century-old populist outrage of William Jennings Bryan by adopting the message ''You shall not crucify mankind upon the cross of Goldman Sachs.'' If Obama can't tamp down that rage across the political map, Palin will at the very least pave the way for a demagogue with less baggage to pick up her torch.

HEADLINE: Health Care Overhaul Bill Passes Crucial Senate Test

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and ROBERT PEAR; Carl Hulse contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Senate voted on Saturday to begin full debate on major health care legislation, propelling President Obama's top domestic initiative over a crucial, preliminary hurdle in a formidable display of muscle-flexing by the Democratic majority. 
 ''Tonight we have the opportunity, the historic opportunity to reform health care once and for all,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and a chief architect of the legislation. ''History is knocking on the door. Let's open it. Let's begin the debate.''
 The 60-to-39 vote, along party lines, clears the way for weeks of rowdy floor proceedings that will begin after Thanksgiving and last through much of December. 
 The Senate bill seeks to extend health benefits to roughly 31 million Americans who are now uninsured, at a cost of $848 billion over 10 years. 
 The House earlier this month approved its health care bill by 220 to 215, with just one Republican voting in favor. That measure is broadly similar to the Senate legislation, but there are some major differences that would have to be resolved before a bill could reach Mr. Obama, and that would almost surely push the process into next year. 
 As the Democrats succeeded Saturday in uniting their caucus by winning over the last two holdouts, big disagreements remained, making final approval of the bill far from certain. 
 Two reluctant Democratic senators, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, warned that their support for a motion to open debate did not guarantee that they would ultimately vote for the bill. Their remarks echoed previous comments by several other senators, including Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut.
 Those comments made clear that more horse-trading lies ahead and that major changes might be required if the bill is to be approved. And it suggested that the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, who relied only on members aligned with his party to bring the bill to the floor, may yet have to sway one or more Republicans to his side to get the bill adopted. 
 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said his party's opposition would persist. ''The battle has just begun,'' he said.
 In a rare ceremonial gesture reserved for major votes, senators cast their yeas and nays from their desks in the chamber, each one rising to voice his or her position. Senator George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, was not present and did not vote.
 After the vote, Mr. Reid said he understood that Ms. Landrieu was already working with two other Democratic senators, Thomas R. Carper of Delaware and Charles E. Schumer of New York, to see if they could devise a public insurance plan with broad appeal.
 The White House issued a statement praising the vote. ''The President is gratified that the Senate has acted to begin consideration of health insurance reform legislation,'' his press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said, adding that President Obama ''looks forward to a thorough and productive debate.''
 Mrs. Lincoln, who faces a tough re-election campaign next year and has in recent weeks been the target of millions of dollars in television advertising by both sides in the health care fight, said pointedly that she would not vote for the measure if it retained a government-run health insurance plan, known as the public option, to compete with private insurers. ''Although I don't agree with everything in this bill, I believe it is more important that we begin debate on how to improve the health care system for all Americans,'' said Mrs. Lincoln, who was the last uncommitted Democrat, and whose speech, at about 2:30 p.m. Saturday, lifted a cloud of suspense that had hovered around the Capitol. 
 She added: ''But let me be perfectly clear. I am opposed to a new government-administered health care plan as a part of comprehensive health insurance reform, and I will not vote in favor of the proposal that has been introduced by leader Reid as it is written.'' But Senator Lieberman, who voted to take up the health care bill, said he was still staunchly opposed to a government-run plan. It is ''a terrible idea,'' he said.
 Ms. Landrieu, whose support came after she won a provision that could be worth more than $100 million in additional federal aid for her financially troubled state, said, ''I have decided there are enough significant reforms and safeguards in this bill to move forward, but much more work needs to be done.'' 
 A parade of Democrats and Republicans spent Saturday laying out their arguments for and against the bill in floor speeches. 
 Mr. Reid, in a rousing closing speech given at his customary volume, which is barely audible, likened the health care bill to some of the most profound issues confronted by the Senate across history. 
 ''Imagine if instead of debating either of the historic G.I. Bills -- legislation that has given so many brave Americans the chance to brave college -- if this body had stood silent,'' Mr. Reid said. ''Imagine if instead of debating the bills that created Social Security or Medicare, the Senate's voices had been stilled. Imagine if instead of debating whether to abolish slavery, instead of debating whether giving women and minorities a right to vote, those who disagreed were muted, discussion was killed.'' 
 With the Democrats nominally controlling 60 votes -- the precise number needed to overcome the Republican attempt to stop the bill -- the vote on Saturday evening was the biggest test yet of the Democrats' resolve and of Mr. Reid's ability to unite his fragile caucus. Mr. Reid faces a tough re-election fight next year. 
 The bill would expand health benefits by broadly expanding Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program for low-income people, and by providing subsidies to help moderate-income people buy either private insurance or coverage under a new government-run plan, the public option. And it would impose a requirement that nearly all Americans obtain insurance or pay monetary penalties for failing to do so. 
 According to the Congressional Budget Office, the cost of the legislation would be more than offset by new taxes and fees and reductions in government spending, so that the bill would reduce future federal budget deficits by $130 billion through 2019. 
 Mr. Reid accused Republicans who opposed the legislation of ''living in a different world.'' He and several other Democrats also used their speeches to assail perceived abuses by private insurers. ''The health insurance industry has an insatiable appetite for more profit,'' Mr. Reid said. 
 Senate Republicans countered with an impassioned denunciation of the measure as an ill-conceived budget-busting expansion of government and a threat to the health and economic security of all Americans, especially the elderly. 
 The Republicans sought to portray the vote on Saturday -- on whether to end debate on a motion to bring up the health bill -- as tantamount to a vote on the bill itself, and to shake the confidence of Democrats who had wavered in recent days. 
 In his closing argument, just ahead of the vote, Mr. McConnell implored at least a single Democrat to vote no. ''If we don't stop this bill tonight,'' he said, ''the only debate we'll be having is about higher premiums, not savings for the American people, higher taxes instead of lower costs, and cuts to Medicare rather than improving seniors' care.'' 
 ''The American people are looking at the Senate tonight; they're hoping we say no to this bill,'' Mr. McConnell added moments later, holding up a single index finger. ''All it would take,'' he said, ''is just one member of the other side of the aisle, just one, to give us an opportunity not to end the debate but to change the debate in the direction the American people would like us to go.'' 
 Mr. McConnell warned of the political consequences for senators who voted to move ahead. ''Senators who support this bill have a lot of explaining to do,'' he said. ''Americans know that a vote to proceed on this bill, to get on this bill, is a vote for higher premiums, higher taxes and massive cuts to Medicare.'' 
 Republicans also said that the vote was a proxy for a larger dispute over abortion, because they said the bill did not sufficiently restrict the use of federal money for insurance covering abortions. Senator Mike Johanns, Republican of Nebraska, described the vote as ''the key vote on abortion in the health care debate.'' 
 Saturday night's vote was required because Senate rules and precedent have long granted a right of virtually unlimited debate, or filibuster, to the minority that can be curtailed only by a supermajority vote of 60 senators to move ahead. Currently, there are 58 Democrats in the Senate and two independents who routinely align with them. If the Democrats had lost the vote, they could have tried again, presumably after changing the bill to try to attract more votes.
 Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont assailed the Republicans as obstructionists on Saturday morning. ''I will vote today to end the filibuster so the Senate can begin the historic debate to improve and reform our nation's health insurance system,'' he said. ''Let's not duck the debate, let the debate begin. Let's not hide from the votes.''
 While Democrats generally agree on the broad goals of the legislation, to cover the uninsured and to slow the growth in health care spending, there are potentially serious disagreements over any number of provisions that could sink the bill.
 Ms. Landrieu, in her speech, methodically cataloged provisions of the bill that she liked and those that she said needed improvement.
 Under the bill, she said, owners of small businesses would no longer face ''volatile costs'' for health insurance. In addition, she said, the bill would ''encourage employers to move away from high-cost benefit plans'' and shift some compensation to wages.
 But more needed to be done to improve the bill, she argued, particularly to help small businesses and the self-employed. And she issued a stern warning about the public option, one of the most contentious features of the sweeping health care legislation.

HEADLINE: Goldman's Non-Apology

 BODY:
''Certainly, our industry is responsible for things. We're a leader in our industry, and we participated in things that were clearly wrong and we have reasons to regret and apologize for.''
 --Lloyd Blankfein, chairman and chief executive, Goldman Sachs, Nov. 17, 2009.
 We'll give this to Mr. Blankfein: On some level, he seems to understand that an apology is in order. But his remarks do not come close to an apology. Even if he had said, ''we're sorry,'' it would have been hollow since he never actually said what he was sorry for (''things'' doesn't cut it) or to whom he was apologizing. 
 Outside Wall Street, those blanks are not so hard to fill in. It is widely and correctly understood that Wall Street, with Goldman as a leader and with regulators in thrall, helped to inflate and profited from a credit bubble that burst and cost tens of millions of Americans their jobs, incomes, savings and home equity. American taxpayers continue to stand behind the bailouts and other government interventions that have stabilized the financial system, including Goldman, enabling the firm to post blowout profits in 2009 and to set aside $16.7 billion for bonuses so far this year. 
 Goldman does not see it that way. It says it never really needed government aid to survive the financial crisis. In that telling, taxpayer dollars have not helped to generate its post-crash profits, and anger over bonuses is jealousy over the good fortune of others. 
 That is absurd. Goldman has repaid its initial $10 billion bailout allotment, but that is only a sliver of its taxpayer support. The firm was paid $12.9 billion, for example, in the bailout of American International Group, and a report by the bailout's inspector general refutes Goldman's claim that it did not need the money. Perhaps the biggest continuing prop is that the government clearly considers Goldman too big to fail, which means that taxpayers are on the hook if Goldman faces the abyss again. 
 On the day of Mr. Blankfein's non-apology, Goldman pledged $500 million over five years -- crumbs from its table -- to help 10,000 small businesses. It is hard to take seriously Goldman's claim that the program was not motivated by its public relations problems. The money will be welcomed by the recipients, but if Goldman wants to make a meaningful contribution, it would have to be in the billions and aimed more directly at taxpayers. 
 So, here's a thought: A multibillion-dollar gift to the federal Bureau of the Public Debt, which accepts tax-deductible donations to reduce the national debt. The donation can come from the bonuses; that way, it would not harm shareholders, because they only get their cut after the bonuses are paid. Goldman's tax savings from the donation could help finance the small-business initiative. 
 And a contribution might help Goldman ward off the alternative: serious calls for a windfall tax on bonuses, which would be justified since the profits they are based on are in large part the result of government efforts. One way or another, the taxpayers will demand their due, and one way or another, they just might get it.
 Checks can be made out to the Bureau of the Public Debt and sent to Bureau of the Public Debt, Dept. G, P.O. Box 2188, Parkersburg, W.Va., 26106-2188.

HEADLINE: Legislative Pileup Looms in the Senate

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, heard a few weeks ago that the House took less than an hour to approve an unemployment bill that had languished for a month in the Senate, aides said he did not know whether to laugh or cry.
 In the polarized Senate, even popular bills and generally acceptable executive branch nominees that eventually win easy approval first have to crawl though time-consuming procedural thickets. 
 Now it is hard to see how Congress will make up for the lost time. While the Senate hopes to devote most of December to a landmark debate on health care, time is running out on a number of other difficult and significant issues that must be resolved by the end of the year.
 What follows the Thanksgiving recess may be a headlong rush into a legislative train wreck. Among the obstacles on the track is raising the national debt limit, always a wrenching vote for lawmakers trying to avoid looking like out-of-control spenders.
 Congress must also either finish seven more spending bills or pass another stop-gap measure to keep the government operating past mid-December. Provisions of the Patriot Act are set to expire. Highway construction and unemployment programs need an extension. The federal estate tax will temporarily lapse without Congressional intervention. 
 To top it off, lawmakers also await President Obama's decision on how to proceed with the war in Afghanistan, and they must decide how to pay for any increase in troops.
 As they brace for the frantic finale, Democrats blame Republicans for all of it, saying the minority party in the Senate has slowed almost everything Democrats have sought to do, filibustering even routine matters.
 ''It has been a very difficult year on the Democratic side,'' Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, said Friday. ''We have faced, again, this onslaught of filibusters and delaying tactics by the Republicans. That it would take four weeks for us to extend unemployment benefits in the worst recession since our Great Depression is an indication of the extremes that the Republican Senate leadership has gone to.''
 Republicans do not see it that way. They say Democrats have caused some of the delays by feuding among themselves, failing to use their 60-seat majority to full advantage. They say that in the debates on the unemployment bill and other issues, Democrats refused to let them offer amendments out of a desire to avoid politically treacherous votes. If they delayed, Republicans say, it was only in an attempt to be heard.
 And now the Republicans say that if they want to clear the calendar, Democrats ought to scrap the health care legislation and focus on the more pressing issues of the moment, like the spending bills and the Patriot Act.
 ''That's what we ought to be doing,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said Friday. ''It would probably take from now until Christmas to do all of these measures that we should be dealing with. Instead, we're spending time trying to do something the American people clearly don't want.''
 And when Republicans see something that they think the public does not want -- or that they themselves do not want -- they do not consider it their obligation to help Democrats advance what they view as flawed policy.
 ''It is true that we have not helped them do bad things,'' said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell.
 While Republicans dispute that they are pure obstructionists, there is evidence to suggest that they are using their procedural power to slow even legislation and nominations that they know they have no chance of blocking. And in some cases, many Republicans do not truly expect to prevail. 
 So far this year, according to the official Senate count, there have been 33 votes on cloture, the mechanism for ending a filibuster against a bill or a nominee. On those votes, Democrats have triumphed 29 times. That the Democrats held together means that most of these matters were not particularly tough. 
 Even more telling is the fact that some of the cloture motions were overwhelmingly approved with 70 and even 80 votes -- far above the minimum 60 that are required to cut off debate and force a vote.
 Democrats say that proves what the opposition is really up to. In their view, the Republicans, unable to prevent most legislation or Obama nominees from advancing, are running out the clock on virtually every play.
 ''Over and over again, we are seeing tactics to simply slow the Senate down,'' said Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan and a diligent chronicler of Republican objections. She pointed out that after initial procedural hurdles were surmounted, ''people have been confirmed overwhelmingly, if not unanimously, and the same is true for legislation.''
 But the Democrats say it is going to take cooperation to finish off the pending business. Given the shortage of that commodity in Congress so far this year, a messy end to 2009 may lie ahead.

HEADLINE: Eyeing a Tiger to Ride

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON; Adam Nagourney contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Via Oprah, Facebook and a bus trip that resembled a campaign swing more than a book tour, Sarah Palin reappeared on the national stage last week, minus her governorship and running-mate status, but with a new role as principled ''rogue'' to add to her previous credits as plain-spoken patriot and hockey mom.
 Whatever else it said about America, her return brought into focus a big question for Republicans as they watched the intense reactions she generated: To what extent should they try to energize their electoral prospects by hitching themselves to the powerful but volatile strain of populism -- characterized by anti-elitism and deep skepticism of government -- that Ms. Palin has come to embody?
The renewed potency of populist conservatism has been on display since the summer, when health care town hall meetings became a forum for frustrated voters, angry at President Obama and Congressional Democrats over the issue of government expansion, and also at Republicans suspected of not fighting aggressively enough. 
 But even as conservatives exult in Mr. Obama's declining job approval ratings, the drive for ideological purity inspired by the populists of the right has left many elected Republicans nervous and concerned.
 Just ask Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina or Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida, rock-solid Republicans who now are accused of being insufficiently ideological. Consider too the recent election in upstate New York, in which a dispute between conservatives and moderates cost Republicans a House seat they had held for generations.
 The re-emergence of Ms. Palin, a self-described outsider who is attracting thousands of what she calls ''ordinary Americans'' to her book signings in battleground states, has infused fresh energy into the debate.
 Writing in The Weekly Standard last week, Matthew Continetti, the author of a new book, ''The Persecution of Sarah Palin,'' argued that she can be a William Jennings Bryan for a new conservative era, who ''will give voice to the millions who don't want government aggrandizing the powerful; who don't want government risking dangerous fiscal imbalances; who do want public policies that create the conditions for general prosperity.''
 Others are skeptical. Peter Wehner, a former aide to President George W. Bush who is now a conservative commentator, defended Ms. Palin against her harsher critics but urged the Republican Party to look elsewhere. In a blog post on the Commentary Web site, he called for public figures ''who radiate intellectual depth and calmness of purpose.'' Palinism, he wrote, ''is less a coherent philosophy or set of ideas and more an attitude and spirit.''
 This disagreement reflects longstanding divisions within a movement whose early leaders, like William F. Buckley Jr., were often unapologetic elitists who disdained the passions of the masses and were likely to link populism to the left and its attacks on Wall Street.
 Michael Kazin, a history professor at Georgetown University and the author of a biography of Bryan, said populism has long had powerful resonance on the left as well as the right, and in both cases has carried undercurrents of anger, resentment and class warfare.
 Senator Joseph McCarthy wielded the language of populism in the early 1950s as, to varying degrees, did George Wallace and Richard Nixon in the late 1960's. ''Populism is very powerful but electorally very perilous,'' Mr. Kazin said. ''People for whom that is the major identity don't get elected president. It's a scary way to talk -- not a way to talk to persuade people to trust you with power.''
 Still, populism has been used successfully by both parties. Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton often cast policies in populist terms -- like Mr. Reagan's appeals to the ''moral majority'' (in contrast with East Coast liberals) or Mr. Clinton's to an alienated middle class ''who play by the rules.'' But both managed to avoid explicitly pitting one group against another.
 David Winston, a pollster who advises the Republican leaders in Congress, said that when populism is married to a positive agenda that gives voters a concrete alternative to the status quo, it can alter the landscape, as it did when Republicans captured the House in 1994.
 ''The challenge is not tapping into a populist environment, it's creating an alternative that brings about the next political shift,'' he said.
 In this view populism is less an ideology than a disposition, and so can be compatible with traditional social and economic conservatism. But this overlooks the counterexample of Patrick J. Buchanan, whose insurgent populist campaign, which emphasized isolationist foreign policy and protectionism, damaged the Republican incumbent, George H. W. Bush, in the 1992 election. More recently, Mike Huckabee, who highlighted working-class anxieties, dogged John McCain through most of the 2008 primaries. He now runs well in polls that compare Republican prospects for 2012 .
 At a time when grass-roots anger is being fed by government bailouts of powerful Wall Street firms, Republicans could find themselves as politically vulnerable as the Democrats now seem. It was, after all, President Bush who initiated the rescues on Wall Street in 2008.
 Even so, the issues now animating tea partiers and other grass-roots activists reflect the Republican Party's core values: less government spending, lower taxes, lighter regulation.
 The trick, some Republicans said, is to guide populists' energies toward an optimistic agenda built on those themes. ''If we don't take this anger and frustration, as legitimate as I believe it is, and channel it into a good, a positive, then we won't be successful,'' said Rick Santorum, a former Republican senator from Pennsylvania.
 Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, who was chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1993 to 1997 and is a potential 2012 president candidate, cited the 1994 House elections as a model for what the party can accomplish now. In that election, he said, Republicans attracted voters who in 1992 had backed H. Ross Perot's third-party candidacy.
 ''We figured out very quickly that the vast majority of them agreed with Republicans on most issues, and we courted them,'' Mr. Barbour said. ''We invited them to be involved and made it plain that we were interested in their views and that we shared most views. And I think the same thing would be said about the tea party leaders and activists.''
 But if he is eager to court Ms. Palin's fans, he seems ambivalent about Ms. Palin herself.
 Under repeated prodding about her qualifications for the presidency Thursday from Chris Matthews on MSNBC's ''Hardball,'' Mr. Barbour mustered only a half-hearted, ''I don't know of anything that disqualifies her from being president.'' He, like other Republicans, is well aware that the populist wave she is riding could upend the party's established order.

HEADLINE: Treading Lightly in Asia Nov. 15-21

 BODY:
Climate Change
 THE NEWS After meeting on the sidelines of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in Singapore,President Obama and other leaders announced that a binding climate-change agreement could not be negotiated in time for a major world summit meeting next month in Copenhagen. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Many other nations are reluctant to make any firm pledges to limit their carbon emissions until the United States does -- and though Mr. Obama has championed a climate-change bill passed by the House in June, the Senate is not expected to take it up until sometime next year.
 Nuclear Weapons
 THE NEWS At the meeting in Singapore, the president managed to get PresidentDmitri A. Medvedev of Russia to publicly express dissatisfaction with Iran's response to diplomatic offers meant to curb its nuclear program.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Obama, who is trying to lay the groundwork for U.N. sanctions against Iran if it does not agree to turn decisively away from nuclear weapons-making, had less luck with his hosts in China, which, like Russia, has a veto in the Security Council. During Mr. Obama's visit, PresidentHu Jintao did not publicly discuss the possibility of sanctions against Iran
 Human Rights
 THE NEWS In contrast with past visits by American presidents, Mr. Obama avoided making any pointed comments on human rights and steered clear of meetings with activists while in China.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Even at a town-hall-style meeting with students in Shanghai -- an audience that proved to have been hand-picked by Chinese officials -- Mr. Obama sidestepped a question about Chinese censorship of the Internet. The joint statement issued after his meetings with President Hu said flatly that ''both sides recognized that the United States and China have differences on the issue of human rights.''
 Exchange Rates
 THE NEWS Chinese officials apparently gave Mr. Obama nothing new on the issue of China's currency, which it pegs to the dollar at a rate that many in the United States and elsewhere say is kept artificially low, giving Chinese factories a cost advantage over foreign rivals.
 BEHIND THE NEWS China's chief bank regulator turned the issue back on the United States just before Mr. Obama's arrival, criticizing low American interest rates for weakening the dollar. China's trade surpluses have given it more than $2.2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, and Beijing is worried about its dollar assets' value eroding.
 Humility
 THE NEWS When Air Force One arrived in Shanghai during a hard rain, Chinese television viewers were surprised to see Mr. Obama descending from the plane to the tarmac holding his own umbrella rather than being shielded from the weather by an aide.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The small moment, widely discussed on Chinese chat sites afterward, struck many as contrasting sharply with the stuffy haughtiness often seen in China's leaders, as well as the widespread perception of American arrogance that Mr. Obama has said he wants to counter with a more respectful diplomatic style.

HEADLINE: Plotting Thrillers in the Fog of China

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
President Obama stood at a ''town hall'' meeting in Shanghai last week, fielding questions from eager Chinese students, an American leader demonstrating the give-and-take of democracy to a nation under one-party rule. Except that the students were mainly members of the Communist Youth League, hand-picked by the Chinese Communist Party, and the first question set the tone: ''What measures will you take to deepen this close relationship between cities of the United States and China?''
 All in all, the ''town hall'' exemplified the sort of stagecraft that the Chinese seem to specialize in -- managed in a way that is so obvious as to be condescending, but still successful at stifling dissent. 
The moment reminded me of why I decided, three years ago, to center my second spy novel, ''The Ghost War,'' on a conflict between the United States and China.
 For novelists, China's rise is pure gold. The Communist Party's opacity and its passion to control China's image have had the opposite effect: they feed Western fears of China's intentions, and dare Western thriller writers to invent disaster.
 Never mind that so far the Chinese have not projected military power outside of East Asia, that they prefer to compete mainly by accumulating dollars by the trillion. Military power grows from economic strength, and military analysts do not doubt that the People's Republic could one day become a full-bore competitor to the United States, offering its protection to all manner of governments throughout the Persian Gulf and Africa.
 For journalists, couldis a blank page. But novelists exist to fill that space. So, in 2006, after outlining my book, I procured a tourist visa (I doubted the regime would welcome any working spy novelist, let alone one whose day job was being a business reporter for The New York Times), and went off to China.
 The trip was fascinating. I'd been to the People's Republic in 1988, before the protests in Tiananmen Square forced China's rulers to liberalize their economic policies. I vaguely remembered a gray Communist country, with empty stores and note-pad sized currency. No more. On Beijing's giant avenues, cars and buses crowded out bicycles. Giant skyscrapers towered above Guangzhou and Shanghai. Even Xian, in the interior, was bustling and prosperous.
 But I can't pretend that I left China with a better understanding of the machinations at the top of the Communist Party. Those doors stayed closed to me, as they do to nearly all Westerners.
 Journalists and spies find such obfuscation frustrating; they are reduced to reading between the lines of official statements and guessing at the shifting alliances and ideologies of the middle-aged men who run China. Facts are hard to come by.
 But the opacity that maddens reporters is manna for novelists, and the novelist in me had a fine time imagining what might be happening behind closed doors in Beijing. What if a hard-line Chinese general wanted to take control of the People's Republic? Could he maneuver China and the United States into a clash, a limited war, to grab control?
 I did have a few facts to work with. Military analysts and the Pentagon say China has sharply increased its military spending in the last decade (though it remains far less than the $680 billion the United States will spend this year). The People's Liberation Army Navy (yes, that's its name) has been developing submarines and super-fast torpedoes whose only logical targets are American naval vessels. Beijing is trying to build ties all over the world, especially with resource-rich nations in Africa. And China has deep national scars from the quasi-colonialism it faced during the 19th and 20th centuries.
 Are old resentments and a shifting balance of power enough to push nuclear-armed powers to the brink of war? In the real world, probably not. In a spy novel, absolutely.
 Readers sometimes comment on the realism of my novels. But I don't aspire to realism. I want, instead, the illusion of realism -- a little like the way the Chinese government cares little about the reality of public consent, so long as it has the appearance of consent.
 If I can conjure an image of the meetings of the Politburo Standing Committee that seems accurate to you the reader, I've succeeded. After all,Hu Jintao -- the general secretary of the committee -- is unlikely to complain. (If only he would. What publicity that would be!) To steal an old joke: If a bear is chasing both of us, I don't have to outrun the bear. I just have to outrun you.
 And so I and other spy novelists can only hope that the Chinese, and the rest of the world's authoritarian regimes, stick with their stage-managed town halls, Internet censorship, and jailings of mouthy dissidents. During the 1990s, we had reason to worry: democracy seemed to be spreading globally, international tensions fading. Now, though, those dark days are behind us, and we can get back to imagining the worst without fear of contradiction.
 Bad for the world, I suppose. Lucky for us.

HEADLINE: Revisiting A Fed Waltz With A.I.G.

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
A RAY of sunlight broke through the Washington fog last week when Neil M. Barofsky, special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, published his office's report on the government bailout last year of the American International Group. 
 It's must reading for any taxpayer hoping to understand why the $182 billion ''rescue'' of what was once the world's largest insurer still ranks as the most troubling episode of the financial disaster. And it couldn't have come at a more pivotal moment. 
 Many in Washington want to give more regulatory power to the Federal Reserve Board, the banking regulator that orchestrated the A.I.G. bailout. Through this prism, the actions taken in the deal by Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, who was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at the time, grow curiouser and curiouser. 
 Of special note in the report: the Fed failed to develop a workable rescue plan when A.I.G., swamped by demands that it pay off huge insurance contracts that it couldn't make good on as the economy tanked, began to sink. The report takes the Fed to task as refusing to use its power and prestige to wrestle concessions from A.I.G.'s big, sophisticated and well-heeled trading partners when the government itself had to pay off the contracts. 
 The Fed, under Mr. Geithner's direction, gave A.I.G.'s counterparties 100 cents on the dollar for positions that would have been worth far less if A.I.G. had defaulted. Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Societe Generale and other banks were in the group that got full value for their contracts when many others were accepting fire-sale prices.
 On the question of whether this payout was what the report describes as a ''backdoor bailout'' of A.I.G.'s counterparties, Mr. Barofsky concluded: ''The very design of the federal assistance to A.I.G. was that tens of billions of dollars of government money was funneled inexorably and directly to A.I.G.'s counterparties.'' The report said this was money the banks might not otherwise have received had A.I.G. gone belly-up.
 THE report zaps Fed claims that identifying banks that benefited from taxpayer largess would have dire consequences. Fed officials had refused to disclose the identities of the counterparties or details of the payments, warning ''that disclosure of the names would undermine A.I.G.'s stability, the privacy and business interests of the counterparties, and the stability of the markets,'' the report said. 
 When the parties were named, ''the sky did not fall,'' the report said. 
 Finally, Mr. Barofsky pokes holes in arguments made repeatedly over the past 14 months by Goldman Sachs, A.I.G.'s largest trading partner and recipient of $12.9 billion in taxpayer money in the bailout, that it had faced no material risk in an A.I.G. default -- that, in effect, had A.I.G. cratered, Goldman wouldn't have suffered damage. 
 In short, there's an awful lot jammed into this 36-page report. 
 Even before publishing this analysis, Mr. Barofsky had made a name for himself as one of the few truth tellers in Washington. While others estimate how much the taxpayer will make on various bailout programs, Mr. Barofsky has said that returns are extremely unlikely. 
 His office has also opened 65 cases to investigate potential fraud in various bailout programs. ''When I first took office, I can't tell you how many times I'd be having a sit-down and warning about potential fraud in the program and I would hear a response basically saying, 'Oh, they're bankers, and they wouldn't put their reputations at risk by committing fraud,' '' Mr. Barofsky told Bloomberg News a little over a week ago, adding: ''I think we've done a good job of instilling a greater degree of skepticism that what comes from Wall Street isn't necessarily the holy grail.'' 
 Mr. Barofsky says the Fed failed to strong-arm the banks when it was negotiating payouts on the A.I.G. contracts. Rather than forcing the banks to accept a steep discount, or ''haircut,'' the Fed gave the banks $27 billion in taxpayer cash and allowed them to keep an additional $35 billion in collateral already posted by A.I.G. That amounted to about $62 billion for the contracts, which the report describes as ''far above their market value at the time.''
 Mr. Geithner, who oversaw those negotiations, said in an interview on Friday that the terms of the A.I.G. deal were the best he could get for taxpayers. He considered bailing out A.I.G. to be ''offensive,'' he said, but deemed it necessary because a collapse would have undermined the financial system. 
 ''We prevented A.I.G. from defaulting because our judgment was that the damage caused by failure would have been much more costly for the economy and the taxpayer,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''To most Americans, this looked like a deeply unfair outcome and they find it hard to see any direct benefit. But in fact, their savings are more valuable and secure today.''
 The report said that while bailing out Goldman and other investment banks might not have been the intent behind the Fed's A.I.G. rescue, it certainly was its effect. ''By providing A.I.G. with the capital to make these payments, Federal Reserve officials provided A.I.G.'s counterparties with tens of billions of dollars they likely would have not otherwise received had A.I.G. gone into bankruptcy,'' the report stated.
 As Goldman prepares to pay out nearly $17 billion in bonuses to its employees, it is important that an authoritative, independent voice like Mr. Barofsky's reminds us how the taxpayer bailout of A.I.G. benefited Goldman.
 A Goldman spokesman, Lucas van Praag, said that Goldman believed ''that a collapse of A.I.G. would have had a very disruptive effect on the financial system and that everyone benefited from the rescue of A.I.G.'' Regarding his firm's own dealings with A.I.G., Mr. van Praag said that Goldman believed that its ''exposure was close to zero'' because it insulated itself from a downturn in A.I.G.'s fortunes through hedges and collateral it had already received. (Goldman's complete response is at www.nytimes.com/business.)
 The inspector noted in his report that Goldman made several arguments for why it believed it was not materially at risk in an A.I.G. default, but he is skeptical of the firm's reasoning.
 So is Janet Tavakoli, an expert in derivatives at Tavakoli Structured Finance, a consulting firm. ''On Sept. 16, 2008, David Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, said that whatever the outcome at A.I.G., the direct impact of Goldman's credit exposure would be immaterial,'' she said. ''That was false. The report states that if the New York Fed had negotiated concessions, Goldman would have suffered a loss.''
 The report says that Goldman would have had difficulty collecting on the hedges it used to insulate itself from an A.I.G. default because everyone's wallets would have been closing in a panic. 
 ''The prices of the collateralized debt obligations against which Goldman bought protection from A.I.G. were in sickening free fall, and the cost of replacing A.I.G.'s protection would have been sky-high,'' she said. ''Goldman must have known this, because it underwrote some of those value-destroying C.D.O.'s.''
 Ms. Tavakoli argues that Goldman should refund the money it received in the bailout and take back the toxic C.D.O.'s now residing on the Fed's books -- and to do so before it begins showering bonuses on its taxpayer-protected employees.
 ''A.I.G., a sophisticated investor, foolishly took this risk,'' she said. ''But the U.S. taxpayer never agreed to be a victim of investments that should undergo a rigorous audit.''
 Perhaps Mr. Barofsky will do that audit, and closely examine the securities that A.I.G. insured and that Wall Street titans like Goldman underwrote. 
 Goldman contends that it had a contractual right to the funds it received in the A.I.G. bailout and that the securities it returned to the government in the deal have increased in value.
 For his part, Mr. Geithner disputed much of the inspector general's findings. He also took issue with the conclusion that the Fed failed to develop a contingency plan for an A.I.G. rescue and largely depended on plans proffered by the banks themselves.
 He said the report's view that the Fed didn't use its might to get better terms in the rescue was unfair. ''This idea that we were unwilling to use leverage to get better terms misses the central reality of the situation -- the choice we had was to let A.I.G. default or to prevent default,'' he said. ''We could not enforce haircuts without causing selective defaults and selective defaults would have brought down the company.''
 Mr. Geithner also said that the ''perception that this decision by the government, not my decision alone, was made to protect any individual investment bank is unfounded.'' 
 Less than two weeks after the A.I.G. bailout, Mr. Geithner took Goldman's side when he criticized a Sept. 28, 2008, article in The New York Times that I wrote about the A.I.G. bailout. That article included Goldman's statement that it wouldn't have been affected by an A.I.G. collapse. Among other things, the article, like Mr. Barofsky's report, questioned Goldman's assertion. 
 According to an e-mail message that Goldman sent to the New York Fed at the time, Mr. Geithner talked about the article with Mr. Viniar, Goldman's chief financial officer, before calling me. When Mr. Geithner called, he said that Goldman had no exposure to an A.I.G. collapse and that the article had left an incorrect impression about that. When I asked Mr. Geithner if he, as head of the regulatory agency overseeing Goldman, had closely examined the firm's hedges, he said he had not.
 Mr. Geithner told me on Friday that he spoke with Mr. Viniar that day to ensure that Goldman's hedges were adequate. And, notwithstanding the inspector general's findings, he said he still believes Goldman was hedged. 
 Probing, in-depth analyses of regulatory responses to the financial meltdown are worth their weight in gold. Mr. Barofsky's certainly is. Yet in its rush to put financial reforms into effect, Congress seems uninterested in investigating or grappling with truths contained in such reports -- and until it does, our country's economic and financial system will continue to be at risk.

HEADLINE: Taking Taxpayers for a Ride

BYLINE: By EDWARD NIEDERMAYER. 
Edward Niedermayer is the editor of the Web site The Truth About Cars.

DATELINE: Portland, Ore. 

 BODY:
 GENERAL MOTORS raised more than a few eyebrows last week by announcing plans to repay what it describes as $6.7 billion in outstanding loans to taxpayers. So provocative was this announcement that it all but overshadowed the real news of the day: G.M. had lost $1.2 billion since exiting bankruptcy in July, and its fourth-quarter results were expected to be worse. 
 The company's chief executive, Fritz Henderson, called the repayment plan ''a personal commitment.'' The Obama administration, wardens of the 60 percent taxpayer stake in the company, declared itself ''encouraged'' by the news. Many commentators followed suit. But in the premature rush to herald the beginning of the end of the government's involvement in the auto industry, a number of key considerations were left out. 
 For starters, $6.7 billion doesn't begin to scratch the surface of what G.M. actually owes us. Over the past 12 months, the Treasury has given it some $52 billion in the form of cash, loans and the purchase of that 60 percent of the company's post-bankruptcy equity. And that number fails to take into account the two bailouts of G.M.'s former lending arm, GMAC, or the $3 billion spent on the ''cash for clunkers program,'' which doubtless kept the company from posting even deeper losses.
 Moreover, G.M. is not, in the strictest sense, paying back taxpayers at all. Rather, it is refunding $6.7 billion of an $18 billion escrow account that was given to it by the government when it emerged from bankruptcy. The rest of that account will be used to cover fourth-quarter losses (including $2.8 billion pledged for the rescue of G.M.'s major parts supplier, Delphi), repay loans from the Canadian government, and possibly prop up the automaker's shaky European operations. That escrow account is due to expire in June, at which time G.M. will repay what remains of the $6.7 billion from this week's pledge -- and then pocket the estimated $5.6 billion remainder. 
 In fairness, G.M. was clear up front that it would not be able to make the taxpayers whole through cash payments alone. Rightly so: for all the talk of slimmed-down cost structures and booming sales in China, G.M. isn't making any profit with which to repay its debts. 
 The big news here was Mr. Henderson's indication that he might have another way for his company to make things right: an initial public offering of G.M. equity. This, he says, could take place as soon as next year; it would not only free the government and G.M. from their souring embrace, but would also represent G.M.'s best and last opportunity to pay back the public.
 Unfortunately, any hope of an I.P.O. completely repaying taxpayers is wildly optimistic. Even before Mr. Henderson hinted at a timeline, a Government Accountability Office report pointed out that G.M. would have to attract a market capitalization of $66.9 billion for taxpayers to recoup the government's investment. Sorry, but that's a pipe dream: G.M. has never been worth more than $57 billion, and that was in the salad days of 2000. 
 Shortly after G.M.'s payback announcement, Ron Bloom, the head of President Obama's task force on the auto industry, provided more insight into the G.M. endgame. In relation to the public offering and the government's maintaining its equity share, he argued that ''private markets would like to see us exit this investment, and I think they will be more comfortable if we're on a sustained path out the door than if they think we're going to try to market-time it to maximize return.'' In short, even an official who negotiated the government's stake in G.M. has abandoned the taxpayer interest in favor of expedient withdrawal.
 Mr. Bloom's clear signal that the administration is jumping ship is especially galling in light of the frothy optimism generated by G.M.'s ''repayment'' announcement. If tens of billions in lost tax dollars is simply the inescapable price of preventing a systemic economic collapse, the White House should tell us so. Instead, it seems to be allowing the perception to settle that G.M. will repay its obligations, while all the while plans are formulated to sell off the taxpayer's portion of the company at any price. 
 It's tempting to think that the Obama administration understands the political explosiveness of huge taxpayer losses from an initial public offering and will move to mitigate them. But there may be stronger political winds pushing the White House to dump its stake. 
 For one thing, G.M.'s unexpected decision to not sell its German division, Opel, deeply embarrassed Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, a vital ally who happened to be in Washington when the surprise decision was announced. Berlin is now withdrawing some $2 billion in bridge loans to Opel. 
 More important, this month's off-year elections indicated that President Obama may have a political weaknesses on the issues of government spending and the economy. Maintaining a majority stake in a struggling G.M. as the 2012 election approaches will only increase the liability. If G.M. has to use taxpayer money to bail out Opel and Daewoo, its Korean division (which lost billions on currency speculation, no less), the issue of bailout money being sent abroad will undoubtedly be a campaign issue. 
 G.M.'s global interests are far too diverse for it to serve its taxpayer owners faithfully, and it can't afford to subjugate its business prerogatives to the political needs of its major shareholder in the White House. So, unless Americans develop a sudden obsession with G.M.'s $40,000 Volt electric car just in time for an I.P.O., taxpayers will be stuck with tens of billions of dollars in losses. 
 Afterward, while our government contemplates its runaway deficit and getting rid of its 8 percent of Chrysler's equity, perhaps we'll get an admission that General Motors still owes the American people. Without one, the relationship between the public and the automaker, and the Obama administration as well, may never be the same.

HEADLINE: L.P.G.A. Tour's Finale Suspended by Darkness

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Tex. 

 BODY:
Darkness chased Lorena Ochoa off the golf course Sunday before she was through, but she was not done. After making a bogey on the penultimate hole of a second round she had waited two days to start, Ochoa headed straight to the practice green and putted for several minutes.
 She did not have enough light to see the line, but that was beside the point. The top-ranked Ochoa needed time to regain her composure after another long and frustrating day at the L.P.G.A. Tour Championship at the Houstonian Golf & Country Club. 
 With one hole left in her second round, Ochoa is at six under par, which is where she stood Thursday night after a 66 gave her the tournament lead. While Ochoa stood in place Sunday, she was passed by two players, including Jiyai Shin, who is poised to end Ochoa's three-year reign as player of the year. 
 Shin, a 21-year-old rookie, is 8 points ahead of Ochoa in the rankings for player of the year, and one stroke ahead of her on the leader board. Playing in the group behind Ochoa, Shin made a birdie at No. 16 right before play was called because of darkness. 
 The tournament, which was shortened to 54 holes after two days of rain, is scheduled to crown a winner and the player of the year on Monday. The second round will be concluded, and a field reduced to the top 70 and ties will play another 18 holes.
 The leader in the clubhouse is the Texan Kristy McPherson, who is eight under par through 36 holes after carding a five-under 67 Sunday. 
 The contest for player of the year is riveting, not unlike the battle being waged between Edward Cullen and Jacob Black on the screens of a nearby movie theater for Bella Swan's heart. Stephenie Meyer, who wrote the books on which the blockbuster ''Twilight'' series is based, told Oprah Winfrey on her talk show that she was a little burned out on vampires. After this weekend, so is Cristie Kerr. 
 With a delay of more than 40 hours between her three-putt bogey on the ninth hole of her second round and her tee shot on the 10th, Kerr went to the movie ''The Twilight Saga: New Moon'' twice and started reading the third book, ''Eclipse.'' 
 Kerr is the dark horse in the player of the year race. She is third in the standings and can become the first American winner since Beth Daniel in 1994 if she wins and Shin and Ochoa finish outside the top nine. 
 After opening with a 72 in the worst of the weather Thursday, Kerr followed with a disjointed 69. She was at four under for the tournament as she stood on the fairway on her 18th hole, the par-4 ninth, visualizing a birdie opportunity. 
 The ground was so wet, it was like hitting off a sponge, and Kerr chunked the shot, then three-putted from the front of the green for a bogey. ''I'm a little angry at myself,'' she said.
 Standing five strokes off the lead after 36 holes, Kerr would usually feel well positioned for a title run. But with the tournament whittled to 54 holes, she says that any charge she can muster Monday will probably not be enough. 
 ''It's kind of a shame,'' Kerr said of the abbreviated tournament, ''especially with the player of the year race being this tight.'' She added, ''We can't get a break.'' 
 This tournament is emblematic of the luck of the L.P.G.A. in a year in which it has been hurt by the economy and internal storms. In July, a player revolt led to the resignation of the commissioner, Carolyn Bivens, on whose watch the L.P.G.A. was hemorrhaging sponsors and tournaments. 
 The event here lost its title sponsor when Allen Stanford of the Stanford Financial Group was arrested on fraud charges. Then came the abrupt withdrawals last week of Natalie Gulbis, who was ill, and Michelle Wie, who was injured.
 On Thursday night, shortly after Wie made her exit, the sky opened. Over the next 36 hours, rain drenched the course with one and a half inches of water. 
 After taking the first-round lead with a 66, Ochoa waited 72 hours to begin her second round. She was clearly not pleased with how the day ended, declining to talk to reporters before handing her putter to her caddie and stalking off into the night.

HEADLINE: Federal Government Faces Balloon in Debt Payments

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 The United States government is financing its more than trillion-dollar-a-year borrowing with i.o.u.'s on terms that seem too good to be true.
But that happy situation, aided by ultralow interest rates, may not last much longer. 
 Treasury officials now face a trifecta of headaches: a mountain of new debt, a balloon of short-term borrowings that come due in the months ahead, and interest rates that are sure to climb back to normal as soon as the Federal Reserve decides that the emergency has passed.
 Even as Treasury officials are racing to lock in today's low rates by exchanging short-term borrowings for long-term bonds, the government faces a payment shock similar to those that sent legions of overstretched homeowners into default on their mortgages.
 With the national debt now topping $12 trillion, the White House estimates that the government's tab for servicing the debt will exceed $700 billion a year in 2019, up from $202 billion this year, even if annual budget deficits shrink drastically. Other forecasters say the figure could be much higher. 
 In concrete terms, an additional $500 billion a year in interest expense would total more than the combined federal budgets this year for education, energy, homeland security and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 The potential for rapidly escalating interest payouts is just one of the wrenching challenges facing the United States after decades of living beyond its means. 
 The surge in borrowing over the last year or two is widely judged to have been a necessary response to the financial crisis and the deep recession, and there is still a raging debate over how aggressively to bring down deficits over the next few years. But there is little doubt that the United States' long-term budget crisis is becoming too big to postpone. 
 Americans now have to climb out of two deep holes: as debt-loaded consumers, whose personal wealth sank along with housing and stock prices; and as taxpayers, whose government debt has almost doubled in the last two years alone, just as costs tied to benefits for retiring baby boomers are set to explode.
 The competing demands could deepen political battles over the size and role of the government, the trade-offs between taxes and spending, the choices between helping older generations versus younger ones, and the bottom-line questions about who should ultimately shoulder the burden.
 ''The government is on teaser rates,'' said Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that advocates lower deficits. ''We're taking out a huge mortgage right now, but we won't feel the pain until later.''
 So far, the demand for Treasury securities from investors and other governments around the world has remained strong enough to hold down the interest rates that the United States must offer to sell them. Indeed, the government paid less interest on its debt this year than in 2008, even though it added almost $2 trillion in debt.
 The government's average interest rate on new borrowing last year fell below 1 percent. For short-term i.o.u.'s like one-month Treasury bills, its average rate was only sixteen-hundredths of a percent. 
 ''All of the auction results have been solid,'' said Matthew Rutherford, the Treasury's deputy assistant secretary in charge of finance operations. ''Investor demand has been very broad, and it's been increasing in the last couple of years.''
 The problem, many analysts say, is that record government deficits have arrived just as the long-feared explosion begins in spending on benefits under Medicare and Social Security. The nation's oldest baby boomers are approaching 65, setting off what experts have warned for years will be a fiscal nightmare for the government.
 ''What a good country or a good squirrel should be doing is stashing away nuts for the winter,'' said William H. Gross, managing director of the Pimco Group, the giant bond-management firm. ''The United States is not only not saving nuts, it's eating the ones left over from the last winter.''
 The current low rates on the country's debt were caused by temporary factors that are already beginning to fade. One factor was the economic crisis itself, which caused panicked investors around the world to plow their money into the comparative safety of Treasury bills and notes. Even though the United States was the epicenter of the global crisis, investors viewed Treasury securities as the least dangerous place to park their money.
 On top of that, the Fed used almost every tool in its arsenal to push interest rates down even further. It cut the overnight federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend reserves to one another, to almost zero. And to reduce longer-term rates, it bought more than $1.5 trillion worth of Treasury bonds and government-guaranteed securities linked to mortgages.
 Those conditions are already beginning to change. Global investors are shifting money into riskier investments like stocks and corporate bonds, and they have been pouring money into fast-growing countries like Brazil and China.
 The Fed, meanwhile, is already halting its efforts at tamping down long-term interest rates. Fed officials ended their $300 billion program to buy up Treasury bonds last month, and they have announced plans to stop buying mortgage-backed securities by the end of next March. 
 Eventually, though probably not until at least mid-2010, the Fed will also start raising its benchmark interest rate back to more historically normal levels.
 The United States will not be the only government competing to refinance huge debt. Japan, Germany, Britain and other industrialized countries have even higher government debt loads, measured as a share of their gross domestic product, and they too borrowed heavily to combat the financial crisis and economic downturn. As the global economy recovers and businesses raise capital to finance their growth, all that new government debt is likely to put more upward pressure on interest rates.
 Even a small increase in interest rates has a big impact. An increase of one percentage point in the Treasury's average cost of borrowing would cost American taxpayers an extra $80 billion this year -- about equal to the combined budgets of the Department of Energy and the Department of Education. 
 But that could seem like a relatively modest pinch. Alan Levenson, chief economist at T. Rowe Price, estimated that the Treasury's tab for debt service this year would have been $221 billion higher if it had faced the same interest rates as it did last year.
 The White House estimates that the government will have to borrow about $3.5 trillion more over the next three years. On top of that, the Treasury has to refinance, or roll over, a huge amount of short-term debt that was issued during the financial crisis. Treasury officials estimate that about 36 percent of the government's marketable debt -- about $1.6 trillion -- is coming due in the months ahead. 
 To lock in low interest rates in the years ahead, Treasury officials are trying to replace one-month and three-month bills with 10-year and 30-year Treasury securities. That strategy will save taxpayers money in the long run. But it pushes up costs drastically in the short run, because interest rates are higher for long-term debt. 
 Adding to the pressure, the Fed is set to begin reversing some of the policies it has been using to prop up the economy. Wall Street firms advising the Treasury recently estimated that the Fed's purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities pushed down long-term interest rates by about one-half of a percentage point. Removing that support could in itself add $40 billion to the government's annual tab for debt service. 
 This month, the Treasury Department's private-sector advisory committee on debt management warned of the risks ahead. 
 ''Inflation, higher interest rate and rollover risk should be the primary concerns,'' declared the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, a group of market experts that provide guidance to the government, on Nov. 4. 
 ''Clever debt management strategy,'' the group said, ''can't completely substitute for prudent fiscal policy.''
 Payback Time: Articles in this series will examine the consequences of, and attempts to deal with, growing public and private debts.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about ballooning debt payments for the federal government misspelled, in some copies, the surname of an economist who noted that the bill for debt service would be even higher were it not for current low interest rates. He is Alan Levenson, not Levinson. And a chart with the continuation of the article misstated, in some editions, the size of debt payments due within a year that are currently paying no more than 1 percent in interest. It is $1.9 trillion, not $2.5 trillion.

EMILIO FLORES FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (pg.A4) CHARTS: THE DEBT BUILDUP: The federal government's debt, stoked for years by deficit spending, has surged because of the economic crisis. Debt is now approaching World War II levels, and more than $1.6 trillion is due in coming months. Low interest rates have made financing the debt less expensive. But when interest rates begin to rise, the government will face problems similar to those of homebuyers who took out mortgages with teaser rates that jump after one or two years.
RUNNING UP THE TAB: Debt as a percentage of gross domestic product
A BALLOON OF SHORT-TERM I.O.U'S COMING DUE: Historically, the government has tried to limit its short-term debt -- Treasury bills that are due from 30 days to one year -- to less than 25 percent of its overall issuance. But the financial crisis created a sudden large need for cash, and short-term debt soared to 36 percent of the government's much-bigger portfolio. More than $1.6 trillion is due by March 31 alone. Replacing any of that with longer-term bonds will require paying higher interest rates.
SOARING PAYMENTS: Much of the debt is currently financed at low interest rates, so payments are very low compared with historical levels.
THE CREDITORS: The government has used annual Social Security surpluses and the contributions to the pension plans of civil service employees and military personnel to finance the debt. When Social Security begins running deficits, as it is expected to do in a few years, or the pension plans need their money, the government will have to raise taxes to pay the benefits, or cut them. Most of the debt has been financed by issuing securities, which pay interest. Nearly half of these securities have been bought by foreign governments. In fiscal year 2009, foreign governments increased their investments by $700 billion to $3.5 trillion. With the debt piling up, however, they may become reluctant to continue lending.

HEADLINE: In Mississippi Delta, A Promising Summer Washed Away by the Fall

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Miss. 

 BODY:
It was a long day for John Hart, a farmer in the hills just east of the Mississippi Delta. 
 An insurance company had decreed that, though Mr. Hart's crop of soybeans and rice was ruined, he would have to harvest it and haul it to a salvage company for pennies on the dollar. For that, Mr. Hart needed to borrow a truck that was 70 miles away. By the time he got back to his field, the sky was so dark that a shooting star whizzed across it like a thick smear of crayon. 
 But that was just a minor setback compared with what he and other Southern farmers have been through this year. In August, they thought they had a bumper crop -- the best they had seen in years. It was the kind of crop that could put you ahead, for once. Pay off that combine.
 But just as the harvest began in September, it began to rain, and it kept raining through October, normally one of the driest months here. The soybeans shriveled and blackened with mold. The rice keeled over into the mud. The cotton hardened into tight little spitballs. The sweet potatoes rotted underground. When the combines could get into the fields, they scarred them with deep ruts that will make next year's planting more expensive. 
 Last year, with commodity prices running at record highs, farming across the nation seemed to be bucking the recession. This year, with the rest of the country in a slow recovery from a man-made disaster, nature forced a crash of its own in the South.
 ''I was counting my money until September,'' Mr. Hart said. ''I don't know whether I'm going to be able to farm another year or not.''
 In the pitch black of the night, Mr. Hart's hired hand and a friend, Edmond Clark, who were waiting to help, informed Mr. Hart that the dew had already come. The ruined beans were too wet to harvest that night. 
 For the thousandth time, Mr. Hart, 61, asked himself why he had come back home more than three decades ago from Chicago, where he was a lathe operator, to farm the family land where he grew up. 
 ''You just keep going,'' he said, forced to live for the most part off his wife's salary as a nurse. ''She knows that's all I like to do.''
 The rainy autumn has made it clear that farmers across the Delta will lose money this year. But for smaller farmers in the area like Mr. Hart, who owns or rents about 1,000 acres, and Mr. Clark, with about 600 acres, the question is whether they will be able to go on. 
 The rain has affected farmers in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, eastern Arkansas and parts of Louisiana. Mississippi and Georgia have requested disaster declarations from the United States Department of Agriculture, and Alabama is likely to follow suit. But help from Washington, in the form of low-interest loans, often takes a year or more to reach the farmers who need it. 
 Lester Spell Jr., the Mississippi commissioner of agriculture and commerce, has asked Congress and the Agriculture Department to speed up the process, saying in a news release, ''I fear many of our hardworking Mississippi farmers will no longer be able to operate due to the excessive losses faced this year.''
 Mr. Spell cited losses of more than 40 percent of the state's soybean crop, almost 50 percent of the cotton and more than 60 percent of the sweet potatoes. 
 For Mr. Hart and his friends, the specter of failure has a double burden because they are among the few black farmers to have survived years of discriminatory policies by the federal Farm Services Administration, which were detailed in a successful class action lawsuit. As part of the settlement in 1999, the Agriculture Department admitted that it had for decades made it harder for black farmers to get loans.
 ''John grew up on the farm; I grew up on the farm,'' Mr. Clark said. ''We've both seen our parents struggle to hold onto this land.'' 
 Mr. Clark has also been touched by the recession. Last month, his wife was laid off from her job at a day care center. 
 In December, the land rents are due for next year, but without a crop, the farmers may have no money to pay, and larger farmers will snap up their acreage. Mr. Clark predicted that small black farmers would be unable to return. ''If I get out of it,'' said Mr. Clark, who rents mostly from black landowners, ''this land is gone.''
 The threat of losing the family land is very real for black and white farmers alike, who have seen generational cycles of prosperity and bankruptcy, of new farmhouses and equipment sold on the auction block. Taylor Flowers Jr., 36, farms land in Coahoma County, where tufts of cotton pile up on the road shoulders. The land was lost by his mother's family and bought by his father's, all before his parents married. 
 It is not just that farming is in their blood. Farmers keep on navigating the complicated algebra of seed costs and bank loans, commodity markets and fuel prices, because there is little alternative. 
 ''I've got a college education, I've got a degree in ag business,'' Mr. Flowers said. ''But I don't know, if I had to quit, what I'd go do. There's not many jobs out there right now.''
 Homer Luckett, 54, another Coahoma farmer, said he had lost about all he could stand. 
 ''I'm hoping that the people that I owe will let me spread it out over two or three years,'' he said. ''I don't mind quitting, but I don't want to have to quit. I'm in debt, but I'd like to be able to farm my way out of debt.''
 On the dashboard of his truck, Allen C. Evans III, a farmer near Clarksdale, has a sheaf of receipts from the grain elevator, showing the damage levels of each load of soybeans: 39.9 percent, 67.9 percent, 51.8 percent. A born fretter, he is afraid to call, he said, to find out the final reckoning of the disastrous season. 
 ''You're just kind of walking around like a zombie,'' Mr. Evans said, ''saying, never could I have guessed that the best crop I've ever raised in my entire life -- the one I never worried about -- of all the crops to have taken away from us, how can this be the one?'' 
 In the Delta, those elevator receipts have become talismans of the times. Michael Patterson, who helps pay for his farming with the proceeds from his grain hauling company, displayed one showing a farmer who brought in 1,110 bushels of soybeans, but got paid for 11. The rest were damaged. 
 That farmer was distraught, Mr. Patterson said. 
 ''You don't want to be the generation,'' he said, ''that loses the family farm.''

HEADLINE: Does a Teacher Own the Lesson Plan?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Selling Lesson Plans Online, Teachers Raise Cash and Questions'' (front page, Nov. 15):
 Lesson planning was my downfall two years ago when I was a first-year English teacher in Camden, N.J. Each Sunday night I was expected to submit by computer my lesson plans for the coming week, including daily procedures and objectives for each class. I bemoaned that the lesson plans of the many English teachers who had preceded me and worked with the same curriculum were unavailable to me.
 I previously worked for a medical education company where all concepts and strategies belonged to the funding sources that paid the employees' salaries. Because we weren't expected to waste time reinventing the wheel, we were given access to the best ideas and practices. Yet as a public school teacher, I was told by the head of my department that teachers own their plans. 
 Well, taxpayers are the funding sources of public schools, so taxpayers own the ideas of the district faculty. No teacher should have to buy an effective lesson plan, let alone struggle to reinvent one.
 Ann F. Hale Collingswood, N.J., Nov. 15, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The teacher who downloads lesson plans for $3 should not be surprised when her students turn in essays that they downloaded for a comparable price.
 But is this really what it means to teach and learn?
 Sara Brock New York, Nov. 15, 2009

 To the Editor:
 Try as I might, I cannot recall taking a vow of poverty when I became a teacher. Nor can I remember ever being compensated for the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of hours I've put in on weekends, evenings and vacations. 
 Teachers continually develop and tweak lessons, often on their own time and without the use of district resources, to reach an increasingly diverse and sophisticated population of learners. The fact that we are willing to pay for lessons superior to the curriculums bought by our school districts doesn't cheapen what we do; it raises it to a new level of commitment.
 Creative and dedicated teachers trying to supplement their pitiful salaries by exercising some entrepreneurial spirit ought to be encouraged. Or are we, as members of a female-dominated profession, somehow excluded from the rules and laws of capitalism?
 If we're going to accuse anyone of undermining education, perhaps we should begin with those who justify paying a salary that is in no way commensurate with the education, experience, time and responsibility required of teachers.
 Kerry Dunigan San Francisco, Nov. 15, 2009
 To the Editor:
 The exchange of ideas is a powerful tool for promoting excellence in the classroom. And we must have accomplished teachers who can act as mentors. Proven lesson plans, approaches to teaching, learning activities and materials, whether for sale online or discussed in the teachers' room, will only promote better teaching. 
 Why do we care whether the information attained by interested teachers is free or not? The point is in the sharing.
 Mel Senator Norwalk, Conn., Nov. 15, 2009
 The writer is an adjunct professor of history and teacher education at Norwalk Community College and Sacred Heart University.
 To the Editor:
 If Erica Bohrer, one of the teachers discussed in your article, had published 20 elementary-school mathematics lessons as a textbook, she would have been praised as a professional contributing to her field. 
 While the Internet has changed the way we share ideas, it has clearly not changed the backward idea that a teacher should labor selflessly without the dignity of claiming authorship of her own work.
 James Stillwaggon Brooklyn, Nov. 15, 2009
 The writer is an assistant professor of educational theory at Iona College.
 To the Editor:
 Teaching in public school is not a market-based endeavor. Excellent lessons should be shared for the common good of the student, not the private gain of the teacher. 
 Unfortunately, injecting market-based greed into our profession is becoming more common. Charter-school teachers sometimes negotiate salaries individually. In that environment, the incentive is to save your best practice for your own classroom. 
 Districts compete with these charter schools for limited resources, and now even entire states are competing for limited Race to the Top stimulus dollars.
 I'm not sure how our lawmakers turned the data-based accountability movement into a movement for market-based competition to improve our schools. Based on data available from our crumbling economy, market-based competition and greed have not improved accountability on Wall Street. There is no reason to believe that greed will serve our children any better.

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 Recession Siphons 
 Area's '50s Vibe
 Many New Yorkers have not heard of Royal Ranch -- an enclave of five or six streets on a hill in the farthest reaches of northeast Queens -- and the residents like it that way. 
 The postage-stamp neighborhood, near the Nassau County border, was built as a development of one-family ranch houses in 1954. And to this day, that 1950s ambience is what Rhonda Kontner, the president of the local civic association and the program director of a nearby special-education school, loves most.
 The enclave is best embodied by the Royal Ranch Club, a grand name for the simple outdoor pool that homeowners built in 1960. Long the prize of the neighborhood, the pool is falling victim to the recession. 
 In an interview, Ms. Kontner, 55, expressed worry that the downturn is also accelerating another change in the neighborhood: the increasingly detached, work-focused vibe of its residents. 
 Q. What's it like to live here?
 A. It's a small residential community. I moved here in 1987, and raised my three kids here. A lot of us had small children growing up. The pool gave us an opportunity to meet our neighbors. We used to hang out at the pool. Our children were small, we had summer camp at the pool, and the pool was the focal point that really bonded us. Unlike today. A lot of the new people moving in are not that interested in the pool, and as a result we've had to take in other people from outside the community to be financially solvent. They pay $600 a season. For us, we pay off a bond over a time period, and we also pay maintenance, $400. There are approximately 55 shareholder-members, the local homeowners, and about 55 outside members.
 Q. Has the recession added to the challenge of maintaining the pool?
 A. Yes. Some of my older neighbors have dropped out of the pool after being members for over 20 years, and they cited the fact that they can't afford the dues.
 Q. How else is the neighborhood changing?
 A. About five years ago, we found out that one of our blocks was mistakenly zoned for two-family houses. It was a big zoning battle. There was a compromise that said they could only build two-family detached houses. Almost that entire block has become two-family houses, very radically changed from everything else in the surrounding area. It's brought a lot more density, more parking, more cars, more everything. It's become a little more transient.
 Q. Is that transience increased by the downturn, too, with landlords under more pressure to increase income and tenants having to move?
 A. Yes. People are moving in and out more, and you don't get a sense of who those neighbors are. We'd like to see these people as part of the neighborhood. We think our neighborhood is a wonderful place. We're only sad that times have changed, and it's not living in the 1950s.

HEADLINE: Amnesty List Puts Pressure On President Of Pakistan

BYLINE: By SAHAR HABIB GHAZI and SABRINA TAVERNISE; Sahar Habib Ghazi reported from Islamabad, and Sabrina Tavernise from Lahore.

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
In another blow to Pakistan's president, Asif Ali Zardari, the authorities this weekend released the names of politicians, many from his own party, who benefited from an amnesty decree that dismissed past alleged crimes. 
 The decree, known as the National Reconciliation Ordinance, was issued in 2007 by former President Pervez Musharraf as part of a political deal to allow Mr. Zardari's wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, to return from years of exile to Pakistan. 
 But it was applied broadly, with thousands of bureaucrats, diplomats and government officials benefiting from the change; on Saturday, the minister of state for law and justice, Mohammad Afzal Sandhu, revealed a list of over 8,000 names. 
 Close to half of the politicians have had cases of corruption, money laundering, misuse of authority and criminal charges dropped against them since 2007. All but a handful were from Sindh Province, home to many in Mr. Zardari's Pakistan Peoples Party.
 The revelation, though not unexpected, puts more pressure on the embattled Mr. Zardari, who has been fighting for his political survival in recent months. An increasingly distant leader who is dogged by corruption cases, Mr. Zardari has come under attack from the powerful Pakistani establishment, an alliance of parts of the military and the news media, who want him gone.
 Mr. Zardari was thrust into the limelight after the death of his wife in December 2007.
 Still, it is far from clear that the amnesty decree, which will expire Saturday, will deal the decisive blow. As president, Mr. Zardari has political immunity, and many analysts argue that despite his unpopularity there is no constitutional way to push him out. 
 ''He's a man nobody likes, but the fact is, he is the president of the most important political party, which was popularly elected,'' said Pervez Tahir, chairman of the economics department at Foreman Christian College in the eastern city of Lahore.
 The Pakistani news media reported that several top politicians -- including Mr. Zardari; Rehman Malik, the interior minister; Ahmed Mukhtar, the defense minister; Hussain Haqqani, the ambassador to the United States; and Wajid Shamsul Hassan, the ambassador to Britain -- were on the Law Ministry's list, which covered cases between Jan. 1, 1986, and Oct. 12, 1999.
 Despite the release of the list, a number of beneficiaries, including Mr. Haqqani and Mr. Hassan, have denied that they had made use of the decree.
 In summer, Pakistan's Supreme Court ruled that the decree had to be passed by Parliament to be binding, but a chorus of lawmakers from all major parties, including Mr. Zardari's coalition partners, said they would reject it. Mr. Zardari's party decided not to bring it to a vote. 
 Many of the political leaders, including Mr. Zardari, say the cases against them, many of which have been pending for years, are politically motivated. 
 ''If they are politically motivated cases, you should be able to defend them in an independent court of law,'' said Ahsan Iqbal, a member of the Pakistan Muslim League-N, Mr. Zardari's political opposition. ''Why should there be any reluctance?''

HEADLINE: Under Scrutiny, Rangel Is Frayed but Defiant

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ and JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
On the House floor during a debate over health care reform, he taunted a colleague who had been calling for his ouster. At a recent fund-raiser, he complained that the House speaker had made an end run around him and his committee. Confronted by a persistent conservative activist in a hallway, he let loose an expletive, telling the man to mind his own business.
 There seems to be little joy in being Representative Charles B. Rangel these days. 
 As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel, the proud and normally irrepressible clubhouse Democrat from Harlem, holds one of the most powerful positions in Congress. But as an ethics investigation into his financial dealings continues, Mr. Rangel's once-considerable clout is diminished and his spirits are often gloomy, friends and associates say, even as he begins to fight back. 
 Concerned that Republicans intend to use Mr. Rangel's problems to cast Democrats as ethically lax -- and unwilling to confront corruption in their own ranks -- some Democrats are quietly edging away from him. House leaders have circumvented him on some major issues, including climate change and, to a lesser extent, health care. 
 Donors, who once flocked to him, are not giving as freely. Officials at the White House have expressed fears that Mr. Rangel's problems -- one aide called them an ''ethics anvil'' -- could hurt some of the party's candidates in next year's midterm elections.
 At home, he faces a crop of potential challengers, leaving him confronting what could be the biggest threat to his position in the nearly 40 years since he unseated Adam Clayton Powell Jr., a civil rights figure who was embroiled in his own ethics scandal. Among those lining up to challenge him are Vince Morgan, a former aide to Mr. Rangel, and Adam Clayton Powell IV, a state assemblyman from Harlem who is a son of Mr. Rangel's predecessor.
 Now, after months of what friends say was his slowness to grasp the severity of his situation, Mr. Rangel, a decorated Korean War veteran, has begun a counteroffensive.
 He has hired new Washington-based public relations consultants to help him and his legal team shape a message as he awaits the outcome of the ethics investigation. 
 He has reactivated his old campaign organization in Harlem to prepare for a potentially difficult election, doing so at the insistence of the veteran Harlem political strategist Bill Lynch, who has taken charge of the operation. He has summoned his old senior adviser, George Henry, from retirement to oversee his Congressional offices. And at age 79, Mr. Rangel has even begun a blog (''Blogging with Charlie'') and opened a Twitter account (''Did you catch me on TMZ?'' he once wrote, referring to his appearance on the celebrity news program).
 His public position has been to ask voters to withhold judgment until the investigations are complete. When pressed, Mr. Rangel, who declined a formal interview for this article, strikes a defiant if exasperated tone.
 ''Are you a psychiatrist?'' he said the other day when asked at a public appearance if he was concerned about retaining his chairmanship.
 He went on to suggest that his position on Capitol Hill remained strong, noting that both President Obama and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, congratulated him on his committee's role in shaping the health care legislation approved by the House this month. 
 ''President called me and said I did a great job; Pelosi called me and said I did a great job,'' he said. ''I'm doing a great job.''
 He also expressed confidence that his name would be cleared by investigations he initially called for, blaming his trouble on unfair news coverage. ''My credibility has never been challenged except by a couple of reporters,'' he said.
 His aides insist that he is no less influential than other House committee chairmen under the centralized leadership style of Ms. Pelosi.
 Nonetheless, Mr. Rangel is taking no chances, barnstorming his district as if he were a candidate who is down in the polls, attending rallies, visiting church groups and regularly checking in with local business and political leaders.
 ''The dude just ate a fish sandwich at my political club,'' said Keith L. T. Wright, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Manhattan and a state assemblyman.
 Bracing for a fight over keeping his chairmanship, he and his team of advisers are monitoring his support among two important Democratic blocs on Capitol Hill that could determine his fate: members of the conservative Blue Dog Coalition, a group he has plied with campaign funds over the years, and the Congressional Black Caucus, an organization he helped found and a vital part of the coalition that delivered Ms. Pelosi the speakership.
 After consulting with Mr. Rangel and his team, the black caucus inserted itself into the situation, sending a letter to Ms. Pelosi, urging support for him. 
 So far, Ms. Pelosi has not sought to strip him of his chairmanship, arguing the ethics process must be allowed to play out. But many senior Democrats say Ms. Pelosi will come under pressure to take a stand as the election campaign gets underway next year and Republicans step up efforts to make Mr. Rangel a symbol of the Democrat's failure to set new ethical standards.
 Brendan Daly, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, said she continued to appreciate Mr. Rangel's contribution, especially on health care. He said she was reserving judgment on the accusations against Mr. Rangel until the investigations conclude.
 ''He is very well liked and respected throughout the caucus,'' Mr. Daly said, ''and that's why it's a difficult thing for people.''
 Mr. Rangel, who appears to have lost weight, occasionally shares with friends the emotional toll all of it is taking on him. ''He didn't seem so much concerned about himself as much as the impact this had on his children and his wife,'' said City Councilwoman Inez E. Dickens of Harlem, recounting a recent visit to his home. 
 By Mr. Rangel's own telling, he had a charmed rise from the streets of Harlem to one of the most powerful perches in Congress.
 His seat is considered one of the safest in Congress, a gift from Nelson A. Rockefeller, a patron who, as governor, handed Mr. Rangel a pencil and allowed him to determine the lines of his own district in the early '70s as repayment for the up-and-coming congressman's support, according to Mr. Rangel's 2007 memoir, ''And I Haven't Had a Bad Day Since.''
 He gained admission to the coveted Ways and Means Committee in part through another patron, Hugh L. Carey, who agreed to help secure Mr. Rangel a spot on the panel in exchange for the congressman's backing in that year's governor's race. 
 Once he became the committee's chairman, when Democrats won control of the House in the 2006 election, Mr. Rangel became a fund-raising magnet, attracting donations from a cross section of industries with a stake in the work of Ways and Means.
 Mr. Rangel has been under investigation by the House ethics committee since last year, when The New York Times reported that he rented four rent-stabilized apartments in Harlem for thousands of dollars per month below market value, despite a rule forbidding members to accept gifts worth more than $50.
 The ethics committee inquiry -- also looking into whether he improperly used his office to raise money for an academic center named for him -- later expanded to include unreported taxable income from a villa he owns in the Dominican Republic. 
 Last month, the ethics committee expanded its inquiry yet again after he amended his financial disclosure statements to account forhundreds of thousands of dollars in income and assets that he failed to initially report. 
 In the meantime, his influence has been greatly diminished on several fronts, members of both parties say.
 Democratic fund-raisers say the ethical allegations have left many donors reluctant to give him money (his aides blamed the weak economy for the 45 percent drop-off in his fund-raising in this election cycle).
 Over the summer, he was largely sidelined as Ms. Pelosi and Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, negotiated crucial sections of a health care bill with the White House and the Blue Dog Coalition of fiscally conservative Democrats. 
 At another point, Ms. Pelosi appeared to undercut him when she maneuvered to replace Mr. Rangel's proposal for an income tax increase to help pay for the health care bill with a plan for a tax increase that would kick in at higher income levels. ''She's never discussed it with me,'' Mr. Rangel said at the time. 
 Ms. Pelosi also largely bypassed Mr. Rangel and his committee on a climate change bill that the House took up in the spring. Ms. Pelosi had Mr. Waxman's committee write the bill and then moved it to the House floor with only cursory consideration from Mr. Rangel's committee, though it had jurisdiction over the tax provisions of the bill.
 ''I can't believe that the Ways and Means Committee lets Nancy Pelosi determine what's in a bill,'' said Dan Rostenkowski, the former chairman of Ways and Means who was forced out and jailed after being indicted in 1994 on corruption charges. He noted that he continued to play the dominant role in President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994 even as he was being served with subpoenas. 
 At a fund-raiser attended by utility industry executives this year, Mr. Rangel complained that the way in which Ms. Pelosi pushed the energy bill through the House had effectively left his committee on the sidelines, a comment that surprised some in the room for its bluntness, said one attendee who spoke condition of anonymity. Ms. Pelosi was taken aback to learn afterward about his comments, according to two associates who spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they did not want to be seen as betraying a confidence.
 Matthew Beck, a spokesman for Mr. Rangel, said with the congressman focused on health care, he allowed Mr. Waxman's committee to take the lead on the bill. He said that Mr. Rangel did not have enough of a consensus to move any legislation out of the committee within the time frame Ms. Pelosi had set, but that he had plenty of input in the bill produced by Mr. Waxman.
 Mr. Rangel showed signs of frustration with his situation when, unprompted, he lashed out at Representative John A. Boehner, the Republican leader, on the House floor as the chamber debated health care legislation two weeks ago. When Mr. Boehner tried to get Mr. Rangel's agreement on a particular provision, Mr. Rangel sarcastically asked Mr. Boehner why he would trust his word, alluding to Mr. Boehner's repeated calls for his ouster.
 ''I think he might have been blindsided by some of this,'' said Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, who said he thought any transgressions by Mr. Rangel were inadvertent.

HEADLINE: Feeding a Hunger for Skills, and Finding a Future

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WILSON

 BODY:
This year, the numbers of those feeling themselves among the neediest have stretched, like the wallets of the city itself. To the ranks of those who have needed food, or clothing, or a place to live, or a prosthetic limb, or an electric wheelchair, add Dion Lewis. He needed a job. He needed training he could not afford. He needed to have his daughter see him reach a goal by sheer, stubborn persistence. 
 Her name is Shardei Lewis, 18, and it's just the two of them in the apartment in Weeksville, Brooklyn. He tears up a little, sometimes, when he talks about her, but he doesn't talk down to her as if she's a child. ''I never stopped letting her know that it's not all peaches and cream,'' he said. 
 Mr. Lewis, 39, had a seasonal job last year at Battery Park City Parks Conservancy, as a maintenance worker. The agency let him go for the winter, but Mr. Lewis was intrigued by what he had learned on the job about green technology, and he attended a lecture at the New York City College of Technology late last year. A speaker described a training class. 
 ''I didn't want to embarrass myself in front of the class, so I followed her to her car,'' Mr. Lewis recalled. ''I asked, 'How can one get funding for this if they can't afford it?' '' The speaker, Wendy Fleischer, a sustainability project manager from Pratt Center for Community Development, told him to keep in touch. 
 He did, and she directed him to another agency, the Fifth Avenue Committee in Brooklyn, which in turn pointed him to the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. In March, the agency paid Mr. Lewis's $1,245 tuition for training to become a building analyst. The course was taught at Bronx Community College, where Mr. Lewis learned how to analyze a building for its energy efficiency. 
 He was immediately fascinated. ''Learning is like air, like food,'' he said. ''To me, this is like a second chance on life. So I'm so hungry.'' 
 He has made mistakes that he has vowed never to repeat. He was arrested twice out of state for selling drugs when he was 19 and 23, ''trying to put food on the table,'' he said. He has been working ever since. 
 He learned to weatherize a house, starting with the doors and windows. He learned how to operate a blower door, a tool that measures how airtight a building is after the rest of the house is sealed. 
 During the course, the students took a field trip to an apartment building on West 158th Street in Washington Heights. Once again, he waited before making his move on the sidewalk: The class met the contractor, Leroy Anthony, with the Community Environmental Center, and when Mr. Lewis saw an opportunity, he stepped forward and asked for a business card. 
 ''I called Leroy,'' he said. ''Persistent, persistent. I've seen the future, where this is going. The world is getting a makeover.'' 
 Finally a job opened up for Mr. Lewis in September. He has worked in buildings in Flatbush, Canarsie and Bushwick, Brooklyn, and in Ozone Park, Queens, and a visit in October found him working at the very same building his class visited on the field trip. 
 The sprinkler system had turned on and damaged the walls. Mr. Lewis, dressed head to toe in a white protective suit and wearing a mask, was part of a team pumping GreenFiber insulation into the walls. 
 The job got him off unemployment. He pays $479.73 a month in rent for an apartment that has been in the family for most of his life, but he fell behind in payments and said he was struggling to catch up. 
 His training was a blessing and a curse: Now he could see everything wrong with his own apartment: the mold behind the walls, the lead in the paint. ''You never look straight ahead anymore,'' he said. ''You look up, side to side. I don't take anything for granted anymore. It's like the matrix has been revealed to me.'' 
 He hopes to one day start his own company and call it Green Life Maintenance. ''The only way I can show my gratitude,'' he said, ''is to employ someone who's taken the same path I have.''

HEADLINE: Daniel Rowen, an Architect Who Favored Modernism, Dies at 56

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Daniel Rowen, a highly regarded architect whose modernist designs for houses, apartments and commercial spaces attracted a number of prominent clients, died on Nov. 17 in Manhattan. He was 56.
 The cause was neuroendocrine cancer, his wife, Coco Myers, said. 
 For more than a decade Mr. Rowen was the principal of Daniel Rowen Architect, which had offices in Manhattan and, beginning in 2003, East Hampton, N.Y., where he lived. 
 His high-profile projects included the sprawling headquarters for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia in the vast Starrett-Lehigh Building, on 26th Street between 11th and 12th Avenues in Manhattan. Mr. Rowen preserved the openness of the loftlike space while creating elegant work environments within it.
 Mr. Rowen was a protege of the modernist architect Charles Gwathmey, who died in August. In 1984 he formed a partnership with Frank Lupo, who had also worked under Mr. Gwathmey. Mr. Lupo recalled one of Mr. Rowen's favorite projects: a Park Avenue apartment that was entirely white and practically devoid of furniture. ''The clients wanted a Zen environment in the middle of Manhattan, wiped clean of any domesticity,'' Mr. Lupo said.
 One area of the home, with a low glass-top table, was designated Space No. 1; another, with a raised sculpture platform, was Space No. 2; a third area, with white pallets in a closet, was Space No. 3. ''This is not the apartment to hunker down in with a long book on a cold winter night,'' Mr. Rowen said in an interview with The New York Times in 1996, ''but it probably is a good place to listen to music.'' 
 Daniel Jared Rowen was born in Washington, the youngest of three children of Hobart Rowen, who became the chief economics correspondent of The Washington Post, and Alice Stadler Rowen. He attended architecture school at Yale, then worked for Gwathmey Siegel & Associates before he and Mr. Lupo started their firm, New York Architects.
 The partners' first project was an office for the art dealer Larry Gagosian. For Mr. Rowen that began a decades-long relationship with Mr. Gagosian that culminated this year with two projects for him on Madison Avenue: a large addition to his uptown gallery and a new Gagosian store.
 In 1999 an apartment designed by Mr. Rowen and Mr. Lupo was included in ''The Un-Private House,'' a show at the Museum of Modern Art. The apartment, dating to the 1980s, had electronics that were ahead of their time, the museum's catalog said.
 Mr. Rowen also created a minimalist office for the hotelier Ian Schrager as well as a luxurious apartment, in collaboration with Philippe Starck, for Mr. Schrager's family on Central Park West. ''He was working on an addition to my house on Long Island when he died,'' Mr. Schrager said in a telephone interview on Thursday. 
 Another Rowen-Lupo project was an austere white office on Lexington Avenue for Osho International, a company that owned the copyright to works by an Indian mystic. Mr. Rowen described one feature, of translucent glass, acid-etched on one side and polished like a mirror on the other, as a ''soft, glowing wall.''
 He married Ms. Myers, a writer and editor, in 1993, after they met on a blind date. The wedding was the subject of a ''Vows'' column in The Times, which began: ''Few people believed that Daniel Rowen would ever marry. A talkative, analytical architect in his late 30s who races vintage cars, he has for the past five years been the host of a men-only party in celebration of bachelorhood.''
 The couple had three children, Max, Harrison and Jensen. They also survive him, as do his sister, Judith Vereker of London, and his brother, James, of Milwaukee.

HEADLINE: They Chose Celebrity

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
Before the 2008 election, almost nobody outside Alaska and Arkansas had heard of Sarah Palin or Mike Huckabee. But in a long and crowded campaign season, they were the only Republican politicians who inspired any genuine enthusiasm.
 They had other things in common as well. Both came from lower-middle-class backgrounds, and joined a soft-edged social conservatism to a strong populist streak. Both had been considered pragmatists, rather than ideologues, as governors of their home states. Both were untainted by the failures of the Bush-era Republican Party. 
 And both had the same Achilles' heel: They seemed unready for high office, and owed their appeal more to personality than to substance. 
 This meant that both faced the same post-election choice. Did they want to take their newfound eminence seriously? Or did they want to cash in on their celebrity?
 For Palin, the serious path required at least serving out her term as governor before returning to the national stage. For Huckabee, it could have involved anything from starting a think tank to running for the Senate in 2010. For both, it would have meant wedding their political identity to ideas as well as attitudes.
 So far, they've chosen celebrity instead. Huckabee spent the last year hamming it up on a weekly talk show, and the last month hawking a book of inspirational Christmas stories. As for Palin -- well, you probably know what she's been up to lately.
 Nobody should begrudge them their choices. Think tanks are a snooze; Senate races are a grind. Signing autographs for your adoring fans is more fun than rounding up budget votes in Juneau. 
 But they were the wrong moves if either wanted to become president someday. Huckabee's gabfest is a weekly reaffirmation of the rap that he's too lightweight for the Oval Office. Palin has sealed her identity as a culture-war lightning rod: she can inspire hysteria from liberals (ably catalogued in Matthew Continetti's ''Persecution of Sarah Palin'') and adulation from conservatives (visible at every stop along her book tour), but she's unlikely to persuade anyone in the middle to trust her with the reins of government.
 It's possible to be a celebrity and a serious politician at the same time: Barack Obama's career proves as much. But Obama's celebrity status is frequently a political liability, and he's (usually) wise enough to know it. That's why he plays the wonk as often as he plays the global icon.
 For now, no Republican leader projects a similar level of seriousness. Late in the Bush years, it was easy to dismiss conservatism as brain-dead. Among policy thinkers, that isn't true anymore: the advent of Obama seems to have provided just the jolt that right-of-center wonks needed. But innovative proposals are useless without politicians willing to champion them.
 When the Republican minority needed an alternative to the Obama administration's sweeping stimulus proposal, for instance, a number of free-market economists were ready with an answer: a payroll tax cut. It was plausible, elegant and easy to explain -- but there was no Republican leader with the wit to seize on it and sell it.
 You could tell the same story about regulatory reform. A slew of conservative economists and think tankers, led by the University of Chicago's Luigi Zingales and the Manhattan Institute's Nicole Gelinas, have been working on ways to protect free markets from a re-run of last fall's ''too big to fail'' fiasco. But most Republican politicians would rather rail against bailouts that have already happened than talk about how to prevent them from happening again.
 In the health care debate, too, conservative and libertarian policy thinkers have floated a number of plans to expand insurance coverage. Some are incremental and some are sweeping; some build on the existing system and some would essentially replace it. But any of them would be better than that threadbare plan House Republicans actually put forward, which would hardly expand coverage at all.
 True, these ideas won't sell millions of books, or excite the crowd on Huckabee's talk show. But they're what the Republican Party needs if it's going to be more than just a brake on liberalism's ambitions. And they're what voters are going to be looking for, in 2012 and beyond, as proof that conservatives can be trusted once again.
 This means that there are substantial political rewards awaiting the politician who becomes the voice of an intellectually vigorous conservatism. It probably won't be Mike Huckabee or Sarah Palin. If Republicans are lucky, though, it will be somebody who shares their charisma -- but who prefers the responsibilities of leadership to the pleasures of celebrity.

HEADLINE: Centrist Senators Say They Oppose Health Care Bill

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
The morning after voting to commence debate on ground-breaking health care legislation, two centrist senators, Ben Nelson and Joseph I. Lieberman, said on Sunday that they were opposed to the bill as it is currently written, particularly its inclusion of a new government-run insurance program.
 Mr. Nelson, the Nebraska senator who voted with his fellow Democrats to start debate sometime after Thanksgiving, said that he was opposed to the bill's insistence on a so-called public option -- a government insurance plan that would compete with private firms to offer coverage for uninsured Americans. While the bill gives states the right to opt out of a public option, Senator Nelson said he would only support a bill that required states to opt in, a step that would stretch out the time that such a program could be broadly enacted. Such a provision would allow for more ''state-based solutions'' to issues of health care coverage, he said in an appearance on ABC's ''This Week With George Stephanopoulos.''
 ''I don't want a big government, Washington-run operation that would undermine the private insurance that 200 million Americans now have,'' he said. 
 He added that if the public option remained in the bill in its present form, he would refuse to stop an expected Republican filibuster. Because he is one of the 60 votes the Democrats had counted on to prevent a filibuster, his statement could dampen the enthusiasm for Democrats still exulting over their ability Saturday evening to come together on a crucial procedural vote and launch debate.
 Mr. Lieberman, the Connecticut independent who caucuses with the Democrats and one of the 60 senators voting to start debate, said that he too would ultimately oppose a bill with a public option because it would impose billion of dollars of new costs at a time that the country's economy is not out of the woods.
 ''We have a health care system that has real troubles, but we have an economic system that is in real crisis,'' he said on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' ''And I don't want to fix the problems in our healthcare system in a way that creates more of an economic crisis.'' 
 He also contended that because the government uses regulation to hold down excessive prices charged by a business, it was ''radical'' to have ''government go into that business.'' And he said that ''the irony of ironies'' is that the Congressional Budget Office has reported that the government-run program could end up charging more for health insurance than the current average charged by private firms.
 In addressing the concerns of centrists like Mr. Nelson and Mr. Lieberman, as well as the moderate Republican senators from Maine, Susan M. Collins and Olympia J. Snowe, the Democratic leadership might risk alienating supporters of the health care overhaul. Senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, said in a telephone interview on Sunday that he would not vote for a health care bill that did not have a public option. Such a bill he said would be ''a huge subsidy to private insurance companies, who could raise their rates without any competition.''
 ''I am not prepared to vote for a massive handout to the private insurance companies, '' he said, adding that he believes there are other Democrats who would also reject a bill that did not have a public option.
 On a third show, Senator Charles Schumer of New York predicted that ''at the end of the day'' Democrats would unite behind an amended version of the bill and ''everyone is going to be together.''
 ''I think now the wind is at our back,'' he said on CBS's ''Face the Nation.'' ''There's a real momentum. And the good news here is we still have a very diverse caucus but every Democrat, from the most liberal to the most conservative, very much wants to get a bill.''
 Senators Nelson and Lieberman each appeared on Sunday talk shows with other legislators -- Democrats fervently supportive of the Senate bill and Republicans fervently opposed. But none of the other legislators seemed to want to grapple directly with the two centrists because they are hoping to enlist their support. Rather, Representatives Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Florida Democrat, who has used her battle with breast cancer to crusade for early detection, and Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, tangled on whether the Senate bill would deny mammograms to women between 40 and 50 years old, a hotly debated issue after a task force appointed by the Department of Health and Human Services last week recommended that only women over 50 begin regular breast cancer screening. 
 Representative Blackburn said that it would and read language in the Senate bill that she said would give bureaucrats like government task forces the power to reject coverage now generally given to women under 50 requesting annual mammograms. But Ms. Wasserman Schultz , accusing the Republicans of having ''for the first time politicized breast cancer,'' contended a task force's recommendations would be just that, recommendations, and were not binding. She pointed out she and every major cancer organization has come out against the task force's recommendations.
 Senator Nelson, the key centrist, then capitalized on that argument to say that a public option would increase the likelihood that such recommendations by bureaucrats would invade the relationships between doctors and their patients. That is why, he emphasized, that he wants a public option to be handled on a state-by-state basis.
 ''I don't mind guidelines and recommendations, but I don't want them to becomes the equivalent of rules and law,'' he said.
 Republicans have been pouncing on the recommendations -- made by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force -- as an example of what they said would be government intrusion into health care. On ''Fox News Sunday,'' Senator Christopher S. Bond, a Missouri Republican, said that the Obama administration was ''playing around with excessive government control and this administration and, regrettably, this Congress has been all about more government control, more government intrusion.''
 But Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, also underscored that the task force report was only a recommendation -- one that the Obama administration has distanced itself from -- and that the ''bigger issue here'' is that the bill will make sure that women ''actually have mammograms covered.''
 On the same program, Senator Arlen Spector, a Democrat of Pennsylvania, shrugged off criticism by his former party that the Senate bill would end up vastly increasing the federal budget and widening the deficit. He pointed out that the Congressional Budget Office, the respected arbiter on what legislation costs, said that the bill would save $130 billion in the first 10 years and $650 billion in the second 10 years. 
 But Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, was skeptical, saying ''I don't think one out of 10 Americans believes that.'' The bill, he said, would lead to higher premiums, higher taxes, cuts in Medicare and it would put ''15 million more low-income Americans into a medical ghetto called Medicaid.''
 By contrast, he said, the Republicans were trying to take smaller steps to reduce costs by letting small businesses poll their resources to buy insurance, by reducing ''junk lawsuits'' and by letting people buy insurance across state lines.
 ''And I think most people would be much more comfortable with us biting off what we could chew instead of this arrogance of thinking we can fix the whole system at once,'' he said.
 Senator Schumer appeared on ''Face the Nation'' with Senator Jon Kyl, an Arizona Republican, who quoted a study predicting that many of the employers who now insure 88 million people would drop their coverage because ''it will be cheaper'' for the employer to dump them into the government-run program. Senator Schumer retorted that the study was funded by a private health insurer and that the Senate bill would bar employees covered by private insurance from shopping at the health exchanges that include a government run plan.

HEADLINE: Democrats Step Up Push for Votes on Health Care

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Anxious that Saturday's party-line Senate vote to open debate on a health care overhaul gives them little maneuvering room, Obama administration officials and their Congressional allies are stepping up overtures to select Senate Republicans in hopes of winning their ultimate support.
 The two moderate Republican senators from Maine, Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe, say Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, reached out to them after he unveiled the Senate measure, encouraging them to bring forward their ideas and concerns. 
 Ms. Collins also received a personal visit from a high-level Obama emissary, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, a former senator who worked closely with her on various issues as part of a bipartisan coalition.
 After the party-line vote of 60 to 39 on Saturday night to move to a full health care debate, including votes on significant amendments, both sides are acutely aware of the wavering in their ranks and are trying to figure out how to play the numbers.
 Republican leaders conceded that the Democratic victory, while not conclusive, improved the odds that a bill would pass. ''Ordinarily, when you do start debate on a bill like this, it ends up passing,'' Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said on ''Face the Nation'' On CBS. ''When these senators, for example, say, 'Well, we'll vote to start the bill but that doesn't guarantee our vote at the end,' the pressure at the end of the process is enormous.'' 
 Sharing the center of attention with Maine's senators are a handful of swing senators from both parties whose votes are up for grabs on this issue. 
 On Sunday, there were already flurries of bargaining, including over their opposition to the kind of government-run insurance option that is in the Senate bill. Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, said on ''This Week'' on ABC that while he opposed this even if states could opt out of it, ''I would look at a public option where states could opt in.''
 Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat who supports the public option and the Senate bill, said optimistically, ''We're working on a number of different options that will bring us together.''
 But Mr. Nelson cited ''a whole host of other items'' that trouble him, like abortion provisions and a program to offer long-term disability insurance. 
 Unlike most Senate Republicans, who dug in deeply against the health bill as it survived the crucial preliminary vote, Ms. Snowe and Ms. Collins have left themselves open to considering a vote for some version of the overhaul if they can win significant changes during a Senate debate that is expected to last for weeks.
 ''I have ruled out voting for this bill, but I still very much want to vote for a bill and that is why I am continuing to have discussions,'' Ms. Collins said. ''I still cling to the belief that it is possible for a group of us to come together and rewrite the bill in a way that would cause it to have greater support.''
 Considering the effort it took Mr. Reid to rally the minimum number of 58 Democrats and 2 independents he needed just to begin the full debate after Thanksgiving, he and other Democrats would clearly like to secure more supporters as the bill wends its way through the Senate.
 A handful of the senators who voted somewhat reluctantly to let the floor fight proceed have pointedly not promised to cooperate in the event of a later filibuster, which is likely to stand in the way of final passage, providing further incentives to try to convert a Republican or two.
 ''If the public option is still in there, the only resort we have is to say no at the end to reporting the bill off the floor,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats and was one of the 60 senators voting to let the debate begin. ''We have a health care system that's in trouble, but we have an economic crisis, and I don't want to fix the health care system in a way that creates more of an economic crisis.'' Mr. Lieberman appeared on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC. 
 Although Ms. Snowe and Ms. Collins both adhered to the party line when they voted Saturday, when they spoke on the Senate floor beforehand they stayed aloof from the assaults on the measure by other Republicans.
 Both senators have talked privately with Democrats and independents about devising joint amendments on areas like cost control, and both said they would keep seeking compromises. Ms. Snowe said that would ''be a true test of whether there is a will to improve this legislation in a nonideological, bipartisan manner.''
 Ms. Snowe was a central participant in the months of closed-door talks by the Finance Committee and was the only Republican to endorse its proposal. But she was sidelined as Mr. Reid and other Democrats took over the job of assembling the current measure from the work of the two committees and the House. 
 Once Mr. Reid, in response to appeals from a majority of Senate Democrats, added a public health insurance option to his bill, he lost Ms. Snowe, who favors a proposal to create a public plan only in states where other provisions of the bill fail to make affordable insurance widely available.
 She said she feared that Mr. Reid had locked himself into a procedural dilemma in which opponents of a public option could not produce 60 votes to change the measure but supporters of the measure could not muster 60 votes to pass it, leading to a parliamentary stalemate.
 The main substantive objection Ms. Collins raised was that the bill focused on extending coverage to Americans without insurance while failing to do enough to curb the costs of insurance coverage and the delivery of care. 
 ''The high cost of health care is what is driving up the cost of insurance premiums, causing many middle-income families and small businesses to struggle to meet these needs,'' she said.
 While the two women are the main focus of Democrats at the moment, officials said they would seek opportunities to appeal to others. They also hope any final joint House-Senate proposal could attract at least a few Republicans in each chamber.
 ''We reach out to our Republican colleagues, and we would like to work with them,'' Mr. Reid said. ''But everyone should understand we're going to do a bill. We hope that we don't have to do it with Democrats, but if we have to, we will.''

HEADLINE: In 3 Tacks for Escalating Afghan War, a Game of Trade-Offs

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Should President Obama decide to send 40,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan, the most ambitious plan under consideration at the White House, the military would have enormous flexibility to deploy as many as 15,000 troops to the Taliban center of gravity in the south, 5,000 to the critical eastern border with Pakistan and 10,000 as trainers for the Afghan security forces.
 The rest could be deployed flexibly across the country, including to the NATO headquarters in Kabul, the capital, and in clandestine operations.
 If Mr. Obama limited any additional American troops to 10,000 to 15,000, the military would deploy them largely as trainers, with some reinforcements likely in the southern province of Kandahar, the Taliban's spiritual home. The neighboring, and opium-rich, Helmand Province and the eastern border with Pakistan, military analysts say, would receive few if any American troops and would remain largely as they are today. 
 Such trade-offs are part of the discussions under way in the West Wing and at the Pentagon as Mr. Obama and his top advisers debate escalating the eight-year-old war. And they drive home the basic point that while the numbers will dominate the headlines, what is really at stake is how to fight the war.
 Here is a primer, culled from the diverse views of administration officials and military analysts, on the military utility of some of the force options before the president to bolster the 68,000 American troops already in Afghanistan.
 40,000 troops
 In late September, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top American and NATO commander in Afghanistan, sent three different troop options to the Pentagon: about 80,000; 40,000 or more; or 10,000 to 15,000. The White House quickly discarded the idea of sending 80,000, making his middle option the high one under consideration by the president. 
 With 40,000 troops, the military priority would be to deploy as many as 10,000 to Kandahar, the desert province abutting Pakistan; its big city, also called Kandahar, is the second largest in Afghanistan. Currently there are about 3,200 United States troops and 1,600 Canadian soldiers in the area. The Taliban control much of Kandahar Province and are contesting control of the city.
 ''We do not now have enough troops around Kandahar to secure this area from the enemy,'' said Kimberly Kagan, the president of the Institute for the Study of War, who over the summer was part of a team that helped General McChrystal assess the Afghan conflict for the president. Control of Kandahar, the hub of Taliban operations in the south, would be a major strategic accomplishment for the United States military and a psychological blow to the enemy.
 An additional 5,000 American troops would probably be sent to the contested Helmand Province, home to the poppy crop that is a major source of income for the Taliban who traffic in opium. The province is the vital breadbasket of Afghanistan, where the river valley is a fertile ground for pomegranates, wheat and other fruits and grains.
 Some 4,000 Marines are now in the area, but they have been unable to secure large parts of the province, including guerrilla strongholds in southern and central Helmand.
 Yet another 5,000 would probably be sent to the eastern area that some military planners refer to as ''P2K,'' for the Afghan provinces of Paktika, Paktia and Khost. The three provinces border the mountainous tribal area of Pakistan, including North and South Waziristan. The Pakistani region has become a haven for the senior leadership of Al Qaeda.
 ''The preponderance of forces, no matter what number you pick, will be in the south, and there will be some in the east,'' said a senior defense official, who would not specify further. The relatively stable north and west, he said, ''will remain areas of an economy of force.''
 Perhaps as many as 10,000 troops would be deployed as trainers with the Afghan security forces, with NATO pledging to send thousands more.
 20,000 to 35,000 troops
 This way encompasses a number of mid-range options under discussion at the Pentagon and the White House. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates; Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have coalesced around a plan to send 30,000 or more troops to Afghanistan, although there are variations in their positions and they are not working in lock step.
 The difference between 30,000 and 40,000, military analysts say, is that there might be 5,000 trainers rather than 10,000, and fewer troops to spread flexibly across the country over all, although there would still be a strong concentration in the south. 
 ''Kandahar is pretty crucial, and we should not skimp there,'' said Michael O'Hanlon, a national security expert at the Brookings Institution who just returned from a trip to Afghanistan.
 Administration officials say that the additional troops would also be deployed to protect some dozen population clusters across the country, including not only Kandahar and Kabul but also Mazar-i-Sharif and Kunduz in the north, Herat in the west and Jalalabad in the east. 
 Military officials say that three-quarters of any additional troops sent, no matter the number, will be working side by side with Afghan security forces in a ''partnering'' or apprentice arrangement. They will be separate from American trainers, whose job is to put raw recruits through a basic military training regime. 
 Under the partnering arrangement, Afghan troops will share the same bases as the Americans, a defense official said, and although there will be separate sleeping quarters and dining facilities, ''they're going to live together, work together, plan together and operate together.''
 Should Mr. Obama send 20,000 troops, military analysts say, there would probably be no fourth brigade to use around the country, and parts of Helmand and the east would receive few if any additional troops. With this number, Mr. Obama would expect a greater contribution of troops from NATO allies (about 35,000 troops from other NATO countries are currently in Afghanistan). Much of the American mission would focus on training.
 Administration officials estimate the cost of sending 30,000 more troops at $25 billion to $30 billion a year and the cost of sending 20,000 troops at $21 billion a year.
 10,000 to 15,000 troops
 Under this approach, advocated by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the United States would accelerate the training of the Afghan security forces and focus on eliminating the Qaeda leadership in Pakistan through drone strikes.
 Mr. Obama is likely to announce his new Afghanistan strategy in the first week of December, administration officials say. 
 Despite the attention to the troop number, Anthony H. Cordesman, a military expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, cautioned that it would be about as helpful to understanding the president's war strategy as counting the number of parts in a Ferrari to determine how it would handle the road.

HEADLINE: The Phantom Menace

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
A funny thing happened on the way to a new New Deal. A year ago, the only thing we had to fear was fear itself; today, the reigning doctrine in Washington appears to be ''Be afraid. Be very afraid.''
 What happened? To be sure, ''centrists'' in the Senate have hobbled efforts to rescue the economy. But the evidence suggests that in addition to facing political opposition, President Obama and his inner circle have been intimidated by scare stories from Wall Street. 
 Consider the contrast between what Mr. Obama's advisers were saying on the eve of his inauguration, and what he himself is saying now.
 In December 2008 Lawrence Summers, soon to become the administration's highest-ranking economist, called for decisive action. ''Many experts,'' he warned, ''believe that unemployment could reach 10 percent by the end of next year.'' In the face of that prospect, he continued, ''doing too little poses a greater threat than doing too much.''
 Ten months later unemployment reached 10.2 percent, suggesting that despite his warning the administration hadn't done enough to create jobs. You might have expected, then, a determination to do more.
 But in a recent interview with Fox News, the president sounded diffident and nervous about his economic policy. He spoke vaguely about possible tax incentives for job creation. But ''it is important though to recognize,'' he went on, ''that if we keep on adding to the debt, even in the midst of this recovery, that at some point, people could lose confidence in the U.S. economy in a way that could actually lead to a double-dip recession.''
 What? Huh?
 Most economists I talk to believe that the big risk to recovery comes from the inadequacy of government efforts: the stimulus was too small, and it will fade out next year, while high unemployment is undermining both consumer and business confidence.
 Now, it's politically difficult for the Obama administration to enact a full-scale second stimulus. Still, he should be trying to push through as much aid to the economy as possible. And remember, Mr. Obama has the bully pulpit; it's his job to persuade America to do what needs to be done. 
 Instead, however, Mr. Obama is lending his voice to those who say that we can't create more jobs. And a report on Politico.com suggests that deficit reduction, not job creation, will be the centerpiece of his first State of the Union address. What happened? 
 It took me a while to puzzle this out. But the concerns Mr. Obama expressed become comprehensible if you suppose that he's getting his views, directly or indirectly, from Wall Street. 
 Ever since the Great Recession began economic analysts at some (not all) major Wall Street firms have warned that efforts to fight the slump will produce even worse economic evils. In particular, they say, never mind the current ability of the U.S. government to borrow long term at remarkably low interest rates -- any day now, budget deficits will lead to a collapse in investor confidence, and rates will soar.
 And it's this latter claim that Mr. Obama echoed in that Fox News interview. Is he right to be worried?
 Well, spikes in long-term interest rates have happened in the past, most famously in 1994. But in 1994 the U.S. economy was adding 300,000 jobs a month, and the Fed was steadily raising short-term rates. It's hard to see why anything similar should happen now, with the economy still bleeding jobs and the Fed showing no desire to raise rates anytime soon. 
 A better model, I'd argue, is Japan in the 1990s, which ran persistent large budget deficits, but also had a persistently depressed economy -- and saw long-term interest rates fall almost steadily. There's a good chance that officials are being terrorized by a phantom menace -- a threat that exists only in their minds.
 And shouldn't we consider the source? As far as I can tell, the analysts now warning about soaring interest rates tend to be the same people who insisted, months after the Great Recession began, that the biggest threat facing the economy was inflation. And let's not forget that Wall Street -- which somehow failed to recognize the biggest housing bubble in history -- has a less than stellar record at predicting market behavior.
 Still, let's grant that there is some risk that doing more about double-digit unemployment would undermine confidence in the bond markets. This risk must be set against the certainty of mass suffering if we don't do more -- and the possibility, as I said, of a collapse of confidence among ordinary workers and businesses.
 And Mr. Summers was right the first time: in the face of the greatest economic catastrophe since the Great Depression, it's much riskier to do too little than it is to do too much. It's sad, and unfortunate, that the administration appears to have lost sight of that truth.

HEADLINE: Brazil's President Elbows U.S. on the Diplomatic Stage

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Mery Galanternick contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.

DATELINE: BRASILIA 

 BODY:
Brazil's ambitions to be a more important player on the global diplomatic stage are crashing headlong into the efforts of the United States and other Western powers to rein in Iran's nuclear arms program.
 Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil's president, is set to receive Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, here on Monday in his first state visit to Brazil. The visit is part of a larger push by Mr. da Silva to wade into the seemingly intractable world of Middle East politics, and follows visits in the last two weeks by Israel's president, Shimon Peres, and Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority.
 But the visit is drawing criticism from lawmakers and former diplomats here and in the United States, who say it could undercut Western efforts to press Iran on its nuclear program, and consequently chill Brazil's relations with the United States and damage its growing reputation as a global power.
 Brazilian officials say the goal of the visit is to strengthen commercial ties between the two countries and help bring peace to the Middle East. 
 ''This is part of Brazil projecting its role and strength as a global player,'' said Michael Shifter, vice president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy research group in Washington. ''And part of this has to do with Brazil sending a message to Washington that it will deal whomever it wants to deal with.''
 And beyond the nuclear standoff, critics in Brazil and the United States say Mr. da Silva's reception legitimizes Mr. Ahmadinejad just five months after what most of the world sees as his fraudulent re-election, followed by a brutal crackdown on dissent.
 ''This state visit is a gross error, a terrible mistake,'' said Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York, chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. ''He is illegitimate with his own people, and Brazil is now going to give him the air of legitimacy at a time when the world is trying to figure out how to prevent Iran from having nuclear weapons. It makes no sense to me, and it tarnishes the image of Brazil, quite frankly.''
 Relations between the United States and Brazil were already tense after Mr. da Silva's government criticized the United States over its handling of the crisis in Honduras and increasing its military presence in Colombia. 
 But Mr. da Silva's overture to Iran is consistent with President Obama's policy of engagement, and the Obama administration says it is optimistic that the meeting will not damage and at best could reinforce the efforts already under way by Washington and European powers to deal with Iran.
 ''We would hope that all our friends and allies would understand that this is really a critical moment for Iran itself,'' Ian C. Kelly, a State Department spokesman, said Thursday. ''We would hope that Brazil would play a constructive role in trying to get Iran to do the right thing and fulfill its international obligations.''
 Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister, said Mr. da Silva was encouraged by Western leaders, including President Obama, to seek a ''direct and open dialogue'' with Iran, in particular on the nuclear issue. 
 ''It was said and reiterated that it was in the interest of Western nations that Brazil has a good interface with Iran,'' Mr. Amorim said in an interview. 
 Brazilian officials said Mr. da Silva would try to sell Iran on the benefits of a Brazilian-style nuclear program, which is constitutionally limited to civilian use.
 But Mr. Amorim made clear that Brazil did not see its role as carrying water for the proposed agreement for Iran to export most of its enriched uranium for processing into nuclear fuel.
 ''We are not here to convince Iran to accept some proposal,'' he said. ''Brazil is interested in peace.''
 Since his election in 2002, Mr. da Silva has sought to cement Brazil's dominance as Latin America's economic and diplomatic leader, using its economic might to raise Brazil's foreign-policy profile.
 His government has also lobbied for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and has become a respected voice in world climate change discussions. In recent months, he has added Middle Eastern diplomacy to his portfolio. 
 Brazil is no stranger to the region. Its national oil company, Petrobras, is helping Iran develop its oil fields and the two countries did about $2 billion in trade in 2007, mostly in Brazilian exports of food to Iran, Mr. Amorim said.
 Brazil joined United Nationspeacekeeping missions in Egypt after the 1956 Suez Crisis and has been involved in the Middle East ever since, said David Fleischer, a political science professor at the University of Brasilia.
 ''Brazil is just starting to realize the weight it has,'' Mr. Amorim said. ''It wasn't Brazil that went looking for the Middle East, it was the Middle East that went looking for Brazil.'' 
 Brazilian officials say the holy grail of Mr. da Silva's Middle Eastern initiative is to improve relations between Israel and the Palestinians, and they see Iran as a key player in resolving the conflict.
 Success in this endeavor ''would really put Brazil on the map and might put Lula in line for the Nobel Prize,'' Mr. Fleischer said.
 But it would have been difficult to have chosen a more formidable or polarizing quest. Many critics do not see Mr. Ahmadinejad -- who has denied the Holocaust, called for Israel to be wiped off the map and backs anti-Israel militias -- as a constructive force in the Middle East.
 More than 1,500 people protested his visit this month in Sao Paulo, home to Brazil's largest Jewish community, and a smaller protest took place on Sunday in Rio de Janeiro. Another is planned for Brasilia on Monday. 
 It is not only the Israeli side that is leery of Mr. Ahmadinejad. Mr. Abbas, the Palestinian leader, said after meeting Mr. da Silva in Brazil on Friday that he had asked him to urge Iran to end its support for Hamas, the radical Islamist movement that controls Gaza. 
 But both Mr. Abbas and Mr. Perez urged Mr. da Silva to join the Middle East peace process. ''Brazil, as an important country, and President Lula, as a respected leader, can play an important role,'' Mr. Abbas told the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo.
 Some political analysts and American officials say that in his effort to burnish his credentials as a statesman, Mr. da Silva is marching to his own drummer rather than cooperating with allies to achieve larger geopolitical goals. 
 ''As Brazil becomes more relevant on climate change and in world economic forums it is not going to be able to so openly criticize or be antagonistic with other major powers without paying a political price for it,'' said Christopher Garman, an analyst with Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy in New York. ''Brazilian policy makers will no longer be able to have their cake and eat it too.'' 
 But a diplomatic success would go a long way toward muting the criticism.
 ''Brazil should expect criticism for hosting Ahmadinejad to be sure,'' said Julia E. Sweig, a Latin America expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''But if it can play a moderating role -- and clearly Washington is hoping as much -- on the nuclear issue, it can surely deal with the critics.''

HEADLINE: Obama Seeks Time For Policies to Take

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
President Obama's scramble for a health care overhaul, like his dash across Asia last week, obscures an irony of his first year in office.
 As he tries to effect his agenda, the politician who campaigned on ''the fierce urgency of now'' plays for time to demonstrate the benefits of policies that, if they work, will not work quickly.
 Mr. Obama, backed by some independent economists, believes that his stimulus plan has helped pull the economy into recovery. But he is at least months away from being able to make that case by pointing to a decline in joblessness. 
 Mr. Obama returned from Asia to lobby Congress on his health policy goals, and won a significant preliminary victory in the Senate over the weekend. Many changes would not even be in place until 2013 -- including such popular provisions as subsidies for buying coverage and prohibitions against insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.
 His initiative to curb global warming by limiting carbon emissions may raise energy costs long before Americans perceive environmental or economic benefits, if they ever do. The most demonstrable near-term result of his forthcoming Afghanistan strategy will be more troops for an unpopular war.
 In Asia, Mr. Obama pushed to ''rebalance'' the world economy through policy shifts in Beijing that he hoped would benefit Americans via more exports to China. The world's oldest continuous major civilization showed no sign of a quick pivot.
 The president's challenge is pursuing far-reaching changes in a political and media culture centered on short-term consequences. He has disdained the values of the ''24-hour news cycle'' and vowed to ignore day-to-day fluctuations in polls, financial markets and cable-TV chatter.
 ''I've got to be looking at the horizon,'' Mr. Obama said in a January interview. That becomes harder to afford with an approaching election.
 Not to Be Rushed
 In Beijing, Mr. Obama praised China's $585 billion economic stimulus, whose emphasis on infrastructure projects paid immediate dividends for American exporters of heavy equipment.
 ''There are opportunities right now that are available for American companies,'' said Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, who accompanied the president.
 More promising for American companies and workers in the long term is the prospect of an expanding Chinese middle class going on American-style shopping sprees. Mr. Obama wants China to make American imports cheaper by letting its currency rise in value, and to provide more incentives for Chinese families to spend.
 Signs exist that the Chinese government and families want that to happen as they adapt to explosive economic growth. But statements from Mr. Obama and President Hu Jintao of China after their consultations made clear Beijing would not be rushed on its currency policy. Other changes to spur domestic spending, like development of broad-scale consumer credit and investments in a social safety net, will not happen quickly either.
 ''Changing the orientation of this economy is not something that can be achieved in two to three years,'' said Arthur Kroeber, an analyst at the Beijing consulting firm Dragonomics. ''It's more like a five- to 10-year process.''
 Needing Results Soon
 White House aides bristled at news media reviews suggesting Mr. Obama had failed to secure diplomatic victories in China. ''This isn't an immediate gratification business,'' said David Axelrod, the presidential adviser.
 But midterm elections arrive in 11 months. For Congressional Democrats -- facing politically risky votes on Mr. Obama's health care, energy, budget and immigration initiatives -- the horizon is approaching rapidly.
 For their sake and its own, Team Obama is not ignoring that reality.
 A White House ''jobs summit'' will explore near-term steps to accelerate job creation, even though the administration is loath to widen the budget deficit and additional spending may not reduce unemployment rapidly anyway.
 To ensure that voters see immediate benefits from health legislation, Democrats have included quick-trigger provisions to bar insurers from putting lifetime caps on benefits and to help expensive-to-cover patients buy insurance through government ''high-risk pools.'' Weeks before visiting Beijing, Mr. Obama nodded to the anxieties of American workers by imposing tariffs on Chinese tires.
 Mr. Obama enjoys thicker political insulation than Democrats in Congress; polls show that voters like him personally, and he does not face re-election until 2012. But he feels the pressures of his strategy, nonetheless.
 Before returning to Washington, he took solace in the timelessness of the Great Wall. ''It gives you a good perspective on a lot of the day-to-day things,'' he mused. ''They don't amount to much in the scope of history.''

HEADLINE: Helping the Hungry: Researching the Causes of Hunger and Related Charities

BYLINE: DINAH MACK and HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: Lesson Plan | Investigating the causes and effects of the rise in hunger across the United States and what individuals can do locally to address the problem. 

 BODY:
Overview | What has caused an increase in hunger in the United States? How can individuals help to alleviate this growing problem? In this lesson, students consider the causes of rising hunger and use The New York Times to research the issue. The class then works together to choose a charitable organization and develop a fund-raising strategy. 
Materials | Computers with Internet connection and projection equipment.
Warm-Up | Note: This lesson plan, and the associated Times resources, deals with the rising problem of "food insecurity" and hunger. Please proceed with sensitivity and delicacy, as there may well be students in your class struggling with food security. You may want to set some ground rules for discussion.
Show the class the following short New York Times video, "A Community Facing Hunger," which looks at the growth of hunger in a small community:
Alternatively or in addition, show "A Year of Struggle at a Food Bank," which explores a year in the life of a food bank and the rise in families in need of its services.
Ask students to share what stood out to them by giving each student a chance to share something he or she noticed. Then hold a discussion about the causes of hunger, as well as why hunger is a growing problem in the United States. Jot down students' ideas about the causes on the board, and explain that they will now read an article about this issue.
Related | Jason DeParle's article "Hunger in U.S. at 14-Year High" explores a new Department of Agriculture report on the increasing problem of food insecurity: 
The number of Americans who lived in households that lacked consistent access to adequate food soared last year, to 49 million, the highest since the government began tracking what it calls "food insecurity" 14 years ago, the Department of Agriculture reported Monday.
The increase, of 13 million Americans, was much larger than even the most pessimistic observers of hunger trends had expected and cast an alarming light on the daily hardships caused by the recession's punishing effect on jobs and wages.
About a third of these struggling households had what the researchers called "very low food security," meaning lack of money forced members to skip meals, cut portions or otherwise forgo food at some point in the year.
The other two-thirds typically had enough to eat, but only by eating cheaper or less varied foods, relying on government aid like food stamps or visiting food pantries and soup kitchens.
Read the entire article with your class using the following questions. 
Questions | For reading comprehension and discussion:

        
What are some of the causes of the rise in food insecurity in the United States? (Add these to the list begun earlier on the board.)
        
What is the definition of food insecurity, and why is that term used instead of "hunger"?
        
Why might the official data on hunger be an underestimation?
        
What does the report show about the demographics of hunger in the United States?
        
Why have some questioned the survey's methodology?
Activity | Explain to students that they will further investigate the issue of food insecurity or hunger, and then develop a plan for how they can help address the problem. 
To start, return to the list of hunger causes and the Times article, and have students use them to generate questions to help guide their research. For example, the article notes that many Americans have begun "eating cheaper or less varied foods, relying on government aid like food stamps, or visiting food pantries and soup kitchens." Based on this quotation, students might generate questions like the following:

        
What are some examples of relatively cheap foods? 
        
How nutritious are cheaper options?
        
What are the eligibility requirements for food stamps?
        
What other forms of aid does the government provide to address hunger?
        
What do food pantries and soup kitchens provide?
        
How many food pantries and soup kitchens are in your local area, and have they seen a rise in demand?
Other questions might focus on the economic and other factors that contribute to hunger; farming loss; other data and studies; international, national and local charities focused on hunger; nutrition issues and so on. 
Next, assign students to work individually or in pairs or small groups to use The New York Times to find answers to their hunger-related questions. You may wish to allow groups to choose the question(s) to focus on, or to make assignments. You may also wish to have students use our Fact/Question/Response (PDF) or K/W/L (PDF) chart to generate their questions and organize their research.
Students can use Times Topics to start finding Times articles and resources on relevant topics like Food Banks, Food Stamps, Diet and Nutrition and Farmers.
Students can also search for hunger topics using the NYTimes.com Site Search tool. They might also peruse Your Money Guides: Philanthropy and The Times's special section on Giving. 
After students have completed their research, reconvene as a class and have the groups share their findings. After all groups have reported to the class, hold a discussion. Ask: What fact or finding struck you most and why? What did we find out about hunger on local, state, national and international levels? What are the causes of hunger at these levels? How can they be addressed? How do you think individuals and small groups can help?
At this point, you may wish to have students complete the "Connecting The New York Times to Your World" sheet (PDF) to help them make personal connections to the issue of hunger, drawing on their own experiences and observations and other readings (including school curriculum). 
Tell them that as a group, they will choose a local organization that helps the hungry, and develop a fund-raising strategy to raise money for the organization. 
First, hold a discussion about the local needs in the community and the issues and facts that most struck your class, drawing on the group research. For instance, if they were most taken by the nutritional challenges of people who are food insecure, they may wish to focus on promoting nutritional choices for poverty- and hunger-stricken people; if they are interested in farming and other supply challenges, they may wish to look into the local use of biotechnology.
Have students find one or more local organizations - or larger organizations with a local chapter or office - that address the issue(s) that most interest them. Online resources include Charity Vault, Network for Good, Charity Navigator and Volunteer Match. 
Once the organization is selected, assess and discuss its needs. Does it need money, goods or services (included volunteer work)? Designate students to phone the organization to find out how the class can help. Invite a representative from the organization to speak to the class, or take a trip with students to the organization.
If a charity does not exist that appeals to your students or that addresses the specific hunger-related issue that they are most interested in, encourage your students to start their own project, following in the footsteps of A Midwinter Night's Dream. 
Next, discuss how the class will raise the money, do the service and/or collect the goods for the organization. Ask students to brainstorm all the fund-raisers they have taken part in. They might consider various online strategies, like using Facebook and Twitter. 
Other fund-raising suggestions: 

        
Hold a penny war.
        
Have a bake sale.
        
Host a read-, walk-, dance- or other "a-thon."
        
Offer a service auction in which students sell their time doing lawn care, car washing, baby-sitting, etc.
        
Hold a food drive.
        
Put on a performance or show and donate the receipts.
        
Give to the charity in lieu of exchanging holiday gifts.
        
Donate time, perhaps going beyond serving food.
Alternatively, or in addition, have students promote the cause of fighting hunger, focusing on the charities they selected and/or developed, in the school and local community.
Going Further | Students write reflections about their research and their participation in the service project. Questions to consider as they write include the following: How did my participation help address local hunger? How can I continue to help hungry people? What national and international causes of hunger are evident locally? What causes can be addressed at the local level? What are the larger issues? Is President Obama's pledge to eradicate child hunger by 2015 realistic? Why or why not?

HEADLINE: In Love Affair With Credit, It's Business as Usual

BYLINE: By ERIC MINK. 
Eric Mink teaches film studies at Webster University in St. Louis. A former television critic for The New York Daily News and The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, he has written about television for more than 30 years.

 BODY:
Creating compelling television out of jacked-up interest rates, compounded penalty fees and software code rigged to rip off credit card customers is no mean feat. ''The Card Game,'' a new production in the long-running ''Frontline'' documentary series on PBS, does a fine job of it.
 This latest look at the questionable practices of the American credit card industry has two important things going for it: briskly paced content with a high outrage quotient and casting that draws clear distinctions between good guys and bad guys. 
 The program, a co-production with The New York Times, springs from the enactment in May of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009. As the calendar counts down through a lobbyist-induced, eight-month delay to the law's effective date, the card companies have been infuriating consumers by hiking rates on existing balances, lowering credit limits and inventing new ways to induce late payments and trigger multiple penalty fees.
 Lowell Bergman, the on-camera interviewer who wrote and produced the documentary with Oriana Zill de Granados, corrals a diverting assortment of players. Opening the program is Shailesh Mehta, a former chief executive of Providian Financial Corporation, a credit card company that pioneered what he calls ''penalty pricing'' or ''stealth pricing.'' With disarming candor, Mr. Mehta reviews the tactics that lure new cardholders, many with poor credit records, with promises of no annual fees and initial zero-interest periods, only to squeeze them later with high interest rates and fees lurking in the fine print of their account contracts.
 The program, which has its premiere on Tuesday night, offers brief case studies of people caught in the resulting credit vise. Among them: Ben Collins, a construction contractor whose small business has been paralyzed by the arbitrary reduction of his firm's credit card limit; Don Bollinger, a rural worker who survived cancer but was forced into bankruptcy after he lost his job and his credit card company doubled the interest rate and minimum payments on his existing balances; and Josette Wermuth, whose debit card's mandatory overdraft ''protection'' ended up costing her $365 in penalty fees after a $7 pizza purchase left her with a negative account balance.
 Caught between the complaints of constituents and industry muscle, politicians including Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York and a member of the House Financial Services Committee, recount repeated legislative and administrative opportunities to rein in abusive practices, only to see reform bills killed or emasculated by lobbying power and regulatory authority neutralized by ideological posturing.
 Speaking of which, ''The Card Game'' also showcases a decidedly unconvincing bunch of industry spokespersons. Scott Talbott, a Washington lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable, conjures up the possible death of American capitalism. Nessa Feddis, a senior counsel of the American Bankers Association, says that only a minority of cardholders were ''confused'' about the rules and declares the matter closed in light of the new bill. ''The industry is moving on,'' she tells Mr. Bergman. ''End of story.''
 Despite the documentary's engaging storytelling, it's still a little desperate for gripping visuals. The arresting close-ups of dramatically lighted credit cards, fingers punching PIN numbers into A.T.M.'s, and store clerks swiping cards through credit terminals soon devolve into cliche.
 There is also a sense of deja vu hovering over ''The Card Game.'' ''Frontline'' and The Times collaborated on a similar report five years ago, ''Secret History of the Credit Card,'' for which Mr. Bergman served as on-camera correspondent and co-writer. That program charted the growth of abusive practices by credit card companies, practices that seem to have become only more robust since the not-unrelated bursting of the credit bubble last year.
 The credit card industry's apparent confidence -- Senator Dodd calls it ''arrogance'' -- in the face of the new federal legislation may stem from its deep pockets and demonstrated lobbying prowess. Or it may draw strength from its practiced exploitation of innate human weakness.
 ''Bankers will figure it out to comply,'' Mr. Mehta says. ''You make the stupid laws, and I'll comply and I'll make money.'' He adds, ''And there are always some desperate people who will take the product.''

HEADLINE: Perilous Fun

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
For parents wanting to provide their children some good, clean off-roading fun, the Fushin, a smaller-than-normal all-terrain vehicle, seemed just the thing. 
 Except the Chinese import with jaunty yellow paint and a low $250 price tag was missing one feature: front brakes. 
 In the $5 billion market for A.T.V.'s, the skyrocketing growth of Chinese imports is becoming the latest challenge for the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which is starting a global campaign to improve the safety of a product that kills more people -- about 900 a year -- than any of the 15,000 other products the commission regulates. 
 Fushin, whose A.T.V. also had sharp handlebars that could cause injury, agreed in May to a voluntary recall of the models marketed for children. But that did not solve the larger problem. A few weeks ago, at the port of Houston, a shipload of Chinese A.T.V.'s that did not meet United States safety standards was seized by customs officials. 
 The Consumer Product Safety Commission is creating new safety rules under legislation passed last year that took voluntary industry standards for A.T.V.'s and made them mandatory. And it is scrutinizing sales of Chinese A.T.V.'s over the Internet. 
 ''We've seen cases where the Chinese manufacturers have not met our standards,'' said Inez Tenenbaum, the commission's chairwoman, who led a 10-member United States delegation that met last month with government officials and A.T.V. manufacturers in the industrial city of Taizhou in the Jiangsu Province of China. ''We explained to them, here are the specs that we have and you will have to build based on our standards.'' 
 That, however, may be easier said than done. While last year's legislation gave the commission broad new powers to regulate A.T.V.'s, both imported and American-made, the Chinese-made vehicles present a special problem. As is the case with other Chinese imports, like tainted toys and drywall, legal accountability can prove hard to establish, and the commission often can only clamp down on problem products after the damage has been done and reported. 
 A big concern is that most of the Chinese A.T.V.'s are used by children, some as young as 6. 
 The legislation expanding the commission's purview was the result of tainted imports from China in the first place -- contaminated pet food and toys coated in lead paint -- and covers items used by children under 12, including A.T.V.'s. 
 ''As with other products that come in from China,'' said Russ Reiner, a trial lawyer in Redding, Calif., who specializes in vehicle rollover cases, ''it is difficult for the commission to have a mandate that will really affect Chinese manufacturers. It is difficult to police. Many times, products come here through shell corporations. The commission can warn the public about products that are not safe. But generally, there is no action until after consumers make complaints.'' 
 Unlike automobiles, which face strict federal safety standards and whose users must be licensed, safety requirements for off-road vehicles are far more limited. Drivers of A.T.V.'s generally need no license, and teenagers frequently post videos on YouTube showing off their daring stunts. 
 For that reason, the commission has an active campaign with local media to publicize safety problems when they occur, including pointing the finger this week at the reality television father Jon Gosselin for riding an A.T.V. with a 5-year-old perched onboard. 
 For the most part, the A.T.V. market is divided into two groups: The first, in industry jargon, are the traditionals, which are big American and Japanese companies like Polaris, Honda, Yamaha, Arctic Cat, Kawasaki and Suzuki. The traditionals make and sell their products in the United States. 
 Chinese imports, which began to enter the market in the last decade, make up the second group. In 2002, fewer than 100,000 imported A.T.V.'s were sold, compared with 800,000 sold by the traditional sellers. 
 That gap has narrowed. Last year, according to a report from Power Products Marketing, a research firm based in Minneapolis, the traditionals sold only 220,000 more units than the Chinese, although both groups' sales have suffered in the economic downturn.
 Chinese A.T.V. makers specialize in the smaller, less-powerful vehicles that are usually used by children, from 6 to 16 years old. More than 83 percent of all youth vehicles are imports, while the traditional makers cater to the adult market and manufacture the bulk of the bigger models. 
 For parents, the appeal of a Chinese A.T.V. is not only its flashy design, but a price tag that is a third to a half lower than its domestic counterparts.
 ''It's basically a race to the bottom to see who can get the cheapest machine,'' said Matthew Camp, an industry analyst with Power Products. ''For some Chinese companies, it is how many units can they pump out in order to survive. Margins are thin and they have to pump them out to make money.''
 On average, the commission reports, more than 100 children are killed each year in A.T.V. accidents, and 40,000 more are sent to the emergency room. The commission does not break down whether those accidents occurred on Chinese A.T.V.'s or domestic ones. 
 Until last year's Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, A.T.V. safety standards were strictly voluntary and followed only by the traditional sellers. The trade association representing traditional A.T.V. makers welcomed the mandatory standards as a way of leveling the playing field with the imports. 
 Paul Vitrano, general counsel for the trade association the Specialty Vehicle Institute of America, accompanied Mrs. Tenenbaum on her trip to China.
 The mandatory standards govern design and require A.T.V. makers and dealers to provide buyers with free classes and videos in safe A.T.V. use. 
 ''Our trip to China showed there was a lack of understanding or information about the new standards,'' Mr. Vitrano said. ''We told the Chinese that there can be virtually no Chinese exports to the U.S. without compliance. Some companies are ahead of the game in complying. Others are not aware of it or don't understand what to do.'' 
 Of course, traditional sellers have much to gain from shutting their rising competitors out of the American market, or, at least, leveling the playing field. And most deaths on A.T.V.'s are adults, most often riding one of the traditional vehicles. 
 For that reason, consumer advocates say the mandatory standards are inadequate, regardless of who makes the vehicle. 
 ''A.T.V.'s have been killing and maiming for years,'' said Sue Rabe, who helped found Concerned Families for ATV Safety, after her 10-year-old son was killed when the A.T.V. he was driving rolled over and fell on him.
 ''This is taking the Chinese up to the American standard. But the American standard isn't good, either. These things should be regulated like cars. They are powerful and people don't understand that until it is too late. There is no way you can replace a loved one.'' 
 Rachel Weintraub, director of product safety for the Consumer Federation of America, said that domestic A.T.V. manufacturers supported mandatory safety standards to fight back against the increase in market share from the imports. 
 ''They wanted to shift the focus from safety in general to the Chinese imports,'' Ms. Weintraub said. ''We still have a problem. They are not looking at the vehicles and saying what can be done to reduce the number of deaths and injuries.'' 
 All A.T.V. makers face another challenge, too. The new safety legislation limits the lead content that can be in any product intended for use by children under 12, and A.T.V.'s have many lead parts. Rather than ban all child-size A.T.V.'s until the lead is removed, the Consumer Product Safety Commission placed a two-year stay on enforcing these provisions. 
 The delay was motivated by concern that if smaller A.T.V.'s were banned, children would just use adult-size vehicles. The commission says that more than 90 percent of the accidents involving children occur because they are operating A.T.V.'s that are too large and powerful for them. 
 David Corneille, the owner of Blackbeard Power Sports in Clinton Township, Mich., a Detroit suburb, said he did not see the popularity of Chinese models waning. 
 Over five years of selling Chinese imports, he says the quality has only gone up. Then there is the other factor. At his store, an average A.T.V. for a child sells for about $500, while a model for teenagers costs approximately $800. 
 ''With all the unemployment, it's tough for the American public,'' he said. ''They want something they can afford.''

HEADLINE: G.M. Seeks Assistance From Europe for Opel

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
As executives of General Motors met Monday with European officials to ask for financial help in overhauling its struggling auto operations, Germany reopened a bitter public debate over state aid and job protections that has sharply divided its government. 
 After talks in Brussels on Monday with European countries where G.M. has plants, Nick Reilly, the interim chief executive of the automaker's European operations, said the company was ''looking for support of any government that feels willing to be able to provide us some financing support in the medium term.''
 Last week Mr. Reilly outlined a plan to cut 20 to 25 percent of G.M.'s capacity for making cars in Europe, a move that would most likely eliminate thousands of jobs. The European unit, made up of Opel and Vauxhall, employs 50,000 people. 
 Representatives of Belgium, Britain, Germany, Poland, Spain and Sweden -- all countries with G.M. plants -- said after the meeting that they had agreed not to negotiate with the company over aid until a meeting Dec. 4, when it will have reviewed G.M.'s revamping plan.
 G.M. decided in September to keep its European operations rather than sell them as part of its overhaul. 
 This year, the German government offered 4.5 billion euros ($6.7 billion) in a bridge loan and loan guarantees if G.M. sold the majority of its European business to a consortium led by the Canadian car parts maker Magna International and the Russian lender Sberbank. 
 At the time, it was reported that Germany favored the Magna consortium's bid over a competing offer led by a United States private equity firm because Magna had promised to protect German jobs. That, in turn, led other countries where G.M. has plants to complain that Germany was protecting its own interests at the expense of workers in other countries.
 Before the meeting Monday, the German economics minister, Rainer Bruderle, warned that any decision to grant subsidies to G.M. in Europe might breach European Union rules over state aid. ''We do not see that the German taxpayer is prepared to be the rich uncle,'' Mr. Bruderle said on ARD public television in Germany.
 The deputy economics minister in Germany, Jochen Homann, said Monday, ''We are not going to participate in a race to see who can give the most state help.'' 
 Mr. Bruderle is a leading member of the pro-business Free Democrats, which this month became the new junior partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right coalition. The Free Democrats were staunchly against the Magna deal, which Mrs. Merkel had publicly supported.
 At the time, Mr. Bruderle, whose party was in the opposition, said the German taxpayer should not support the Magna-Sberbank deal because there was no clear strategy or revamping plan. 
 IG Metall, the influential German union that represents autoworkers, criticized Mr. Bruderle on Monday for ruling out state aid. ''If there is a plan, then the goal should be to prevent jobs losses,'' said Armin Schild, district leader of the union in Frankfurt and a member of Opel's supervisory board. 
 Union representatives said they hoped the future of the company's European work force would become clearer when they met Wednesday with Mr. Reilly to discuss revamping plans.
 ''It is of crucial importance to us that there is a complete financing until 2014,'' said Lothar Sorger, deputy labor leader of Opel at its Kaiserslautern plant in Germany. ''We do not want at all to find ourselves in the situation that they cancel once again'' investments in models and new development work. 
 European Union commissioners who also participated in the meeting Monday said in a statement that the countries had agreed that any financial support to G.M. would not be linked to where the company made commitments on job cuts. They also said any state aid had to facilitate efforts by carmakers to adapt production to declining demand.
 The European Union's industry commissioner, Gunter Verheugen, who is German, said pledges of financial subsidies would ''create ruinous competition'' for Germany's other major car manufacturers, including Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler.

HEADLINE: The Values Question

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
It's easy to get lost in the weeds when talking about health care reform. But, like all great public issues, the health care debate is fundamentally a debate about values. It's a debate about what kind of country we want America to be.
 During the first many decades of this nation's existence, the United States was a wide-open, dynamic country with a rapidly expanding economy. It was also a country that tolerated a large amount of cruelty and pain -- poor people living in misery, workers suffering from exploitation. 
 Over the years, Americans decided they wanted a little more safety and security. This is what happens as nations grow wealthier; they use money to buy civilization.
 Occasionally, our ancestors found themselves in a sweet spot. They could pass legislation that brought security but without a cost to vitality. But adults know that this situation is rare. In the real world, there's usually a trade-off. The unregulated market wants to direct capital to the productive and the young. Welfare policies usually direct resources to the vulnerable and the elderly. Most social welfare legislation, even successful legislation, siphons money from the former to the latter.
 Early in this health care reform process, many of us thought we were in that magical sweet spot. We could extend coverage to the uninsured but also improve the system overall to lower costs. That is, we thought it would be possible to reduce the suffering of the vulnerable while simultaneously squeezing money out of the wasteful system and freeing it up for more productive uses.
 That's what the management gurus call a win-win.
 It hasn't worked out that way. The bills before Congress would almost certainly ease the anxiety of the uninsured, those who watch with terror as their child or spouse grows ill, who face bankruptcy and ruin.
 And the bills would probably do it without damaging the care the rest of us receive. In every place where reforms have been tried -- from Massachusetts to Switzerland -- people come to cherish their new benefits. The new plans become politically untouchable.
 But, alas, there would be trade-offs. Instead of reducing costs, the bills in Congress would probably raise them. They would mean that more of the nation's wealth would be siphoned off from productive uses and shifted into a still wasteful health care system.
 The authors of these bills have tried to foster efficiencies. The Senate bill would initiate several interesting experiments designed to make the system more effective -- giving doctors incentives to collaborate, rewarding hospitals that provide quality care at lower cost. It's possible that some of these experiments will bloom into potent systemic reforms.
 But the general view among independent health care economists is that these changes will not fundamentally bend the cost curve. The system after reform will look as it does today, only bigger and more expensive.
 As Jeffrey S. Flier, dean of the Harvard Medical School, wrote in The Wall Street Journal last week, ''In discussions with dozens of health-care leaders and economists, I find near unanimity of opinion that, whatever its shape, the final legislation that will emerge from Congress will markedly accelerate national health-care spending rather than restrain it.''
 Rather than pushing all of the new costs onto future generations, as past governments have done, the Democrats have admirably agreed to raise taxes. Over the next generation, the tax increases in the various bills could funnel trillions of dollars from the general economy into the medical system.
 Moreover, the current estimates almost certainly understate the share of the nation's wealth that will have to be shifted. In these bills, the present Congress pledges that future Congresses will impose painful measures to cut Medicare payments and impose efficiencies. Future Congresses rarely live up to these pledges. Somebody screams ''Rationing!'' and there is a bipartisan rush to kill even the most tepid cost-saving measure. After all, if the current Congress, with pride of authorship, couldn't reduce costs, why should we expect that future Congresses will?
 The bottom line is that we face a brutal choice. 
 Reform would make us a more decent society, but also a less vibrant one. It would ease the anxiety of millions at the cost of future growth. It would heal a wound in the social fabric while piling another expensive and untouchable promise on top of the many such promises we've already made. America would be a less youthful, ragged and unforgiving nation, and a more middle-aged, civilized and sedate one.
 We all have to decide what we want at this moment in history, vitality or security. We can debate this or that provision, but where we come down will depend on that moral preference. Don't get stupefied by technical details. This debate is about values.

HEADLINE: The Gloves Come Off at Amazon and Wal-Mart

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE and STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Ali had Frazier. Coke has Pepsi. The Yankees have the Red Sox.
 Now Wal-Mart, the mightiest retail giant in history, may have met its own worthy adversary: Amazon.com.
 In what is emerging as one of the main story lines of the 2009 post-recession shopping season, the two heavyweight retailers are waging an online price war that is spreading through product areas like books, movies, toys and electronics.
 The tussle began last month as a relatively trivial but highly public back-and-forth over which company had the lowest prices on the most anticipated new books and DVDs this fall. By last week, it had spread to select video game consoles, mobile phones, even to the humble Easy-Bake Oven, a 45-year-old toy from Hasbro that usually heats up small cakes, not tensions between billion-dollar corporations.
 Last Wednesday, Wal-Mart dropped the price of the oven to $17, from $28, as part of its ''Black Friday'' deals. Later the same day, Amazon cut its price, which had also been $28, to $18. 
 ''It's not about the prices of books and movies anymore. There is a bigger battle being fought,'' said Fiona Dias, executive vice president at GSI Commerce, which manages the Web sites of large retailers. ''The price-sniping by Wal-Mart is part of a greater strategic plan. They are just not going to cede their business to Amazon.''
 Retailers are already fighting for every dollar consumers spend this holiday season. Sales are not expected to drop as much as they did last season, but the National Retail Federation, an industry group, predicts that they will decline 1 percent, to $437.6 billion.
 Of course, Wal-Mart and Amazon are fundamentally different companies, and for now, at least, Amazon poses little immediate threat to the behemoth from Bentonville, Ark. 
 Wal-Mart, with $405 billion in sales last year, dominates by offering affordable prices to Middle America in its 4,000 stores. Amazon is a relative schooner to Wal-Mart's ocean liner, with $20 billion in sales, mostly from affluent urbanites who would rather click with their mouse than push around a cart.
 This fight, then, is all about the future. Rapid expansion by each company, as well as profound shifts in the high-tech landscape, now make direct confrontation inevitable. Though online shopping accounts for only around 4 percent of retail sales, that percentage is growing quickly. E-commerce did not suffer as deeply as regular retailing during the economic malaise, and it is recovering faster than in-store shopping. People are also shopping on smartphones and from their HDTVs.
 Amazon, based in Seattle, has harnessed all of these trends, and is also behaving more like a traditional retailer. This fall it expanded its white-labeling program, slapping the Amazon brand onto audio and video cables and other products, and introduced same-day shipping in seven cities, trying to replicate the instant gratification of offline shopping.
 For rivals both real and putative, Amazon is expanding its slice of the retail pie at what must be an alarming rate. In the third quarter of this year, regular retail sales dipped by about 4 percent and e-commerce over all was flat. But Amazon sales shot up 24 percent, sending its shares soaring. 
 More important for Wal-Mart, sales in Amazon's electronics and general merchandise business -- which competes directly with much of the selection in Wal-Mart stores -- were up 44 percent. Wal-Mart does not break out Web sales, but it has been reported that its online business produces revenue of several billion dollars.
 ''If you are Wal-Mart, you want to have your proportional piece of this change in consumer behavior,'' said Scot Wingo, chief executive of ChannelAdvisor, which helps retailers sell online. ''You can even paint a scenario where e-commerce one day is 15 percent of all shopping, and that could really start to erode Wal-Mart's offline business.''
 That is why many analysts are unsurprised that Wal-Mart executives have placed Amazon squarely in their sights, with public throw-downs in interviews and pointed discounting. 
 It began last month with what appeared to be a public-relations-oriented competition on book prices, with both companies (along with Target, based in Minneapolis) dropping prices on books like ''Under the Dome,'' by Stephen King, to below $9.
 The companies then began jousting over the prices of DVDs. Less visibly, there were isolated skirmishes, some of which also lowered prices in Wal-Mart's stores. Wal-Mart offered a $15 gift card with a purchase of the new video game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 -- and Amazon matched soon after. 
 Wal-Mart and Amazon then both offered the Xbox 360 gaming console for $199 -- with a $100 gift card thrown in. Last week, they both began offering the new Palm Pixi phone for around $30 -- nearly $175 off the suggested retail price.
 Of course, online retailers have always competed on price, monitoring rivals' sites for changes and adjusting accordingly. 
 ''We've grown up in a supercompetitive environment where customers can check prices with one click, and we like it that way,'' said Craig Berman, an Amazon spokesman.
 But rhetoric from Wal-Mart itself has stoked the flames of rivalry. In an interview last week, Raul Vazquez, the president and chief executive of Walmart.com, asserted that the site was growing faster than Amazon's; suggested that Amazon Prime, a two-day-shipping service that costs $80 a year, was too expensive; and said that it was ''only a matter of time'' before Wal-Mart dominated Web shopping.
 ''Our company is based on low prices,'' Mr. Vazquez said, laying down a challenge. ''Even in books, we kept going until we were the low-price leader. And we will do that in every category if we need to.''
 Friction between the two companies is not entirely new. In the late 1990s, Amazon assembled at least some of its knowledge of retail supply chains by hiring away Wal-Mart employees. Wal-Mart sued, and the two companies settled privately. 
 In a battle over prices, Wal-Mart is on more familiar turf. With its unmatched size, Wal-Mart has more leverage than anyone to negotiate better terms with suppliers. Offering the lowest price ''is in our DNA,'' Mr. Vazquez said. 
 Among Amazon's advantages are a sophisticated distribution network built specifically for Web shopping, the thousands of outside sellers who offer products on Amazon.com, and a recognizable online brand. Amazon's customers also do not pay sales tax in most states, a crucial advantage that companies like Wal-Mart, and their lobbyists, are trying to eliminate.
 Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, is fond of saying that retailing is a big market with room for many winners. But for Ms. Dias, from GSI Commerce, Wal-Mart's campaign against Amazon is overdue. As an executive at the now-defunct Circuit City chain, and as an adviser to traditional retailers today, she says she has watched many companies overlook the long-term threat posed by Amazon.
 ''We have to put our foot down and refuse to let them grow more powerful,'' she said. ''I applaud Wal-Mart. It's about time multichannel retailers stood up and refused to let their business go away.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Ends 3-Day Losing Streak

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Wall Street held on to steep gains on Monday, channeling momentum from rallies in Europe and Asia and a renewed rush for gold.
 An early upturn, led by increases in shares of materials and energy companies like Chevron, was reinforced by an unexpected surge in home sales, feeding optimism over the health of the broader economy. 
 Stocks floated at high levels all day. After three days of losses, the Dow Jones industrial average finished up 132.79 points, or 1.29 percent, at 10,450.95. The wider Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 14.86 points, or 1.36 percent, at 1,106.24. The technology-dominated Nasdaq increased 29.97 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,176.01. 
 The gains were concentrated in the telecommunications sector. Sprint Nextel rose 3.7 percent, Verizon increased 3 percent and AT&T climbed 2.9 percent.
 After making modest gains late last week, the dollar weakened again, falling to slightly below $1.50 against the euro. Since the beginning of a rally in March, the weak dollar has emerged as one of the stock market's best allies. Low interest rates in the United States have led many normally risk-shy traders to jettison their reservations and turn to the stock markets in hopes of high returns.
 Gold, which tends to rise as the dollar weakens, reached $1,166.10 an ounce, a record. Oil rose slightly, to $77.56 a barrel.
 Investors were encouraged by a report by the National Association of Realtors that showed a 10.1 percent increase in sales of existing homes in October. Analysts had predicted a modest 2.3 percent increase, but a government-financed credit of up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers helped drive up demand. That credit was set to expire later this month, creating a buying frenzy in October, but Congress recently extended the credit through April.
 Renewal of the housing sector is seen as crucial to kick-starting consumer spending and turning around the broader economy. 
 ''The stronger-than-expected housing recovery will provide a welcome boost to consumption and employment,'' researchers at Capital Economics, based in Toronto, wrote in a research note on Monday. ''But such spillover effects will not be large enough to prevent a prolonged period of sluggish consumer spending and labor market weakness.''
 The focus this week is on retail sales, as stores prepare for the traditional start to the holiday shopping season on Friday.
 Jeffrey A. Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader's Almanac, said the gains on Monday were a result of a general optimism about coming retail sales, though he said that the number of stocks trading hands each day remained low.
 ''I think we're at the beginning of that seasonal sweet spot,'' he said. ''I don't see that robust of a consumer sector out there, but it's a lot better than last year.''
 Linda A. Duessel, equity markets strategist at Federated Investors, said the rise in home sales gave Wall Street hope that consumers would increase spending in the holiday season.
 ''What's going to get us the next level higher in the markets will be a consumer who is actually spending, which the market is not expecting,'' Ms. Duessel said. ''Any sign that the consumer actually does want to spend could be another catalyst that fuels the next advance.''
 Investors also seemed encouraged by remarks by the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, James Bullard. Mr. Bullard said on Sunday that the central bank should extend its mortgage-backed securities buying program beyond its expiration date in March. That decision would keep interest rates low and help keep the dollar weak.
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 5/32, to 100 7/32, and the yield fell to 3.35 percent, from 3.37 percent late Friday.
 In Europe, the FTSE 100 in Britain was up 1.98 percent, and the DAX in Germany was up 2.44 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 1.4 percent. 
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills and two-year notes:

PERSON: Daniel Rowen 

HEADLINE: Daniel Rowen, 56, Modernist Architect

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Daniel Rowen, a highly regarded architect whose modernist designs for houses, apartments and commercial spaces attracted a number of prominent clients, died on Nov. 17 in Manhattan. He was 56.
 The cause was neuroendocrine cancer, his wife, Coco Myers, said. 
 For more than a decade Mr. Rowen was the principal of Daniel Rowen Architect, which had offices in Manhattan and, beginning in 2003, East Hampton, N.Y., where he lived. 
 His high-profile projects included the sprawling headquarters for Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia in the vast Starrett-Lehigh Building, on 26th Street between 11th and 12th Avenues in Manhattan. Mr. Rowen preserved the openness of the loftlike space while creating elegant work environments within it.
 Mr. Rowen was a protege of the modernist architect Charles Gwathmey, who died in August. In 1984 he formed a partnership with Frank Lupo, who had also worked under Mr. Gwathmey. Mr. Lupo recalled one of Mr. Rowen's favorite projects: a Park Avenue apartment that was entirely white and practically devoid of furniture. ''The clients wanted a Zen environment in the middle of Manhattan, wiped clean of any domesticity,'' Mr. Lupo said.
 One area of the home, with a low glass-top table, was designated Space No. 1; another, with a raised sculpture platform, was Space No. 2; a third area, with white pallets in a closet, was Space No. 3. ''This is not the apartment to hunker down in with a long book on a cold winter night,'' Mr. Rowen said in an interview with The New York Times in 1996, ''but it probably is a good place to listen to music.'' 
 Daniel Jared Rowen was born in Washington, the youngest of three children of Hobart Rowen, who became the chief economics correspondent of The Washington Post, and Alice Stadler Rowen. He attended architecture school at Yale, then worked for Gwathmey Siegel & Associates before he and Mr. Lupo started their firm, New York Architects.
 The partners' first project was an office for the art dealer Larry Gagosian. For Mr. Rowen that began a decades-long relationship with Mr. Gagosian that culminated this year with two projects for him on Madison Avenue: a large addition to his uptown gallery and a new Gagosian store.
 In 1999 an apartment designed by Mr. Rowen and Mr. Lupo was included in ''The Un-Private House,'' a show at the Museum of Modern Art. The apartment, dating to the 1980s, had electronics that were ahead of their time, the museum's catalog said.
 Mr. Rowen also created a minimalist office for the hotelier Ian Schrager as well as a luxurious apartment, in collaboration with Philippe Starck, for Mr. Schrager's family on Central Park West. ''He was working on an addition to my house on Long Island when he died,'' Mr. Schrager said in a telephone interview on Thursday. 
 Another Rowen-Lupo project was an austere white office on Lexington Avenue for Osho International, a company that owned the copyright to works by an Indian mystic. Mr. Rowen described one feature, of translucent glass, acid-etched on one side and polished like a mirror on the other, as a ''soft, glowing wall.''
 He married Ms. Myers, a writer and editor, in 1993, after they met on a blind date. The wedding was the subject of a ''Vows'' column in The Times, which began: ''Few people believed that Daniel Rowen would ever marry. A talkative, analytical architect in his late 30s who races vintage cars, he has for the past five years been the host of a men-only party in celebration of bachelorhood.''
 The couple had three children, Max, Harrison and Jensen. They also survive him, as do his sister, Judith Vereker of London, and his brother, James, of Milwaukee.

HEADLINE: Slow Month for Retailers, but Strong Finish Is Seen

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
A few weeks into the holiday shopping season, consumers are still not reaching for their wallets. 
 After a fairly robust October, retail sales slowed in November as the nation's stores entered their critical time of year. Major sectors like apparel, luxury goods and jewelry experienced slight sales declines.
 That might seem like an ominous sign about how the chains will fare this Christmas. But retailing analysts said the declines were minor and that many consumers were saving their powder for the day after Thanksgiving, the blowout shopping day known as Black Friday. 
 Retailing veterans expect stores to be bustling on Friday as frugal consumers hunt for bargains with newfound purpose. Retailing professionals are also cheered that stores have less inventory today than they did this time last year.
 ''Last year, we were in emergency nuclear discounting mode,'' said Michael McNamara, vice president for research and analysis at SpendingPulse, an information service by MasterCard Advisors. ''This year, it's more strategic in nature.''
 For Nov. 1 to 14, sales of women's clothing declined 3.3 percent and sales of men's clothing fell 1 percent compared with last year, according to SpendingPulse, which estimates sales for all forms of payment, including cash, checks and credit cards. Luxury goods posted the biggest year-over-year decline, falling 9.2 percent.
 Those declines were not as bad, though, as the double-digit losses that stores experienced last year and into early 2009. For instance, the women's clothing category had posted nine months of double-digit sales declines since October 2008. 
 In short, the retailing landscape does not look great, but it has stabilized. A couple of sectors even posted year-over-year sales increases for the first half of November, including electronics (up 6.1 percent) and online shopping (up 19.4 percent).
 Retailers and industry analysts pay close attention to sales figures this time of year because it is when stores do the most business. The Friday after Thanksgiving is merely one day out of an entire season, of course, but it is usually one of the busiest days. 
 Last year, sales over Thanksgiving weekend declined 1.01 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to SpendingPulse. That was a departure from previous years, when sales rose briskly -- up 4.5 percent in 2007, up 6.1 percent in 2006 and up 5.7 percent in 2005. 
 For several years, spending on that weekend had been a good indicator of how the rest of the holiday season would unfold. But last year, the slight decline in Black Friday sales was much better than the sharp decrease for the entire season. That was in part because of the wild discounting that was taking place. 
 For example, sales of luxury goods last Thanksgiving weekend rose 2.9 percent as upscale stores drastically cut prices and consumers swooped in for once-in-a-lifetime deals. But sales of luxury goods for the entire holiday shopping season sank a whopping 20.9 percent, according to SpendingPulse. 
 The National Retail Federation, an industry group, is optimistic about sales this coming weekend. The group said Monday that newly frugal consumers eager for discounts may drive sales up from last year. A survey conducted for the federation by BIGresearch found that as many as 134 million people will shop Friday, Saturday or Sunday -- up from the 128 million people who planned to do so last year.
 Mr. McNamara, of SpendingPulse, was not as sure. He said that while the economic deceleration has slowed, it may be difficult to outperform last year's Thanksgiving weekend results, given that consumers have been more tightfisted in the months since.
 A survey published on Monday by the global business advisory firm AlixPartners found that 87 percent of consumers plan to spend the same or less than they did last Christmas. Analysts at the firm said consumers were skittish about the high unemployment rate and would do most of their holiday shopping at value-priced chains. Some consumers may hold out for the deep discounts of last Christmas, but analysts and stores alike said those shoppers would be waiting in vain. 
 For the entire 2009 holiday shopping season, November and December, sales are expected to be about the same as last year. The National Retail Federation predicted sales would decline 1 percent, to $437.6 billion, below the 10-year average of 3.4 percent holiday season growth, though not as bad as last year's 3.4 percent drop. Some equity analysts and market research groups say they think that figure is too low, though. The International Council of Shopping Centers, another industry group, predicted holiday sales would rise 1 to 2 percent.
 While there is disagreement over the likely results for the season, the general consensus is that sales this weekend will be relatively healthy, with business tapering off on Saturday and even more so on Sunday.

HEADLINE: Matching Architecture to the Art in a New Miami Museum

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
Why is it so hard to design a great contemporary-art museum?
 This question has been bothering art lovers for a while. One institution after another has embarked on vast new building projects over the last decade, and in nearly every case the museum and its architects struggled to figure out the right balance between architectural expression and the need to showcase art. Yet after all this time and all those buildings, the question is still being asked.
 No architects have been more deeply or visibly embroiled in this struggle than the Swiss team of Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron. Since the 2001 opening of their Tate Modern -- a building that instantly became the emblem of London's rise as an art world capital -- they have designed more than half a dozen art museums, each one a provocative reworking of the conventional formula. 
 Much of this work paid off. Their Schaulager in Basel, Switzerland, a mixture of galleries and art storage spaces that opened in 2003, is considered by many to be one of the most appealingly intimate places to look at art built in recent memory. But other designs, like the 2005 expansion of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, got decidedly mixed reviews in the art world, with some critics arguing that too much of the architects' personalities had seeped into the galleries. And in retrospect the Tate Modern, with its huge public spaces and huger crowds, may function better as a spectacle than an art space.
 The team's recently unveiled design for the Miami Art Museum is likely to ignite the debate all over again. Some architects no doubt will snipe that it looks too safe, an insult in design circles, as if Mr. Herzog and Mr. de Meuron were inspired by a fear of inciting yet more art world ire. On a breathtaking site overlooking Biscayne Bay, its boxy exterior, surrounded by slim 50-foot columns and capped by a vast flat roof, it could even be momentarily confused with 1960s-era performing arts developments like the Kennedy Center.
 But the design for the Miami Art Museum is not a regurgitation of outmoded historical forms. Instead it breaks those forms apart and then pieces them back together to create something wholly new. It's as if the architects had stepped back to contemplate the long arc of museum designs -- including their own -- before moving forward again along the evolutionary chain.
 The $130 million building project has been overseen by Terry Riley, a former head of the Museum of Modern Art's department of architecture and design who helped plan that museum's expansion, and who was the Miami museum's director until his resignation last month. (Mr. Riley is returning to his architectural practice, but he will continue to lead the Miami project as a consultant. Financing comes largely from a $100 million local bond issue. (The museum is still raising money for an endowment to help pay for operating expenses and acquisitions.) 
 The museum is to face Biscayne Bay to the east and a vast public park, scheduled to begin construction next year, to the south. It is intended to be part of a cultural development that also includes a planned Science Museum by Grimshaw Architects. 
 Mr. Herzog and Mr. de Meuron's design has strong connections to Classical and modern precedents. It is part of a lineage that reaches back past postwar performing arts centers to Mies van der Rohe's New National Gallery and Karl Friedrich Schinkel's neo-Classical Altes Museum, all the way to the Parthenon.
 The architects reinforce the sense of grandeur by placing their building up on a concrete platform, as if to stress art's elevated status. A grand staircase -- nearly the entire 180-foot width of the platform -- connects it to the waterfront: something like the grand staircase in front of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but with a better view. A smaller stair connects to the park. 
 The first sign that something unexpected is going on here is a surprising feeling of weightlessness. The base, which would typically be a heavy solid platform, is conceived as a thin concrete slab that seems to hover several feet above the ground. Resting on top of it, the lobby, restaurant, auditorium and galleries are broken down into a cluster of boxlike forms, some of them weighing down the core of the composition; others cantilevering out over the deck.
 Seen from a distance the museum will look like it is levitating, the various parts about to float off in different directions. Only the vast trellislike roof -- and the columns that support it -- seems to hold everything in place. Gardens and light wells are set into the platform deck. Hanging gardens, some as long as 40 feet, are suspended from the roof, giving the impression that the building is being swallowed up by its natural surroundings. (The scene might bring to mind a post-apocalyptic science fiction fantasy.)
 The idea is to maintain art's place on the pedestal of high culture while allowing for a more mixed experience. Yet the instability of some of the forms also suggests a more ambivalent view of art's place in the world -- one that acknowledges that for more than a century that pedestal has been increasingly wobbly as the boundaries between art, fashion and fame have blurred. 
 Another grand staircase leads up from near the center of the platform to the second-floor galleries. Most of these are organized in a relatively straightforward sequence. At various points visitors will be able to step off this main route into smaller ''focus'' galleries that are intended for specific artists.
 Some of the galleries are punctuated with big floor-to-ceiling windows, which I have often found to be distracting in a museum. (One of the biggest cliches of architecture in the 1990s was that museum galleries had to be designed to prevent ''museum fatigue'' -- the exhaustion some people feel as they walk from one gallery to the next -- and the idea has not yet entirely died out.)
 But the architects have also designed a system of movable partitions that can be used to block out windows as well as divide the galleries into smaller spaces. That flexibility will be particularly important, since the Miami museum -- like many other museums that launched expansion plans during the past decade -- has only a modest collection, which it hopes to build up over the years.
 The building does not have the striking originality of the Schaulager, which is as much an expression of the personal vision of Maja Oeri, the woman who conceived the museum, as of the talents of its designers. There, as you move up through the building from the main galleries to the storage rooms -- essentially compact galleries themselves, open by appointment -- the closeness you feel with the art builds, and the rest of the world falls away. 
 This is a more conventional project, in which the architects had to deal with the competing interests and demands of county and city officials as well as the museum's board. They also had to grapple with many of the issues that have made the design of contemporary art museums so perplexing: the growing role of cultural tourism in urban economies, the shifting nature of the audience, a young unfocused collection.
 The Miami Art Museum building avoids the pitfalls of much recent museum design, which is no small feat. It has found an uneasy middle ground: mesmerizing architecture that nonetheless will put curators and their audiences at ease.

HEADLINE: A Survey Shows Pain Of Recession For Artists

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
A major new survey of American artists and how they are weathering the economic downturn has found that slightly more than half experienced a drop in income from 2008 to 2009, a blow to an already struggling group, two thirds of whose members reported that they earned less than $40,000 last year.
 More than 5,300 practitioners in fields like painting, filmmaking and architecture participated in the online survey, a larger response than expected, providing a detailed look at the state of the country's artists, a group that the Census Bureau numbers at more than two million. 
 Many of the findings -- that working artists tend to work day jobs to support themselves; that more than a third don't have adequate health insurance; that musicians and architects tend to do better than writers and painters -- simply provide statistical support for what artists themselves have long known.
 But it also found that the recession has been exceptionally tough for many artists. Eighteen percent of those who responded said their income had dropped 50 percent or more in the last year.
 The survey was conducted in July and August and commissioned by a nonprofit artist-support organization called Leveraging Investments in Creativity, which worked with Princeton Survey Research Associates International and the Helicon Collaborative, a consulting firm that advises nonprofits. 
 The researchers found that in general very few artists' incomes approach six figures. While the majority of artists have college degrees, only 6 percent said they earned $80,000 or more. 
 ''A lot of the artists who were reporting were telling us, 'I live in a recession all the time, so this downturn has really not been so different for me,' '' said Judilee Reed, the executive director of Leveraging Investments in Creativity. 
 (The groups that conducted the survey, which was paid for in part by the Ford Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts, publicized the survey through arts organizations and acknowledged that as a result it might not reflect the ''experiences of the entire population of practicing artists in the United States.'' But they added that the data were weighted to hew as closely as possible to Census Bureau demographics for artists.) 
 The artists surveyed tended to earn either very little of their overall income from their artwork or almost all of it. Slightly more than 40 percent said that in 2008 they earned 20 percent or less of their total income from their art. 
 But at the other end of the spectrum 28 percent said creative work accounted for 80 percent or more of their income, and those artists were often those whose incomes were higher, $80,000 or more. Visual artists (who made up half of the respondents) and writers were more likely to earn 20 percent or less of their income from art. 
 Even artists whose second jobs have carried them through the downturn relatively unscathed said that the climate for creative work was more difficult. Esther Robinson, a Brooklyn filmmaker whose 2007 documentary, ''A Walk Into the Sea: Danny Williams and the Warhol Factory,'' was partly paid for with credit cards, money later recouped with an advance from a distributor, said, ''This year there are almost no advances available for the same kind of film that is of a certain quality and that is theatrically releasable.''
 Ms. Robinson, who also runs a nonprofit arts organization that she founded, said that she was concentrating on short films because ''I don't see a way to finance any of the feature ideas I have for documentaries right now.''
 Perhaps because artists tend to have an idealistic bent, the survey found, however, that many also reported upsides to the downturn: that it has given them freedom to experiment and to spend more time on their art when avenues for making money are closed. James Vira, a Manhattan architect who recently lost his job in a round of layoffs at Cooper, Robinson & Partners, is trying to make it on his own by doing consulting work, taking on small projects and designing furniture and other objects.
 ''It's allowing me to pursue things that I really want to pursue, and it's working out so far,'' said Mr. Vira, the father of two young children. ''I'm very, very hopeful. But I still check the want ads -- as a habit, I guess.''

HEADLINE: The Biology Behind the Milk of Human Kindness

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER

 BODY:
As the festival of mandatory gratitude looms into view, allow me to offer a few suggestions on what, exactly, you should be thankful for. 
 Be thankful that, on at least one occasion, your mother did not fend off your father with a pair of nunchucks, but instead allowed enough contact to facilitate your happy conception. Be thankful that when you go to buy a pale, poultrylike entity, the grocery clerk will accept your credit card in good faith and even return it with a heroic garble of your last name. Be grateful for the empathetic employee working the United Airlines ticket counter the day after Thanksgiving, who understands why you must leave town today, this very minute, lest someone pull out the family nunchucks. 
 Above all, be thankful for your brain's supply of oxytocin, the small, celebrated peptide hormone that, by the looks of it, helps lubricate our every prosocial exchange, the thousands of acts of kindness, kind-of kindness and not-as-nakedly-venal-as-I-could-have-been kindness that make human society possible. Scientists have long known that the hormone plays essential physiological roles during birth and lactation, and animal studies have shown that oxytocin can influence behavior too, prompting voles to cuddle up with their mates, for example, or to clean and comfort their pups. Now a raft of new research in humans suggests that oxytocin underlies the twin emotional pillars of civilized life, our capacity to feel empathy and trust.
 Reporting this month in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that genetic differences in people's responsiveness to the effects of oxytocin were linked to their ability to read faces, infer the emotions of others, feel distress at others' hardship and even to identify with characters in a novel or ''Doonesbury.'' ''I came into this research as a big skeptic,'' said Sarina M. Rodrigues of Oregon State University, an author of the new report, ''but the results had me floored.'' 
 Oxytocin may also be a capitalist tool. In a series of papers that appeared in Nature, Neuron and elsewhere, Ernst Fehr, director of the Institute for Empirical Research in Economics at the University of Zurich, and his colleagues showed that the hormone had a remarkable effect on the willingness of people to trust strangers with their money. In the Nature study, 58 healthy male students were given a single nasal squirt of either oxytocin or a placebo solution and, 50 minutes later, were instructed to start playing rounds of the Trust Game with each other, using monetary units they could either invest or withhold.
 The researchers found that the oxytocin-enhanced subjects were significantly more likely than the placebo players to trust their financial partners: whereas 45 percent of the oxytocin group agreed to invest the maximum amount of money possible, just 21 percent of the control group proved so amenable. Moreover, the researchers showed that the oxytocin boost didn't simply make subjects more willing to take risks and throw their money around. When participants knew they were playing against a computer rather than a human being, there was no difference in investment strategy between the groups. Trust, it seems, is a strictly wetware affair.
 Yet the hormone doesn't turn you into a sucker. In the Nov. 1 issue of Biological Psychiatry, Simone Shamay-Tsoory of the University of Haifa and her colleagues reported that when participants in a game of chance were pitted against a player they considered arrogant, a nasal spritz of oxytocin augmented their feelings both of envy whenever the haughty one won and of schadenfreudian gloating when their opponent lost. 
 As a rule, though, oxytocin is a joiner not a splitter. Analogues of the molecule are found in fish, perhaps to help facilitate the delicate business of fertilization, by inhibiting a fish's natural tendency to flee from other fish. The more elaborate grew the social demands, the more roles oxytocin assumed, reaching its apotheosis in mammals. If you're going to give birth to a litter of needy young, why not let the same signal that helped push those mewlers into the world give you tips on their care and feeding? And if you're a human, bent on turning everything into an extended family affair, here is oxytocin again to cheerlead and teleprompt. C. Sue Carter of the University of Illinois at Chicago, a pioneer in the study of oxytocin, suspects that the association between the hormone and childbirth long kept scientists from taking it seriously. ''But now that it's been brought into the world of economics and finance,'' Dr. Carter said, ''suddenly it's very hot.''
 Oxytocin acts as a hormone, traveling through the bloodstream to affect organs far from its origin in the brain, and as a kind of neurotransmitter, allowing brain cells to communicate. Unlike most neurotransmitters, oxytocin seems to deliver its signal through just one receptor, one protein designed to recognize its shape and shudder accordingly when clasped; dopamine and serotonin, by contrast, each have five or more receptors assigned to their care. Yet the precise contours of oxytocin's hardworking receptor differ among individuals, to apparently noticeable effect.
 In their new study, Dr. Rodrigues and Laura R. Saslow and Dacher Keltner of the University of California, Berkeley, looked at how two variants in the genetic code for the receptor might influence a person's capacity for empathy, as measured by a standard empathy questionnaire (''I really get involved with the feelings of the characters in a novel'') and a behavioral task called ''Reading the Mind in the Eyes.'' In it, participants looked at 36 black-and-white photographs of people's eyes and were asked to choose the word that best described each subject's mood. Uneasy, defiant, contemplative, playful? In a related measure of oxytocin's presumed calming effects, subjects were also tested for how strongly they reacted to the stress of hearing a series of loud noises. 
 In their sample of 192 male and female college students, the researchers found that those carrying the so-called A version of the oxytocin receptor, which previous reports had associated with autism and poor parenting skills, scored significantly lower on the eye-reading task and higher on the stress-prone test than did subjects with the G variant of the receptor. 
 ''We're all different, and that's a good thing,'' Dr. Rodrigues said. ''If everyone were gooey and lovey-dovey, it would be an obnoxious world.'' As she drolly admitted, she herself is Type A.

HEADLINE: Optimism in China, but at What Price?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Nation of Futurity'' (column, Nov. 17):
 While David Brooks rhapsodizes about the productivity and optimism of contemporary China, he does not mention some very ugly blemishes. For the whole of their remarkably long history, the people of China have proved themselves willing to live under repressive regimes that have no patience for dissent. 
 The emperors, ideologues and technocrats who have ruled China have been superficially very different. The cowed obedience they demand of the general population has been, and remains, sadly the same.
 And while the economic transformation that has taken place in the last generation is impressive, it has come at a high cost. Much of the Chinese landscape is now poisoned by levels of pollution found in few other places in the world.
 And China's behavior toward other countries and cultures can be described as brutally pragmatic at best. Its systematic disemboweling of the indigenous culture of Tibet, which included mass murder and the destruction of thousands of unique monasteries, is the most extreme and contemptible example of this.
 So, yes, China makes a lot of things and has become much wealthier. But in the grand scheme of things, this doesn't impress me as much as it does Mr. Brooks.
 David Hayden Wilton, Conn., Nov. 17, 2009
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks states that ''the anxiety in America is caused by the vague sense that they [the Chinese] have what we're supposed to have.'' I disagree completely.
 I think our national anxiety is based on our experience that no matter how hard we work or how well we adhere to the rules, the rich will always get richer and the rest of us will struggle. Our national policies provide no relief for the middle class, encourage the shipping of manufacturing jobs overseas and support the profit-making requirements of our health care system and Wall Street.
 The worst of it is that it doesn't seem to matter who holds the majority in Washington. Money talks and the rest of us walk.
 It's no surprise that the majority of Americans aren't so optimistic about the future. We're too broke, unemployed, uninsured and foreclosed on to maintain that sunny outlook.

HEADLINE: Home Sales in October Rose to a 2-Year High

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Existing-home sales in October rose to the highest level in more than two years, according to a report released Monday, driven by the popularity of a credit for first-time home buyers. The surge far outpaced expectations and nurtured hope that the stubbornly frail housing market might be on the upswing. 
 Sales of existing homes were up 10.1 percent in October to an annual rate of 6.1 million, the National Association of Realtors said in a report Monday. That was a level last seen in February 2007, before the collapse of the housing sector. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News had predicted a 2.3 percent increase. 
 The group attributed the gain to the popularity of a government-financed credit of up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers. The credit was originally set to expire at the end of November, and economists said the looming deadline probably provoked a buying frenzy in October. (Earlier this month, lawmakers voted to extend the credit through April.) 
 Inventories continued to shrink, the report said, and prices, while still lower, fell by the smallest amount in more than a year. Sales of lower-cost homes fueled the gains.
 Total sales were up 23.5 percent from the October 2008 rate of 4.94 million. In addition, sales for the 12-month period from October 2008 to October 2009 reached 4.4 million, up slightly from the October 2007 to October 2008 levels.
 The gains, which were most robust in the Midwest and weakest in the West, surprised even Lawrence Yun, the chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. Mr. Yun cautioned that future results might be more modest. ''With such a sale spike, a measurable decline should be anticipated in December and early next year before another surge in spring and early summer,'' he said.
 Economists closely monitor trends in home sales because their effects ripple through the economy. Consumers, in effect, are not just buying houses: they are also furnishing them with items like washers, tables and mattresses, and they must take out loans to finance them. Once Americans begin to spend again, analysts expect businesses will resume hiring and the economy will be on firmer ground.
 The report examined sales of single-family homes, as well as condos and co-ops. The group revised its September figures, saying home sales rose by 8.8 percent rather than the 9.4 percent it originally reported, to an annual rate of 5.54 million.
 Even amid inklings of a turnaround for the housing market, there are still reminders that the sector remains very weak. 
 Celia Chen, senior director at Moody'sEconomy.com, noted that sales of existing homes -- especially those that have been foreclosed and tend to be cheaper -- might be slowing the pace of home construction, as builders grapple with low demand for expensive new homes. 
 ''The housing sector needs help,'' she said. ''It's important to shore up the market because that is a large part of the economy and will be helpful in stabilizing the broader economy.''
 And while home sales may be picking up, consumers are still struggling to keep up with bills. The Mortgage Bankers Association said last week that nearly one in 10 homeowners with mortgages -- about five million households -- was at least one payment behind in the third quarter.

HEADLINE: Revisiting Cuts in Travel

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
When the economy collapsed last fall, many companies had to make some quick decisions about travel, typically one of the first areas they trim when finances are tight. Should they cut back as most of their competitors were, continue business as usual or spend even more to get a leg up?
 Most companies -- about 85 percent -- decreased travel spending, according to the National Business Travel Association, a trade group. But two recent reports, commissioned independently by the business travel association and another trade group, the U.S. Travel Association, found a clear link between business travel and corporate profit. 
 While both groups have an interest in promoting business travel, Henry H. Harteveldt, travel analyst for Forrester Research, agreed that in-person meetings were important in promoting business. ''We are social beings,'' he said. ''There are emotional as well as rational benefits to face-to-face meetings.'' 
 Ultimately, he added, ''Nothing replaces two business people building a professional relationship in person.''
 But he said companies should avoid unnecessary expenses and ensure that travel was purposeful. With forethought, Mr. Harteveldt said, ''there can be enormous benefits.'' But companies must be careful not to overreact. Relying too much on technology or cutting back too sharply, he said, ''can be just as harmful as wasting money on business travel.''
 Geoff Freeman, senior vice president for public affairs for the U.S. Travel Association, said that business travel was unfairly characterized as an excessive perk in the wake of the taxpayer-financed bank bailouts last year. ''It left the industry terribly exposed,'' he said. ''There was anger, there was emotion, but there was not enough data.'' 
 Adam Sacks, managing director of Oxford Economics, the firm that prepared the U.S. Travel Association report, said the results confirmed the bottom-line value of business travel using government data that covered 14 economic sectors over 13 years, a broad review of related research and surveys of corporate executives and business travelers.
 To some extent, Mr. Sacks said, the findings confirmed what business people already knew intuitively: curbing travel may save money in the short term, but there are significant long-term benefits from investing in business travel. ''Not all cuts are smart cuts,'' he said. 
 Last fall and spring, Brian Jacobsen, co-president of Madison Park Greetings, a stationery and gift company in Seattle, said he carefully weighed how best to ride out the tough economic climate, and ''made a strategic decision to do more travel.'' He made cuts in other areas, and paid almost every bill using credit cards so the company could earn free tickets. ''We have actually increased our travel budget this year by 20 percent,'' he said. ''We saw it as an opportunity to have more of a presence while our competitors have been cutting back.'' 
 In September, for example, his company provided the featured gift tote bags for celebrities at a fund-raising luncheon before the Emmy Awards in Los Angeles. He also sent the designer of the bags to network there. Her presence was not essential but ''led to all sorts of opportunities,'' he said. 
 The company was asked to provide gifts for similar philanthropic events preceding the American Music Awards this past weekend and the Golden Globe Awards in January, Mr. Jacobsen said. ''It was all the result of one travel trip.'' 
 Brian Parish, president of IData, a technology consulting company for higher education based in Alexandria, Va., said he, too, saw the direct effect of in-person encounters. Earlier this year, negotiations for a couple of projects stalled. ''They seemed on the fence,'' he recalled. ''We braced ourselves.'' So he quickly flew out to meet the prospective clients.
 ''We got the deal,'' in both cases, said Mr. Parish, who estimated the accounts to be worth a total of well over $400,000. ''They were two clients we probably wouldn't have had without making the trip. It showed them we were serious,'' he said. 
 Craig A. Banikowski, president of the National Business Travel Association, noted in an e-mail message that two separate studies reached essentially the same conclusion. ''When you read either study,'' he said, ''you come away with the same questions: Is my business investing enough in traveling? Are my competitors going to gain the edge by optimizing their travel? Answering these questions effectively could mean the difference between surviving and thriving as we climb out of the recession.'' 
 Brooks C. Holtom, associate professor of management at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University, said he was initially skeptical of the two reports. After reading both, Professor Holtom said that ''deeper analysis would have benefited organizational decision makers since the return on investment varies substantially by type of travel and industry.'' 
 But despite some concerns, ''I agree with the broad findings'' of the reports, he said, ''In fact, relationships with people matter. All else equal, people do business with people they like.''
 Mitch Mounger, president of Sunrise Identity, a promotional merchandise agency in the Seattle area, said his company had struggled to maintain the right balance.
 ''We certainly have felt the pain of the economic downturn, and it has impacted our business travel decisions,'' Mr. Mounger said. He no longer has a set travel budget, for example, and each trip must be justified. ''There are less fishing expeditions,'' he said. 
 The company now uses several strategies to make trips affordable and productive, like arranging meetings all in one day to avoid hotel stays, and clustering cities and regions into one trip rather than making several. Sales representatives even call on colleagues' clients if they happen to be in the area, unheard of before. 
 ''We believe in business travel,'' Mr. Mounger said. ''You just have to be smart about it.'' 
 He added, ''I don't have data, but every time we do it, good things happen.''

HEADLINE: Signs Of Hope

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

DATELINE: Detroit 

 BODY:
 I came to Detroit and its environs, the seat of America's glorious industrial past, to see if I could get a glimpse of the future. Is the economic, social and physical deterioration that has caused so much misery in the Motor City a sign of what's in store for larger and larger segments of the United States?
 Or are there new industries waiting in the wings -- some of them right here in the Detroit metropolitan area -- with new jobs and bright new prospects for whole new generations of American dreamers? 
 I found real reason to hope when a gentleman named Stan Ovshinsky took me on a tour of a remarkably quiet and pristine manufacturing plant in Auburn Hills, which is about 30 miles north of Detroit and is home to Chrysler's headquarters. What is being produced in the plant is potentially revolutionary. A machine about the length of a football field runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, turning out mile after mile after mile of thin, flexible solar energy material, from which solar panels can be sliced and shaped. 
 You want new industry in the United States, with astonishing technological advances, new mass production techniques and jobs, jobs, jobs? Try energy. 
 Mr. Ovshinsky knows as much or more about the development and production of alternative energy as anyone on the planet. He developed the technology and designed the production method that made it possible to produce solar material ''by the mile.'' When he proposed the idea years ago, based on the science of amorphous materials, which he invented, he was ridiculed.
 But the thin-film photovoltaic solar panel was just one of his revolutionary ideas. He invented the nickel metal hydride battery that is in virtually all hybrid vehicles on the road today. And when I pulled into the parking lot outside his office in Bloomfield Hills, he promptly installed me in the driver's seat of a hydrogen hybrid prototype -- a car in which the gasoline tank had been replaced with a safe solid-state hydrogen storage system invented by Mr. Ovshinsky.
 Within minutes, I was driving along a highway in a car that produced zero pollution. No carbon footprint whatsoever. How's that for a wave of the future?
 The point is that these (and many more) brilliant, innovative technologies are here. They are real, tangible. They exist. What's needed now is the will to develop policies that will vastly expand these advances and radically reduce their costs. The United States should be leading the world in the creation of whole new energy technologies and industries, instead of allowing the forces of the old carbon-based industries -- coal, oil, gasoline-powered vehicles -- to stand obstinately in the way of real progress.
 ''Now,'' Mr. Ovshinsky told me, ''is when we have to build the new industries of the future.'' He has always been driven by the desire to use science and technology to solve the real-world problems of real people, and that has meant creating employment and stopping the pollution of the planet. He and his late wife, Iris, formed a company (to become known as Energy Conversion Devices) in Detroit in 1960 with the idea of using their considerable talents, as he put it, ''to do good, to change the world.'' 
 After nearly a half-century of revolutionary innovations with the company, Mr. Ovshinsky retired two years ago to focus his attention on the difficult and time-consuming effort to make solar energy economically competitive with coal and oil. ''I know solar energy can't live up to its possibilities unless it's a hell of a lot cheaper,'' he said.
 He believes he has assembled a team that, with sustained, intense work under his direction -- and if sufficient funding can be secured -- will bring the price of solar power below that of coal and oil within a few years.
 What's weird is that this man, with such a stellar track record of innovation on products and processes crucial to the economic and environmental health of the U.S., gets such little attention and so little support from American policy makers. In addition to his work with batteries, photovoltaics and hydrogen fuel cells, his inventions have helped open the door to flat-screen televisions, new forms of computer memory and on and on.
 So when Stan Ovshinsky tells us that we should be putting our chips on hybrid and electric vehicles, and that solar and hydrogen power can be the cornerstone of an industrial renaissance in the U.S. as well as a cleaner planet, we should be listening very, very closely. 
 As oil defined the 20th century, new forms of energy will define the 21st. The U.S. has the opportunity, the intellectual resources and the expertise to lead the world in the development of clean energy. What we've lacked so far has been the courage, the will, to make it happen.

HEADLINE: Hewlett-Packard's Profit Increases

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Hewlett-Packard Company posted a 14 percent increase in quarterly profit on Monday despite an 8 percent decline in revenue, helped by a strong performance in China and better profit margins in its services business. 
 The results were in line with preliminary figures that Hewlett gave two weeks ago, which had topped Wall Street's estimates at the time. Stock in H.P. fell slightly in after-hours trading.
 Hewlett, a hardware and technology services company that is a bellwether for information technology spending, has been more cautious than some peers in predicting economic turnaround.
 The chief financial officer, Cathie Lesjak, called the results ''solid.'' She said the market in the United States, particularly in the consumer business, was recovering. She said the strength of a recovery next year was largely dependent on demand in Europe, which remains weak.
 H.P.'s services revenue rose 8 percent, and signings were strong, putting it in good position for next year, said Mark V. Hurd, the chief executive of H.P.
 Sales of PC units rose 8 percent, as the company continued to take market share, but revenue fell 12 percent as consumer demand focused on smaller and less expensive models. 
 PC revenue in China rose 40 percent.
 A Kaufman Brothers analyst, Shaw Wu, said Hewlett's report showed hints of recovery in a number of its business units, including PCs and printers.
 ''They're basically pointing to year-over-year growth in the January quarter,'' Mr. Wu said. ''It's a good sign.''

HEADLINE: An Unsurprising Slide for Obama

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama returned from his trip to Asia facing some unsettling news: two new public-opinion polls showing that his approval rating has dipped below 50 percent for the first time. To many of his critics, who chafed as Mr. Obama enjoyed broad support among Americans even though many were critical of his handling of specific issues like the economy, this erosion is a tipping-point, the end of Mr. Obama's perceived near-invulnerability.
 For a number of reasons, the slide is not a surprise. Coming less than a year into his presidency, not to mention almost a full year before the 2010 Congressional elections, though, the long-term political significance of the slide is anything but clear.
 Still, there is cause for the White House to be concerned, and for Republicans to sense an opportunity. The poll numbers worry Democratic strategists who are preparing for the already tough mid-term elections. They are well aware of the significance of presidential approval ratings in predicting the outcome -- and particularly of what happens when a president's approval rating is below 50 percent in the two months before a mid-term election. 
 Mr. Obama's decline a year into his term comes as he struggles through a decidedly sour climate. The unemployment rate has jumped above 10 percent and shows no sign of abating. At this point, even if Mr. Obama cannot be blamed for causing the economic decline, Americans are growing impatient with him to fix it. 
 His main legislative initiative -- the health care bill -- is the subject of a messy fight in Congress, displaying Washington in the very bitter partisan light that Mr. Obama promised to end. It has provided Republicans with a platform to stir concerns that Mr. Obama is using the health care overhaul to expand the role of government beyond the comfort level of many Americans; polls suggest that these arguments have helped sow significant doubts.
 And not incidentally, the president has been out of the country for the past 10 days. As Mr. Obama learned when he went overseas as a presidential candidate in the summer of 2008, his approval ratings tend to drift down when he travels abroad. It presumably did not help matters that much of the media coverage of Mr. Obama's visit to China was critical of the way he dealt with Chinese leaders.
 Mr. Obama's aides argue that the political culture of Washington is too fixated on each new bit of approval-rating data. 
 ''I think the history of these things is that Washington becomes absorbed with them,'' said David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama. ''But not every day is Election Day. There's not all that much relationship about what these things mean and what's going to happen in an election a year -- or three years -- in advance.''
 Still, there does seem to be the suggestion of a trend here. One of the interesting things about Mr. Obama's presidency has been the gap between how Americans are judging his handling of various issues -- particularly the economy and Afghanistan -- and their view of him. It has made Republicans wary of attacking Mr. Obama himself as they try for gains next year.
 ''We need to be careful,'' Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, head of the Republican Governors Association, told Republicans meeting in Austin last week. ''We need to treat this president respectfully. We need to make this about policies, not personalities. This is a guy that people like.''
 But Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, has long argued that the gap between the public's views of Mr. Obama and of his policies is politically significant, and that it is only a matter of time before the two measures meet. If that happens, Republicans could find it easier to engage Mr. Obama, whether by challenging him on policies in Washington, or running against him in Congressional elections next year, the way Democrats ran against George W. Bush in the 2006 midterms.
 Separate surveys by Gallup and by Quinnipiac University at the end of the week each showed Mr. Obama's job approval rating slipping below 50 percent for the first time: 49 percent in the Gallup poll and 48 percent in the Quinnipiac poll. A CBS News poll earlier in the week put it at 53 percent; that poll found that 49 percent of respondents approved of his handling of the economy, down from 54 percent in October, and 43 percent disapproved of his handling of the war in Afghanistan. 
 If Congress passes a health care overhaul, the White House -- and many independent analysts -- believe the achievement of a signature campaign promise is likely to push the president's approval ratings back up again. A decline in the unemployment rate over the next six months could have much the same effect. As Mr. Barbour said, ''The American people want their president to succeed.''
 History suggests that Mr. Obama's approval rating could be one of the key factors in determining how his fellow Democrats fare in the mid-term election. It is an urgent concern for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has distributed a slide-show presentation to supporters that charts the correlation between a president's rating and his party's performance in mid-term congressional elections. For the past 50 years, almost without exception, the party has lost seats whenever its president's average approval rating in September and October before the election dropped below 50 percent.
 Republicans, at least as of today, are envisioning trying to tie Mr. Obama to Democrats in marginal districts who would prefer not to be too closely associated with him and his policies, the way Democrats used Mr. Bush against Republican candidates -- a development that would have seemed farfetched six months ago.
 Mr. Axelrod did not dispute the notion that the fate of some Democratic incumbents could rest on how popular Mr. Obama is next summer. In fact, that is precisely the argument White House officials are making to nervous Democrats in urging them to rally around the health care bill, rather than risk having Mr. Obama suffer a debilitating defeat that could turn Americans against him.
 ''We're in this together,'' Mr. Axelrod said on Sunday. ''But the folks who are running next year have the most immediate stake in the success of health insurance reform. Having come this far on something of such importance, it's hard to see the political benefit of failure now.''
 A collapse of the health care initiative could be a major problem for the Democrats, possibly for years to come. Democrats in Congress would have less than a year to rebound. Mr. Obama would have three. 
 An impossible task? Bill Clinton saw his health care plan collapse early in his first term, and he managed to rebuild himself politically in time to cruise to reelection in 1996, even after his party took a drubbing in the 1994 midterms.
 Ronald Reagan's average job approval rating in the months before his first mid-term Congressional election, in 1982, was 42 percent -- and Republicans that November lost 26 seats. And who remembers that? Two years later, Reagan carried 49 states as he galloped to a second term over Walter F. Mondale.

HEADLINE: Beware The Result Of Outrage

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
The biggest news story of last week?
 O.K., maybe it was Oprah Winfrey announcing she was going to call it quits with her daytime show in 2011.
 But it's a close call. Though Oprah sucked up a lot of the media oxygen, last Thursday was an important day in Washington, too, with a couple of Winfrey-worthy aha! moments that could shake up the world of finance.
 Representative Ron Paul of Texas won committee approval of a far-reaching amendment that would give Congress vast new authority over the Federal Reserve. The Fed has long enjoyed Lone Ranger autonomy, but that will quickly end if the final bill passes. 
 Representative Brad Miller, Democrat of North Carolina, and Representative Dennis Moore, Democrat of Kansas, added their own bell-ringer for voters still outraged over bailouts: the next time the government has to step in and rescue a company, secured creditors will take a hit, too. 
 That would be a huge shift in the way bondholders are treated. Up to now, they've been kept whole, even as others have been asked to share the pain. Otherwise, some feared, creditors might get spooked, and lending might seize up. 
 The amendment, which also was approved by the committee, already has a nickname: ''The Bair-Miller-Moore Haircut'' (credit goes to Ira Stoll on his FutureOfCapitalism.com blog). The Bair reference is, of course, to Sheila C. Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 One other amendment was added, as well. Representative Paul E. Kanjorski of Pennsylvania proposed giving regulators power to undo firms deemed to be too big to fail. 
 All of these amendments, which are part of a 300-page bill to reform the financial industry that is making its way around the House of Representatives, are intended to help quiet some of the outrage over the bailout. 
 The Federal Reserve, which has printed money in exchange for assets from the nation's banks, has long operated opaquely. It is virtually impossible to size up its balance sheet.
 So on its face, the Paul amendment seems well intended. After all, who can argue with a little more sunlight?
 But consider these words of caution from Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire: ''Congress has demonstrated time and again its inability to manage the nation's fiscal policy, illustrated by our staggering national debt in excess of $12 trillion. So how can anyone think that its involvement in monetary policy would be good for the country?''
 So any unintended consequences of the amendment -- what Senator Gregg calls ''a dangerous move by this Congress to pander to the populist anger'' -- could indeed lead to less independence for the Federal Reserve, and the result ultimately may not be good for the economy. 
 That has been Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's line all along. He does not want the Fed to be a puppet of Congress. And on that score, he is probably right. Could Paul Volcker have raised interest rates in the early 1980s to nosebleed levels if Congress were pulling strings? What would happen in an election year? Interest rates would invariably go down, only to go up again later. 
 Representative Paul, of course, doesn't just want oversight of the Federal Reserve, he wants to dismantle it entirely. He has a dog in this fight and it is snarling: he has a book out called ''End the Fed.'' In an interview with my colleague, Cyrus Sanati, Mr. Paul told him, ''It's not pandering, it's listening.'' 
 ''The people are angry because they are finding out what the Fed is doing,'' he added.
 The other amendment, the Bair-Miller-Moore Haircut is potentially even more controversial. 
 It calls for secured creditors of banks -- the top creditors on the totem pole -- to be entitled to receive only 80 percent, not 100 percent, of the money they put up if a bank is taken over in receivership or a conservatorship by the government. 
 That is a hot-button idea because, for the last year, many critics have asked why bondholders were protected by the government. Again, at a gut level, it seems fair for secured creditors to take a haircut if the taxpayer if going to bail them out.
 Again, not so simple in practice. Because of the new risk, banks would find it more expensive to raise money -- especially so when they run into problems. 
 Who wants to lend money to a bank when there is a chance the government is going to come in and take it over, so that even a secured creditor at the top of the food chain is going to lose something?
 Joseph Abate, a Barclays Capital analyst, made this point in a research report, too: ''In any situation where it appears that a large firm is about to fail, secured lenders will rapidly head for the exit and terminate as many of their repo transactions as possible. No secured lender will want to be left in a trade with a bank in receivership where the regulators have converted the transaction into an unsecured loan at 80 percent of the original amount.'' 
 In other words, Mr. Abate contends, ''It would likely make secured funding to large institutions much more 'flighty.' ''
 Indeed, there is an argument that the amendment will make the system more risky, not less so. 
 ''Large systemically important firms would become more vulnerable to liquidity runs -- of the sort seen last fall,'' the Barclays report said.
 All these proposals are well intentioned, and with a bit of refining, they may ultimately be the right solutions. But as we learned with the bailouts, they may come with unintended consequences.

HEADLINE: Some Democrats Back Off Bid to Legalize Gay Marriage in New Jersey

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
It was not on the ballot, nor was it a top-tier issue in the New Jersey governor's race this fall, but the push to legalize same-sex marriage in the state could become a casualty of the election results. 
 Just weeks ago, Democrats, who control both houses of the Legislature, spoke confidently about their intention to pass a marriage-equality bill after the election and send it to Gov. Jon S. Corzine, a fellow Democrat who had promised to sign it even if he was not re-elected. 
 But when lawmakers returned to Trenton on Monday for the first time since Mr. Corzine was defeated by Christopher J. Christie, a Republican who opposes gay marriage, a few Democratic legislators appeared to be wavering in their support, setting off an emotional blitz of lobbying and backroom bargaining. 
 Some Democratic legislative leaders -- including the majority leader, Stephen M. Sweeney, who will become Senate president in January -- have said that they view Governor Corzine's loss as a gauge of the public's unease with the troubled economy, and fear that voters might resent elected officials who appear distracted by social issues. He said he did not think this was the right time to enact the bill.
 Other Democrats worried that if they passed a same-sex-marriage bill while Mr. Corzine was on his way out of office, they might anger voters, energize Mr. Christie's conservative base and alienate socially traditional Democrats.
 With Mr. Christie scheduled to take office on Jan. 19, supporters of the proposal are under pressure to move quickly. Lawmakers and gay-rights advocates say they are confident they can get the measure through the General Assembly. 
 But Senate Democrats met to discuss the measure on Monday and -- despite intense lobbying from a coalition of gay-rights advocates and other groups -- did not schedule it for a vote, because they appeared unable to muster the 21 votes needed to pass it. A few Republicans have said they may support the bill, but several of the 23 Democrats have expressed reservations about it. Senator Loretta Weinberg, a sponsor of the bill, who spent the fall campaigning as Mr. Corzine's running mate, said that despite her colleagues' post-election apprehensions, she believed that lawmakers would make New Jersey the latest state to legalize gay marriage. 
 ''This is an issue of fairness,'' she said. ''It's not like we're going to miss out on a chance to fix the economy during the lame-duck session because we're spending a couple of hours debating this. It is a matter of civil rights.''
 Although New Jersey is regarded as one of the nation's most liberal and socially tolerant states, the push to move from its current law legalizing civil unions to same-sex marriage has been heated. Polls show that a slight majority of voters favor gay marriage, but opponents of the measure have been aggressive in taking aim at lawmakers from both parties who have voiced support for same-sex marriage, especially those whose districts include conservative communities.
 At least 75 opponents of the bill descended on the Capitol on Monday for a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting, though no marriage bill was on the agenda.
 ''It would weaken marriage for everyone'' said Moshe Bressler, 38, of Lakewood, an Orthodox Jew who said his religious beliefs made him oppose it.
 Supporters of the bill responded by mobilizing about 250 people at the State House, where they handed out leaflets, buttonholed legislators and met on the steps for a rally. 
 Steven Goldstein, head of Garden State Equality, said he was upset by Democrats who had grown ''weak-kneed'' since Mr. Corzine's defeat. Mr. Goldstein warned that gay New Jerseyans, who have become a significant source of fund-raising and support for many Democrats, would exact a price if party leaders did not deliver on their promise to pass the marriage bill.
 ''If the Democrats don't enact marriage equality now, after years of telling us to wait, wait, wait, it will cause a huge schism between the state Democratic Party and not just the gay community, but the entire progressive base,'' he said. ''And it could change the political landscape of New Jersey permanently.''
 Gay-rights groups have been campaigning extensively for years to win legalization of same-sex marriage and announced Monday that they would release two new radio ads highlighting the stories of gay couples who have been denied health care coverage and other legal and social benefits granted to married couples. 
 Reed Gusciora, a Democrat from Princeton who sponsored a same-sex marriage bill in the Assembly, said he still held out hope that lawmakers would view it as a matter of civil rights and approve it. 
 ''Certain members are putting political expediency before public policy,'' he said. ''But this issue is a lot like the Corzine-Christie race: it could go either way.''

HEADLINE: U.S. to Set Short-Term Goal on Emissions Before Climate Change Meeting

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The United States will propose a near-term target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions before the United Nationsclimate change meeting in Copenhagen next month, a senior administration official said Monday. President Obama, the official said, will announce the specific target ''in coming days.'' 
 The announcement of a target will take the current legislative stalemate over a climate bill into account, the senior official said, and thus might present a range of possible reductions rather than a single figure. 
 The lack of consensus in Congress puts Mr. Obama in a tricky domestic and diplomatic bind. He cannot promise more than Congress may eventually deliver when it takes up climate change legislation next year. But if he does not offer some concrete pledge, the United States will bear the brunt of the blame for the lack of an international agreement. 
 The official also said the president would decide shortly whether and for how long he might attend the December climate meeting, which runs from Dec. 7 to Dec. 18. He repeated the president's assertion that he would consider attending if his presence could be a useful impetus to a deal.
 The official, a member of the team of American climate change treaty negotiators, spoke at a White House briefing under the condition that he not be identified.
 The Obama administration has so far resisted demands that it commit to a specific emissions reduction goal, saying that it could not pre-empt Congress, which has stalled on climate change legislation. China, the world's largest emitter of climate-altering gases, has also refused to spell out its plans for reducing emissions, although President Hu Jintao promised in September that his country would reduce the amount of emissions per unit of economic output by a ''notable margin.'' 
 Many observers of the climate negotiations expect China to deliver a more specific pledge on this so-called carbon intensity target before the Copenhagen meeting opens.
 Mr. Obama has come under criticism from leaders of dozens of countries that have already set domestic greenhouse gas reduction targets. He is also under fire from numerous environmental advocates who say the United States, the world's second-largest emitter, must take a credible commitment to Copenhagen to ensure that the talks do not fall apart.
 The House passed a measure in June that calls for a 17 percent reduction over 2005 levels of the domestic emissions of the gases that contribute to the heating of the planet. A Senate committee passed a bill last month that sets a 20 percent target, but that is likely to be weakened in future negotiations.
 Paul Bledsoe of the bipartisan National Commission on Energy Policy said the president's hands were tied by Congressional inaction. ''The U.S. cannot negotiate at Copenhagen above the targets in domestic legislation without risking support for that legislation in the Senate,'' Mr. Bledsoe said. ''If European demands continue above the U.S. domestic targets, they set up an impossible dynamic for the administration.''
 A second administration official briefing reporters on Monday said that Mr. Obama would have a stronger hand at Copenhagen if Congress had already acted on climate change legislation, but that the debate on health care had blocked it.
 ''We would have preferred that health care be done a long time ago, and we'd be having an energy debate today,'' the official said.
 Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Mr. Obama could credibly tell delegates to the climate conference that the United States intended to reduce its emissions by 17 percent to 20 percent, based on the legislation that has been approved by the House and the Senate environment committee. 
 ''It's important for the president to exert that leadership with consultation with Congress,'' Mr. Kerry said in an interview late last week.
 Mr. Obama and leaders of a number of other major countries have said that the Copenhagen talks would not yield a comprehensive and binding treaty to address global warming. Instead, the more than 190 nations represented there are expected to produce an interim agreement that addresses the major issues without requiring ratification or international enforcement.

HEADLINE: After Eight Years of Talks, State Still Can't Decide Who'll Run Aqueduct

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI and DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
Amid a battered economy and falling tax revenue, Gov. George E. Patakiagreed in October 2001 to a budget deal that authorized electronic slot machines at the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens.
 But eight years and one recession later, state officials still cannot agree on an operator for the aging track, despite the obvious financial incentive: a refurbished operation with video gambling machines would generate more than $1 million a day, many experts say.
 The latest round of talks has been stalled for months, and despite a series of meetings among Gov. David A. Paterson and legislative leaders to try to resolve the matter, they remain deadlocked. The pressure is on state lawmakers, who have already included a $200 million upfront payment from the winning bidder in their plan to reduce a multibillion-dollar budget deficit.
 The problem is that the governor and the leaders of the Assembly and the Senate must agree on the winning bid. 
 The governor's office appears to favor a group led by SL Green Realty, Manhattan's largest commercial landlord, and Hard Rock International, or maybe Delaware North.
 The Senate, which would have to approve the selection, has expressed enthusiasm for Aqueduct Entertainment Group, even though some advisers say it is one of the weaker of the six bidders. The Assembly, in turn, has not shown a preference, although Speaker Sheldon Silver is thought to favor Delaware North or SL Green.
 Given the history of tortuous and interminable negotiations over selecting an operator -- symbolizing the worst of Albany's dysfunction and backroom political horse trading -- no one is expecting a quick compromise.
 ''It is a mystery why this is taking so long, since it is costing over a million dollars a day not to have it open,'' said Jeff Gural, a minority partner in the SL Green group who owns two small tracks upstate that have electronic machines. ''The original decision was promised for Aug. 1.''
 Some legislators and many of the bidders say the chaotic situation has been compounded by the failure of the governor's chief counsel, Peter J. Kiernan, to establish criteria for bids and a formal selection process. As a result, some bidders have been allowed to change their offers midstream to be more competitive, while the state has twice asked for their final and best offers.
 ''There are no parameters,'' said Assemblyman J. Gary Pretlow, a Westchester Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly's Committee on Racing and Wagering. ''The problem is that the process was flawed from its inception. Everyone should have been operating with common guidelines.''
 Most recently, the Paterson administration surprised the six competing bidders when he asked them to submit their new final offers by Nov. 6 and demanded that all must guarantee an upfront licensing fee of $200 million or more, payable within 30 days of signing an operating agreement. Weeks earlier, Governor Paterson inserted the $200 million into his deficit reduction plan. 
 One of the bidders, Stephen A. Wynn, the Las Vegas gambling and hotel impresario, promptly pulled out.
 Joseph M. Kelly, a professor of business law at the College of Buffalo and an associate of the Catania Consulting Group, which specializes in gaming issues, said the peculiar process could easily lead to a lawsuit once someone was selected. ''I have a lot of problems with the process,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''Whoever is selected, I think you can argue that the decision was arbitrary and capricious.''
 The Legislature first authorized the use of electronic slot machines, also known as video lottery terminals, at Aqueduct and eight other racetracks in the state and six American Indian casinos during another period of fiscal distress -- immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center. The other racetracks quickly installed the machines.
 On a recent Friday afternoon, the parking lots at Aqueduct were largely vacant. A good portion of the grandstand, which once accommodated as many as 30,000 people, was closed. Still, the handful of bettors in the stands had hundreds of empty seats to choose from. Most sat inside, staring at the television screens that broadcast races from Aqueduct and elsewhere. The cavernous hall resembles a large bus station without all the passengers.
 ''This isn't a pretty place,'' said Donald Rosen, whose horse, Boxitup, finished second in the eighth race that day. ''Hopefully, when they get the slots, they'll fix it up and get people to come here.'' 
 ''I saw it work with slots at Saratoga,'' he added, referring to a harness track upstate. ''That place is now like a palace. It's clean; everyone's jumping around.''
 Yet selecting an operator for Aqueduct, potentially the most lucrative location for New York, has turned into a long-running drama.
 After two attempts to pick an operator fizzled, Gov. Eliot Spitzer decided to start over in 2008. His successor, Governor Paterson, and the Legislature ultimately picked Delaware North, a Buffalo company, over two rivals. But that deal collapsed in March after Delaware North failed to raise a $370 million payment for the exclusive rights to build the gambling hall.
 In June, six groups submitted new offers to build a hall for 4,500 machines and to refurbish the track; they included Delaware North, SL Green, Mr. Wynn and R. Donahue Peebles in partnership with MGM Mirage, the casino operator.
 SL Green vowed to open at least 1,500 electronic slot machines within eight months of signing a preliminary operating deal with the state or pay up to $25 million in penalties. Another bidder, Aqueduct Entertainment Group, said it would open 1,200 machines within six months, although there was no mention of any self-imposed penalties.
 Penn National Gaming, which operates 15 casinos in Florida, New Jersey, Maine and other states, signed a deal with the hip-hop entrepreneur Russell Simmons to handle the project's community outreach. It also offered the highest -- at least until recently -- licensing fee, $250 million. 
 And in a nod to the hotel union's political power in Albany, all of the contenders worked out some form of agreement with the New York Hotel and Motels Trades Council.
 Mr. Silver said last week that he had no favorite candidate to run Aqueduct. ''I have no horse in the race,'' he said, adding that he favored ''the one that makes the most sense.''
 He said the Legislature was now focused on dealing with the budget and a $4 billion deficit. ''We have five months to collect that $200 million,'' he said, adding that he hoped to resolve the issue once negotiations on the budget were concluded.
 The Senate -- particularly its president, Malcolm A. Smith -- has been pushing Aqueduct Entertainment Group, even though that group's ties to the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, a spiritual and political mentor of Mr. Smith's, have been questioned in the Assembly and by the governor's office. 
 Senator Eric Adams, a Brooklyn Democrat who chairs the Senate's Racing, Gaming and Wagering Committee, said on Monday that Senator John L. Sampson, the Democrats' leader, ''is comfortable with A.E.G.,'' but could ''live with any of the others.''
 ''We don't want to go in there and say, 'Listen. This is the only person we're going with and that's it.' We want to get this resolved, and we need the money in the budget.''

HEADLINE: Right and Left Join to Take On U.S. in Criminal Justice Cases

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In the next several months, the Supreme Court will decide at least a half-dozen cases about the rights of people accused of crimes involving drugs, sex and corruption. Civil liberties groups and associations of defense lawyers have lined up on the side of the accused.
 But so have conservative, libertarian and business groups. Their briefs and public statements are signs of an emerging consensus on the right that the criminal justice system is an aspect of big government that must be contained. 
 The development represents a sharp break with tough-on-crime policies associated with the Republican Party since the Nixon administration.
 ''It's a remarkable phenomenon,'' said Norman L. Reimer, executive director of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ''The left and the right have bent to the point where they are now in agreement on many issues. In the area of criminal justice, the whole idea of less government, less intrusion, less regulation has taken hold.'' 
 Edwin Meese III, who was known as a fervent supporter of law and order as attorney general in the Reagan administration, now spends much of his time criticizing what he calls the astounding number and vagueness of federal criminal laws. 
 Mr. Meese once referred to the American Civil Liberties Union as part of the ''criminals' lobby.'' These days, he said, ''in terms of working with the A.C.L.U., if they want to join us, we're happy to have them.''
 Dick Thornburgh, who succeeded Mr. Meese as attorney general under President Ronald Reagan and stayed on under President George Bush, echoed that sentiment in Congressional testimony in July.
 ''The problem of overcriminalization is truly one of those issues upon which a wide variety of constituencies can agree,'' Mr. Thornburgh said. ''Witness the broad and strong support from such varied groups as the Heritage Foundation, the Washington Legal Foundation, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the A.B.A., the Cato Institute, the Federalist Society and the A.C.L.U.''
 In an interview at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group where he is a fellow, Mr. Meese said the ''liberal ideas of extending the power of the state'' were to blame for an out-of-control criminal justice system. ''Our tradition has always been,'' he said, ''to construe criminal laws narrowly to protect people from the power of the state.''
 There are, the foundation says, more than 4,400 criminal offenses in the federal code, many of them lacking a requirement that prosecutors prove traditional kinds of criminal intent. 
 ''It's a violation of federal law to give a false weather report,'' Mr. Meese said. ''People get put in jail for importing lobsters.''
 Such so-called overcriminalization is at the heart of the conservative critique of crime policy. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce made the point in a recent friend-of-the-court brief about a federal law often used to prosecute corporate executives and politicians. The law, which makes it a crime for officials to defraud their employers of ''honest services,'' is, the brief said, both ''unintelligible'' and ''used to target a staggeringly broad swath of behavior.'' 
 The Supreme Court will hear three cases concerning the honest-services law this term, indicating an exceptional interest in the topic. 
 Harvey A. Silverglate, a left-wing civil liberties lawyer in Boston, says he has been surprised and delighted by the reception that his new book, ''Three Felonies a Day: How the Feds Target the Innocent,'' has gotten in conservative circles. (A Heritage Foundation official offered this reporter a copy.)
 The book argues that federal criminal law is so comprehensive and vague that all Americans violate it every day, meaning prosecutors can indict anyone at all. 
 ''Libertarians and the civil liberties left have always had some common ground on these issues,'' said Radley Balko, a senior editor at Reason, a libertarian magazine. ''The more vocal presence of conservatives on overcriminalization issues is really what's new.''
 Several strands of conservatism have merged in objecting to aspects of the criminal justice system. Some conservatives are suspicious of all government power, while others insist that the federal government has been intruding into matters the Constitution reserves to the states. 
 In January, for instance, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in United States v. Comstock, about whether Congress has the constitutional power to authorize the continued confinement of people convicted of sex crimes after they have completed their criminal sentences. 
 Then there are conservatives who worry about government seizure of private property said to have been used to facilitate crimes, an issue raised in Alvarez v. Smith, which was argued in October. 
 ''A joint on a yacht, and the whole thing is forfeited,'' said Paul Cassell, a law professor at the University of Utah and a former federal judge appointed by President George W. Bush.
 Some religious groups object to prison policies that appear to ignore the possibility of rehabilitation and redemption, and fiscal conservatives are concerned about the cost of maintaining the world's largest prison population.
 ''Conservatives now recognize the economic consequences of a criminal justice leviathan,'' said Erik Luna, a law professor at Washington and Lee University.
 The roots of the conservative re-examination of crime policy might also be found in the jurisprudence of Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. The two justices, joined by liberal colleagues, have said the original meaning of the Constitution required them to rule against the government in, among other areas, the rights of criminal defendants to confront witnesses.
 ''Scalia and Thomas are vanguards of an understanding by the modern right that its distrust of government extends all the way to the criminal justice system,'' said Douglas A. Berman, a law professor at Ohio State University.
 The court will hear another confrontation clause case, Briscoe v. Virginia, in January. It is a sequel to a decision in June that prosecutors may not use crime lab reports without live testimony from the analysts who prepared them.
 The conservative re-evaluation of crime policy is not universal, of course. Two notable exceptions to the trend, said Timothy Lynch, director of the Cato Institute's criminal justice project, are Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.
 ''Roberts and Alito are coming down consistently on the side of the government in these criminal justice cases,'' Mr. Lynch said. 
 Some scholars are skeptical about conservatives' timing and motives, noting that their voices are rising during a Democratic administration and amid demands for accountability for the economic crisis.
 ''The Justice Department now acts as a kind of counterweight to corporate power,'' said Frank O. Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri. ''On the other side is an alliance between two strands of conservative thinking, the libertarian point of view and the corporate wing of the Republican Party.''
 Mr. Meese acknowledged that the current climate was not the ideal one for his point of view. ''We picked by accident a time,'' he said, ''when it was not a very popular topic in light of corporate frauds.''

HEADLINE: Reading the Tea Leaves in Obama's Sliding Numbers

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama returned from his trip to Asia facing some unsettling news: two new polls showed that his approval rating had dipped below 50 percent for the first time. 
 To many of his critics, who had chafed as he enjoyed broad support among Americans even as many were critical of his handling of specific issues like the economy, this erosion is a tipping point, the end of Mr. Obama's perceived near-invulnerability.
 In many ways, the slide should not come as a surprise. And coming less than a year into his presidency, not to mention almost a full year from the 2010 Congressional elections, its long-term political significance is anything but clear. 
 Still, there is cause for the White House to be concerned, and for Republicans to sense an opportunity. The poll numbers worry Democratic strategists preparing for the already tough Congressional elections. They are well aware that presidential approval ratings can be a predictor of the outcome of midterm contests, especially when those ratings fall below 50 percent in the two months before the election.
 Polls by Gallup and Quinnipiac University at the end of last week showed that Mr. Obama's job approval rating had dropped below 50 percent, though not by much: it was 49 percent in the Gallup poll and 48 percent in the Quinnipiac poll.
 Mr. Obama's poll numbers reflect an array of challenges that have combined to create a sour climate for him. The unemployment rate has jumped above 10 percent and shows no sign of declining. At this point, even if Mr. Obama cannot be blamed for causing the economic decline, Americans seem increasingly impatient with him to fix it. 
 His health care bill is the subject of a messy fight in Congress, displaying the bitter partisanship Mr. Obama had promised to end. It has provided Republicans a platform to stir concerns that Mr. Obama is using the health care overhaul to expand the role of government beyond the comfort level of many Americans.
 And not incidentally, the president was out of the country for 10 days when the polls were released. As Mr. Obama learned when he went overseas as a presidential candidate in the summer of 2008, his approval ratings tend to drift down when he travels abroad. It presumably did not help that much of the news media coverage of Mr. Obama's visit to China was critical.
 Mr. Obama's aides argue that the political culture of Washington is too fixated on this kind of polling. 
 ''I think the history of these things is that Washington becomes absorbed with them,'' David Axelrod, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, said in an interview on Sunday. ''But not every day is Election Day. There's not all that much relationship about what these things mean and what's going to happen in an election a year -- or three years -- in advance.''
 Still, there does seem to be the suggestion of a trend here. One interesting thing about Mr. Obama's presidency has been the gap between how Americans judge his handling of various issues -- particularly the economy and Afghanistan -- and their view of him personally. Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, has long argued that the gap between how Mr. Obama's policies are viewed and how he is viewed is politically significant, and that it was only a matter of time until the two measures meet. If that happens, Republicans could find it easier to engage Mr. Obama, be it challenging him on policies in Washington or running against him in Congressional elections next year, the way Democrats ran against George W. Bush in the 2006 midterms.
 If Congress passes Mr. Obama's health care bill, the White House -- and many independent analysts -- believe that the accomplishment of a signature campaign promise is likely to push the president's approval ratings back up. A decline in the unemployment rate over the next six months could have much the same effect. 
 History suggests that Mr. Obama's approval rating could be a major factor in determining how his fellow Democrats fare in the midterm elections. It is an urgent concern for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has distributed a slide-show presentation to supporters charting the correlation of a president's job approval rating to his party's performance in midterm Congressional elections. 
 For the past 50 years, almost without exception, the party loses seats in November when its president's average approval rating in September and October drops below 50 percent.
 Mr. Axelrod did not dispute the notion that the fate of some Democratic incumbents could rest on how popular Mr. Obama is next summer. That is precisely the argument White House officials are making to nervous Democrats in urging them to rally around the health care bill, rather than risk a debilitating defeat for Mr. Obama that could make Americans turn against him.
 ''We're in this together,'' Mr. Axelrod said Sunday. ''But the folks who are running next year have the most immediate stake in the success of health insurance reform. Having come this far on something of such importance, it's hard to see the political benefit of failure now.''
 A collapse of the health care initiative could be a major problem for the Democrats, possibly for years to come. Democrats in Congress would have less than a year to recover. Mr. Obama would have three. 
 An impossible task? Bill Clinton saw his health care plan collapse early in his first term, and he managed to rebuild himself politically in time to cruise to re-election in 1996, even after his party got wiped out in the 1994 midterms. It took until 2006 before Congressional Democrats fully recovered from those losses.
 Ronald Reagan's average job approval rating in the months before his first midterm Congressional election, in 1982, was 42 percent -- and Republicans that November lost 26 seats. Two years later, Mr. Reagan carried 49 states as he galloped to a second term.

HEADLINE: Pressure Builds in Congress as Obama Nears Afghanistan Troop Plan

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT and HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As President Obama nears a decision on a troop increase for the war in Afghanistan, he is facing increasingly vocal criticism from senior Congressional Democrats over the war's cost, the size of the United States troop commitment and the reliability of America's allies.
 Mr. Obama met with his war council for two hours on Monday night -- his ninth such session and, aides said, perhaps the final meeting before Mr. Obama announces his decision, which is expected next week. Administration officials are already working on the big, and potentially contentious, rollout of Mr. Obama's Afghanistan strategy. 
 Aides on the Senate and House committees dealing with military and foreign affairs were tentatively preparing for hearings next week. The aides and administration officials said witnesses might include Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
 White House officials are bracing for opposition in Mr. Obama's own party. ''On the merits, I think it is a mistake to deepen our involvement,'' Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat who heads the House Appropriations Committee, told ABC News on Monday. ''But if we are going to do that, then at least we ought to pay for it. Because if we don't, if we don't pay for it, the cost of the Afghan war will wipe out every initiative we have to rebuild our own economy.''
 Mr. Obey and other senior House Democrats introduced legislation last week to impose a surtax beginning in 2011 to cover the costs of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. While the legislation has little chance of enactment, it underscores the frustration among Democratic lawmakers and the pressure Mr. Obama is under to outline a clear exit strategy when he announces his plan for Afghanistan. 
 Administration officials said that even if an exit strategy was not an explicit part of Mr. Obama's announcement, it would be implicit. ''One of the things which we want to convey is that we're not in the business of staying there forever,'' an administration official said. A second senior administration official said that Mr. Obama had ''pretty much'' made up his mind, but that details remained to be worked out.
 Several people briefed on administration deliberations said that the president's advisers had been testing the reaction to an increase of 20,000 to 30,000 troops. 
 American commanders in Afghanistan said they were anxious to learn whether Mr. Obama would approve 40,000 additional troops, as requested by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the commander in Afghanistan, or something less.
 ''We will welcome any increase,'' one senior American officer in Afghanistan said Monday by e-mail. The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the White House review had not concluded, said a troop increase was ''desperately needed to dominate in critical areas.'' 
 ''Without it, we will execute the same strategy, focused on the same areas -- Kandahar City, central Helmand, and freedom of movement for Afghans on Ring Route -- but risk is greater,'' he said.
 Mr. Obama has not yet personally conveyed his decision to his major allies in the war, including Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, Prime Minister Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, officials said. ''I think at the point that the phone calls are made, we'll know it's a done deal,'' a European official said Monday.
 But administration officials have been trying to consult their foreign counterparts. Richard C. Holbrooke, Mr. Obama's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, recently went to Russia to discuss Afghanistan. He has also met with representatives from the NATO countries involved in Afghanistan. He told reporters on Monday, ''With the elections now behind us, we're going to be intensifying our effort on coordination.'' 
 A NATO spokesman, James Appathurai, said NATO officials would meet Dec. 7 to discuss the troop strategy, Reuters reported.
 In addition to ensuring his NATO allies are on board, Mr. Obama must sell his plan on Capitol Hill. On Friday the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, challenged any American strategy that relied on the ineffectual and corrupt government of President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan. 
 ''How can we ask the American people to pay a big price in lives and limbs, and also in dollars, if we don't have a connection to a reliable partner?'' she said on National Public Radio. 
 Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, who heads the Armed Services Committee, said that to win over Congress and the American public, Mr. Obama needed to lay out how Afghans would eventually assume more of their own security, how the Afghan government would aggressively tackle corruption and improve services, and how Taliban fighters willing to stop fighting the government could be reintegrated into Afghan society. ''This is a package,'' he told C-Span on Sunday. 
 In any vote on Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama will probably be put in the uncomfortable position of relying on Republicans. 
 ''I had hoped -- and I still hope -- that the president's going to make the right decision here, which is to keep the pressure on,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, told CNN on Sunday. ''The military people are getting a little frustrated with the delay in making the decision. It's really time for the president to make the call.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 25, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about President Obama's strategy for committing more American troops to the war in Afghanistan misidentified the office held by Angela Merkel of Germany, whose country supplies troops for the American-led coalition. She is chancellor, not prime minister.

HEADLINE: Fighting Hunger in Difficult Times

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Hunger in the United States'' (editorial, Nov. 18) rightly pointed to the important role federal nutrition programs play in eliminating childhood hunger. 
 We cannot expect our nation's students to succeed in the classroom without the nutrition they need to thrive. The Hunger Free Schools Act, which we introduced in June, would help ensure that low-income children have access to free school breakfasts and lunches. Our bill would eliminate bureaucratic hurdles that have left vulnerable children without the nutrition they need. 
 No child should miss out on nutritious meals because of needless red tape. By cutting through it, our bill would ensure access to meals for an estimated three million additional children. 
 When Congress renews the child nutrition programs, the Hunger Free Schools Act must be incorporated. The price of inaction is desperately hungry children, and that price is simply too high.
 Michael F. Bennet Sherrod Brown Robert P. Casey Jr. Washington, Nov. 19, 2009
 The writers are United States senators.
 To the Editor:
 With hunger levels up dramatically in the last year, you are right to urge Congress to expand funding for federal nutrition programs. We in New York are fortunate to have Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand working to address hunger by making the Child Nutrition Act an even stronger safety net.
 But this problem cannot be addressed at the federal level alone. With more than a million New Yorkers living in ''food insecure'' households and nearly 1.5 million having received food stamps this year, we in local government need to do our part.
 That's why now more than ever, we need both the city and the state to maintain critical funding to emergency food programs. Back in June the City Council restored more than $2 million for food pantries that were facing budget cuts. We also restored $4.5 million for Meals on Wheels, and half a million dollars to provide food for New Yorkers living with H.I.V. and AIDS. 
 Even in the toughest economic times, we cannot abandon the New Yorkers who need our help the most. In fact, in times like these we in government must dig deep and find ways to make our funding go even further.
 So this year the City Council will be working to protect these important services from even greater cuts. I urge Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and my colleagues in Albany to make emergency food programs a real priority this year, so we can continue to help all New Yorkers put food on their tables.
 Christine C. Quinn Speaker, New York City Council New York, Nov. 19, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Re ''49 Million Americans Report a Lack of Food'' (news article, Nov. 17):
 You report that 49 million Americans lack ''consistent access to adequate food.'' Equally shocking is the fact that up to one-quarter of Americans qualify for food stamps (and other benefits) but don't use them. Sometimes they don't even know they're eligible.
 Astonishingly, more than $65 billion in such benefits and services goes unclaimed each year. Government entities, partnering with nonprofit organizations, must launch a coordinated campaign to streamline the entire benefits process. There is no excuse for maintaining a 19th-century welfare system in a 21st-century society. 
 Technology and other common-sense strategies can ease access and increase the number of families that are helped. For example, a pilot program run by San Francisco uses Webcams to replace in-person interviews for food stamps. 
 We must create easier, faster, bolder systems to place food stamps in the hands of the hungry.
 Elisabeth Mason New York, Nov. 20, 2009
 The writer is chief executive of SingleStop USA, which tries to improve access to government benefits, tax credits and services for the working poor.
 To the Editor:
 In response to his department's survey disclosing that 49 million Americans (1 in 6) struggle to get enough food, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack pointed to the slowing economy as the reason for this spike in hunger. 
 But what accounts for the 36 million people in our country who were hungry before the recession hit? With current policies, there is no chance to achieve President Obama's goal of ending childhood hunger by 2015.
 The Child Nutrition and W.I.C. Reauthorization Act, up for review in 2010, has proven inadequate to safeguard low-income children from poor nutrition. Now is the time to call on legislators to strengthen this act.
 By mandating universal school meals and summer feeding programs, investing in proven community solutions that rebuild local food economies and promoting sustainably grown foods as the basis for human nutrition and food security, we can end hunger in America.

HEADLINE: Cheap and Cheerful for the Holidays

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
MADISON AVENUE is dancing the limbo for the holiday shopping season as advertisers ask each other, ''How low can you go?''
 With only a month left before Christmas, it seems clear that consumers, worried about the economy and unemployment, will need considerable incentives -- in the form of big sales and deals -- to buy anything. As a result, campaigns are celebrating price cuts, discounts and bargains in a manner that the British call ''cheap and cheerful.'' 
 It is a far cry from the holidays of not so long ago, when commercials suggested giving luxury cars as gifts by topping them with red bows -- and never mentioned the sticker shock. 
 ''We recognize people are cutting back this season,'' said Caralene Robinson, marketing director at Boost Mobile in Irvine, Calif.
 To acknowledge that, a holiday commercial for Boost by the Los Angeles office of 180 -- an agency owned by the Omnicom Group -- suggests even Santa Claus is scrimping, by replacing his reindeer with donkeys.
 ''We could placate the audience with tried-and-true messages we've all seen before,'' said William Gelner, executive creative director at 180 Los Angeles, ''or we do something in line with what consumers are feeling today.''
 Likewise, the headlines on circulars for Target stores proclaim sentiments like ''Festively frugal'' and ''Hot deals are served.''
 The Walgreen Company is sending e-mail messages to customers of its Walgreens drug stores that promote a ''one-day toy sale'' on Thanksgiving Day with prices 50 percent off.
 A campaign for cosmetics and fragrances being sold by Wal-Mart Stores urges women to ''create your beautiful for less'' with gifts like a scent named after the singer Faith Hill, priced at $16. ''They definitely won't say, 'You shouldn't have,' '' the headline of an ad says reassuringly.
 The cover of a Toys ''R'' Us catalog, which calls itself ''Our biggest Big Book ever!'' promises ''up to $5,500 in savings!'' -- presumably, if a shopper bought everything advertised therein.
 The Aeropostale clothing chain gives shoppers a cut-rate choice: ''50 percent off everything'' from Tuesday through Sunday, or ''$10 off every time you spend $50 or more'' from Monday, Nov. 30 through Dec. 24.
 Ads in a campaign for J. C. Penney, which carries the theme ''Joy of giving,'' point out sale prices for clothing, home furnishings and other merchandise. 
 ''Every day, but especially now,'' the text reads on a page in a Penney Christmas catalog, ''we show our gratitude by offering you the style you want, the quality you expect and the price you love!'' 
 Some retailers are pushing up the opening of stores for sales the Friday after Thanksgiving to 4 a.m., from 5 a.m. -- or even, as Old Navy is, an eye-crossing 3 a.m.
 The mood is also reflected in the December issues of national magazines. A line on the cover of Real Simple directs readers inside to an article about ''50 gifts under $50,'' while Better Homes and Gardens fills its readers in on ''35 stylish gifts under $35.''
 Country Living magazine goes with ''75 gifts under $25'' and Glamour presents gift ideas so ''genius'' that ''no one will know they're under $25.'' 
 Woman's Day magazine may have won the limbo contest with its cover line of ''23 stocking stuffers $5 and under, plus great gifts $20 and under.''
 The gift guide in the December 2008 issue of Better Homes and Gardens, owned by the Meredith Corporation, offered ideas priced at ''$50 and under,'' recalled Gayle Butler, editor in chief of the magazine, who is based in Des Moines.
 ''This year, when we started researching, we thought, 'You know, maybe that organic cotton throw pillow might feel like a frill,' '' she said, referring to a more expensive item last year. As a result, she added, ''the $35 price point felt really, really good'' for 2009.
 ''People want to celebrate, they want to have a joyful holiday,'' Ms. Butler said. ''A gift doesn't have to cost a lot, but it needs to feel it's chosen with care, so we're featuring thoughtful gifts you feel good about giving.'' 
 Some value-focused holiday ads are adding humor to the mix to brighten the mood. The cover of a catalog for the Sam's Club unit of Wal-Mart Stores promises ''More joy for your jingle.''
 That approach is also taken in a promotional campaign from Kraft Foods, which carries the theme ''Keep the jingle in your holidays.'' Visitors to a Web site (nabiscocrackers.com) are invited to ''get jingled'' by decorating photographs with festive touches like holly and ornaments, then sharing them on Facebook.
 The campaign, for brands like Planters, Ritz, Triscuit and Wheat Thins, also offers consumers discount coupons on Kraft products, a $10 rebate on selected purchases -- and even $5 coupons good for the Clue board game sold by Hasbro.
 ''We spend a lot of time talking to consumers,'' said Michael Tilley, manager for consumer and customer engagement in East Hanover, N.J., for the Nabisco cracker brands sold by Kraft, and they are ''recession-fatigued; money is tight and they are looking for value.''
 ''They're also looking for affordable fun,'' he added, ''for ways to make it an enjoyable holiday season.''

HEADLINE: Spare Change for Homeless? Cuomo Sees a Sham and Sues

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In Manhattan, they are as common a sight as the homeless themselves: the United Homeless Organization's street-corner donation tables, operated with little more than a large plastic jug and a worker pleading for coins and bills for the needy. 
 The workers, clad in aprons bearing the group's logo, are all homeless or formerly homeless, and the organization says that the donations help pay for food pantries, clothing, detox centers and other services. Skeptical New Yorkers who wondered over the years just where the money ended up wondered just as often if they were perhaps being too skeptical. 
 Until Tuesday, that is, when New York's attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, described the United Homeless Organization as a sham. His office filed a lawsuit against the group, alleging that its president, a formerly homeless Bronx man named Stephen Riley, and its director, Myra Walker, used tens of thousands of dollars from the group for personal expenses while failing to provide any services for the homeless. 
 The expenses, the lawsuit said, included premium cable television service at Mr. Riley's apartment; restaurant meals; trips to Cleveland, Mr. Riley's hometown; and shopping purchases from GameStop, the Home Shopping Network and the Web site for Weight Watchers. 
 The table workers pay Mr. Riley and Ms. Walker a $15-per-shift fee to use the group's tables and materials, and keep the rest of what they collect, according to the lawsuit. It said that Mr. Riley and Ms. Walker used the fees as ''their personal kitty,'' routinely flouted nonprofit and charitable solicitation laws and failed to maintain accurate records of revenue and expenses. 
 A city license is required to solicit money in public places, but the organization has never applied for one, and the document often displayed at the tables is a copy of its New York State incorporation receipt, the suit said. 
 The group's Web site stated that it provides food and clothing to the homeless, but Mr. Riley and Ms. Walker admitted in testimony to Mr. Cuomo's office that the group has no such programs , the lawsuit said. The organization does not run a shelter, soup kitchen or detox center, and does not give money to other homeless charities, according to the lawsuit. Mr. Riley and Ms. Walker are the only directors on the board.
 ''U.H.O. exploits the good intentions of people who thought that their charitable donations were helping to fund services for the homeless,'' Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. ''Instead, their donations go directly to U.H.O.'s principals and workers, who abused the organization's tax-exempt status to line their own pockets.'' 
 Mr. Riley, 64, and Ms. Walker, 46, did not respond to phone calls and e-mail messages seeking comment.
 The suit, filed on Monday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, seeks restitution from the two and asks that the organization be shut down. It was reported on Tuesday by The New York Post.
 Criminal charges are not being pursued. A spokesman for the attorney general said that the office believed that ''the most efficient way'' to end fraud and receive restitution was to proceed with a civil case.
 A table worker who declined to give his name defended Mr. Riley and Ms. Walker. ''I personally know Stephen Riley and Myra Walker for two years now,'' he said. ''The two of them don't drive a Rolls-Royce and they haven't been on a vacation for years. The attorney general this time of the year is going after the homeless and pennies?''
 On Tuesday, the group's Web site, www.unitedhomeless.org, was down. But the tables were up: On Park Avenue South, near 14th Street, George Ortiz, 27, manned a table draped in red and topped with a five-gallon jug that held some coins and bills. He was surprised to hear about the lawsuit. ''I only get about $25 a day,'' said Mr. Ortiz, who says he is homeless. ''I give them $15 and I keep $10 for myself. It's not that much money.'' 
 Rodney Williams, 44, standing at a table on 17th Street, said he knew nothing about the inner workings of the organization, but that he thought the group served a legitimate purpose. ''It enables me to have some money,'' said Mr. Williams, who added that he uses the cash to buy food and rent a room in Harlem. ''This is for homeless people. This is the bottom line.''
 The jugs, though far from overflowing, continued to receive donations. Hector Martinez, 28, put about a dollar in change into one at Broadway and 14th Street. ''I didn't know if it was going to a group or just the guy standing there at the table,'' said Mr. Martinez, a TV and film production assistant. ''I figured either way, it's going to someone.''
 The lawsuit comes at a critical time for homeless services organizations, on the eve of the holiday season, when many New Yorkers are more likely to donate. 
 But Patrick Markee, senior policy analyst for the nonprofit Coalition for the Homeless, said he did not expect the allegations to hurt donations to other groups. ''We're more worried about the economy than we would be about any blowback from this,'' he said.
 As a nonprofit group, the United Homeless Organization is exempt from federal income tax. It was formed in the 1980s but incorporated in 1993, and Mr. Riley is identified in the lawsuit as a co-founder. Organization members used to routinely solicit donations in the subway system, but these days the tables are the heart of its operation: Up to 50 are set up around Manhattan from Monday to Saturday, with a smaller number on Sundays.
 In 2001, Courtney Perry, identified at the time as the group's program director, told The New York Times that aside from the $15 fee, the money in the jugs went directly to the table workers themselves. ''Most of it goes for night-to-night housing,'' Mr. Perry said. Mr. Cuomo's office said that the group did not keep records for the hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations kept by table workers, and that although the group has suggested the money goes toward ''emergency assistance,'' some of the table workers had been regularly receiving the cash for years.
 The total collected each year is unknown. From 2003 to 2007, the organization reported revenue ranging from $60,000 to $98,000 in annual filings sent to Mr. Cuomo, though the suit said the fees collected by Mr. Riley and Ms. Walker and the donations were ''grossly underreported.'' 
 From January 2005 to August 2009, more than $173,000 in cash was withdrawn from the group's bank account by Mr. Riley and Ms. Walker, though it was unknown how a large portion of that money was used. 
 Mr. Riley told Mr. Cuomo's office that other than Social Security disability checks and government housing assistance, he had no other source of income and received no compensation from the United Homeless Organization. The group's main office is Mr. Riley's apartment, near the Bronx Zoo.

HEADLINE: Don't Forget the Gulf States

 BODY:
The recession has wreaked a special kind of havoc in the Katrina-ravaged Gulf states, where the effort to rebuild housing for low-income workers and their families is in danger of coming to a halt. Unless Congress acts quickly, more than 70 different housing developments totaling more than 6,000 units might never get built. That would be terrible for the Gulf region, which needs a lot more affordable housing and a large low-wage work force to drive its recovery. 
 Nearly all affordable rental housing is built through the federal low-income tax credit program, under which companies get tax relief for investing in housing projects. The credits allotted by Congress just after the storm under the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act got the rebuilding effort off to a good start. But businesses have become less interested in the tax credits since the onset of the recession because they have less profit to offset.
 Demand will surely pick up as the economy improves. But time is running out for the all-important tax credits that were allotted in the post-Katrina period. Under the opportunity zone act, developments built with credits were required to be ready for occupancy by December 2010, which would have been fine had the recession not come along. If the developments miss this date, because of weather delays or other problems, the investors who bought the credits will lose them.
 With just a year to go, potential investors who are worried about delays are avoiding the Gulf tax credit program. This has jeopardized affordable-housing developments in Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi. 
 Congress can boost investor confidence and give Gulf restoration a shot in the arm by adopting a House bill that would extend the occupancy deadline on Gulf tax credits to December 2012. The two additional years would give developers time to complete these desperately needed projects.

HEADLINE: Third-Quarter U.S. Growth Revised Lower

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The United States economy grew at slower pace in the third quarter than previously reported, the government said Tuesday, as weak consumer spending and rising imports offset stimulus efforts.
 A separate report showed consumer confidence inched upward in November, though it remained at low levels as shoppers head into the holiday season.
 The nation's gross domestic product -- the total value of goods and services in the economy -- rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent from July through September, the Commerce Department said, falling short of the 3.5 percent originally reported last month. The revised number, based on more complete data, was in line with analyst expectations. It was larger than the typical adjustment, underscoring the erratic nature of today's economy. 
 But even though growth was slower, the third quarter still marked the end of the longest contraction since World War II, with the economy expanding for the first time in a year.
 Much of the growth can be attributed to the billions of dollars the federal government has pumped into the economy as it seeks to mitigate the effects of a deep recession. 
 Popular government-financed initiatives, like an $8,000 credit for first-time home buyers and the cash-for-clunkers program, have helped prop up spending in crucial sectors. But the nation is still grappling with the highest unemployment rate in 26 years, and consumers have been reluctant to open their wallets again. 
 The Commerce Department said Tuesday that consumer spending in the third quarter increased 2.9 percent, falling short of the 3.4 percent it reported last month. That number worried some economists, who said it was below healthy margins and lower than the levels seen in 1983, when unemployment was equally high. Consumer spending makes up about 70 percent of the economy.
 Spending on cars fell more than originally reported, and commercial construction was weaker. Corporate profits, led by financial companies, climbed $130 billion in the third quarter -- the largest increase since 2004. 
 Rising imports continue to widen the trade deficit and hamper growth. The value of imports rose 20.8 percent in the third quarter, rather than the 16.5 percent originally reported, partly because of high oil prices.
 Economists attribute the rise in imports to an improving manufacturing sector in the United States. As companies begin to ramp up production, they often rely on supplies from overseas to stock their factories. Exports are also increasing, but at a slower pace, and companies are hoping a weak dollar will make their products more competitive abroad.
 Analysts said the revised numbers reinforced the third quarter's strength but suggested that growth going forward would be slow. There is still the question, they noted, of whether the economy will be able to prosper without government support.
 Julia Coronado, senior United States economist at BNP Paribas, said the revised figures suggested economic renewal would not follow the ''V''-shaped model of recovery -- that is, an energetic rebound after a sudden dive.
 ''It's going to be a very gradual pace of recovering instead of a roaring return to business as usual,'' Ms. Coronado said. ''The G.D.P number highlights this recovery is different from prior recoveries.''
 The consumer confidence index, based on interviews with 5,000 households conducted by the Conference Board, increased less than a point from October and noted continuing pessimism in how Americans view the job market. ''Consumers are entering the holiday season in a very frugal mood,'' the report said.
 Michael Feroli, a senior economist at JPMorgan Chase, said the report underscored the dangers of persistently high unemployment on consumer spending, though he noted retail sales and auto sales have posted gains in recent weeks.
 ''People have a very poor assessment of the current jobs market, the future market, and income growth,'' he said. ''The fact that the consumer confidence number is still so depressed is eye-catching.''

HEADLINE: Even in Recession, Some Small Businesses Grow

BYLINE: By ANNE FIELD

 BODY:
Many small businesses have found themselves treading water, at best, during the recession. But, that is not true for everyone. In fact, a significant minority of resilient companies have been able to do the seemingly impossible and increase revenue in these troubled times. According to a recent survey of 300 small-business clients conducted by SurePayroll, a payroll service based in Chicago, about 30 percent of respondents said their sales increased over the last year.
 How have they done it? Turns out, in a bad economy, successful small businesses tend to be successful in their own ways. In some cases, for example, the secret lies in offering customers more bang for the buck, and in others, it is in expanding overseas. The bottom line: for each company, the solution depends on a variety of factors, like business model and the industry. 
 ''The answers are very specific to the company's circumstances,'' said Ken Gaebler, chairman and chief executive of Gaebler Ventures, a business incubator and investment firm in Chicago. ''A good entrepreneur knows which buttons need to be pressed to thrive in a tough situation and make it through to the other side.'' 
 Take Princess Jenkins, the owner of the Brownstone, a New York City clothing and accessories boutique. Based on Harlem's bustling 125th Street, it has two employees and sells unusual fashions for women 40 and older. Last fall, Ms. Jenkins surveyed the market and realized how difficult the next season could be. She met with her five top designers and urged them to produce the boldest fashions they were capable of -- designs she knew would appeal to her customers' flamboyant tastes. ''I told them, it's going to get really tight next year,'' she said, ''and I need the best you have to offer.'' 
 They also mapped out a bigger marketing plan focused on three major events. In February, Ms. Jenkins rented a ballroom next door and staged her first fashion show, to which she invited 200 top clients. Sales from the event, she said, were ''incredible.'' Six months later, using decorations, curtains and designs from the show, Ms. Jenkins set up four booths -- she usually books just one -- during a small-business fair held as part of ''Harlem week.'' And, in early November, during the marathon, using three of those booths, she held another fashion show, this one with a D.J. 
 ''The next time people come to 125th Street, they'll remember there was something big going on there,'' she said. ''It's all about building a lasting impression.'' According to Ms. Jenkins, the moves have paid off with year-to-year sales up about 10 percent. She expects them to total about $350,000 for 2009.
 For other companies, the secret has been tightening expenses to make prices lower. In January, Travis Harris spun off his cellphone accessories business in Ephrata, Pa., from New Covenant Software, his software development firm, founded seven years ago. For one thing, the spun-off company, which Mr. Harris named TheCellGuru.com, begun two years ago and which has four employees, had been growing much faster than the original business. Plus, the two companies had very different business models. ''It was easier to handle them as separate corporations,'' Mr. Harris said. 
 While he said he usually sold his products at about 10 percent less than competitors did, Mr. Harris decided to reduce his marketing budget and cut prices even further. He eliminated all of his paid advertising on the Web, choosing instead pay-per-click sites like Google Products, through which customers can shop by comparing prices. Mr. Harris was able to pass his savings on to customers, lowering prices by $2 to $3 an item and increasing traffic 200 percent. Year-to-year sales, according to Mr. Harris, have also grown by that amount. ''We knew people were searching deeper, looking for the best prices they could find,'' he said. ''And when they discovered us, they'd say, 'O.K., this is it.' '' 
 At Inside Sports and Entertainment, Ety Rybak, a founder, and his partner concluded that the difficult climate called for a significant change in the type of events the 14-employee company organized. The company, based in New York and started five years ago, usually provided deluxe packages to the Super Bowl, Master's Cup and other major events, which clients used to reward employees or curry favor with their own customers, often spending $10,000 a person. But, last fall, Mr. Rybak realized that his ''clients couldn't possibly spend the kind of money they used to spend. We had to get creative.'' 
 Mr. Rybak decided to focus on local extravaganzas that didn't require paying for airfare or hotels -- organizing, for example, a number of large events during the openings of the new Yankee and Citi Field baseball stadiums in April. Another example: For a law firm, he put together a day at the Central Park Zoo, to which clients, employees and their families were invited. Usually, the firm held separate events for each constituency. Alan Baum, president of the company, estimates that revenue will be up about 25 percent this year, to more than $13 million.
 Even before last fall's crash, sales at Lexington International, a 12-employee maker of a laser device for treating hair loss, started heading south. ''People cut down on nonessential health care items, and we really felt it,'' said David Michaels, managing director of the company, which is based in Boca Raton, Fla., and was founded nine years ago. When he analyzed his company's performance, Mr. Michaels concluded that the possibilities for domestic sales growth were slim. But he had started exporting his product, called HairMax, to Canada and Australia in 2001. Perhaps expanding to other countries was the answer. 
 Mr. Michaels turned to the Gold Key Service of the Commerce Department, hiring consultants who spent several months conducting industry research and visiting a handful of countries, the better to pinpoint potential distribution partners. Then, Mr. Michaels traveled to those places to meet his partners in person. At the same time, the consultants helped him understand the regulatory issues he would have to tackle in each country. Ultimately, the licensing process took three to nine months, depending on the region. The most difficult country was South Korea, which, Mr. Michaels said, has a particularly rigorous licensing procedure for medical devices. 
 Now, he is also selling to Russia, Brazil and Saudi Arabia, in addition to South Korea, where, Mr. Michaels said, ''There are significant social advantages to having a great head of hair.'' He figures that international sales have more than compensated for the decline in the United States.

HEADLINE: From the Hospital Room to Bankruptcy Court

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: NASHVILLE 

 BODY:
Some of the debtors sitting forlornly in this city's old stone bankruptcy court have lost a job or gotten divorced. Others have been summoned to face their creditors because they spent mindlessly beyond their means. But all too often these days, they are there merely because they, or their children, got sick.
 Wes and Katie Covington, from Smyrna, Tenn., were already in debt from a round of fertility treatments when complications with her pregnancy and surgery on his knee left them with unmanageable bills. For Christine L. Phillips of Nashville, it was a $10,000 trip to the emergency room after a car wreck, on the heels of costly operations to remove a cyst and repair a damaged nerve. 
 Jodie and Charlie Mullins of Dickson, Tenn., were making ends meet on his patrolman's salary until she developed debilitating back pain that required spinal surgery and forced her to quit nursing school. As with many medical bankruptcies, they had health insurance but their policy had a $3,000 deductible and, to their surprise, covered only 80 percent of their costs. 
 ''I always promised myself that if I ever got in trouble, I'd work two jobs to get out of it,'' said Mr. Mullins, a 16-year veteran of the Dickson police force. ''But it gets to the point where two or three or four jobs wouldn't take care of it. The bills just were out of sight.''
 Although statistics are elusive, there is a general sense among bankruptcy lawyers and court officials, in Nashville as elsewhere, that the share of personal bankruptcies caused by illness is growing. 
 In the campaign to broaden support for the overhaul of American health care, few arguments have packed as much rhetorical punch as the there-but-for-the-grace-of-God notion that average families, through no fault of their own, are going bankrupt because of medical debt. 
 President Obama, in addressing a joint session of Congress in September, called on lawmakers to protect those ''who live every day just one accident or illness away from bankruptcy.'' He added: ''These are not primarily people on welfare. These are middle-class Americans.'' 
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, made a similar case on Saturday in a floor speech calling for passage of a measure to open debate on his chamber's health care bill.
 The legislation moving through Congress would attack the problem in numerous ways.
 Bills in both houses would expand eligibility for Medicaid and provide health insurance subsidies for those making up to four times the federal poverty level. Insurers would be prohibited from denying coverage to those with pre-existing health conditions. Out-of-pocket medical costs would be capped annually.
 How many personal bankruptcies might be avoided is unpredictable, as it is not clear how often medical debt plays a back-breaking role. There were 1.1 million personal bankruptcy filings in 2008, including 12,500 in Nashville, and more are expected this year. 
 Last summer, Harvard researchers published a headline-grabbing paper that concluded that illness or medical bills contributed to 62 percent of bankruptcies in 2007, up from about half in 2001. More than three-fourths of those with medical debt had health insurance. 
 But the researchers' methodology has been criticized as defining medical bankruptcy too broadly and for the ideological leanings of its authors, some of whom are outspoken advocates for nationalized health care.
 At the bankruptcy court in Nashville, lawyers provided a spectrum of estimates for the share of cases in Middle Tennessee where medical debt was decisive, from 15 percent to 50 percent. But many said they felt the number had been growing, and might be higher than was obvious because medical bills are often disguised as credit card debt. 
 ''This has really become the insurance system for the country,'' said Susan R. Limor, a bankruptcy trustee who calculated that 13 of the 48 Chapter 7 liquidation cases on her docket one recent afternoon included medical debts of more than $1,000. 
 Under Chapter 7, a debtor's assets are liquidated and the proceeds are used to pay creditors; any remaining debts are discharged, and filers are left with a 10-year stain on their credit ratings. 
 ''You can't believe how many people discharge medical debts,'' Ms. Limor said. ''It's a kind of trailing indicator of who's suffering in this economy.''
 Kyle D. Craddock, a bankruptcy lawyer here, said his medical cases were heartbreaking because the financial devastation was so rapid and ill-timed. ''They're sick, they're bankrupt, and if they stay sick for too long, they end up losing their jobs as well,'' he said.
 That was the case for Ms. Phillips, 45, who said she was fired in October from her job in a shipping department because she had missed so much work while recuperating from her car accident and operations. Her firing came only 11 days after she filed for bankruptcy, listing about $7,000 in unpaid medical bills among her $187,000 in liabilities. 
 ''The medical bills put me over the edge,'' said Ms. Phillips, who lost her health insurance along with her job. ''I had no money for food at this point. How was I going to do it?''
 It was the same for the Mullinses, who have two children. They had a mortgage and owed money on credit cards and student loans. ''But the medical problem is what took us down,'' said Ms. Mullins, who is packing to move from the two-bedroom house they will soon surrender to Wells Fargo. ''Everything was due, they wanted their money now, now, now, and it just became overwhelming.''
 For some, like Nathan W. Hale, 34, who had an attack of pancreatitis two months after losing his job with a Nashville cable company, it is the absence of insurance that pulls them under. Others, like Robin P. Herron, 35, of Eagleville, Tenn., have insurance, but it is not enough. Her Blue Cross Blue Shield policy covered only 80 percent of the cost when her daughter needed surgery to remove a cyst from a fallopian tube, leaving her $6,000 in debt.
 After cortisone injections failed to cure his gimpy knee, Mr. Covington, 31, had surgery because the pain was forcing him to miss days of work as an emergency medical technician. His recovery kept him off the job for five months.
 Simultaneously, his wife, a 911 dispatcher, developed sciatica while pregnant and had to take months off on reduced disability pay. Their insurance policy, with an $850 monthly premium, has a $4,000 annual deductible per family.
 As the bills rolled in, the Covingtons compounded their troubles by placing medical charges on credit cards, simply to make the collection agencies stop calling. They fell months behind on their mortgage, and by August had lost their house and both cars.
 Mr. Covington, who has taken a second job, said he found it ironic that it had not been the recession that forced them into bankruptcy. ''I tell my wife that we beat the economy,'' he said, ''but health care beat us.''

HEADLINE: California Takes Step To Limit Emissions

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
California has taken a major step toward creating a broad-based trading system to limit emissions of pollutants blamed for harmful climate change.
 The California Air Resources Board, often a trailblazer in environmental regulation, released a draft rule on Tuesday establishing a cap-and-trade program that sets a declining ceiling on emissions of greenhouse gases and allows companies to buy and sell permits to meet it. 
 California's goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. The proposed system would begin in 2012 with 600 major sources of global warming pollutants, including power plants, refineries and concrete factories.
 Similar proposals to reduce emissions are stalled in Congress with little hope of moving through this year. And next month, world governments will assemble in Copenhagen to discuss the issue but are not expected to produce any binding agreements on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally. 
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said the new rules would help California address a serious environmental problem, while giving companies flexibility in meeting clean-air goals.
 The proposed rule also includes reductions in emissions from industrial and transportation fuels beginning in 2015.
 California joins a number of other states and regions, including the 10 states of the Northeast, in moving ahead with programs to address global warming as Congress debates a nationwide program. One point of dispute in the legislation is whether the federal government will pre-empt these local and regional efforts and create a single national cap-and-trade program.
 California, the world's eighth-largest economy by some measures, was one of the first states to recognize the potential effects of a changing climate. State scientists have identified reduced snowpack in the Sierra Nevada, prolonged droughts, increasing wildfires and growing infestation of pests as some of the results of the warming.
 The draft of the California program dodges one of the toughest issues in designing any cap-and-trade system: how to allocate permits that allow companies to emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. A bill that passed the House in June distributes roughly 85 percent of the permits to various parties and industries free in the early years of the program, with more of them auctioned in later years.
 Mary D. Nichols, the chairwoman of the Air Resources Board, said her preference was for virtually all of the California permits to be auctioned from the start.
 ''Congress started this, you know, as a political exercise to see how many allowances you had to give out to which groups to get them to buy into the program,'' Ms. Nichols said in a briefing for reporters, according to Reuters. ''We know how many emissions we have to reduce. The question is how do we do it in a way that costs less.'' 
 The resources board has scheduled months of hearings and public comment on the rule before it is to be finalized next October.

HEADLINE: Bookseller Posts Loss and Lowers Outlook

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Barnes & Noble on Tuesday posted a larger second-quarter loss than last year. It lowered its profit forecast for this quarter in anticipation of weak holiday sales and because of the high costs of developing its electronic book reader, the Nook. 
 Barnes & Noble introduced the Nook, a competitor to the popular Kindle from Amazon.com, last month and said the device would begin to ship in late November. Last week, it said the Nook had sold out and orders placed beginning Nov. 20 would be filled Jan. 4 or later.
 On Tuesday, Barnes & Noble said orders for the Nook exceeded expectations. The company said it was increasing production for the Nook, which would raise costs. Barnes & Noble said it planned to invest more in its digital strategy, including hiring more people and investing in technology and in-store marketing support.
 The bookseller's second-quarter loss totaled $24 million, or 43 cents a share. That compares with a loss of $16 million, or 34 cents a share, last year. Excluding costs related to buying its college bookstore unit from its chairman, the loss totaled 30 cents a share.
 Revenue rose 4 percent, to $1.16 billion, from $1.11 billion last year, for the period ended Oct. 31. Best sellers included Dan Brown's ''The Lost Symbol,'' Jeff Kinney's ''Dog Days'' from the ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' series and Mitch Albom's ''Have a Little Faith.''
 Sales in stores open at least one year, considered an important indicator for retailers because it excludes the effect of opening or closing stores, fell 3.2 percent.
 The company, based in New York, now expects to earn 33 cents to 63 cents a share for the year, compared with an earlier forecast of 59 cents to 89 cents a share. Analysts predict a profit of 99 cents a share.
 The company expects third-quarter profit of $1.30 to $1.60 a share, while analysts expect a profit of $1.53 a share.
 It expects sales in stores open at least a year to fall 1 percent to 3 percent in the third quarter and 2 percent to 4 percent for the year.
 Traditional bookstores have faced increased competition from online sellers and discounters, as consumers have limited their discretionary purchases amid difficult economic times.
 The company's shares fell $1.27, or 5.4 percent, to $22.25.

HEADLINE: Silverdome Sells For $583,000 at Auction

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Pontiac Silverdome, built three decades ago for $56 million, is being practically given away -- sold at auction for $583,000. It is a fire sale that has reduced the once-proud arena to another sad symbol of the Detroit area's economic collapse. Under the Silverdome's air-inflated, cross-hatched silver roof, the Rolling Stones and Elvis Presley have played. So have the Detroit Lions and the Detroit Pistons. In 1987, Pope John Paul II drew more than 90,000 for a Mass there, and in 1983 Super Bowl XVI was played there. 
 Mostly unused since the Lions moved to Detroit's Ford Field in 2002, the dome has saddled Pontiac with a maintenance bill of $1.5 million a year. Drive-in movies were briefly shown in the parking lot, but plans to convert it to a casino, mall, minor-league baseball stadium or entertainment complex have all failed. The buyer, Triple Properties Inc. of Toronto, has said it plans to use the site for a soccer arena.

HEADLINE: State Courts at the Tipping Point

 BODY:
State courts are not just another government agency. They are at the center of the nation's legal system and enforcement of the rule of law, handling more than 95 percent of all civil and criminal litigation. This vital institution -- constitutionally, an independent, co-equal branch of government -- has been spiraling into crisis as cash-starved states struggle with huge deficits. 
 In a sobering speech earlier this month at a gathering of the New York City Bar Association, Margaret Marshall, the chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, warned that because of budget cuts in tough economic times, state courts across the country stand at ''the tipping point of dysfunction.''
 Chief Justice Marshall's sense of alarm is well founded. Reductions in financing have led to some overdue efficiencies that states might not have made if the recession had not forced their hands. But in too many cases, the cuts are already impeding core court functions, forcing court closures, shortened court hours and a tangible narrowing of access to justice. 
 New Hampshire, for example, suspended civil and criminal jury trials in 8 of 10 county courts for one month each between last December and June. In California, state courthouses are closed for business on the third Wednesday of every month. Iowa is planning to close all state courts for several days before the state's fiscal year ends on June 30. 
 More than two dozen states have imposed court hiring freezes, and 11 states have put staff on unpaid furloughs of varying length, according to the National Center for State Courts. Court staff, including clerks, court interpreters and security personnel, have been eliminated or reduced. In a financially driven loosening of security in Maine, for instance, magnetic security machines at local courthouses are no longer regularly manned. In Alabama, says the immediate past president of the Alabama Bar Association, Mark White, fiscally driven ''compromises in service and security are creating a situation ripe for disaster.''
 In Georgia, it can take 60 days to hold a hearing in a temporary custody case that used to take just a few weeks. In other states as well, spending cuts have led to fewer court dates available for hearing and trials, creating a growing backlog of cases. With priority given to serious criminal matters, there is a looming threat to the civil justice system, and its ability to vindicate people's rights, and to foster economic growth and stability by enforcing business contracts in a timely manner.
 The brunt of the budget cuts has fallen on the high-volume courts hearing family and juvenile matters, misdemeanors and small-claims disputes, notes the American Bar Association. Some of society's most vulnerable people, including battered women, abused and neglected children and victims of vandalism and petty theft, turn to these courts for protection and justice.
 There are factors apart from budget problems undermining the vitality of state courts, not least the advent of expensive judicial election and retention campaigns fueled by special interest money. And no one, including Chief Justice Marshall, suggests that state courts should be spared from having to share the burden at a time when cuts to health care and public education are under consideration in nearly every jurisdiction. 
 But, at some point, slashing state court financing jeopardizes something beyond basic fairness, public safety and even the rule of law. It weakens democracy itself.

HEADLINE: In Holiday Season Adjusted for Recession, Chicago Finds a Tree to Fit

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
This city's Christmas tree, which by tradition will be lighted by Mayor Richard M. Daley on Wednesday, has already suffered slights. 
 As the tree awaited its grand moment in Daley Plaza downtown, one passer-by this week deemed it spare and wondered whether its branches might break off. Another resident, in one of several letters to local newspapers on the topic, likened Mr. Daley to the Grinch for erecting what the writer called an ''ornamental evergreen shrub.'' 
 In truth, Chicago's tree is big. This blue spruce stands 50-some feet tall, and took decades to grow, in the care of the generous suburban family that donated it to the city. If you count the base and the star on top, which city officials appear to prefer to, it stands 60 feet tall, they say.
 Still, it is a speck of what once filled the plaza. Since 1956, when Mayor Daley's father ran the city, multiple trees have been shaped together to make an elaborate display. Just last year, 113 trees were fashioned into a towering 85-foot creation. But in recent years, the cost of the weeks of construction and a surrounding display had approached $350,000, a price too steep, the city decided, at a time of deep budget cuts.
 Chicago is hardly alone in its downsized jollity and energy-saving lights. In Austin, Tex., a beloved ''Trail of Lights'' tradition will look different -- and shorter -- this year, saving hundreds of thousands of dollars. At the State House in South Carolina, the fir provided by garden clubs is shorter and cheaper. 
 ''It's only about six feet less than last year,'' said Jane Suggs of the Columbia Garden Club. Ms. Suggs, despite what she acknowledged had been taunts from some that Charlie Brown might have selected it, called the tree magnificent.
 Likewise, some Chicagoans say this tree, which along with the surrounding display will cost about half of what it did last year, suits their mood now. And city officials said they had also heard from those who found the old model too big, too artificial, too much. 
 ''People say they like how real and natural this looks,'' said Megan McDonald, executive director of the mayor's office of special events, ''that it is like one they could have in their home.''

PERSON: Abe Pollin 

HEADLINE: Abe Pollin, 85, Team Owner and Philanthropist, Dies

BYLINE: By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN

 BODY:
Abe Pollin, the owner of the N.B.A.'s Washington Wizards, who built the sports arena that revitalized downtown Washington and was known for his wide-ranging philanthropy, died Tuesday. He was 85.
 His death was announced by his company, Washington Sports & Entertainment, which gave no other details. Mr. Pollin had been treated for several years for progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare neurological disease that impairs movement and balance.
 ''The N.B.A. family has lost its most revered member,'' David Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, said Tuesday.
 Mr. Pollin was the senior N.B.A. owner, having bought an interest in the Wizards' predecessor, the Baltimore Bullets, in 1964, when the league had only nine teams. He moved the Bullets to an arena he built in Landover, Md., outside Washington, in 1973 and purchased the N.H.L. expansion team the Washington Capitals a year later. 
 The N.B.A. franchise, renamed the Capital Bullets and then the Washington Bullets, won the league championship in 1978 behind the frontcourt play of Wes Unseld, Elvin Hayes and Bob Dandridge. But attendance sagged over the years, and in December 1997 Mr. Pollin moved the Bullets and the Capitals into a $200 million arena in Washington that he financed himself. First called the MCI Center, and now the Verizon Center, the arena, in the commercial district southeast of the White House near Chinatown, brought shops, restaurants and housing to a formerly run-down neighborhood.
 Mr. Pollin, a builder by trade, was a presence in the Washington area for his housing construction and charitable work. He financed medical research, aided the poor and helped feed children in developing countries through Unicef.
 ''About 50 years from now, when they ride by here, people will ask, 'Who built that building?' '' he said of the Verizon Center in 2001. '' 'Some guy named Smith,' they'll say. Because no one remembers. For feeding hungry children, yes, I'd like to be remembered. For taking care of the homeless, I'd like to be remembered.''
 Abraham Pollin was born on Dec. 3, 1923, in Philadelphia. When he was 8 his family moved to Washington, where his father, Morris, became a plumbing and heating contractor. After graduating from George Washington University in 1945, Mr. Pollin worked for his father, then opened a construction company. 
 For all its success in business and sports, the Pollin family endured tragedy. Mr. Pollin and his wife, Irene, lost two children to congenital heart disease -- Kenneth, at a year old, in 1952, and Linda, 16, in 1963. After their daughter's death, Mr. Pollin gave up his construction business for a year, suffering from depression, then built a nonprofit housing development in Linda's name. Irene Pollin became a psychotherapist and specialized in grief counseling.
 Mr. Pollin joined with two partners in buying the Bullets in 1964, and he gained full ownership four years later. The Bullets made the N.B.A. finals in 1971 behind the future Hall of Fame guard Earl Monroe, but were swept by the Milwaukee Bucks. After Mr. Pollin moved the Bullets to Washington's Maryland suburbs in 1973, when he built the Capital Centre, later known as US Airways Arena, they continued to thrive. They went to the finals again in 1975, when they were swept by the Golden State Warriors, and then defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in a seven-game championship series in 1978.
 But Mr. Pollin's Capitals got off to a dreadful start, even by the standards of expansion teams. They had an 8-67-5 record in their inaugural season, then won only 11 games in their second year.
 In a preview of the N.B.A.'s efforts to expand its commercial presence internationally, Mr. Pollin took the Bullets to China in 1979, the first time an N.B.A. team appeared there.
 In 1995, Mr. Pollin announced that the Bullets would be renamed, expressing dismay over the name's association with gun violence. He said he had long considered a name change but was finally moved to act when the Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, whom he knew, was assassinated. A fan vote selected Wizards as the new name, and it was adopted for the 1997-98 season.
 Mr. Pollin added to his sports holdings in June 1998, when the Washington Mystics of the Women's National Basketball Association made their debut at the Verizon Center.
 But Mr. Pollin sold the Capitals hockey team, a minority interest in the Wizards and his other holdings as chairman of Washington Sports & Entertainment in 1999 for an estimated $200 million to a partnership headed by Ted Leonsis, a billionaire Internet executive. Mr. Pollin said he wanted to spend more time in charitable work and that his sons, Robert and James, did not want to enter the sports world. They, along with his wife and two grandchildren, survive him.
 In January 2000, Michael Jordan purchased a portion of Mr. Leonsis's minority interest in the Wizards and became the team's top basketball executive after his second retirement as a player with the Chicago Bulls. Mr. Jordan gave up his executive duties with the Wizards and donned their uniform in 2001. He retired as a player again in April 2003, expecting to return as the team's president of basketball operations, but was dropped by Mr. Pollin in May after the Wizards failed to make the playoffs for a sixth consecutive season.
 Mr. Pollin and Mr. Jordan parted ways during a heated meeting. ''It was not a healthy atmosphere to produce a happy organization or a winning team,'' Mr. Pollin told The Associated Press afterward. ''I knew that there would be some negative stuff thrown at me, but when I made my decision, I stuck to my decision.''
 In a statement after the meeting, Mr. Jordan said, ''I am shocked by this decision and by the callous refusal to offer me any justification for it.''
 Mr. Pollin's charitable endeavors reached from Washington to developing countries. Locally, he financed college educations for needy students through his I Have a Dream Foundation and provided meals for the homeless in the Abe's Table program. He raised money for the Kennedy Center, the Salvation Army and the United Jewish Appeal. Mr. Pollin and his wife created the Linda and Kenneth Pollin Foundation at Harvard Medical School and financed pediatric medical research in New York. They also established a $1 million research fund at the Society for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.
 Mr. Pollin was particularly affected by the poverty he had seen in Africa as Washington-area chairman of Unicef. In 1997, he told of seeing Ugandan children as young as 3 scooping corn kernels out of the dirt that had been dropped by their mothers from their Unicef allotment.
 ''To allow children to starve to death when there's food to go around is simply inexcusable,'' he told Washingtonian magazine. ''Nobody knows about them. But they're human beings. They're God's children.''

HEADLINE: False Alarm On Abortion

BYLINE: By PHILLIP B. LEVINE. 
Phillip B. Levine, a professor of economics at Wellesley College, is the author of ''Sex and Consequences: Abortion, Public Policy and the Economics of Fertility.''

DATELINE: Wellesley, Mass. 

 BODY:
 ABORTION financing has become an important stumbling block in negotiations over health care reform. An amendment sponsored by Representative Bart Stupak, Democrat of Michigan, which was added to the House bill at the last minute, would prohibit both government-run insurance plans and any private insurance plans purchased with government subsidies from covering abortions. 
 The amendment quickly led to a burst of rhetoric and lobbying on both sides of the abortion debate. But this public battle exaggerates the extent to which the Stupak amendment would really change things for women seeking abortions. And, at the same time, it obscures the other benefits that expanded health insurance coverage could bring to women's reproductive health. Ultimately, providing greater access to family planning could significantly reduce the total number of unintended pregnancies. 
 The Stupak amendment's effect on any individual woman's insurance coverage for abortion depends on what kind of insurance she has now. About 12 percent of the 62 million American women of childbearing age -- ages 15 to 44 -- are now covered by public insurance plans like Medicaid. For them there will be no change because current law already prohibits the use of federal funds to cover abortion costs. 
 Likewise, the amendment would change nothing for women who now have no insurance -- about 20 percent of women of childbearing age. 
 The women whose abortion coverage would be at risk are those who are covered by private insurance -- some 42 million women aged 15 to 44. Insurers could decide to drop all abortion coverage in order to ensure their eligibility to participate in public insurance exchanges, where many Americans are expected to purchase insurance if health reform legislation passes. But women who have private insurance are not as likely as women with no insurance or public insurance to have abortions. Privately insured women tend to be older, with higher family income, and women in these groups are much less prone to seek abortions. 
 The abortion rate of women in poverty is four times that of women above 300 percent of the poverty level. Only six percent of women of childbearing age with private health insurance live in poverty; 62 percent have incomes above 300 percent of the poverty line. 
 Even if women with private health insurance find themselves seeking an abortion, the out-of-pocket cost for the vast majority of them is not that high relative to their income. In general, 89 percent of abortions are performed in the first trimester; these non-hospital procedures cost an average of around $400. 
 The small group of women who decide to abort after their first trimester -- perhaps for reasons of fetal health -- could potentially be affected more seriously, as these abortions are considerably more expensive. Yet the women who undergo second-trimester abortions are unlikely to be covered by private insurance now; nearly two-thirds of them have family incomes below 200 percent of the poverty level. 
 What is being overlooked in this debate is the benefit to women's reproductive health that would most likely occur if insurance access were expanded. Currently, 89 percent of private health insurance plans cover contraceptive services. Presumably, if health care reform provided insurance to more women, those who gained coverage would receive family planning services as well. Research on expanded Medicaid coverage that I have done with a colleague using data from 1990 to 2003 found that it reduced unintended childbearing by 9 percent. Our data indicate that this reduction was attributable to greater use of contraception. 
 This suggests that health care reform could lead to a substantial reduction in unintended fertility. Consider that there are 12.4 million uninsured women of childbearing age. Suppose that health care reform ended up providing health insurance for 10 million of them. Each year, roughly 7 percent of all women this age give birth, amounting to about 700,000 births to this group of women. If their rate of fertility were cut by 9 percent, then 63,000 unintended births could be avoided if health care reform is enacted. 
 I do not mean to understate the importance of the abortion debate taking place. Yet this debate should not overshadow the tangible benefits to women's reproductive health that could be brought about by expanded insurance coverage.

HEADLINE: In One Pocket, Out the Other

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: SYDNEY 

 BODY:
When Steve Franklin bought four plane tickets on Qantas last June, he faced an unexpected expense: a surcharge of 7.70 Australian dollars on each of the 136.70 dollar ($126) tickets -- just for using his Visa credit card. 
 Mr. Franklin, who planned to fly his parents and his 7-year-old twin daughters from Sydney to Adelaide, knew that changes to credit card rules had affected the cost of using plastic, but the extra 5.6 percent seemed excessive.
 The charges were the consequence of changes in credit card rules in Australia that were aimed, in part, at reducing the cost of hidden fees for using plastic. But the law, passed six years ago, also allowed merchants to tack on new charges, and many have done just that, in some cases with fees that exceed the old ones. 
 Now, as Congress debates how to rein in credit and debit card companies in the United States, Australia's experience is being pointed to as an example of just how tricky that can be: for one thing, if regulators limit one fee or rate, banks are likely to find another way to keep revenue flowing. 
 As in Australia, the stakes are high in the United States. American merchants, like their counterparts Down Under, complain that the high fees they must pay credit card companies and banks to accept their cards force them to increase prices on everything they sell -- even for people who pay with cash -- to make up the difference. In the United States, the Government Accountability Office last week issued a report showing that consumers who did not use credit cards ''may be made worse off by paying higher prices for goods and services, as merchants pass on their increasing card acceptance costs to their customers.'' 
 The main consumer federation in Australia, Choice, says that while regulations here have had a few unintended consequences, they have created incentives for retailers and consumers alike to rely more on debit cards, which have much lower processing costs, instead of credit cards. ''It drives me crazy, people buying chewing gum on a credit card,'' said Christopher Zinn, a spokesman for Choice, an Australian consumer group. ''We all pay for it.''
 Though many people may not realize it, out of every dollar charged on a credit card, merchants in many countries, including the United States, get about 98 cents and sometimes less; the other 2 cents go to banks and credit card companies. Banks use these fees to cover fraud losses, their loss of interest on money until the consumer pays the bill, computer systems and employees who process credit card transactions. The banks also pay Visa and MasterCard for their marketing and digital networks. 
 But the fees also generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue each year for banks that issue cards branded by Visa and MasterCard. In the United States alone, banks that issue credit cards get an estimated $40 billion to $50 billion in income annually from interchange fees, which are the biggest single component of fees charged to merchants. The banks and card companies are lobbying heavily against proposed changes. They warn that lower fees will lead them to squeeze credit and raise the cost of credit cards at a time when the economy thirsts for credit to sustain an economic recovery.
 Some of this has already happened in Australia, where in 2003, after years of retailers' complaints, the nation's central bank required that the interchange fees that merchants pay banks that issue Visa and MasterCard cards be cut in half, to less than 1 cent. Merchant fees for American Express and Diners' Club were not regulated because banks did not issue their cards. But both card companies cut merchant fees anyway, to 2 cents, from 2.46 cents, to avoid losing customers to Visa and MasterCard.
 That difference may sound tiny -- what's a penny? -- but banks and card companies say the lower fees have cost them about 1 billion Australian dollars annually, or $919 million. And they have turned to Australian consumers to make up the revenue. 
 Since the government policies went into effect, Australian banks have cut credit card perks and shrunk rewards programs, like frequent-flier miles. While it used to take 12,400 Australian dollars of spending on Visa or MasterCard from one of the country's four biggest banks to earn a 100 dollar shopping voucher, for instance, now it takes 17,000 dollars.
 Banks now also require customers to pay their bills faster. Interest starts accumulating on many cards 33 or 44 days after the start of a billing period, instead of the previous 55 days.
 Annual fees have also climbed for credit cards with reward programs, to 140 Australian dollars a year for gold cards that carry rewards, up from 98 dollars before regulation of interchange fees. Basic cards without rewards still carry on average an annual fee of 29 Australian dollars. 
 Perhaps more vexing, Australian merchants, including retailers, restaurants and airlines, are imposing surcharges for each credit card transaction, even though fees the merchants pay card companies have fallen. 
 ''I feel like Qantas was trying to nickel-and-dime me,'' Mr. Franklin said. Qantas said that it was merely trying to recoup the fees it still had to pay to banks and card companies, a cost it does not incur when a customer pays cash or uses a debit card.
 Indeed, after the Australian central bank allowed companies to start levying surcharges, many began to impose large and rising ones on credit card use. Some companies have even figured out a way to make a profit. For instance, Accor, a global hotel giant with 11 brands ranging from the luxurious Sofitel chain to Motel 6, introduced a 1.5 percent fee here last February for credit card users. 
 ''It has aided our profit margins,'' said Michael Issenberg, Accor's chairman of the Asia and Pacific region, who added that the hotel chain had seen little consumer resistance. 
 Consumer advocacy groups see such profits as an unintended consequence for consumers of the central bank's changes. Choice, an Australian consumer group, has joined with Visa and MasterCard to ask the government to restrict retailers from making gains from the surcharges. No one is suggesting outright surcharges for paying with a credit card in the United States, although one Congressional bill would make it easier for merchants to charge consumers less if they pay with debit cards or cash, something card companies oppose. 
 Visa, MasterCard and the banks that issue their cards prohibit retailers from charging extra if consumers pay with credit instead of cash, out of fear that more people would use cash if they knew that using plastic would cost more. Where exceptions are allowed, as in some gas stations, retailers must list the cash and credit card prices for each item. In Australia, the central bank overrode the banks' and card companies' rules, and authorized surcharges. 
 In addition, other bills in the House and Senate would allow merchants to band together to negotiate lower fees with Visa, MasterCard and others; now, retailers have little choice but to accept the terms they are offered or not accept credit cards, which could result in losing customers. 
 But banks in the United States warn that, as in Australia, American consumers may see the costs of using a credit card rise, and the benefits decline, if Congress passes legislation to reduce interchange fees. While American retailers had once pushed for changes unsuccessfully, there is new momentum this year after Congress passed credit card reforms in the spring aimed at curbing excessive fees and interest on credit cards. 
 Among retailers, 7-Eleven is leading a push to persuade Congress to adopt the ''Australia option'' and is calling on the Federal Reserve to cap and closely regulate merchants' credit card fees. In September, 7-Eleven sent more than one and a half million signatures to Washington from customers who, the chain said, believed Congress should limit merchant fees because they tended to raise the price of goods.
 ''There's certainly an awareness on Capitol Hill of Australia, and a lot of interest,'' said Keith Jones, the government relations director for the Southland Corporation, which runs the 7-Eleven chain.

HEADLINE: Markets Edge Down as Consumer Confidence Stays Low

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A disappointing report on consumer confidence and a more sober read on the economy pulled stocks down on Tuesday from 13-month highs.
 Major indexes posted modest losses in light trading as drops in financial and industrial stocks were tempered by gains in health care companies. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 17 points the day after it jumped by 133.
 Stocks pulled away from their lows of the day after the Federal Reserve released minutes from its latest rate-setting meeting, where it pledged to keep rates low for the foreseeable future and said inflation remained at bay. The Fed raised its expectations for economic growth during the second half of this year, but said unemployment would remain high. 
 Before the report, shares had been falling after the government revised its calculation of third-quarter economic growth down to 2.8 percent, from its original estimate of 3.5 percent, the latest sign that the recovery is likely to be slow.
 Meanwhile, the Conference Board said its Consumer Confidence Index rose to 49.5 in November from a revised reading of 48.7 in October. While better than expected, the report showed that consumers remained gloomy heading into the holiday season. A reading above 90 means the economy is on solid footing.
 ''It's all about the daily data,'' said Howard Ward, chief investment officer of the Gamco Growth Fund. ''Today's was uninspiring.''
 Mr. Ward said a warning from China's central bank that commercial banks there should control their lending also weighed on the market, financial stocks in particular. The comments raised concerns about growth in one of the biggest trade partners of the United States.
 The market's modest moves came after a big rally on Monday carried the Dow Jones industrials up to their highest level in just over a year. A weakening dollar and an upbeat report on housing lured investors back into stocks after a three-day losing streak.
 The Dow fell 17.24 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,433.71. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.59 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,105.65, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 6.83 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,169.18.
 The dollar's weakness has been a big driver behind higher stock prices this year. Investors have been taking advantage of interest rates at record lows to invest in assets other than cash that can earn them better returns.
 As the end of the year approaches, however, safe haven assets like the dollar and Treasury bonds have become more appealing as investors seek to safeguard some of the big gains in the stock market this year. 
 A report of the fourth consecutive month of improving house prices in September did little to shore up investor confidence. The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index rose 0.3 percent in September from the previous month.
 A slightly stronger dollar put pressure on the shares of commodities and materials producing companies. 
 Among health care stocks, Medtronic rose more than 7 percent after it reported a 59 percent increase in its quarterly profit and raised its full-year outlook. Shares gained $2.94 to $43.25.
 Bond prices rose after a strong auction of five-year notes. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 12/32, to 100 19/32, and the yield fell to 3.30 percent, from 3.35 percent late Monday. 
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills and five-year notes:

HEADLINE: Atlantic Yards Wins Appeal To Seize Land

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
After enduring three years of delays, several lawsuits and the collapse of the real estate market, the $4.9 billion Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn took a major step forward on Tuesday when New York's highest court ruled that the state can seize private property for the 22-acre development.
 The Court of Appeals ruled 6 to 1 that the state could exercise eminent domain in claiming businesses, public property and private homes for economic development projects like Atlantic Yards. In doing so, the court backed the state's assessment that the area in question -- where some holdouts had refused to sell their property -- fit the legal definition of being blighted. 
 The ruling also had broader implications -- reaffirming New York's use of eminent domain even as many state legislatures seek to curb government's power to condemn private property. 
 The project's opponents had argued that eminent domain on behalf of the private developer, Bruce C. Ratner, was improper and unconstitutional. They vowed to continue their battle, but there was no question that a cloud of uncertainty that has hung over Atlantic Yards for more than a year had lifted.
 Mr. Ratner called the court's ruling a ''light-switch'' kind of decision for the long-stalled project. ''I look at this as the last major hurdle; now we can proceed as we've wanted to for the last three years,'' he said on Tuesday. ''The courts have made it clear that this project represents a significant public benefit for the people of Brooklyn and the entire city.'' 
 Mr. Ratner plans to begin selling tax-free bonds next month to finance the development's cornerstone project: an 18,000-seat basketball arena for the New Jersey Nets at Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues near downtown.
 Construction work is already under way at portions of the site. The developer expects that it will take about 28 months to build the arena, enabling the Nets to move from East Rutherford, N.J., to Brooklyn around June 2012.
 Those opposed to the project said the decision, while a setback, was hardly the end of the fight.
 ''The fight against the Atlantic Yards project is far from over,'' said Daniel Goldstein, a spokesman for Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, a community group that opposes the project. ''The community has four outstanding lawsuits against the project and, meanwhile, the arena bond financing clock ticks louder and louder for Ratner. While this is a terrible day for tax-paying homeowners in New York, this is not the end of our fight to keep the government from stealing our homes and businesses.'' 
 If construction begins in the coming weeks as expected, Atlantic Yards will stand out in a city where 530 construction projects are stalled, sitting lifeless and without adequate financing in virtually every neighborhood. 
 Atlantic Yards would transform a busy intersection of two thoroughfares dominated by a railroad cut where Long Island Rail Road trains are cleaned between rush periods. The billion-dollar arena would be the most expensive in the country and home to Brooklyn's first major sports team since the Dodgers left after the 1957 baseball season. Plans also call for 16 high-rise towers on nearby blocks, mostly residential buildings with as many as 6,430 apartments.
 The developer has said that he will start the first residential building six months after beginning the arena. But with so many new apartments sitting vacant, analysts say it could be many years before demand would justify building so many units in one neighborhood.
 The arena would be built on an 8.5-acre railyard and on adjacent property, much of which Mr. Ratner has acquired. 
 Mr. Ratner is not expected to get possession of all the property until sometime next year. He and his underwriters, Goldman Sachs, plan to sell the bonds for the arena by mid-December. They must complete the bond sale by Dec. 31 to qualify for tax-free financing. Otherwise they would have to resort to conventional financing, which could be prohibitively expensive.
 In the next few days, the developer is also hoping that the rating agencies will give his bonds an investment-grade rating and a lower interest rate. On Tuesday, a state-sponsored local development corporation authorized the sale of a combination of tax-exempt and taxable bonds.
 ''We anticipate having the ratings necessary to successfully market this transaction and fund the project by Tuesday,'' said Greg Carey, a managing director of Goldman Sachs.
 In the meantime, Mr. Ratner's company, Forest City Ratner, completed construction of a $50 million temporary railyard, just to the east of the original one, and turned it over to the Long Island Rail Road on Monday. The company, which was the development partner for the Midtown headquarters for The New York Times Company, continues to do construction work on the railroad property while it awaits title to the rest of the 22-acre parcel.
 Even in New York, where large-scale development is always a contentious affair, Atlantic Yards has been a long-running story of a tenacious developer and an equally implacable opposition. The development has been hobbled by a series of disputes ever since it gained state and city approvals in 2006.
 Mr. Ratner bought the New Jersey Nets in 2004 for $300 million, not out of a love for basketball so much as a lever for a large real estate project. The developer promised great architecture with designs by Frank Gehry; lots of affordable housing for teachers, firefighters and construction workers; a larger and better railyard as a replacement; and for sports romantics, a professional basketball team.
 But critics, led by Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn and some local elected officials, said the proposed towers would loom over the low-scale neighborhood and worsen traffic. Opponents resented that just as the area was improving, they were threatened with condemnation by a developer who got $305 million in subsidies from the state and the city, as well as tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks.
 Since 2004, the project has lost some luster. Mr. Ratner scrapped Mr. Gehry's designs for a glass-walled arena and 16 towers. He renegotiated his deal to buy the railroad land. Instead of paying $100 million at closing, he will make a $20 million down payment and pay the rest over time, while building a smaller permanent railyard than originally promised.
 Now, he is selling a majority stake in the Nets to a Russian billionaire and basketball enthusiast, Mikhail D. Prokhorov. 
 The Nets, who are currently on a West Coast road trip, have started the season 0-13.

HEADLINE: Fed Remains Cautious On Strength of Recovery

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Policy makers at the Federal Reserve have become slightly more optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery, but they continue to predict that unemployment will remain well above 9 percent through 2010, according to new forecasts released on Tuesday.
 The forecasts, along with the minutes of the central bank's policy meeting earlier this month, show that officials remain worried about the fragility of the economic recovery even as they begin a more intensive debate about how and when to remove their emergency supports. 
The uncertainty has probably increased since the Fed meeting three weeks ago. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reduced its estimate of economic growth in the third quarter to 2.8 percent, from 3.5 percent. Last week, the government reported that housing starts plunged 10.6 percent in October, a drop that sent chills through financial markets.
 According to the Fed minutes, policy makers were still unconvinced that the recovery was strong enough to be self-sustaining without government stimulus efforts like the cash-for-clunkers program.
 ''It was not clear how much of the recent firming in final demand reflected the effects of temporary fiscal programs to support the auto and housing sectors,'' the Fed said in its summary of the discussions. Most policy makers expected the recovery to be ''rather slow'' and to bring only a ''slow improvement'' in unemployment next year.
 But the minutes also hinted at a debate about when to start raising interest rates.
 Fed officials will eventually have to raise the benchmark overnight interest rate, which has been held at virtually zero since last December. In addition, they need to end their program to prop up mortgage lending by purchasing $1.25 trillion in mortgage-related securities. 
 That program is set to end in March, and the real estate industry is already worried that mortgage rates will jump. But at some point, officials want to shrink their holdings and bring the Fed's balance sheet back to normal.
 The minutes describe a spirited debate about the best way to do that, though no hint about when to start. Some members argued that the Fed could sell some of the securities outright. Others warned that such sales could cause a damaging spike in long-term interest rates, and argued that the central bank should manage the ''exit strategy'' with a combination of more indirect approaches. 
 Fed officials also hinted at a debate about when to raise the overnight Federal funds rate from its current level of zero. 
 ''Members noted the possibility that some negative side effects might result from the maintenance of very low short-term interest rates,'' the Fed recounted. Though policy makers decided that the risks were ''relatively low,'' they agreed to ''remain alert'' to them.
 Brian A. Bethune, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said the comments were more like obligatory boilerplate than a signal of future tightening. ''It's like the 18-year-old going out with the keys to the car and says, 'of course I'll drive carefully' before he even gets the sermon from his parents.''
 Most, if not all, of the Fed policy makers appeared to agree that for now unemployment posed a bigger risk than inflation. 
 The new forecasts, produced by each of the Fed governors in Washington and the presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks around the country, were slightly more optimistic about the pace of growth.
 The ''central tendency'' of the forecasts predicted that the economy would expand 2.5 to 3.5 percent next year. That was slightly faster than the predictions from June, reflecting a pickup in growth this summer that was somewhat faster than Fed officials had expected.
 But over all, Fed officials barely budged from their previously somber prognosis of plodding growth, high unemployment and low inflation for the next two years. On average, they predicted that the jobless rate would be 9.3 to 9.7 percent in 2010. They predicted that unemployment would average about 7 percent even in 2012.
 ''Most members projected that over the next couple of years, the unemployment rate would remain quite elevated, and the level of inflation would remain below rates consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's objectives,'' the central bank reported. 
 For practical purposes, Fed officials have generally wanted to keep the core rate of inflation, which excludes volatile prices for food and energy, around 2 percent or slightly below.
 But that core rate has drifted below 1.5 percent in the last year, and most Fed policy makers predicted that it would remain below 2 percent through 2012 and for the longer run as well. To many Fed officials, that means there is still ample time to keep interest rates low without stoking inflation pressures.

HEADLINE: Seeking Deals, Holiday Fliers Get Early Start

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nate Schweber contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Airports big and small will be packed on Wednesday, just as they are every year on the day before Thanksgiving.
 But the long lines and frayed nerves actually started last week, as many penny-pinching travelers booked earlier, and less expensive, flights. 
 As a result, what used to be a quick holiday trip home is now stretching to a week or more. 
 ''I took my boys out of school for a couple days because it was so much cheaper,'' said Peggy Edwards, who flew into New York last Friday from Atlanta with her two sons, and figured she saved at least $100 on each fare by flying earlier.
 ''That's why we decided to make a week of it, to get our money's worth,'' she added.
 Executives at several major airlines said they noticed the shift this year, with the crush starting several days earlier than usual.
 And the airlines, because of the way they set airfares at peak times, gave deal-seeking travelers plenty of reasons to hunt for cheaper alternatives to flying right before the holiday. 
 Rick Seaney, the chief executive of FareCompare.com, a travel Web site, said passengers could have saved up to half off airfares this week by flying the Friday before Thanksgiving and returning the Monday after.
 Mr. Seaney said the poor economy prompted many travelers to seek the lowest fares, even if it meant adjusting their travel dates. 
 ''Everybody's looking at every dime,'' Mr. Seaney said. ''They're all worried about their jobs.'' 
 Two years ago, before the recession, budget-conscious travelers were willing to spend up to $375 round trip to fly home. This year, Mr. Seaney said, many people balked at anything more than $240.
 Many people are indeed staying home, or driving. Air travel is expected to fall 6.7 percent this holiday from last year, according to AAA, the travel group, which predicts 2.3 million people will fly this week.
 The airport crowds late last week surprised many travelers.
 ''It was mobbed today,'' said Linda Moxley, who decided to save money by flying with her family into New York last Friday from her home near Atlanta.
 ''Big surprise,'' she added. ''Very crowded.'' 
 For the airlines, the new booking pattern they have had to prepare for is a marathon rather than a sprint. With so many people flying, disruptions can worsen the ripple effects. A snowstorm can snarl Midwest travel, or bad weather can cause traffic jams at New York's airports, as it did Tuesday when low clouds caused a slowdown in air traffic.
 ''It's just a question of when,'' Donald R. Dillman, a vice president at United Airlines in charge of the company's vast operations control center near O'Hare Airport here, said of flight cancellations. ''But we can be ready.''
 For United, holiday preparations began in October, when teams across the airline and at its five hub airports began daily briefings on the holiday schedule. 
 Since last week, those briefings have been more frequent -- up to three a day -- among executives, airport officials and staff at the operations center, a sprawling, darkened room where 250 flight controllers, schedulers, meteorologists and planners stare at multiple screens on each desk. 
 They track every United plane in the sky and every flight that is scheduled to take place during the day, feeding information to smaller command centers at each of United's hubs.
 United has little wiggle room in its operations, given how many routes it cut and planes it grounded to save money as the industry has struggled with high fuel costs. 
 Full planes make the task of managing the Thanksgiving holiday even harder. A cancellation could mean passengers could be stuck for hours, or even overnight (international travelers can even be held up for days).
 This year, the airline has put three big planes on standby -- a Boeing 747, a 767 and a 777 -- that it can use on short notice, said Joseph C. Kolshak, United's senior vice president for operations.
 United is also introducing a new winter storm policy. If it can give them enough warning based on weather patterns, it will notify passengers 12 to 24 hours ahead of their flights, and offer to rebook them on later trips, letting them stay home rather than be stranded at airports. 
 Mr. Dillman said the bargain-hunting Thanksgiving travelers actually increased the airline's chances of running a smoother operation. 
 ''The earlier you go, the more choices you'll have'' in the event of a delay. He has his own advice for Thanksgiving 2010: ''Avoid Sunday at all costs.''
 The airline has added staff to the 8,700 people who work for United at its O'Hare operations, in every area, like customer service, baggage handling and even the outside companies that provide services like wheelchairs, fuel and catering.
 During the holidays, when there can be as many as 112 flights an hour, infrequent travelers -- who are unfamiliar with check-in kiosks, security procedures and airport layouts -- can slow the routines.
 ''Our goal is to get them through the lobby as quickly as possible and to their aircraft as quickly as possible,'' said Terry Brady, a United vice president who heads the airline's operations at O'Hare.
 Some travelers are hoping to devise new ways to beat the crowds. But given how crowded planes are this year, they seem to be lowering their expectations.
 Shakema Wilson flew to New York last Friday from Atlanta with her daughter -- ''to beat the traffic and all the congestion going on with the airline industry,'' she said.
 She plans to fly back on the day after Thanksgiving. 
 ''We're coming back on 'Black Friday,' '' she said. ''It's going to be a rush, I think.''

HEADLINE: Waiting On Weis at Notre Dame

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
In the dwindling days of college football season, the usual topics of discussion have hardly captivated us. We should be busy parsing Urban Meyer's proclamations about staying at Florida or squawking about the befuddling permutations -- and maddening existence -- of the Bowl Championship Series. Instead, there is a strange fixating pull to the implosion at Notre Dame, where Coach Charlie Weis's imminent demise has become the slow-motion car crash no one can stop craning their necks to watch.
 For his part, Weis appears to be trying to spiff up the paint job on the car before it crashes, giving an extended interview with John Walters of Fanhouse.com. He expresses bitterness about the personal nature of criticism, said his wife declined to go to one of his games Saturday for the first time, all but says he is headed back to the N.F.L. because, ''I'm more respected there.'' Of course, there are differing views of Weis, who, Mike Freeman of CBSSports.com writes, did not earn much good will at Notre Dame. While Dan Wetzel of Yahoo.com urges Notre Dame to end its decade and a half of bad hires, Ray Ratto writes on CBSSports.com that it's time for Notre Dame to wake up and realize it isn't all that special anymore. 
 At least no one is approaching Weis and punching him in the jaw, a fate reserved for his quarterback, Jimmy Clausen. And on the topic of coaching incompetence, he isn't getting nearly as pounded as Yale's Tom Williams and Louisiana State's Les Miles, whose blunders last weekend have people wondering just what is going on in those college headsets. Williams is even drawing unfavorable comparisons to Bill Belichick for his outrageous fourth-and-22 call against Harvard, for which he apologized to his players on Monday.
 You may also extend your amazement to the B.C.S., which hired the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer to spiff up its image. Perhaps it is fitting to hire the man who did P.R. for the Iraq War, but Fleischer is also fresh off a bang-up job (as in multiple-car crash) for the United States Olympic Committee.
 The N.F.L., meanwhile, is enjoying the image makeover being accomplished by Titans quarterback Vince Young, who led Tennessee to its fourth straight victory Monday night, a turnaround story that shows just how far Young has come in the past year, writes Alex Marvez on Foxsports.com. The Bills would love to find themselves a story like that, but instead are stuck being snubbed by the unemployed coach Bill Cowher, who reportedly has eyes for the Bears' or Texans' jobs. Even though those jobs aren't actually open yet.
 There could be an opening soon in Cleveland, where Eric Mangini's latest flailing is accusing the Lions of faking injuries to slow down the Browns. You can stop laughing any time now. Breathe. Have a sip of water.
 Of course, no coach's seat is toastier these days than the Nets' Lawrence Frank, who, Yahoo.com's Adrian Wojnarowski believes, deserves better than the Dead Coach Walking tag he's wearing these days.
 The pressure in baseball surrounds the free agency market, where teams will spend the gross national product of a small nation on utility infielders, but the Yankees are vowing not to spend another $429 million this off-season. That sound you hear is the agent Scott Boras saying, ''Darn!'' and canceling his vacation to outer space. The Twins are hoping it does not cost nearly that much to keep the most valuable player Joe Mauer in Minnesota, which they desperately need to do, writes Scott Miller on CBSSports.com. His contract extension is a big test for the Twins, writes Joe Christensen of The Minneapolis Star-Tribune.
 Mauer could sign a $429 million contract, but if Notre Dame hasn't fired Weis yet, no one may notice.

HEADLINE: These Rates Would Shock A Loan Shark

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Just in time for Thanksgiving last year, a credit card offer arrived in the mail. The (introductory) rate was 2 percent. Malcolm S. jumped. A student at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, Malcolm was looking after the affairs of a grandfather in a nursing home.
 Soon, he had run up $2,000 in charges. Even sooner, the 2 percent rate vanished. 
 On Tuesday morning, he was on the 11th floor of a courthouse in Brooklyn, facing a lawyer for the credit card company, a judge and a debt balance that had metastasized to $4,300 with interest and fees. 
 The interest rate was around 29 percent. The judge, Noach Dear, held his head. ''John Gotti must be looking down and smiling,'' Judge Dear said. ''Even he wouldn't have the chutzpah to charge that interest.''
 The lawyer for the bank, JPMorgan Chase, said he himself had been charged 29 percent interest on a credit card. ''And I made the payments,'' the lawyer said.
 After the judge said he would hold a trial in January if the case wasn't settled, Malcolm, 21, walked to the elevator. ''It was mostly for Christmas and my grandfather,'' he said, asking that his full name not be used. ''I was immature. I've learned my lesson.''
 Room 1101 at 141 Livingston Street is full of lessons. It is the consumer debt court for Brooklyn, the peephole through which you can see the ocean. Five days a week, by 9:30 in the morning, every bench in the room is packed with people who owe. A few lawyers, their arms wrapped around folders, stand in the aisles to represent the banks that issued the cards, or the collection agencies that have purchased the debts, usually for 10 cents on the dollar. Capital One. Citibank. Worldwide Asset. Chase. Arrow Financial. Throughout Tuesday morning, Judge Dear inquired about the interest on unpaid balances, and the 29 percent cited in the Malcolm S case was typical. Once, such numbers were unheard of.
 Between 1978 and 1980, the banking industry was effectively liberated from limits on the interest that could be charged on loans, including credit cards. A Supreme Court decision and federal legislation overrode most state laws that defined and prohibited usury. A new world of payday loans, tax refund loans, subprime mortgages and teaser-rate credit cards was born, just as real hourly wages, adjusted for inflation, were stagnating. It took three decades for the country to borrow and lend its way into a global financial collapse. 
 The benches in Room 1101 were full before the stock market crashed, and they remain jammed. 
 And now, usury, a word from the days of burning bushes and stone tablets, is again being uttered. This week, representatives from chapters of the Industrial Areas Foundation are meeting in London to discuss ways of getting real caps on interest rates.
 ''The rates are much more important than looking at the big salaries at the tops of the banks,'' said Judith Trachtenberg, who is in London on behalf of her temple on the Upper West Side, Congregation B'nai Jeshurun, which belongs to Metro I.A.F., the local chapter of the Industrial Areas Foundation. 
 The argument is that prohibitions on usury can be found in every page of human history, written there by government, religious teaching, social custom. ''There's nothing new about speed limits on roads, either,'' said Mike Gecan, a senior organizer with Metro I.A.F. 
 SINCE August, Mr. Gecan and other leaders of the group have met twice with executives at Citibank to push for limits on interest. At a meeting on Oct. 19, according to Mr. Gecan, John P. Carey, the chief administrative officer for Citigroup's credit card business, said a cap was not out of the question, as long as it was indexed to inflation, unemployment and the prime rate. 
 ''So I said, 'Well, that's interesting. And it's not a no,' '' Mr. Gecan said. ''He said, 'That's right.' ''
 Through a spokesman, Mr. Carey called that a misinterpretation, but he actually cited the same factors on setting rates as Mr. Gecan, adding that they needed to provide for an ''appropriate rate of return'' and not have an adverse effect on credit availability.
 All Tuesday, lawyers for the banks and collectors stood outside consumer debt court, trying to make deals before the judge ordered a trial. Judge Dear dismissed a dozen cases because the banks were not ready to produce records and witnesses.
 After one, a man with a cane shuffled toward the door, then turned around.
 ''When do I come back?'' he asked.
 ''You don't have to,'' Judge Dear said.

HEADLINE: Nets Have Dug a Big Hole, but Their Foundation Is in Place

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ABRAMS

 BODY:
 The Nets have lost their first 14 games in a start that is threatening to make their season irrelevant before the calendar turns to 2010. The long-term future, however, looks a lot brighter.
The final challenge to their plans to build an arena in Brooklyn was denied Tuesday, increasing the likelihood of the Nets' opening the 2012-13 season there. No matter where they play that season, their two budding stars -- Brook Lopez and Devin Harris -- give them the building blocks for an improved on-court product.
 New York's Court of Appeals dismissed a challenge over the use of eminent domain in constructing the long-planned and long-delayed Atlantic Yards project near Brooklyn's downtown and ushering in a new arena for the Nets. 
 The ruling was the last major hurdle in the groundbreaking process. The Nets, who play at the often-barren Izod Center in East Rutherford, N.J., now can begin planning for their move to Brooklyn. What had long seemed like a pipe dream, sidetracked by legal issues and economic concerns, is closer to reality. 
 The Nets may be in position to lift themselves back into the N.B.A.'s consciousness by then, if not before. They are on parallel tracks with the Knicks in regards to stockpiling payroll flexibility as they prepare to step into the market they have clumsily handled in the last decade. 
 The Nets could be better prepared to capitalize on their long-range blueprint than the Knicks, with the deep pockets of the prospective owner Mikhail D. Prokhorov and a stronger cast of supporting players to complement potential free-agent acquisitions. 
 Lopez and Harris will still be under contract in 2012-13 and occupy the center and point guard positions, two of the most difficult spots to fill in the N.B.A.
 ''They certainly are two positions that you'd like to have a quality player, and we're fortunate to have two guys in Brook and Devin who are young players and still have room to grow and hopefully they will,'' Rod Thorn, the Nets' president, said.
 Both will be relatively young and in their prime. Harris will enter the final season of his contract in 2012-13. Meanwhile, the Nets also have the option of retaining Courtney Lee and Terence Williams, two promising young players, that season. Lastly, they are headed toward a high lottery draft pick after this season and possibly a run at the Kentucky freshman guard John Wall. 
 The present is not quite as promising. Coach Lawrence Frank and the Nets flew to Denver for their game against the Nuggets on Tuesday night barreling toward the worst start in N.B.A. history with a four-game trip in their forecast.
 Their 101-87 loss dropped them to 0-14, the effects of a raft of injuries and salary purging over the last two seasons. The trip ends in Los Angeles against the Lakers on Sunday, and if the Nets return home winless, they will have matched the 1988-89 expansion Miami Heat and 1999 Los Angeles Clippers for worst start in league history. 
 If so, history will not reflect the injuries, the long hours of Frank, whose job is on the line, or the cost-cutting demands from the current owner, Bruce C. Ratner. Instead, the Nets may stand as holders of the league's worst start if they lose to the Dallas Mavericks on Dec. 2. 
 ''That's just the way it is,'' Thorn said. ''Your fans, when they come to the game, they want you to win. They're only concerned with whether you win. They're not concerned with who's playing and who's not playing. There are players out across the league. Every night, there are good players who aren't playing. I don't think the majority of people are interested one way or another about who is injured or who is not injured.''
 After Tuesday's court ruling, the future appears much brighter, but how to bridge that gap is still uncertain. Ratner purchased the franchise in 2004 for $300 million, originally planning to transplant the Nets from New Jersey as early as 2006. 
 The hurdles the Atlantic Yards project faced continually pushed back the time frame, while the Nets transformed into a lame-duck organization with a small fan base to claim as its own. In the preseason, the franchise said it might relocate to Newark until the Brooklyn arena is complete, but even that layover faces added hurdles and needs the support of New Jersey's governor-elect, Chris Christie. 
 The Nets will have plenty of salary-cap space after the season for what is expected to be the N.B.A.'s most sought-after free-agent class, headlined by LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. If one or all of the players depart their current teams, the Nets could become spenders, depending on the progress of the ownership shift. But they will have to entice a player willing to buy into the long-range plan and play away from the glistening New York skyline the first two years of his contract. 
 And just like the Knicks, the Nets will not budge from a long-term plan with hopes of a better tomorrow. Thorn is firmly aware of the prospects of a bright future. It is the now that is difficult to cope with. 
 ''In my position, I'm not playing and not coaching, and I always try to look at is as what's better for us short term and long term,'' Thorn said. ''What we don't want to do is do something that will affect us marginally in the short term and be worse off in the long term.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 08, 2009

 CORRECTION:
 An article in some editions on Nov. 25 about the long-term future of the New Jersey Nets misstated the year that the developer Bruce C. Ratner bought the team. It was 2004, not 2003. (The error also appeared in articles on June 5, June 29 and Sept. 24.) The article also misstated the year that the Nets originally planned to move to Brooklyn. It was as early as 2006, not in time for this season.

HEADLINE: Industrial Real Estate, A New Jersey Bulwark, Shows Some Cracks

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
Over the years, as the real estate markets for offices, residences and stores in New Jersey have gone through peaks and valleys, the market for industrial real estate has been like the buildings themselves -- not flashy, but big, solid and reliable. 
 No longer. The tenor of third-quarter market reports about the warehouse sector has ranged from unhappy to abysmal. 
 One big commercial real estate services concern, CB Richard Ellis, reported, for instance, that 11.7 percent of the state's industrial property was available for either purchase or lease as of Sept. 30. That was the highest rate it has recorded since 1992 and a 32 percent rise in 12 months.
 Another company, Cushman & Wakefield, uses somewhat different parameters in its calculations, but said it agreed with the ''thrust and reasoning'' of CBRE's report. Its measure of the vacancy rate for warehouses and distribution centers was 8.8 percent as of Sept. 30. 
 Furthermore, industrial specialists said that asking rents were plummeting statewide, and that in many submarkets, effective rents were the lowest in a decade. 
 In two large industrial areas off the New Jersey Turnpike that have traditionally had robust real estate trade -- the Exit 8A and 7A submarkets, as they are known -- the property availability rate is 24 and 29 percent, respectively, said David Knee, an industrial specialist and managing director with Jones Lang LaSalle, another commercial real estate company. 
 ''Staggering,'' Mr. Knee said. ''I haven't seen it in all my 21 years in the business.''
 The iPort 12 International Trade and Logistics Center, a huge ''intermodal'' facility only four miles from the Port of Newark, finally found its first tenant in August, almost two years after construction was finished.
 The Graybar Electric Company took 136,250 square feet at the 1.2-million-square-foot facility, which is off Turnpike Exit 12 in Carteret. The warehouse has 36-foot ceilings and can handle shipments arriving by rail, road or water. 
 Graybar, a Fortune 500 company that distributes electrical and communications products, had planned to buy a building in New York. Instead, it secured a 10-year lease with multiple ''incentives,'' including a period of free rent, according to its broker.
 The iPort building is one of several behemoths that were started on speculation a few years ago, during a period when demand seemed insistent for more big-box distribution centers at strategic locations in the region.
 But then the national economy swooned. Retail business shriveled, the tonnage of goods being delivered at New Jersey ports slipped and the ''monster'' industrial buildings -- as Cushman's industrial specialist, Stanley B. Danzig, terms anything over 750,000 square feet -- became functionally obsolete, in some cases before they were finished.
 ''When spec building is going on, the idea among developers is: Let's make it as big as the municipality will allow, with minimum 36-foot ceilings -- clear height'' for trucks, ''superflat floors, everything perfect -- and see what rent we can get,'' said Mr. Danzig, a broker.
 ''Landlords who had been hoping to lease these full-building monsters are now acquiescing to partial-building deals,'' he said.
 Even smaller buildings are breaking up space for multiple users. Mr. Danzig mentioned a recent deal that his company had brokered for about half the space in a new 340,000-square-foot building in the port service area of Elizabeth.
 Huge blocks of space are apparently no longer in demand. ''The only sweet spot for deals,'' said William Waxman, a senior vice president at CB Richard Ellis, ''is for those under 250,000 square feet.''
 Some brokers said the only activity is in ''blends and extends,'' their term for deals in which a company consolidates its space from more than one building to a single site, or extends a current lease while taking less space -- ordinarily, in these times, at a reduced rental rate.
 The average asking rent for industrial property as of Sept. 30 was $5.66 a square foot a year, down from $6.14 last year at that point, according to CBRE's numbers. In central New Jersey, south of Trenton, the price drops have been particularly sharp, according to CBRE. 
 The actual rents being paid after concessions and discounts are taken into account are consistently below asking rates, the company said. In central New Jersey, average paid rates were reported to have fallen 19 cents, to $5.04 a square foot, in the third quarter alone. 
 Mr. Knee of Jones LaSalle said he knew of a recent deal in the 7A submarket in which the effective rent worked out to less than $3 a square foot.
 ''The fundamental reason for all this is that retail demand is way off,'' said David T. Houston Jr. of Colliers Houston & Company, who said he has been in the business for more than 30 years.
 Despite the bleak numbers, however, Mr. Houston claims the sector is not moribund. ''I still get a call every day from somebody looking to buy industrial property in New Jersey,'' he said. ''And we still have the tenth-lowest vacancy rate of any market in the country.''
 ''I just sold a building in Edison to the AriZona Beverage Company,'' the producer of AriZona Tea, he added. The company purchased a 500,000-square-foot building owned by the industrial development and management company ProLogis to use for bottle distribution.
 The food and beverage industries are holding steady better than the retail sector, Mr. Houston noted. But ''the users of the 'big boxes' are typically retailers,'' said Mindy Lissner, an industrial specialist with CBRE. ''They are pretty much out of the market for a while.''
 Consistently ranked as the third- or fourth-largest market in the country, New Jersey's industrial sector ''is in no danger of dying or disappearing as a regional hub'' because of its location in a densely populated region, Mr. Danzig said. 
 ''The big companies still need to distribute consumer goods from Washington to Boston,'' he said. ''That's not going to change. But people's appetite for goods is down at the moment, and it's going to take time -- who knows how long -- until it revives.''
 Various analysts also noted that new construction had come to a virtual halt, which meant existing available space would be absorbed sooner. Cushman & Wakefield says that while some two million square feet of development was under way last year at this time, only 200,000 square feet was under construction in the third quarter.

HEADLINE: An Upturn in Housing May Be Reversing

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD and JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Home prices are enduring an early winter chill, raising the odds that the economy may suffer another jolt while it is still weak.
 Two price indexes released Tuesday indicated that the momentum the housing market showed over the late spring and summer is faltering, even as the government said the economy grew at a slower pace in the third quarter than previously reported.
 The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index, a closely watched measure of the housing markets in 20 metropolitan areas, barely rose in September, rising 0.3 percent from August on a seasonally adjusted basis. Prices fell for the month in nine cities in the index, including Boston, New York, Seattle and Charlotte, N.C. 
 A report from the Federal Housing Financing Agency showed that prices were flat in September from August.
 Real estate, which has traditionally brought the economy out of recession, seems increasingly likely this time to hold it back. The housing market's epic boom early this decade has turned into an epic bust whose effects may take years to shake off.
 The housing market is confronting an abundance of inventory, high unemployment, fearful consumers and devastated family balance sheets.
 ''There is no clear, easy way out for housing,'' said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo. ''Contrary to my hopes, housing prices and the housing market in general will weaken again.'' 
 He forecast a new decline in prices of as much as 10 percent, which he expected to shave a half-point off the nation's economic output just as it emerges from the recession. 
 In its report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said the economy grew at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the third quarter, down from the 3.5 percent rate reported last month.
 The revised number, based on more complete data, was in line with analyst expectations. It was larger than the typical adjustment, underscoring the erratic nature of the recovery. But although growth was slower, the third quarter ended the longest economic contraction since World War II, with the economy expanding for the first time in a year.
 Little of this recovery is reflected in housing prices, which are limping despite improved sales volume. 
 The Case-Shiller index, which covers about 45 percent of the United States housing market, is a three-month moving average. Since July and August were relatively strong, the weak September report could indicate a plunge in prices.
 The Federal Housing Finance Agency uses data from the government mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which until recently were limited to loans below $417,000. Its index tends to swing less widely than Case-Shiller.
 The two housing price reports lag, by a month, the figures on the volume of home resales, which were issued Monday for October. Home resales jumped 10.1 percent to the highest level in two years, better than analysts had expected. 
 Much of the increase was attributed to the $8,000 first-time buyer's tax credit, which had been set to expire Nov. 30 but has been renewed through spring. Buyers who have already owned a home are now eligible for a $6,500 credit. 
 While brisk sales volume should, in theory, push up prices, Maureen Maitland, the vice president for index services at S.& P., said the oversupply of inventory was acting as a brake. ''You can look down the street and have 10 houses to choose from,'' she said. 
 About 3.57 million used homes are for sale, a number that has been declining but is still higher than the historic average. It represents seven months of inventory at the current sales rate.
 Ms. Maitland speculated that the housing market might follow a ''W'' pattern, as the price lows plumbed last spring are tested again this winter.
 ''There is going to be more moderation and downturn in the coming months,'' she said.
 While that might be good for prospective buyers, it would put more stress on would-be sellers and everyone who looks to his or her house to measure net worth and ability to spend.
 Consumers are much poorer than they were, and are acting accordingly. Consumer spending in the third quarter increased 2.9 percent, less than the 3.4 percent originally reported.
 That number worried some economists, who said it was below healthy margins and even lower than growth levels in 1983, when joblessness was as high. Consumer spending makes up about 70 percent of the economy.
 Julia Coronado, senior United States economist at BNP Paribas, said the revised figures suggested economic renewal would be mild indeed.
 ''It's going to be a very gradual pace of recovering instead of a roaring return to business as usual,'' she said. ''The G.D.P. number highlights this recovery is different from prior recoveries.''
 Also released Tuesday was the S.& P./Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. That index covers a broader segment of the market, about 75 percent, but is released quarterly, rather than monthly.
 The national index showed an 8.9 percent decline in the third quarter of 2009 from the third quarter of 2008, a substantial improvement over the 14.7 percent decline in the annual rate of return in the second quarter of 2009.
 Despite such improvements, it will be a long time under the most favorable circumstances before housing recovers what it lost. The 20-city composite index is off nearly 10 percent in the last year and 29.1 percent since its 2006 peak.
 Prices in Las Vegas have declined for 37 months and are down more than half from their peak. At the other extreme is Dallas, which did not have much of a boom and thus did not have so far to fall. Prices there are only down about 5 percent.
 Florida has been ravaged almost as much as Las Vegas. About a quarter of its homeowners with mortgages are late with payments. But even there, some people are still buying.
 ''They're not buying as investors, they're buying as homeowners,'' said Grant Stern of Morningside Mortgage Corporation in Bay Harbor Islands, Fla., near Miami Beach. ''Nobody expects a 50 percent gain. Flat is the new up.''
 One of Mr. Stern's clients is Howard Roth, who recently moved to Florida from Oakland, Calif., where he lived in an apartment. He closed on a house in Boca Raton on Monday.
 ''I wanted a dog, and a yard for a dog,'' Mr. Roth, a 61-year-old retiree, said. The turmoil in the market did not faze him.
 ''America always bounces back,'' he said. ''Somebody's got to make a move.''

HEADLINE: Budget Hawks With a Buffet Of Options

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 If the Senate were going to write a new rule for Medicare payments meant to slow the growth of medical costs, you might think that the rule would apply to hospitals and doctors. A fair amount of medical care is, after all, provided by hospitals and doctors. 
 But the Senate's health reform bill exempts hospitals from just such a rule until 2019. Doctors, meanwhile, are likely to be effectively exempt, the Congressional Budget Office says. And come 2019, a separate part of the rule will change, making the entire thing mostly moot.
 This odd situation is just one of the opportunities that awaits those senators who don't yet seem to have a firm position on health reform. All along, these centrist senators -- Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Olympia Snowe of Maine and others -- have claimed that containing costs was among their highest priorities. Yet it's never been clear how serious how they were. Most have not been aggressively pushing cost containment proposals.
 The bill brought to the floor last week by Harry Reid, the Senate leader, has offered them a chance to make good on their rhetoric. 
 On the positive side, the bill includes nearly every big idea that health economists and medical researchers have for slowing cost growth -- as well as for improving the patchwork quality of American health care. 
 But many of the ideas, like the rule on Medicare reimbursement, have been at least partly neutered. A provision to punish hospitals for infecting their patients, for example, would cut payments for the related treatments by a mere 1 percent. A provision meant to help people who don't like the insurance options offered by their employer would apply to only a tiny fraction of them. A provision to encourage more cooperation among doctors would not apply to the areas where it is needed the most: chronic diseases like diabetes and congestive heart failure.
 ''There is a lot to like in the bill,'' Dr. Alan Garber of the Stanford School of Medicine says, ''but it needs to go further.''
 Thus the opportunity for those centrist senators: to achieve their stated goal, they don't suddenly need to turn themselves into health care wonks and rewrite the bill. They just need to improve what's already there.
 Complaining that Congress and the White House aren't doing enough to reduce the deficit is always a popular pundit game. So it's no surprise that the last few weeks have been filled with knowing claims that health reform will fail to control spiraling health costs.
 Sometimes, however, Washington really does succeed in reducing the deficit. Presidents Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower both did it. President Bill Clinton and Congress eliminated the deficit. Their 1993 budget bill was derided by some of the same people now criticizing health reform as an economy wrecker. Instead, that budget bill created the first significant surpluses since the late 1940s (and helped make possible the 1990s economic boom). 
 Health reform, done right, also has enormous potential. And the Senate bill isn't all that far from doing it right. Ronald Brownstein has written a detailed essay for The Atlantic's Web site, in which he breaks down the bill and quotes mostly pleased health experts, like Robert Reischauer, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office whose skepticism of Mr. Clinton's reform helped kill it. Jonathan Gruber of M.I.T. calls himself ''a known skeptic on this stuff'' before adding, ''I can't think of a thing to try that they didn't try.''
 It is the execution of the ideas that can be problematic.
 In a column two weeks ago, I laid out six issues that would determine whether health reform would change health care (beyond expanding insurance, which clearly remains crucial). That is, would the bill encourage the best treatments? Would it discourage errors and needless infections? Would it bring costs under control so that most workers could again receive a decent raise? 
 By these measures, Mr. Reid's bill is vastly better than the bill the House passed this month. The Reid bill, however, is not as strong as the bill that the Senate Finance Committee wrote last month, which itself was good but not ideal. 
 On only one of the six areas has Mr. Reid seemed to have come up with an improvement: insurance choice. His bill would give a small number of people with high premiums the ability to opt out of their employer-provided plan and choose a plan on the insurance exchange for the uninsured and small businesses. This provision is one of the few in any bill that would immediately help people who don't like their employer coverage.
 On three of the six areas -- preventing medical errors, financing more research into what kinds of care actually work and creating pilot programs to reward doctors who provide good, less expensive care -- the bills from Mr. Reid and the finance committee are similar. On a fifth area -- a tax on the costliest insurance plans -- the Reid version is only slightly worse. The tax is still big enough to bring down insurance costs and raise incomes.
 The real problem with the Reid bill comes in the sixth area, the one I alluded to at the start of this column. The finance committee bill called for the creation of an independent commission with the power to suggest changes to Medicare payment rates, based on available evidence. The goal would be to steer the medical industry away from treatments that brought big profits and no net health benefit. 
 Economists put the idea near the top of their wish list, as has President Obama. It has the potential to bend the curve of Medicare spending, as the experts say, and eventually spread to the rest of medicine. When Medicare policy has changed in the past, private insurers have often followed suit.
 Even as is, the finance panel's version of the commission had its flaws. It specifically exempted hospitals and hospices until 2019, presumably for political reasons. The Congressional Budget Office also thinks the commission will be too weak to prevent Congress from overriding any ideas that apply to doctors and their powerful lobbyists. The commission's work would then be restricted to home health care agencies and a few other parts of the medical industry.
 Yet, as worrisome as these provisions were, they still left a promising commission in place after 2019. The Reid bill does not. 
 The details are technical but important. Beginning in 2020, the commission would be told to reduce the growth rate of Medicare's budget merely to the growth rate of non-Medicare health spending. So if per capita health spending kept rising 6 percent a year, as it has recently, Medicare's budget could keep rising at that rate -- eventually making the program insolvent or requiring huge tax increases. 
 Instead of turning Medicare into a role model, the Reid bill says it simply must be no more wasteful than the rest of the health care system. Lewis Carroll would be proud.
 What will those centrist senators do? 
 A cynic may suggest they were never as fiscally conservative as they let on. Some have preferred repeating bromides about fiscal conservatism to engaging in the details of cost-cutting. Others, like Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and many Blue Dog Democrats in the House, have seemed mainly interested in securing Medicare dollars for rural areas. Still others -- including Joe Lieberman, who represents a state, Connecticut, that is home to many insurance executives -- have seemed obsessed with the so-called public insurance option. None of these positions will fix the health care system.
 Fortunately, though, the senators still have plenty of opportunity to prove the cynics wrong.

HEADLINE: Thanks For the Memories

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD. 
Thomas L. Friedman is off today.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 At his Cabinet meeting Monday afternoon, President Obama took a moment to give thanks to his team.
 Sipping a glass of water, the president offered special gratitude to the woman on his right.
 ''I advised this hard-working Cabinet to get a little bit of rest this week,'' he said, looking at Hillary Clinton, ''particularly the people who have been traveling around the globe day-in and day-out and don't know what time zone they're in.''
 The secretary of state, with a china cup and saucer in front of her, smiled. 
 In the back of the room, back where they were parched, back where no water or coffee was served for the two-hour meeting, sat Greg Craig, the White House counsel who was a ghostly presence, given his death by a thousand leaks.
 Only a year after he had helped Barack Obama get elected by eviscerating his close friend, Clinton White House colleague and Yale Law School classmate, Hillary Clinton, Craig was himself eviscerated by the Obama inner circle.
 I remember meeting Craig at a book party during the campaign. He upbraided me for writing critical things about Obama. I didn't like being chastised, but I admired his loyalty.
 It couldn't have been easy for Craig, a special counsel in the Clinton White House who directed the response on impeachment, to break away from the Clintons and help the insurgent Obama shatter Hillary's dream of shattering the Oval glass ceiling.
 As Todd Purdum wrote of Craig in The Times in 1998, ''At Yale, he surrendered his $75-a-month apartment in New Haven to Mr. Clinton and his girlfriend, Hillary Rodham, who were a class behind him, and he remains especially close to Mrs. Clinton, friends say.''
 In a memo he sent to the press during the bitter 2008 Democratic primary, Craig made the case that Hillary had exaggerated her foreign policy experience and that she did not pass ''the Commander-in-Chief test.''
 It was brutally effective, taking apart her claims of involvement, country by country, and noting: ''As far as the record shows, Senator Clinton never answered the phone either to make a decision on any pressing national security issue -- not at 3 AM or at any other time of day.''
 I often wondered if Craig and U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, the other former Clinton official who helped undermine Hillary's foreign policy record, would have done so if they had known that after turning on Hillary they would once more end up working beside her; if they had known that Obama can often be more interested in wooing opponents than tending to those who put themselves on the line for him.
 There were complaints that Craig was out of the loop, but couldn't Obama have walked the single West Wing staircase up to his counsel's office and looped him in?
 Craig was, after all, simply defending positions that Obama himself took during the campaign, from closing Gitmo to greater transparency.
 The way the Craig matter was handled sent a chill through some Obama supporters, reminding them of the icy manner in which the Clintons cut loose Kimba Wood and Lani Guinier. But then, Obama is surrounded by many old Clinton hands (and a Clinton).
 Writing in Politico, Elizabeth Drew called it ''the shabbiest episode of his presidency,'' saying that it had caused people who had helped Obama rise to question whether he would behave in as classy and non-Clintonian a fashion as they had hoped.
 It recalled Obama's failure to lift a finger to help Caroline Kennedy -- after she had lifted him at a crucial moment -- when the loopy Gov. David Paterson was dragging her through mud and refusing to announce a decision on the appointment for the New York Senate seat. Paterson was being lobbied by a vengeful Bill Clinton. Bill was still upset at Caroline for bestowing the Camelot mantle, which he had tried to claim during his campaigns, on Obama. Yet no one from the Obama camp tried to counteract Bill and straighten out Paterson.
 Although a handful of donors were invited to the premiere state dinner Tuesday night -- as well as erstwhile allies Craig and Hillary -- many donors and passionate supporters are let down by Obama's detachment, puzzled at his failure to make them feel invested when he's certain to come back to tap their well soon enough.
 It is especially puzzling given that Obama faces tough midterms and a less-than-certain re-election -- and given that we all now know someone on the unemployment line. (A new poll shows Obama and Sarah Palin neck and neck among independents, but then it is a Fox survey.)
 Bill Clinton may not have cared any more about contributors than Obama does, but he was such a talented politician that he made them feel as though they were in ''a warm bath,'' as one put it.
 Obama is more like a cold shower.

HEADLINE: Chief of I.M.F. Urges Continued Stimulus Efforts

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
The chief of the International Monetary Fund urged the world's major economies on Tuesday to retain their economic stimulus programs until there were durable signs of a recovery, including an end to rising unemployment.
 ''A premature exit is the main danger,'' Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the I.M.F, said during an interview at the fund's office here. ''We have to be sure that the recovery is final, that domestic demand is self-sustaining and the peak in unemployment is on the foreseeable horizon.''
 Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who was visiting Europe this week, added that ''the bigger risk is of growth not coming back, a jobless recovery and to believe that we are out of the woods.'' 
 The comments place the I.M.F. firmly on the side of the major Western governments, the primary backers of the fund, in calling for retention of state support like aid for banks and automakers and tax breaks for consumers.
 The I.M.F.'s position contrasts starkly with the prescription it gave to Asian countries grappling with a different economic crisis a decade ago.
 Then, the fund, which is based in Washington, lent money to countries including South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand. But it linked its support to harsh financial medicine like high interest rates and a restrictive fiscal policy aimed at balancing budgets. The conditions were blamed for prolonging the downturn in the region.
 The I.M.F. has ''learned a lot from the Asian crisis -- that one-size-fits-all doesn't work and that you have to adapt to the constraints of the country,'' Mr. Strauss-Kahn said.
 In the current context, continuing the stimulus entails risks, according to some economists and politicians, like impoverishing future taxpayers, creating excessive reliance on foreign creditors, keeping unproductive banks afloat and even stoking inflation.
 Some economists are worried that the splurge in government spending could push the public finances of some countries close to the brink. Rising deficits have caused strains in bond markets, reflecting worries about the possibility of default and the ability of investors to digest the surge in supply.
 In Europe, borrowers like Ireland and Greece have come under particular strain. There has been speculation that the government in Britain -- where the budget deficit is projected to rise above 13 percent of gross domestic product next year -- may face more severe balance of payments difficulties.
 A recent report by Variant Perception, a research firm based in Charlotte, N.C., said the British fiscal situation was ''already on a par with some of the worst financial crises in the postwar period that have precipitated currency crises.''
 Mr. Strauss-Kahn acknowledged the dangers. ''I understand the concerns about deficits and they are not unfounded,'' he said. ''Defaults, of course, are a concern, but they are not likely.''
 He stressed that in the event of extreme strains in government bond markets, systemically important borrowers would find support either from multilateral lenders or central banks.
 He also acknowledged concerns about commercial banks becoming too dependent on ultracheap financing from the major central banks.
 Over all, he said, the fund was more confident about the global outlook than it was in September, when it last released economic projections. This suggests that, excluding a dip in activity in December, it would raise its key forecasts in the update in January. ''The U.S. recovery appears to be stronger than we thought in September,'' he said. ''What I see in the global figures now is that things are moving faster than expected.''
 Regarding currency adjustments, Mr. Strauss-Kahn said that the euro appeared ''somewhat overvalued,'' while the renminbi was ''still undervalued.'' A rise in the value of the Chinese currency would be a logical element in the country's ''shift from an export-driven economy to one that was more dependent on domestic demand,'' he said.
 The I.M.F. has been asked by the Group of 20 to study ways to allow banks to pay for their own bailouts. It is expected to report on the matter in April. One option it will examine is a tax on financial transactions.
 Meanwhile, the announcement last week by Hungary that it would forgo the next installment of an I.M.F. loan was ''the best news of the year,'' Mr. Strauss-Kahn said. Other countries in the region -- like Ukraine, Latvia, Romania and Serbia -- still face ''challenges,'' he said.
 After the crisis, the I.M.F. will continue to offer technical advice and training as well as taking ''a more formal role linked to the G-20 as a kind of think tank and institution to help implement the follow-up to G-20 meetings,'' he said. Further out, it may even become a lender of last resort.

HEADLINE: The Swaps Market Is Too Big to Ban

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS PAISNER and MARTIN HUTCHINSON

 BODY:
Is the market for credit-default swaps in for a renaissance? George Soros, for one, reckons credit derivatives should be banned. But trading in swaps has so far survived the crisis and market reforms are on the way. Barring unexpectedly draconian regulatory changes, a comeback looks likely. 
 In a credit-default swap, the buyer pays the seller a fee to protect against default on a notional amount of a borrower's debt, typically in increments of $10 million. If the borrower defaults, the seller pays up. Losses on an oversize book of particularly wacky versions of these derivatives forced the American International Group to take a gigantic government bailout. 
 Cheery forecasts for growth in swaps trading from Icap, a British broker, and the Intercontinental Exchange, the clearinghouse, are therefore a bit surprising. After all, the notional volume of outstanding contracts declined by 14 percent, to $36 trillion, in the first half of 2009, according to the Bank for International Settlements. In part, the decline reflects the efforts of dealers to cancel out offsetting contracts. But trading activity has also fallen. 
 There's still uncertainty over reforms being mulled by lawmakers and regulators in the United States and Europe. Sensibly, they mostly want swaps contracts to be traded through central clearinghouses rather than bilaterally, the traditional way of doing business. Done right, that ought to reduce the systemic risk of an individual market participant going bust. It should also mean collateral requirements are standardized and more uniformly enforced. Both reforms would have eased A.I.G.'s troubles. 
 Central clearing of swaps, and maybe exchange trading of the most popular instruments, would accelerate an existing trend toward electronic trading, especially in the United States, which has lagged in that regard. Standardization could also bring in a wider range of users. 
 Admittedly, some policy makers want to squash the swaps market much more forcefully, and the instruments do have structural imperfections that still need work. 
 But it looks likely that reforms to improve the market's workings will trump the idea of shutting it down. With that in mind, forecasting a return to robust market growth makes sense. Central clearinghouses and electronic trading led the energy derivatives market to bloom in recent years. The return of credit risk-taking wouldn't please everyone, but the credit-default swaps market could emerge bigger and stronger, too.
 The India Option
 Let's hope everyone enjoyed President Obama's first state dinner on Tuesday night in honor of Manmohan Singh, India's prime minister. China, America's second-largest trade partner after Canada, usually gets the bigger reception. But United States trade with India, the world's most populous democracy, is more balanced. 
 The United States-China trading relationship is enormous, but one-sided. Imports are 4.5 times exports to China. That is fueled by the undervalued Chinese currency, but it also to some extent reflects Chinese protectionism that hampers American exports. 
 Trade with India is much smaller, but growing rapidly. It is also closer to equilibrium. Indian exports to the United States are only 25 percent larger than American exports to India, less broken than American trade as a whole. Moreover, India is more open than it used to be to foreign direct investment, typically an American strength. India's foreign direct investment was nearly a third of what China's was in 2008, but up from less than 10 percent in 2000-2. 
 Along with the huge and one-sided trade position, China's holdings of $800 billion in United States Treasuries make America's economic relationship with the country too unbalanced to be comfortable. With its huge population, nearly as large as China's, and robust economic growth rate, India offers the United States a healthy alternative partner. 
 India's finances are not as solid as China's. Moody's warned on Tuesday, for example, that Indian banks had an excessively high level of nonperforming loans. The Indian budget deficit is also large. That, however, is a problem shared with the United States. Mr. Singh, a Social Democrat, should also be broadly in tune politically with Mr. Obama. 
 The Obama administration can't afford to distance itself from China. But economically and politically, India is a more congenial partner. Mr. Obama could avoid developing too much of an overriding bilateral relationship with China by dining more with Mr. Singh.

HEADLINE: Schumer Faults Adidas For Overseas Production

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Adidas is planning to move most production of N.B.A. players' official jerseys and shorts out of the United States, managers of the main factory producing the gear said on Tuesday. 
 With the decision threatening 100 jobs at the factory, American Classic Outfitters in Perry, N.Y., 50 miles east of Buffalo, Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, urged Adidas not to move the jersey operation.
 ''It is flat wrong for Adidas to move the production of jerseys worn by N.B.A. players outside the United States when there are U.S. companies that have done this work so well and for so long,'' Schumer said. ''And to do it in this economic climate adds insult to injury.''
 Schumer said he might ask the N.B.A.'s commissioner, David Stern, to intervene.
 Donna Wampole, a production supervisor at the factory, said it had already cut workers' hours by 20 percent because of Adidas's decision. The nonunion plant made the jerseys worn by Michael Jordan and other members of the 1992 Olympic Dream Team.
 ''I think it's a horrible thing,'' Wampole said. ''I think American teams should be wearing American garments made in the United States.'' 
 Adidas said in a statement that it had decided to begin moving production of N.B.A. uniforms closer to the source for materials. Robert Knoll, senior vice president for American Classic Outfitters, said Adidas informed him that a new fabric for jerseys had been developed in Asia and told the company two months ago that it planned to move production to Thailand -- not just the plant's production for 17 N.B.A. teams, but also its production for uniforms for the W.N.B.A. and for the N.B.A.'s Development League. 
 The plant makes more than half of official N.B.A. jerseys; Adidas has contracts with two other American companies to make such jerseys.
 Knoll said his company and Adidas signed a six-year agreement in 2008, but ''there were so many holes in this contract that if the wind blows in a different direction, they could get out.''
 He said all of the Perry plant's production was for Adidas. The plant also makes uniforms for college and high school teams.
 ''We're going to do everything we can to keep this facility going at the level it was going,'' Knoll said. ''We'll be pursuing new business.''
 Adidas said it produced uniforms at more than 30 plants in North America and would continue to do so.
 The N.B.A. did not reply to telephone messages.

HEADLINE: OBAMA MAY ADD 30,000 TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and ERIC SCHMITT; Jeff Zeleny, Peter Baker and Mark Landler contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama said Tuesday that he was determined to ''finish the job'' in Afghanistan, and his aides signaled to allies that he would send as many as 25,000 to 30,000 additional American troops there even as they cautioned that the final number remained in flux.
 The White House said Mr. Obama had completed his consultations with his war council on Monday night and would formally announce his decision in a national address in the next week, probably on Tuesday. 
 At a news conference in the East Room with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, Mr. Obama suggested that his approach would break from the policies he had inherited from the Bush administration and said that the goals would be to keep Al Qaeda from using the region to launch more attacks against the United States and to bring more stability to Afghanistan. 
 ''After eight years -- some of those years in which we did not have, I think, either the resources or the strategy to get the job done -- it is my intention to finish the job,'' he said. 
 He said that he would outline his Afghanistan strategy after Thanksgiving, adding, ''I feel very confident that when the American people hear a clear rationale for what we're doing there and how we intend to achieve our goals, that they will be supportive.''
 Though he and his advisers have drawn up benchmarks to measure progress and put pressure on the Afghan government to do its part, Mr. Obama offered no details in his public remarks on Tuesday. He was also silent on precisely what would constitute finishing the job in Afghanistan or how soon he envisioned being able to begin extricating the United States from the war there. 
 While the troop levels he orders will go a long way toward defining his position, the White House has stressed that Mr. Obama's review has gone far beyond the numbers to better define the military and civilian-aid components of the effort in Afghanistan, how they fit into efforts to combat Al Qaeda in Pakistan and how to ensure that the American commitment in the region is not open-ended.
 At the meeting on Monday night, Mr. Obama went around the table in the White House Situation Room asking his senior advisers for summations of their individual assessments and to voice any concerns they still had, said an administration official who was briefed on the two-hour meeting. 
 ''There was a lot of back and forth,'' said the official, with Mr. Obama interjecting questions and top aides cutting each other off at times. When the meeting finished shortly after 10 p.m., some of the senior advisers lingered in small groups to continue their discussions, said the official, who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the meeting's confidentiality. 
 The meeting covered a wide variety of issues, including benchmarks to measure progress by Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as the specific number of additional American troops to send. 
 Although his aides told some allies that the troop increase would most likely be slightly below 30,000 -- there are currently 68,000 American troops in Afghanistan -- several officials said Mr. Obama did not appear completely settled on a final number.
 ''He's still not happy,'' one official said. 
 One reason for Mr. Obama's disquiet might be discontent among the members of his own party on Capitol Hill over the prospect of escalating the war and paying for it. Among those present at Monday night's session was Peter R. Orszag, the White House budget director.
 Before a meeting with Mr. Obama on Tuesday afternoon, Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, said during a conference call of economists and bloggers that there was ''serious unrest in our caucus about can we afford this war.''
 Ms. Pelosi said she did not want to sacrifice the party's domestic agenda to the cost of the troop buildup. ''The American people believe that if something is in our national security interest, we have to be able to afford it,'' she said. ''That doesn't mean that we hold everything else'' hostage to that.
 Administration officials said that during the Monday meeting, officials discussed a proposal to deploy the American troops in waves, the first of which would go early next year to be in place in southern or eastern Afghanistan by spring. They said the American military should be able to deploy one brigade per quarter.
 One administration official involved in Afghanistan policy said the president and his top advisers were thinking in terms of ''exit strategies'' and not necessarily ''exit timetables.'' He compared the current thinking to the ''conditional engagement'' that President George W. Bush used in Iraq. 
 As Afghan security forces are trained and deployed, the official said, American officials and commanders would watch closely to determine when operational control of a given area could be turned over to them. That is what happened in Iraq, as American forces gradually turned over control of territory to Iraqis once they had proved their ability. 
 ''As you go along, you might have some target dates,'' the administration official said, noting as an example the proposal by Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who leads the Armed Services Committee, that by 2012, the Afghan Army should be increased to 240,000 soldiers from 92,000, and police forces to 160,000 officers from 84,000.
 Mr. Obama declined to say what day he would make his announcement, but officials said the Congressional leadership had been invited to the White House for a briefing next Tuesday. 
 Administration officials said that as part of his Afghanistan strategy, Mr. Obama would also announce strict benchmarks, or ''performance'' targets, which the United States will expect the Afghan government to meet. Mr. Obama will be tying both military and economic aid to Afghanistan to those targets, the officials said. 
 As the debate over the size of the troop increasehas played out over the last few months, an increase of about 30,000 reinforcements has won the support of Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
 That number would fall between the 40,000 additional troops requested by the American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, and the far smaller number favored by some Obama advisers, including Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Obama will also be making a broader appeal for Afghanistan's neighbors and regional actors to play a role, the officials said. 
 ''We have to do it as part of a broader international community,'' Mr. Obama said at the news conference. ''So one of the things I'm going to be discussing is the obligations of our international partners in this process.''
 After Mr. Obama announces his Afghanistan strategy, Mrs. Clinton will brief NATO allies at a meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels on Dec. 3 and 4. There, Mrs. Clinton is expected to solicit specific contributions from them, including as many as 10,000 additional soldiers, bringing the total number of allied troops in line with General McChrystal's request. Administration officials cautioned that they did not expect contributions to be nailed down until January.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Rise, But Factory Orders Slip

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
Sales of new homes reached their highest level in October in more than a year, the government said Wednesday, but the pace was sluggish and unsold homes lingered for the longest time on record.
 The latest government report on the housing market said that sales of new homes rose 6.2 percent from September, outpacing expectations. 
 The housing report was one of several released on Wednesday that reflected the uncertainty facing a fragile economy. Consumer spending rose last month, but orders for long-lasting manufactured goods dropped sharply. In addition, the number of newly laid-off workers filing claims for unemployment dropped more than expected last week, falling 35,000, to 466,000. That was the first week below 500,000 since January. 
 The Wednesday home sales figures, along with other reports this week, reflected a housing sector that was starting to rebound, yet struggling because consumers remained nervous about their jobs and their depleted savings accounts.
 Home sales in October were up 5.1 percent from the period a year earlier, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 430,000 -- far above the 404,000 predicted by economists and the highest level since September 2008. The biggest growth was in the South, where sales increased 23.2 percent.
 But median prices, which have been relatively stable, fell slightly from a year earlier, to $212,200, raising the possibility of a second collapse of the housing market. 
 For their part, analysts played down the significance of the October sales, noting that numbers overall were so low that the small increases overstated the progress. Longer-term trends, they said, indicated more modest improvements in the housing market.
 ''The October sales pace was a bit stronger than some folks expected, but the bad news is it remains incredibly low,'' Thomas A. Lawler, founder of Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting in Virginia, said. ''The good news is the sales pace was enough for inventories to continue to go down.'' 
 While the number of unsold new homes in October shrank to the lowest level in nearly four decades, the time those houses stayed on the market reached 13.5 months, the longest period since the government began collecting data in 1963.
 ''Selling a new home has never been harder,'' Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said. Yet he said he was encouraged by the decline in the number of unsold homes.
 ''Builders at some point soon are going to have start ramping up production, or they are going to lose sales,'' Mr. Newport said. ''We've seen huge losses, and that's going to start going the other way pretty soon.''
 Part of the rise in sales may be the result of the popularity of the government's credit of up to $8,000 for first-time home buyers. While the availability of the credit probably drove up sales of existing homes, which rose 10.1 percent in October, it probably does not explain much of the upturn in new-home sales.
 That is because buying a new home is a bit of a gamble, with no guarantee of a firm move-in date, and to take advantage of the government credit, a home would need to be ready before the Nov. 30 expiration date. (This month, lawmakers voted to extend the credit through April.) 
 Consumer spending in October rose 0.7 percent, the Commerce Department said, helped by an increase in car sales and rising prices. The number topped expectations and followed a 0.6 percent decrease in September. Income levels rose 0.2 percent for a second month.
 Yet some economists said they were unmoved by the spending increase and believed that high unemployment, mounting debt and meager growth in personal income would continue to limit consumer spending. The personal saving rate, which has fluctuated significantly in the last year, dropped to 4.4 percent in October, from 4.6 percent in September, the government said.
 At the same time, demand for items like refrigerators weakened, as durable goods orders fell 0.6 percent in October, according to another report. 
 The durable goods numbers revealed a mixed picture for manufacturing. Orders fell largely as a result of an 18.4 percent decline in military spending. But after excluding the military, orders rose 0.4 percent in October.
 John Lonski, chief economist Moody's Capital Markets Research Group, said that taken together, the reports showed that the economy was struggling, with lackluster sales and weak spending by businesses leading to high unemployment and nervous consumers.
 ''Growth over the near term will be led by the restocking of inventories, as opposed to any resurgence of consumer spending,'' he said. ''We are in economic recovery, but it is a very mild one.''

HEADLINE: Data on Homes Sales and Jobless Claims Lift Markets

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A drop in unemployment claims and a rise in new-home sales pulled the stock market higher on Wednesday in light trading ahead of Thanksgiving.
 Modest gains on Wednesday left the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index at 13-month highs.
 The economic news, as well as a drop in the dollar, stoked investors' appetite for higher-returning but riskier investments like stocks. For months, investors have been weighing their desire for bigger returns with fears that the stock market will falter if the economy looks as if it won't maintain a recovery. 
 Investors drew confidence from a handful of promising economic reports. The government said new claims for unemployment insurance fell by 35,000 last week, to 466,000.
 The drop in claims suggests the job market is healing, but concern remains that the improvement will be temporary. The jobless rate hit 10.2 percent in October, and many analysts say they believe it will keep rising before starting to improve next summer.
 In other economic reports, new home sales rose 6.2 percent, to an annual rate of 430,000, above what economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected.
 The government also said that spending rose a brisk 0.7 percent last month, after falling in September.
 Increased spending by consumers is seen as necessary for the economy to sustain a rebound. The report was a welcome sign as the holiday shopping season prepared to move into full swing.
 Not all the day's news was promising, however. Orders for expensive manufactured goods dropped 0.6 percent last month, the first decrease since August. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 30.69 points, or 0.29 percent, to 10,464.40, its second gain this week and its best finish since October 2008.
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.98 points, or 0.45 percent, to 1,110.63, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 6.87 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,176.05.
 Markets in the United States are closed Thursday for Thanksgiving and will close early on Friday.
 A. Haag Sherman, chief investment officer at Salient Partners in Houston, said light trading around Thanksgiving indicated that investors should not draw many conclusions about the latest economic data.
 ''The market's reaction has been kind of a muted,'' he said. ''You can't read too much into what the market's doing today.''
 The dollar fell against most other major currencies, while gold rose for the ninth consecutive session, advancing $22.40 to settle at $1,191.80 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Bond prices were mixed. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 9/32, to 100 28/32, pushing its yield down to 3.27 percent from 3.30 percent late Tuesday. The yield on the three-month Treasury bill rose to 0.05 percent from 0.03 percent.
 Beyond the increase in consumer spending, earnings from Tiffany & Company increased confidence about consumer spending for the holidays. The jeweler's third-quarter profit topped expectations, and the company raised its full-year profit forecast. Tiffany rose $2.06, or 4.9 percent, to $43.89.
 Other luxury names rose, as did most retailers. Saks gained 33 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $6.74, while Nordstrom rose $1.15, or 3.4 percent, to $34.83.
 The reports came ahead of the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season on Friday. Investors will be looking for any signals in the coming weeks from retailers about consumer spending, which is the primary driver of the economy.

HEADLINE: Gifts With A Story to Tell

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
SHOPPERS, be advised: The human touch rules this year. Also anything even vaguely critter-like, be it mammalian, reptilian or insectival. Decay, as opposed to the merely antique, is also rampant, imbued with attitude or lush with metaphor. 
 Despite a punishing retail climate, or what David Alhadeff, the owner of the Future Perfect in Brooklyn, calls ''the economic thing,'' merchants and makers of the decorative arts reported that anything that hints of the hand -- indie crafter, artisan, sculptor or even a member of a Dutch (or Brooklyn) design collective -- is still selling. 
 ''People respond much more to authentic, human-centric design now,'' said Chee Pearlman, a design consultant. ''As opposed to the extruded-plastic sort from China. It's clearly a time for genuine connection to the objects in our lives.''
 Or as Grace Bonney, creator of DesignSponge, the craft-centric design blog, put it: ''Vintage has been massive this year. So has the artisanal look, anything that's handmade or pretends to be handmade.'' 
 Indeed, you can find objects that look old, weathered, handcrafted or artisan-produced -- and sometimes all of those things at once -- at all points of the retail compass, from Etsy, the online marketplace devoted to craft and vintage goods, to Design Within Reach, now offering hand-knitted stuffed animals from Peru ($39; see Page 4). Even Ballard Designs, the traditional decorative accessories catalogue, is selling mercury glass objets and ''antique'' demi-johns like the ones you find at flea markets, Ms. Bonney pointed out.
 The Conran Shop, the home of glossy furnishings from Kartell and Herman Miller, is mixing in vintage and ethnic pieces -- Chinese wedding cabinets, for example, or Ethiopian chairs -- at its stores, said Emmanuel Plat, president of the Conran Shop USA. ''Farm tables and French school chairs, we always had a bit,'' he said. ''But in the last two years, we've added more and more, and it's taken off.'' 
 Retrospect, a new store on Smith Street in Brooklyn, limns the current appetite for Victorian-inspired esoterica to great effect. It's noteworthy that it is the sister shop to Environment 337, a perky, bright design store opened in 2001 by Loren Sosna, a textile designer. ''Retrospect is about what I really prefer, things that have age and character,'' Ms. Sosna said. ''Eight years ago, that look was really out of vogue. Now I find people are appreciating it again.''
 Matter, in Brooklyn, has hand-blown glass eyes the size of your hand (in hazel or blue, $500; above right). And West Elm is selling wind-up musical apples and pears in whorled wood ($26; this page, center) that are more homespun than the company's usual groovy fare.
 ''There's still a backlash going on against the austerity of modernism,'' said Julie Lasky, editor of Design Observer, a Web site that covers design and culture. ''It hasn't gone as far as it could, and there are certain scary suggestions that flocked wallpaper or the whole cabinet of curiosities thing may not be over.''
 That said, Ms. Lasky admitted to being ''completely seduced by the craft movement. I find myself spending more and more time on Etsy, which has turned into this amazing marketplace. It's a very impressive development in terms of design.''
 While Etsy is still the spot to find crocheted apple cozies ($7.25 from Kris0376) and raw bacon magnets ($4.99 from Design Dude), it is more and more the place to buy compelling design pieces as well, like a carpenter's clamp bookshelf made entirely of bone china ($500 from Ricochet Studio; above). In fact, Etsy is on track to record $180 million worth of sales this year, according to its chief executive officer and founder, Rob Kalin. That's nearly double its sales a year ago, and almost seven times that of 2007, a stunning amount of growth in this climate.
 ''People are taking 'buy local,' one step further,'' Mr. Kalin said of his four-and-a-half-year-old craft mall. ''Knowing where your food comes from, or your clothes, is extending to wanting to know where your dining room table comes from. It really matters. And I think what makes gifts in particular special is knowing there's a person who made it and a story behind it. I think people want to buy things that tell stories, especially in an age when so few store-bought items tell stories.''
 On a recent rain-flecked afternoon, Mr. Alhadeff of the Future Perfect was simultaneously greeting well-wishers and merchandising, setting out familiar objects (needlepoint graffiti pillows, silver hand-grenade candles) along with more recent work (a bison fur chair by Jason Miller with cute-spooky button ''eyes,'' a calendar in the shape of a huge handmade plywood cross) in his new store on Great Jones Street in Manhattan. Though the Future Perfect's expansion is a sign that the Brooklyn design movement continues to grow, it also speaks to another byproduct of the recession: more-affordable rent. 
 ''Two years ago, we were having our best year, in terms of sales,'' Mr. Alhadeff said. ''But we still couldn't afford Manhattan real estate. Now we can. It's been an amazing opportunity.''
 In the window was an assemblage of old drawers, boxes and tool carry-alls strapped together on a wheeled cart, a piece of furniture made by Joel Voisard, a Queens-based artist. Titled ''Box Cart,'' it came with a $6,500 price tag and fell smack into the storytelling category, owing as much to a 1991 Tejo Remy piece for Droog called You Can't Lay Down Your Memory as to the Joads' overstuffed car in the film version of ''The Grapes of Wrath.''
 Around the corner at Moss, the SoHo high-design emporium, there were candles, kitschy and lifelike, in the shape of tortoises, cactuses and elaborate layer cakes, made by Point a La Ligne, a French company known as the Rolls-Royce of candlemakers (starting at $35).
 Murray Moss, the store's founder, observed: ''What's happening in a big way is a renaissance of figural work.''
 Shoppers clustered around an exhibit of Bots, mechanical toys (about $11,000 each) made by Cathy McClure, a sculptor who deconstructs vintage wind-up toys and then casts their plastic skeletons in bronze. There were kittens and elephants and puppy dogs, all rendered as ancient, creaky animals, which Mr. Moss said is a metaphor for the aging process or life itself. 
 ''Did you see the video? Cathy cuts the fur away like a taxidermist,'' he said later, describing a process that reveals ''these extremely sophisticated, figural pieces, which are then cast in bronze, which is of course a fine-art element. For me, it's this total metaphor, wherein that which begins cute and cuddly is returned to a kind of decaying, second childhood, like Shakespeare's seventh age: sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.'' 
 Tellingly, Mr. Moss said, what carried his business through this past ''very difficult'' year was high-end art commissions, like a project for a ''major art collector'' executed by Maarten Baas, a young Dutch designer who has been torching -- as in, using a blow torch on -- notable furniture pieces like a Rietveld chair or a Sottsass shelf, and then coating them in clear epoxy. The result, a charred piece of history, is spooky and sort of interesting, if a bit heavy-handed in the metaphor department.
 One commission was for two banquet-size dining tables and 24 chairs, part of an '80s-era set by Michael Graves.
 The cost?
 ''Oh, I really shouldn't,'' Mr. Moss said. ''But it was over $250,000.''
 Zounds!
 You don't have to spend that much to get the perfect gift, as demonstrated by Home section contributors Tim McKeough, Rima Suqi and Stephen Treffinger, who selected a number of artisanal and particular objects (shown on the cover and these pages) at more accessible prices.
 Each gift makes the point -- as Margaret Visser does in her new book, a lively cultural history of gratitude called ''The Gift of Thanks'' -- that gift-giving, like most rituals, is a form of social glue. And the strength of that adhesive is in direct proportion to the amount of energy and effort the giver has expended, or appears to have expended.
 Ms. Visser even suggests that decrying the commercialism of the season is an important part of the ritual.
 ''Our struggles and complaints mean, in part, that the gifts we have bought have manifestly cost us trouble,'' she writes. ''We may not actually have made them, but everyone is aware -- our own grumbling making sure it is understood -- that work, freely undertaken, went into their acquisition.''

HEADLINE: Our Health Care Choices, and Our Values

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 David Brooks poses ''The Values Question'' (column, Nov. 24). As we prepare to celebrate Thanksgiving, when so many have so little to be thankful for, how can he call a decision on whether to provide care for those in the greatest of need a ''brutal choice''? 
 Can we possibly sit around our tables, surrounded by loved ones, with bellies full, and debate whether to ''ease the anxiety of millions at the cost of future growth''? We have a moral obligation to do what is right. 
 We know that failure to pass health care legislation will mean certain death to some who go without proper care. We are a society that should pride ourselves on protecting the health and well-being of our citizens.
 Mr. Brooks talks of a ''sweet spot'' where there would be no trade-off, where coverage could be extended and costs lowered. Maybe the proposed health care bills do that, maybe they don't. 
 But we are a society that has lost its way if we consider the continuation of ''poor people living in misery'' an acceptable trade-off for more turkey on our plates or another present under the Christmas tree.
 Robert S. Nussbaum Fort Lee, N.J., Nov. 24, 2009
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks presents a false choice in the health care reform debate, between ''security'' and ''vibrancy'' in our culture's values.
 Where is the ''vibrancy'' in a culture that stifles entrepreneurship because people are afraid to leave corporate jobs and strike out on their own, because they can't afford, or would be denied, private health insurance?
 And just how are the 46 million people without health coverage supposed to be vibrant participants in our economy or culture while living in constant fear of ruin due to the very real possibility of ill health or an accident? Sometimes you have to feel secure in fundamental ways before you can unleash your vibrancy. 
 And Mr. Brooks makes it sound as if the new financial burden of expanded coverage would be a vampire at the jugular of America's culture; in fact, what's being considered is a surtax on people making over $500,000 a year. 
 That's a drop in the bucket for those people, especially when compared to the repercussions of having 46 million people without health insurance, and everyone else under 65 living in fear of losing theirs.

HEADLINE: Miami-Dade Hopes Online Auctions Will Help to Reduce Backlog of Foreclosures

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
Buying into Miami's foreclosure glut will soon be a whole lot easier.
 Seeking ultimately to eliminate a record backlog and a system that favors insiders, Miami-Dade County announced plans on Wednesday to use online auctions for the thousands of delinquent properties that have made South Florida a center of the recession. 
 Miamidade.realforeclose.com, the Web site, will become fully operational on Dec. 7, making Miami-Dade the largest of 12 Florida counties in the process of replacing courthouse auctions with online sales. 
 County officials here expect the number of properties sold, now about 450 a week, to triple, slowing the growth of an inventory of 110,000 foreclosures. ''The goal is to make it more convenient for people to bid and to research properties,'' said Harvey Ruvin, the clerk of courts. ''It kind of levels the playing field.'' 
 The online system would end, or at least make digital, what many officials describe as a process steeped in speculation, trickery and, occasionally, physical conflict. 
 For centuries, property auctions by government have been in-person affairs; the laws of many states require that they take place ''on the courthouse steps.'' And in Miami, with 7,000 properties entering foreclosure each month, that has often meant that auctions were held in small, dank rooms where a handful of investors or their employees would jockey for properties. 
 Sometimes, the investors -- typically dressed in T-shirts and jeans to suggest the absence of wealth -- were accused of working together to keep prices low. In other cases, they would compete intensely. In Miami and elsewhere in Florida, scuffles have broken out as one investor tried to block another, or tried to sell a property at a higher price than he paid minutes earlier. 
 Mr. Ruvin said that he installed cameras and a full-time police officer a few years ago to keep things under control. 
 He said he looked forward to making the system computer-based, so bidders would make offers from home. ''My approach is to serve more and more people online instead of in line,'' he said. 
 A change in state law last year, allowing sale by ''electronic means,'' has made it possible. And in the eight Florida counties that already have online foreclosure auctions up and running -- including other areas hard-hit by the real estate predicament, like Lee County -- more potential buyers have become involved. 
 Lloyd McClendon, the chief executive of RealAuction.com, which has contracts to run the county auctions across Florida, said nearly 11,000 bidders had registered, including at least one person from New Zealand. 
 ''It opens it up to a wider audience, and really the sale prices are more in line with what they should be,'' Mr. McClendon said. ''Before, these bidders would do deals among themselves. This is fairer to all who are involved.''

HEADLINE: The Latest Entrepreneurial Fantasy Is Selling Cupcakes

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
Move over restaurants and bed-and-breakfasts. A new fantasy seems to have taken hold for people who long to own their own business: the cupcakery.
 There is no Cupcake Manufacturers Association keeping count, but anecdotal evidence indicates that stand-alone cupcake shops have been spreading not just in the acknowledged cupcake meccas of New York and Los Angeles but also in Boston, Denver, Austin, Tex., and lots of smaller places. Nationwide, cupcake sales, according to the market research firm, Mintel, are projected to rise another 20 percent over the next five years at a time when other baked goods are expected to grow in the single digits. 
 ''Cupcake Wars,'' a series pilot in which four bakers vie to create the most interesting concoctions, will soon have its debut on the Food Network. ''Martha Stewart's Cupcakes'' (Clarkson, Potter), a collection of 175 recipes, was published in June, and spent 11 weeks on The New York Times best-seller list. And the most popular of the cupcake blogs, Cupcakestakethecake, is visited by some 9,000 people a day. At least a dozen blogs chronicle each new flavor -- from bacon to s'mores -- as well as the best frostings, the quirkiest decorations and the newest twists (so far, the meatloaf cupcake with mashed-potato frosting seems to have been contained within Chicago).
 New York's Magnolia Bakery, which helped set off an earlier cupcake craze when its treats appeared in a ''Sex and the City'' episode, is now expanding operations into Los Angeles, where its $3 red velvets and devil's foods will compete with the chai lattes and ginger lemons of Sprinkles Cupcakes, which is based in Beverly Hills but has owner-operated shops in six other cities and plans to open in far-flung locales like New York, London and Tokyo.
 ''Cupcake stores are taking the place of ice cream stores,'' said Adam Borden, whose Baltimore-based venture capital firm, Bradmer Foods, specializes in food-focused enterprises. ''Cupcakes aren't seasonal like ice cream, and they appeal to people who want the authentic experience. They have an allure based on nostalgia.''
 All of which suggests a couple of questions: How many cupcakes do you have to sell to pay the rent? And are cupcakes a viable business? These are still very early days in the Great Cupcake Rush, but the answers appear to be, respectively, a lot and maybe. (What do you think? Click HERE to leave a comment.)
 Thus far, there seem to be four basic cupcake business models:
 The Chain
 Founded by two married former investment bankers, Charles and Candace Nelson, Sprinkles is looking to grow. The couple spent two years working on their recipes before opening their Beverly Hills location in 2005. ''You have to have a great product, brand and location and then it can be very scalable,'' said Mr. Nelson.
 Sprinkles is slated to open three more stores next year. Seventy percent of its business comes from walk-ins, so location is crucial. Mr. Nelson declined to say whether the individual stores or the company as a whole had achieved profitability, but he did say that Sprinkles had a 20-year business plan and was committed to the long haul.
 The Web-Only Store
 Danielle Buckley got her start in June 2008 by writing a blog tracking the growing cupcake scene in the Washington area, where there are nearly a dozen cupcake bakeries. She quickly decided she was as interested in baking cupcakes as she was in writing about them -- but she decided against building a physical store.
 Instead, she sells her cupcakes online at delleicious.com. She bakes them to order on Monday nights using the kitchen in a Rockville, Md., cafe (in exchange for which the cafe gets two dozen cupcakes to sell to its customers).
 Delleicious cupcakes are now available in parts of Maryland, Virginia and Washington. Ms. Buckley sells about 15 dozen a week and says she's making money -- but not enough to quit her day job. ''I need a steady paycheck and benefits,'' she said, so she's keeping her job helping to manage contracts for the federal government.
 The Cupcakes and More Store
 In 2006, selling 20 kinds of cupcakes, Tiffany Bacon, a former software entrepreneur, opened Toot Sweet Cupcakes in Austin, but quickly decided that she wasn't going to make it on cupcakes alone. After four months in business, she started selling lunch fare, too.
 Last year, Ms. Bacon and her husband rented a new kitchen near the store, equipping it with 80-quart mixers and other professional baking items they bought at auctions. They also fixed up an adjacent room where Ms. Bacon home-schools her six children. ''They pitch in and help on big orders,'' said Ms. Bacon.
 She has the backing of a big-time investor -- Donald Yacktman, the once high-flying mutual fund manager who now runs an Austin-based investment fund. Mr. Yacktman first lent Ms. Bacon $5,000 to buy a professional oven and mixer. Later, he committed a sum in the mid-five figures for a 25 percent stake in the business. ''I was so impressed with her energy and work ethic,'' he said. ''Plus, I sampled the product.''
 Ms. Bacon pays her $2,400-a-month rent by selling an average of 10,000 cupcakes a month. She charges from $1 to $2.50 a cake, depending on the size. Business had been increasing 300 percent each month until last spring, when Dell Computer shut down a nearby manufacturing operation. After that, business fell off 10 percent in June.
 Ms. Bacon and her husband, who works with her, take a combined salary of $36,000 to $50,000 a year. Any extra money is rolled back into the business. ''There are no vacations,'' said Ms. Bacon. ''We're working 80-hour weeks.''
 The Sole Bakery
 Cupcakes began to fascinate Porche Lovely during a stint as a prep chef on the Food Network's ''Sugar Rush'' show. She decided she wanted a hands-on enterprise. ''I wanted a kinder environment than the stress of a commercial kitchen,'' said Ms. Lovely. ''And I wanted to build equity and set my own rules.''
 She invested $62,500 to overhaul and equip a storefront, now Lovely Confections Bakery, in the gentrifying ''Blue Bird'' district of Denver. She bought her 1,400-square-foot space for $300,000, financing her efforts in part with a $50,000 credit union loan and $50,000 from the sale of her home after her divorce. In August, her sales rose 30 percent over the same month the previous year.
 For each cupcake she sells, Ms. Lovely figures she spends 60 cents on ingredients, 57 cents on mortgage payments and utilities, 48 cents on labor, 18 cents on packaging and merchant fees, 16 cents on loan repayment, 24 cents for marketing, 18 cents for miscellaneous expenses and 4 cents for insurance. That totals $2.45, leaving a potential profit of 55 cents on each $3 cupcake. 
 So far, the per-cupcake margin is going to pay down start-up expenses. She's been selling the 2,800 cupcakes a month she calculates she needs to sell to cover her costs -- she's taking only a small salary for now -- but she says it's too early to predict when the store will turn profitable, in part because of the economy and in part because she fears losing business to rival cupcake entrepreneurs. 
 Ms. Lovely is in the process of rebranding the shop to overcome what she calls ''a typical rookie mistake'' of underestimating ''the power and importance of branding and marketing.'' She said she had to do more to tell customers that her cupcakes were made from organic, local and natural ingredients.
 ''I don't use mixes or cut corners on ingredients,'' she said. That's a message that she's refining with the help of Section 45, a Denver marketing company that has been donating its services and helping create a new logo, signs, business cards and online presence.
 The rebranding introduction should get under way by mid-December. Ms. Lovely said the store required the same hard work, endless hours and investment of any small business. She spends 80 hours a week baking and minding the shop, noting ruefully, ''This is that $10-an-hour job you didn't think you'd ever have again.''
 It's uphill, she conceded, adding, ''I still live in my brother's basement.''

 Hershey could just about scrape together the $17 billion it would need to trump Kraft's bid for Cadbury, the British confectioner. Hershey could even do it without having the charitable trust set up by its founder lose control, according to calculations by Breakingviews.com. But investors would be unwise to entrust the candy concern with more of their cash without lots of sweeteners. 
 First, consider how Hershey would finance a deal that's twice its market value without running afoul of the articles of incorporation that give the Milton Hershey Trust voting control despite owning just a third of the company. The trust was set up in 1909 by Hershey's Mennonite founder to pay for his charitable works in perpetuity. 
 By taking on debt equivalent to five times next year's combined earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, Hershey could raise $10.6 billion. That's similar to the debt levels that InBev took on when it bought Anheuser-Busch before the credit crisis. But like beer, chocolate is a stable business, which may comfort Hershey's backers at JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.
 To pay for the remainder, Hershey could sell new stock or offer it as consideration to Cadbury shareholders. But if the trust's economic interest fell below 15 percent, company rules would mean its Class B stock would lose its supervoting rights.
 If the company sold equity at a 10 percent discount, it would need to issue around 190 million new shares to raise the additional $6 billion-plus needed for a Cadbury deal. That would dilute the trust's economic interest to 17.5 percent -- still above the threshold needed to maintain the dual-share structure -- from 32.1 percent. 
 And even after such a big stock issue, the trust would control 64 percent of Hershey's votes. That might still be palatable to the trustees and local grandees who would like to keep a global chocolate powerhouse in Pennsylvania. 
 But a transforming deal that perpetuated the trust's control should raise a red flag for other shareholders. After all, the trust hasn't done a great job of safeguarding its interests until now. In 2002, Hershey, with the trust's backing, rejected an offer worth $45.50 a share from Wm. Wrigley Jr. The stock hasn't traded at that price for years. 
 That year, the group failed to buy the Adams gum division from Pfizer, leaving it to Cadbury. Just two years ago, it passed up a chance to merge with Cadbury in a deal that arguably would have brought the same strategic benefits as the bid it is contemplating, but without the need to pay a premium. 
 Put it all together, and it's hard to see why Hershey's regular investors should back a deal that would pile on leverage of the financial kind but bring them little or none in the boardroom. Cadbury isn't a sweet enough prize for that.
 Distraction of Saab
 Is General Motors about to pull an Opel on Saab? The sale of Saab, G.M.'s Swedish subsidiary, to Koenigsegg has fallen through, and directors are considering whether to keep it going. There may be some on the Detroit carmaker's board who believe that G.M. should bring Saab back into its garage, just as the company did this month with Opel, its main European operation. They should resist the temptation. 
 Granted, G.M. is in better shape after its restructuring. But the Motown manufacturer still has more than enough fine-tuning of its own to do. While it managed to generate $3.3 billion in cash and $1.5 billion of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last quarter, many of its plants were idle for much of the summer and huge bills were paid in early July by its bankrupt predecessor. 
 That means it'll be hard to replicate the performance without an uptick in sales. And G.M. still has to cut more of its staff and dealers. The last thing it needs is the distraction of taking on another struggling niche operation. Opel, it can be argued, was a special case. G.M. was going to keep a third of the European mass-market carmaker anyway and was concerned about sharing technology with prospective buyers, Magna International and, via Sberbank, the Russian carmaker Gaz. 
 That's not the case with Saab. As sad as it would be for Swedish manufacturing, G.M. should send Saab to the junkyard.

HEADLINE: Resetting the Tables

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
TUCKED into a corner where his friend the D.J. Francesco Civetta manned the turntables, Julian Lennon waxed mellow. ''I love to sit and watch the world go by,'' said Mr. Lennon, one in a sprinkling of notables at a private party at Le Cirque on Nov. 20. A drink might give him enough courage, he said, to check out the lounge that has been set aside for weekly invitation-only parties, an area that seemed to him ''filled with so many great characters from all walks of life.''
 His vision certainly chimed with that of Le Cirque's owner, Sirio Maccioni, and his son Mauro, who presided over the event in the Bloomberg Tower on East 58th Street. 
 In its heyday, Le Cirque, which celebrated its 35th anniversary in October, served as the rarefied clubhouse where Richard Nixon and the Nancys, Kissinger and Reagan, sampled foie gras alongside The Donald, Billy Joel and Joan Collins. But a hobbled economy and a client migration to downtown haunts has dimmed the luster that sustained it in its glory days. 
 To revive its storied past and draw a deep-pocketed after-hours crowd, the Maccionis have reserved the little-used bar and lounge near the main dining room to entertain night revelers long unaccustomed to venturing north of 14th Street.
 ''Giving private parties will in no way compromise the brand,'' Mauro Maccioni insisted, predicting that there would come a time when people ''will be fighting over tables.'' 
 Morgan Miller, a photographer enlisted to wrangle the kinds of guests who in another era might have might have table-hopped at Regine's, suggested that one day ''Mayor Bloomberg and Jay-Z might meet on the elevator and step across the courtyard for a drink.'' 
 But last week, the postmidnight crowd that lined the bar and filled the lounge where Anna Magnani glowered on an outsize plasma screen seemed to mock him. Gathered under a canopy of upended umbrellas that provided the room's chief decor, lawyers and traders, trust-fund scions and Euro bankers -- flashing smiles as tight as their suits -- circled a handful of models and comely young Russians artfully seeded throughout the room. Swathed in satin and pearls, they provided faint glamour in a scene otherwise dominated by men in saggy jeans and women in tubular frocks and leggings better suited to an eHarmony mixer. 
 ''Did the Maccionis get all the players?'' asked Malcolm M. Knapp, a restaurant analyst. ''No, but give it time.'' They may yet succeed in conjuring a kind of Vegas-like environment ''where brokers and other high rollers can take their clients,'' he said, presumably wining them on the bottles of $350 Grey Goose or $500 Dom Perignon on the restaurant's menu. 
 Kate Bosworth and the photographer Patrick Demarchelier were among the celebrity no-shows. ''But look, there's L.T.,'' Mr. Miller hissed, steering a visitor toward Lawrence Taylor, the retired star linebacker, who sat with friends over beer and fries. Nearby, Robert Hantman, an entertainment lawyer, scoured the room for glamour-pots. 
 ''I wanted to see how Le Cirque changes from early dinner to late-evening crowd,'' Mr. Hantman said, ''and to see the metamorphosis from those who have money to those who are chasing it.''

HEADLINE: City, and Artist, Under Construction

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Some of the brass outside the clubs on Pall Mall needs a little buffing these days, a minor sign of something maybe, but London is still prosperous. A single-fare subway ticket costs a whopping $6.60. 
 This makes imagining what the city looked like after World War II, for those not around at the time, next to impossible. German bombs destroyed some 80,000 buildings and damaged 700,000 here. 
 Today early postwar London has gone the way of medieval London. It's all but disappeared. Now an exhibition of Frank Auerbach's paintings of the rebuilding of the city, from the 1950s and early '60s, helps conjure it back up. A pitch-perfect affair, tucked into the attic at the Courtauld Gallery, it presents the city and artist both emerging from the shambles. 
 Esteemed in Britain, Mr. Auerbach remains too little appreciated in America. Born in Berlin in 1931 to Jewish parents, he spent the war years in English boarding schools, where his parents had sent him, at 7, to escape the Nazis. Orphaned after they died in a concentration camp, he settled into a life in London, studying at different art schools, moving in 1954 to a studio in Camden Town, a ramshackle room off a cramped basement alleyway, where he still works. 
 His subjects are the neighborhood and models who will sit for him for months on end. Famously, he almost never leaves town, laboring over pictures for years, painting and repainting them, sometimes hundreds of times, making and destroying and remaking, a process he refined on the scenes of a postwar London under construction that are in the show. 
 Even while the bombs were still falling and walls tumbling, British city planners and architects dreamed of how to replace the old city. Prewar London had lacked housing, hygiene and green spaces. Modernists imagined new apartment blocks and glass high-rises on broad lawns. One scheme, in the spirit of Le Corbusier, even proposed tearing down the whole center of the city and starting from scratch. Nostalgists countered with tamer visions of neo-Georgian neighborhoods.
 The government had its own priorities. It had to provide millions of homeless people with places to live after the war. Grand designs, Corbusian or neo-Georgian, to remake London into a coherent whole, a la Paris, were all too complex and time consuming. Instead a haphazard boom in construction, occasionally inspired but mostly mundane occurred in the 1950s and early '60s, a hodgepodge, but unprecedented, which slowly lifted the convalescent city from the ashes.
 The transformation caught Mr. Auerbach's eye -- not the new buildings and bridges per se, but the city on the cusp. ''A city fully functional is to me a somewhat formally boring collection of cubic rectilinear shapes, but London after the war was a marvelous landscape with precipice and mountain and crags, full of drama,'' he recalled recently, in an essay in the exhibition's catalog. ''Being in Paris, you'd be haunted a little bit if you started trying to paint Notre Dame or a view of the Seine by the fact that other people had painted it before, but the London I knew and saw hadn't really been painted.'' 
 That's a gift to an artist. There was an obvious urban metaphor in the method of endlessly destroying and repainting that Mr. Auerbach adopted, but he talked instead about the influences of de Kooning, Soutine, Rubens, obvious suspects, and also about a formative stretch in a life-drawing class taught by the artist David Bomberg. A student's drawing that looked ''affected, mannered or used a cliche learned from art,'' Mr. Auerbach remembered, would cause Bomberg to ''suggest a total destruction.'' Then, when the student was least ''aware of having done a picture,'' Bomberg would say stop. 
 Finding form in the formless is another way of putting it. This was London's ambition at the time. Just as many parts of the city had become strange to its own residents, so Mr. Auerbach was a stranger trying to find his home in the new city. ''Formlessness can be seen in the paintings as that which allows form to exist even as it works to deny that very existence,'' Barnaby Wright, the show's curator, notes in the catalog. ''It is life in a hostile environment, and it reminds us of Auerbach's memory of seeing on the building sites 'survivors scurrying among a ruined city.' ''
 In a sense Auerbach was again and again inhabiting the building sites he painted, by painting them over and over, while at the same time making plain -- in the liquid, roiling, puckering, clotted, swirling mounds of pigment that slowly accumulated in the process of his making the pictures -- their tenuousness and instability. 
 The pictures are virtually abstract at a glance. What holds them in place, their architecture, is the grid, the most basic modernist scaffolding. It's there in the heavy planks of paint, vortices making rough geometry out of muddy, metallic scenes. The planks nail down vertiginous, open views of the Royal Dutch Shell Company building, near Festival Hall, and of workmen under Hungerford Bridge, an all-black-on-black image whose legibility depends partly on room light glinting off its oily surface. 
 Colors otherwise tend toward ochre, matt greens, grays and dried-blood red, an economy of palette to match straitened scenes. Charred, molten surfaces, greasy, or like fields of raked dirt or sand, make a natural corollary to the grime, silt and soot they depict, although Mr. Auerbach never meant to be so literal. The thickness of paint, its viscous, jellied effect, inevitably results from the process by which he arrived, through constant reworking, at the final images, which, crucially, never sacrifice their ambiguity. 
 ''A great painting is like ice on a stove,'' Mr. Auerbach has said, adapting Robert Frost's phrase to describe this ambiguousness. ''Its shape riding on its own melting into matter and space, it never stops moving backwards and forwards.'' You can see an example of what he means in a view of the rebuilding of the Empire Cinema in Leicester Square from 1962. 
 Mr. Auerbach devised a skeletal frame of red beams and ladders teetering above a yawning gap, a kind of vortex or precipice, at the foot of the picture. The scene is Piranesian, disorienting, a spectacle. The sensation it provokes relates no doubt to the rush of excitement Mr. Auerbach found, chancing on the site one day, where builders struggled against the clock to remake a 19th-century theater into a modern movie palace. 
 Scale is hard to read in this case, as elsewhere. Atmospheres don't yield easily to depth, but they're never opaque, either. Light emerges like sun through thick fog. 
 One painting, ''Shell Building Site From the Thames,'' encapsulates the series. Cranes and cables inspired Mr. Auerbach to erect a kite-shaped network of lines, dark against light. Franz Kline and Abstract Expressionism come to mind in the busy crisscross of vectors. But Rembrandt is the explicit source. The image derives from a small masterpiece in the National Gallery here, a darkling ''Lamentation'' in which light emanates from the dead body of Jesus at the base of the cross, Jerusalem rising in the distance.
 The theme of death and resurrection makes Mr. Auerbach sound pedantic and literal. The virtue of these paintings is to capture both the gravity and lightness of an era, when everything was changing. Londoners salvaged beauty from chaos as they moved the city toward recovery.
 It was the young Mr. Auerbach's task, day after day, in the studio.

HEADLINE: Extending a Hand to Those Hurt in the Subprime Mess

 BODY:
There has been plenty of blame to go around in the nearly three years since the housing bubble popped. Some fault the homeowners who failed to heed the fine print; some say that the banks, pushing mortgages to unqualified, financially unstable borrowers, deserve the blame. A report published last week by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University found that those who lived in predominantly nonwhite neighborhoods were more likely to obtain high-cost subprime loans. 
 Nationally, more than eight million homes have been foreclosed on since the housing boom first gave way to widespread mortgage delinquencies in early 2007; in New York City, at least 15,000 properties have been foreclosed on this year, according to RealtyTrac, which collects foreclosure data. When Nassau and Suffolk Counties are added, the number jumps to roughly 25,000.
 Beginning in January 2008, The New York Times Foundation decided to set aside $1 million each year to help homeowners who had lost their homes after becoming delinquent on their subprime loans and needed money to move. The pool expanded to include tenants facing eviction because their landlords were foreclosed on and homeowners who needed a relatively small amount to keep their home. 
 The foundation turned to the Children's Aid Society, one of the seven beneficiary agencies of the Neediest Cases Fund, to administer the fund. So far, $634,410 has been distributed to 118 households.

HEADLINE: Passion for the Pint Overcomes Hurdles

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
Like scores of other avid home brewers, Shane C. Welch has turned his personal passion into a commercial enterprise. But he has followed his own path in marketing his beers.
 Mr. Welch's company, Sixpoint Craft Ales, in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, does not sell beer in bottles, for instance. Instead, it primarily sells kegs to pubs and restaurants in the New York metropolitan area. If consumers want to drink Sixpoint beer at home, they need to bring 64-ounce jugs, known as growlers, to the bars to refill them.
 ''We are not going to pursue the traditional brewery path,'' said Mr. Welch, who grew up in Milwaukee, a city steeped in beer-making history. ''It doesn't make sense to ship it halfway around the world. That is an antiquated business model.'' 
 The economics of the beer business can be daunting. Microbreweries need to sell thousands of barrels of beer a year before turning a profit. Until they do so, small business loans can be hard to get. And ingredients like hops have gotten pricey.
 In addition, start-ups are entering a tough competitive field. A wave of consolidation has left a handful of companies brewing most of the beer that most Americans drink. Last year, InBev of Belgium acquired Anheuser-Busch, creating the world's largest beer maker. Another merger last year, between the United States operations of SABMiller and Molson Coors Brewing Company, formed a company called MillerCoors. 
 But none of this has prevented beer-making enthusiasts from trying their luck. Roughly 450 microbreweries operate in the United States, an increase of almost 25 percent since 2004, according to the Brewers Association, a trade group based in Boulder, Colo. That figure does not include nearly 1,000 brew pubs, which primarily sell the beer they make at their own restaurants. 
 Paul Gatza, the director of the Brewers Association, said that the pace of new microbrewery openings had slowed this year with the recession. Last year, 56 microbreweries were opened, and 10 closed. Three of those that closed had opened in 2008. This year, the association has tracked 25 microbrewery openings and five closings.
 Even among America's craft brewers -- as aficionados call the independent breweries -- some have grown into larger operations. The Brewers Association reclassifies microbreweries that exceed 15,000 barrels of production a year as regional breweries. In this way, nine microbreweries became regional breweries last year.
 Mr. Welch, who runs his microbrewery from a 7,000-square-foot former filing cabinet factory, described the creative process of making beer as ''understanding what people want and matching the reality to that desire.'' He has come up with dozens of beer recipes using a wide variety of grains.
 His approach, which he says is to keep the business as ''amorphous'' as possible, appears to be working. Mr. Welch says that Sixpoint is on track to sell around 8,000 barrels of beer this year -- roughly 10 times what it sold in 2005, its first full year of production.
 Patrick Rue, who operates the Bruery out of a 10,000-square-foot warehouse in Placentia, Calif., is pursuing a different strategy. Although his microbrewery has been in business only a little more than a year, its Belgian-style beer -- which is brewed a few miles from Disneyland -- is sold in states as far away as New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts.
 ''We need to sell a little bit of beer in a lot of places,'' Mr. Rue said. ''That's our bridge to survival.''
 The Bruery, which shipped its first case of beer in May 2008, sold about 1,200 barrels during its first 12 months of production. All of the bottled beer -- which accounts for roughly three-quarters of sales -- comes in champagne bottles, with prices ranging from $8 to $14. ''It's hard to compete with Sam Adams on price, so you have to be distinctive,'' Mr. Rue said.
 On the other hand, the Mt. Carmel Brewing Company, which is based in Cincinnati, is focusing on its local market, where demand has outstripped the supply this tiny brewery can produce. A recent investment in new equipment has raised the brewery's annual production to 3,000 barrels from 1,000 barrels.
 Kathleen and Mike Dewey founded Mt. Carmel Brewing four years ago. Ms. Dewey manages the office and distribution, while her husband is in charge of production. They started the business with a $10,000 family loan, which they supplemented with credit cards while they got their brewery off the ground. At one time they had roughly $40,000 billed to credit cards, all of it for business-related expenses. But they have paid off those cards.
 Ms. Dewey said that anyone who wanted to start a microbrewery should either have a substantial sum of money to begin with -- or a great deal of patience. ''It can be very dreamy thinking about starting your own microbrewery,'' she said. ''But unless you have several million dollars, be prepared for a lot of hard work.''

HEADLINE: Deere Reports Quarterly Loss

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: CHAMPAIGN, Ill. 

 BODY:
Deere and Company, the maker of farm equipment, reported a $223 million loss for the fourth quarter on Wednesday, citing a big write-down and a 28 percent decline in sales of farm and construction equipment. 
 Deere said in its statement that the sluggish economy in the United States and much of the rest of the world continued to drive down demand for the company's farm equipment. 
 Nonetheless, the company, based in Moline, Ill., said it would have been profitable without the unusual items in the latest quarter.
 The loss included a write-down of $321.8 million in the value of assets and restructuring expenses, including the cost of laying off hundreds of workers. Otherwise, Deere said it would have earned 23 cents a share.
 Deere said it expected its equipment sales to drop another 1 percent next year, including a 10 percent slide in the first quarter. The company forecast a $900 million profit next year.

HEADLINE: This Year, It May Be Wise to Skip the Shopping Maul

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM and CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
Attention shoppers: It might pay to just sleep in this Black Friday.
 The conventional wisdom is that the most stupendous bargains of the year are to be had on the Friday after Thanksgiving. But the marketplace has become so packed on that crowded shopping day that some retailers are shifting their strategy.
 Deals on certain products are likely to be just as good, perhaps even better, in the days and weeks after Friday. In this economy, retailers need to stand out -- and some of them are betting they can do so by offering bargains later in the season. Also, while chains are not discounting as deeply as last year, they know the primary way to get penny-pinching consumers to spend is to keep the deals coming all season long. 
 Exactly which strategy retailers are pursuing this year differs not only among shopping chains but among categories of merchandise. That means the best time to shop for the season could hinge on which items are on your list. 
 ''Black Friday is about cheap stuff at cheap prices,'' said Daniel de Grandpre, the editor in chief of DealNews.com, which tracks such sales each year. ''That means that high-end stuff is not on sale on Black Friday. It just isn't.''
 That is not to say consumers who brave the nation's stores on Friday will not find deals on flat-screen televisions and fluffy ear muffs. But the products on sale that day, particularly electronics, generally are lower-end products without many extras, or they are older models on the verge of being discontinued. That is, of course, a reason stores are able to offer them at low prices.
 ''It looks like a real mixed bag of deals and duds,'' said Andrew Eisner, director of content for Retrevo, a Web site that reviews consumer electronics and recommends where and when to buy them. 
 Many of the gadgets on sale this Friday will be outdated models, he said, like navigation devices without speech capability, Blu-ray players without Internet connections and digital cameras without face-recognition technology.
 Manish Rathi, a co-founder of Retrevo, cited some ''over-the-hill'' products, like a Nikon CoolPix digital camera being sold at Target for $88, reduced from $140. 
 Mr. de Grandpre said luxury retailers tended to stay out of the Black Friday fray because they would rather not associate with bargain-basement shopping. To participate in the nation's uber-shopping day in a way that is befitting their status, luxury chains do offer deals, but only in certain popular holiday and seasonal categories, like coats and home decor. And they do not bother to open at 5 a.m., a common opening time on the day after Thanksgiving for the lower-end retailers known as big-box stores.
 The luxury chain Saks, for instance, is offering 40 percent off already reduced merchandise, but not its newest collections. The chain does not bring in merchandise specifically for the day after Thanksgiving. And the doors open at the relatively late hour of 8 a.m. 
 ''The key difference is we don't run a strategy of these key items that we buy thousands of and that we mark down to these low, low amounts,'' said Kimberly Grabel, senior vice president for marketing at Saks. ''That is the big-box mentality.'' 
 Stores have greatly reduced their inventories since last year, when the economic downturn forced them into panic selling. So while there will be sales, as there are every year in any economy, it is possible stores might run out of certain products or sizes. ''For the best selection you are going to need to shop early this year,'' Ms. Grabel said.
 Her best advice? ''Stay home and shop online.'' 
 Indeed, on Wednesday, many stores had begun holiday promotions on their Web sites. On Wednesday, clothing was up to 40 percent off at Bloomingdale's, Saks, Neiman Marcus and Barneys. At Nordstrom, merchandise was up to 50 percent off. At Lord & Taylor, some items, like women's coats, were half off. 
 Saks planned to offer its early deals online at midnight Wednesday. ''We figure some people will need a break from their family on Thursday,'' Ms. Grabel said. 
 To distinguish themselves from discounters, the likes of Saks and Neiman Marcus also offer gift cards for spending a certain amount of money within a designated time period on Black Friday, which got its name because it was thought to be the day when retailers often shifted into the black, or became profitable. In the coming months, the chains will probably continue borrowing the idea of private, timed online sales. 
 Made popular by members-only shopping Web sites like Gilt, Rue La La and HauteLook, the sales give consumers a now-or-never incentive to buy, and are a less conspicuous way for stores to sell designer merchandise at a discount. Consumers must sign up for e-mail alerts on retailers' Web sites to be in the know. 
 In general, chain stores will not divulge their promotion schedules for the rest of the shopping season, but some Web sites also track sales throughout the holiday season, including Deal- News.com, BlackFriday.info, and Bfads.net. 
 Expect some notable deals online on Monday, now called Cyber Monday, when consumers return to their offices and go holiday shopping on the Web. 
 This year, more e-commerce sites plan to offer bargains to win over reluctant consumers. For instance, Blue Nile, the online jeweler, has long avoided participating in promotional days. But no more. 
 ''Even the wealthy have become more value-conscious,'' said John Baird, a spokesman for Blue Nile, noting a shift in the behavior of its more affluent customers. 
 Blue Nile plans to offer two promotions on Monday -- free overnight shipping on orders placed by 6 p.m. Eastern time, and discounts on a different item each day through Dec. 23. (On one of the days, a 15-carat diamond eternity bracelet will cost $27,000, down from $36,500. Blue Nile would not say which day the bracelet would be on sale.) 
 ''We want to be very careful when we offer special promotions like this, to make sure they are brand-appropriate,'' Mr. Baird said. ''We're not going to be like the mall jeweler, so you're not going to see 50 percent off the entire store.''
 Across-the-board sales are the specialty of the nation's biggest big-box stores and Web sites, and they, too, began discounting before consumers roasted their turkeys. 
 Kmart had a ''Better Than Black Friday Sale.'' Best Buy offered ''Early Black Friday Prices'' on some televisions, and on Nov. 11 the chain offered its lowest-ever advertised price on a laptop, $250. Toys ''R'' Us had early blockbuster deals known as doorbusters. And for weeks, Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, has been offering deep discounts.
 Consumers who missed those bargains need not fret. 
 ''Once you've started discounting, it's hard to stop midseason,'' said Maggie Taylor, a vice president and senior credit officer for Moody's Investors Service. 
 Some chains are even getting a jump on Monday, re-imagining it as Cyber Sunday. J.C. Penney, for instance, plans to offer its Monday sales beginning Sunday, for two days. Staples also plans to offer its Web deals on both Sunday and Monday. 
 Consumers can track hourly specials on CyberMonday.com, which will continue posting news about deals at the nation's major online retailers long after Monday.

HEADLINE: Tiffany's Profit Tops Expectations

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Strong overseas sales and cost-cutting helped Tiffany & Company post better-than-expected quarterly results on Wednesday and to raise its profit outlook for the full year. 
 Tiffany reported earnings of $43.3 million, or 35 cents a share, for its third quarter, which ended Oct. 31, down 1 percent from a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations were 34 cents a share, topping the average Wall Street forecast of 24 cents. 
 The luxury goods sector has experienced sharp declines in sales during the recession, but Tiffany's results signaled that the high end of the market could be on the mend, said Matt Arnold, an analyst at Edward Jones & Company.
 ''The main thing that sticks out to me is that trends continue to improve, and this should persist for a while,'' Mr. Arnold said. 
 Sales declines in the United States were slowing and overseas sales were coming in better than expected, Tiffany said, while sales of lower-priced items were faring better than more expensive jewelry.
 Revenue dropped 3 percent, to $598.2 million.
 Sales at stores open at least a year fell 6 percent. That figure is a key indicator of retailer performance because it measures growth at existing stores rather than newly opened ones.
 Tiffany sales in the Americas declined 9 percent, with revenue at its flagship New York store down 8 percent. Even though overseas tourists were not traveling as much to New York, they were still spending at Tiffany stores in their own countries, Mr. Arnold said.
 Asia-Pacific sales rose 10 percent and European sales climbed 12 percent during the quarter.
 Tiffany has tried to offset some of its sales weakness with cost-cutting and inventory management. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined to $261 million from $265.6 million, while net inventories were 6 percent below the previous year at quarter's end.
 For the full year, Tiffany said profit from continuing operations would be as much as $1.98 a share, up from a previous estimate of $1.75 a share.

HEADLINE: Yes, We're Open

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
SELF EDGE is the name of a good-looking store on Orchard Street that opened in July. It sells classic examples of American work-wear, like chambray shirts, that are produced in Japan with old American machines and the deadstock of American button and zipper makers. With the geeky solemnity of a rare seed catalog, the store's Web site declared of Flat Head, one of its lines: ''Probably the finest construction ever seen on button-down shirts.'' 
 You can almost picture a group of guys in Tokyo or Osaka trying to get the exact specifications of a 1950s boondocker shirt from Sears, but that is not what is interesting about Self Edge. What is interesting is that it's there at all.
 The pattern of the recession has been to close stores, lay off workers and reduce inventories to a bare nub of excitement. Pop-up stores have lent a small thrill to the scene, but pop-up stores reflect a weak economy; otherwise, landlords would have those spaces rented to the hilt. 
 But nothing quite conveys the confusion and sense of retail sclerosis as the high-end ladies boutique, lights on and empty, its owner selling the same six fabulous designers as everyone else, the same droopy China-made knit that shouldn't cost $600 but somehow does, and not a chance, barely a glimmer of hope, that enough customers will care to buy something.
 Inevitably, new stores open. Here in New York there is an abundance of retail space, real estate experts say. Rents are 20 to 40 percent lower than a year ago, and landlords are often willing to give better terms, like longer leases. But is there a vision behind these stores? Do they reflect a world altered not only by a recession but also by the reach of the Internet and new attitudes about consumption, quality and usefulness?
 The first Self Edge store opened in San Francisco three years ago, when Kiya Babzani, a founder, persuaded a group of Japanese design firms, about 10 in all, to sell their replicas of American vintage outside of Japan. 
 ''It's a very new thing for them to be distributed to the West,'' Mr. Babzani said. Well, they didn't consider what they were doing to be fashion. Iron Heart, for one, is chiefly interested in making jeans for motorcyclists. Another company might be into work shirts, after a Cone Mills model from the '60s, with a chain-stitch run-off. Either way, Mr. Babzani said, ''They're not interested in any kind of innovation.''
 Self Edge on Orchard Street has a 10-year lease. On a recent afternoon, Andrew Chen, an owner, was helping a European visitor with a pair of jeans. Asked if the recession had hurt business, Mr. Chen said no. ''It helps to carry a product that nobody else has, and it helps to be knowledgeable about it,'' he said.
 Across Orchard, Victor Osborne, a hat maker, took a five-year lease on a storefront, paying only slightly more in rent than he did for a workroom in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. If anything, the recession has changed his approach to design. 
 ''I was designing for what the department stores wanted,'' he said. ''It was 'fill this void, fill this void.' Now I can merchandise my store the way I want.'' Mr. Osborne, whose hats range from neat felt cloches to hip Mao caps, said he receives about five custom orders on weekends, at $250 apiece.
 ''Half the people I've met here I used to know on the Lower East Side in the '80s and '90s,'' said Denise Carbonell one morning in Red Hook, in Brooklyn, as sunlight filled her shop, Metal and Thread, on Van Brunt Street, across from the restaurants Baked and The Good Fork.
 Here was a woman whose knowledge and disillusionment about fashion -- she began her career in 1976 as Perry Ellis's patternmaker and later had her own label and then a shop for 20 years -- seemed to coalesce in the fond, well-chosen contrarian displays of jewelry and wood and metal objects, like forged baskets and beautiful old jackknives.
 Ms. Carbonell, who owns her building, has been around the retail block too many times to become a proselytizer for the local hand-made movement, though, in fact, that is the sort of thing she sells -- and at reasonable prices ($50 for a pair of copper-pipe earrings set with Czech glass). ''I think it was just a personal vision of where I wanted to be during the day and how I wanted to live for a while,'' she said, adding: ''It's not a shop that makes money or will ever make money. There are people who are drawn to this kind of thing and love the feeling of it, but it's not the majority.''
 Maybe, but the stores that have opened in recent months, like JF & Son on Kenmare Street in NoLIta; and Against Nature, a bespoke tailor on Chrystie; and certainly Metal and Thread, suggest a mind-set about fashion that feels less doctrinaire than in the past and, like local cuisine, not beholden to broad trends.
 Everything at Against Nature, which resembles a shabbily genteel Victorian men's club, is made in the backroom by the owners: Jake Mueser, 27, and Amber Doyle, 23, who are tailors; Simon Jacobs, 34, a custom-jeans designer; and Ryan Matthew, 29, a jeweler and leather-goods maker. Last Friday, Michael Zucker sat on the store's Chesterfield sofa with his fiancee, Caitlin DiStefano, a fashion publicist, while Ms. Doyle finished the last adjustments on a gray suit for him. The couple was getting married the next day at the Plaza Hotel.
 ''This is the last place I thought I'd be,'' Mr. Zucker, who works in real estate, said almost shyly. ''Usually I'm at Barneys. This is something different.''
 Ms. DiStefano put in, ''He's already looking at swatches for shirts.''
 The partners pay $3,150 a month for rent, an amount they say they can handle, given the foot traffic and the business they get from referrals. A bespoke suit, which involves three or four fittings, begins at $2,500. A pair of Mr. Jacobs's jeans costs about $350.
 And they don't ask how big the market is for such clothes. They know it's limited to privileged people who want something a little different. ''Right now,'' Mr. Mueser said, ''any amount of money that keeps this place open and keeps me fed and living is more than enough money to make what I do worthwhile.''
 Lately he and Ms. Doyle have been working on the design of a floor-length cape for a customer. ''It's so much fun,'' she said. ''There are no boundaries to these things.''
 Beyond favorable rents, beyond an interest in traditional things, the new stores say a lot about the fashion world. That there is a disconnect between the customer and the people making clothes. That men have replaced women as informed, upward-moving shoppers. That designers will have to take control of how their clothes are produced. 
 At JF & Son, if you don't see a washed denim dress or a slouchy pair of corduroys in your size, the owners -- Katie King, Jesse Finkelstein and Travis Boyer, all in their 20s -- can get it for you in about two weeks. They make everything in a studio in India that Mr. Finkelstein and Ms. King opened about two years ago, selling their clothes at wholesale prices. They also develop fabrics for design houses like Vena Cava and Opening Ceremony.
 They started the studio, outside New Delhi, mostly out of frustration with the demands of middlemen, including buyers and showroom owners. As Ms. King explained: ''Our aesthetic can be a little earthy, but we also have things that are glitzy. When we had a showroom, they were always trying to push us into a category. 'Are you going to be the next Alexander Wang? The next Vena Cava?' '' She added: ''Once we started the studio, it made a world of difference. We were able to make things we'd never be able to do in New York.''
 In September, withthe help of Mr. Boyer, who helps coordinate textile exhibitions, the partners opened a store, for which they pay $6,500 a month in rent. ''Because of the economy, we weren't sure how people would react to an unknown brand, but it's been amazing,'' Ms. King said. ''I've forgotten about the recession.''
 Their clothes are simple and friendly, with a surprising amount of detail for the price. Most garments are under $250. In an e-mail message, Mr. Finkelstein said there was a moral dimension to their strategy: ''People want to know how the things they buy are produced, be it children's toys or food. I think we have a responsibility to our consumers to offer this level of transparency.''
 Mr. Boyer believes that a store must also clearly relate to some contemporary need. Not long ago he and Ms. King were in a bar in Williamsburg, where, as Mr. Boyer said, ''guys had waxed mustaches and were shaking drinks.'' 
 ''We were kind of critical of that -- this over-fetishization of a past that also included racism and denial of women's rights. We work with a lot of feminist artists and so we have no real reason to want to put a deer head on a wall.''
 He paused. ''Is there not enough momentum behind new ideas? Are people not thinking about the future? Are we going to start walking around with monocles?''

HEADLINE: Fed Tightens Regulations On Its Regional Directors

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve, under attack in Congress for being too entwined with big banks, closed a loophole on Wednesday that allowed a director at Goldman Sachs to be a director of the New York Fed as the agency was bailing out Wall Street during the financial crisis.
 The Fed tightened its restrictions on so-called public directors of Fed's 12 regional banks, who are not supposed to hold posts or own stock in banks or bank holding companies. 
 The rule itself is narrow, a response to an embarrassment earlier this year involving Stephen Friedman, a director and former top executive at Goldman Sachs who was also serving as a public board member of the New York Fed.
 The new policy was the latest in a string of recent announcements that appear aimed at bolstering the Fed's credibility as a regulator at a moment when Congress is trying to overhaul financial regulation and when lawmakers in both parties have accused the central bank of being beholden to the financial industry.
 Last week, the House Financial Services Committee endorsed a bill by Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas, that would subject the Federal Reserve to sweeping Congressional audits. The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher J. Dodd, has proposed legislation that would strip the Fed of most of its bank regulatory power.
 In the last month, the Fed has imposed new restrictions on fees for gift cards and on bank overdrafts. In late October, it proposed sweeping new rules on executive compensation at banks, and in September it issued final rules that would limit the ability of banks to raise their interest rates and fees on credit cards.
 The rule announced on Wednesday is aimed at patching up a potential conflict of interest that prompted Mr. Friedman to resign in May from the New York Fed's board.
 Under the Fed's convoluted governance structure, enshrined in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, the Fed's 12 regional banks are governed by boards that are almost by definition beholden to the banking industry.
 The nine-member boards have three classes of directors: Class A directors are selected by member banks in each region and are supposed to represent the banks; Class B directors are selected by banks but are supposed to represent the public; and Class C directors are selected by the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, and are also supposed to represent the public.
 The public directors are not allowed to be executives or board members of banks, bank holding companies and other ''financially related entities.'' The Class C public directors are also prohibited from being shareholders in banks.
 Mr. Friedman became a public member on the New York Fed's board even though he owned shares in Goldman and was a director. 
 At the time he joined the New York Fed's board, Goldman Sachs was an investment bank and did not have a bank charter. But it converted itself into a bank holding company during the financial crisis, and it benefited enormously from the Fed's rescue efforts. The New York Fed received a waiver from the Federal Reserve Board in Washington to let Mr. Friedman remain a director after the Goldman conversion, but Mr. Friedman resigned after coming under heavy criticism.
 The new policy would prohibit any public director in a similar situation from getting such waivers. 
 But it would not change the fact that two-thirds of directors would still be selected by banks. Nor does it impose additional restrictions on the public directors, who can still have ties to large financial institutions, like hedge funds or private equity funds, as long as they are not part of a bank holding company.

HEADLINE: From Yanks' Core To Pacquiao, Plenty of Cheers

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON

 BODY:
For all the scandals and scoundrels, on Thanksgiving there are always good names to be thankful for:
 Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Jorge Posada and Andy Pettitte, the Core Four who were the foundation of the Yankees' winning the World Series again after nearly a decade of disappointment.
 Tom Watson, who didn't quite win the British Open at age 59 but did win the hearts of golfers and nongolfers alike. 
 Manny Pacquiao, the prince of the Philippines, whose world title in a seventh weight class has people talking boxing.
 Michigan State in the Final Four, the Red Wings in the Stanley Cup finals and the Tigers in the American League Central, who, although each eventually fell short, provided economically battered Detroit with teams to cheer.
 Dan Rooney, the Steelers' owner and sage, who is wearing his sixth Super Bowl ring as the United States' ambassador to Ireland.
 Pat Summitt, the University of Tennessee women's basketball coach, who broke through the 1,000-victory ceiling.
 Mark Teixeira, who showed not only what a difference a slugging first baseman made in the Yankees' batting order, but also what a difference a dazzling defensive first baseman made.
 Randy Edsall, the University of Connecticut football coach, who held his team together after the killing of cornerback Jasper Howard.
 The United States Open champions Kim Clijsters of Belgium, a familiar name reintroducing herself after motherhood, and Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina, a new name introducing himself to world tennis at age 20.
 Dewayne Wise, whose leaping, juggling, falling catch against the left-center-field wall at U.S. Cellular Field preserved a perfect game for the White Sox left-hander Mark Buehrle.
 Landon Donovan, whose published criticism of his teammate David Beckham's standoffish ego prompted the British soccer star's personality turnaround for the Los Angeles Galaxy.
 Kris Jenkins and Leon Washington, the two players the Jets could least afford to lose to injury for the season, but did.
 Hideki Matsui, the epitome of the baseball phrase ''professional hitter'' throughout his seven seasons with the Yankees.
 Mario Lemieux, the Stanley Cup champion Penguins' co-owner and chairman, who reworked the franchise's finances to keep it in Pittsburgh, led the drive for a new arena and has had the All-Star center Sidney Crosby living in the Lemieux family's suburban home ever since he arrived five years ago as a teenager.
 Craig Currier, the Bethpage State Park superintendent who, by recruiting dozens of nearby golf course superintendents, kept the Black Course playable for the United States Open despite torrential rains.
 Luis Castillo, the Mets' stand-up second baseman, who never flinched during two news media inquisitions after having dropped what would have been a game-ending pop fly that allowed the Yankees to win an interleague game.
 Mike D'Antoni and Lawrence Frank, good coaches who deserve better personnel than the Knicks and Nets have supplied.
 David Diehl, Rich Seubert, Shaun O'Hara, Chris Snee and Kareem McKenzie, the offensive linemen who have kept Eli Manning alive and well as the Giants' quarterback.
 Lance Armstrong, who in his return to the Tour de France at age 37 after three years away proved that finishing third is noble.
 Mike Scioscia and his Angels of Anaheim, who grieved openly for starting pitcher Nick Adenhart, killed with two friends in a car crash as the season began, but moved on despite a 9-13 start to win the American League West for the fifth time in six seasons.
 All those who played in or just watched all of Syracuse's six-overtime victory over Connecticut in the quarterfinals of the Big East basketball tournament.
 Lisa Leslie, who retired from the Los Angeles Sparks at age 37 as the W.N.B.A.'s career leader in scoring and rebounding to be a full-time mom.
 Alex Rodriguez, whose steroids confession in spring training apparently cleared his conscience, who hit 30 home runs and drove in 100 runs even after hip surgery forced him to miss the first month of the season, and whose timely postseason slugging led the Yankees to their 27th World Series title.
 Jimmie Johnson, the Nascar champion who in winning a record fourth consecutive Sprint Cup title proved it is possible to stay down to earth while driving a zillion miles an hour on it.
 Meb Keflezighi, a child immigrant from a village with no electricity in war-ravaged Eritrea where he was one of 11 siblings, who waved and proudly pointed to the USA on his shirt in the home stretch of the New York City Marathon, the first American man to win since 1982.
 Ernie Harwell, the longtime Detroit Tigers voice who is battling incurable bile-duct cancer with the same understated style that marked his career as one of baseball's play-by-play legends.
 Rachel Alexandra, the first filly to win the Preakness since 1924, and Zenyatta, the mare who outran the boys in the Breeders' Cup Classic for a 14-0 career record. You can't have two Miss Americas, but thoroughbred racing had two Ms. Horses of the Year.

HEADLINE: A Tale Of Two Turkeys

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
On Wednesday, President Obama pardoned his first Thanksgiving turkey.
 There is something wrong with this concept.
 Here is how our beloved national tradition works: One lucky turkey gets to live -- and fly first class to Disneyland, where he is grand marshal in the Thanksgiving Day parade (I am not making this up). While another nameless bird gets slaughtered in his place.
 It's ''A Tale of Two Cities,'' except somehow I doubt that the doomed turkey volunteered for the job. 
 Who mourns the Backup Bird? What fickle finger of fate decided that he should literally get the ax, while the one who was supposed to go next lives happily ever after on the Big Thunder Ranch in Frontierland?
 The president did not seem all that thrilled with his role. ''There are certain days that remind me of why I ran for this office. And then there are moments like this, where I pardon the turkey and send it to Disneyland,'' he said.
 His daughters, who were trotted out as the alleged champions of the turkey pardon, looked as if they'd be perfectly happy to retract. Malia, who noted that the bird reminded her of ''a large chicken'' seemed particularly unenthusiastic.
 The National Turkey Federation named the bird Courage, perhaps in memory of Benjamin Franklin's contention that the bald eagle was a bird of bad moral character while the turkey was ''though a little vain and silly, a bird of courage.'' If Franklin's argument had prevailed and the turkey, rather than the bald eagle, had become the national symbol, would we still be eating them? Would the turkey farmers still be in business? What does eagle taste like, anyway? 
 These are the whims of fate that we celebrate on the day before Thanksgiving, when one random, somewhat sullen-looking bird gets pardoned while another goes to the presidential dinner table.
 The turkey-pardoning is supposed to be a long-running national tradition, but it officially only goes back to George (the Good One) Bush and 1989. Since Thanksgiving is a holiday that's particularly rich in long-running traditions, 20 years barely counts as an impulsive gesture.
 If we want a political tradition, we can do better. Let's all just gather around the family computer and watch that video of Sarah Palin discussing Thanksgiving in front of a bloody turkey abattoir.
 There was actually no mention at the presidential pardon of what the Obamas themselves were going to be eating on Thanksgiving. While the turkey federation traditionally donates a live bird for the ceremony and dead ones for the White House dinner, the oven-ready birds seem to be the ones that the president and the girls were taking to a Washington charity. As to the menu at the White House, a spokesman said it would involve ''traditional foods and family favorites,'' but declined to give details.
 We all know that Obama is extremely logical. He must understand that the only way for this pardoning ritual to make sense would be if he spared the backup turkey, and the backup's backup, all the way down the line.
 Then he could announce the creation of a new vegetarian Thanksgiving to commemorate the day the Pilgrims and the Indians got together over a steaming platter of parsnips.
 But since this is keep-it-cool, middle-of-the-road Barack Obama, he would probably skip both the drama and the turkey and go meatless without telling anybody. 
 After all, if the word got out, who knows how many tea parties it would spark? Birthers would probably claim that no one actually born in the United States would consider celebrating Thanksgiving without a turkey. Glenn Beck would weep over the incipient loss of our freedom to consume really dry meat on a holiday. Rumors would arise that Michelle does not really love her national cuisine.
 Whatever they're eating, the Obamas will undoubtedly discuss the things they want to give thanks for this year. You wonder what the president would say. He can always mention his family. Not every man has daughters loyal enough to accompany him through a cheesy turkey-pardoning. 
 But when he tries counting his blessings, does the specter of President Karzai rise up through the mashed potatoes? Do the brussels sprouts all look like little versions of Joe Lieberman threatening a filibuster? If it turns out that there is a turkey, and someone inevitably remarks that it looks like the biggest ever, does Obama think they're talking about the unemployment rate?
 It's not really fair. The president knows he could jump-start the economy, fix health care and do his ambitious energy policy -- if only the last administration hadn't cut taxes, started two wars and created a new, large Medicare entitlement without paying for any of it. 
 When he's not making his way through Thanksgiving photo-ops, he's adding up the numbers over and over in his mind, and sending mental daggers at the Republicans who are yelling at him about deficits that they created. 
 Although what else could he expect in a Washington that thinks you can pardon your turkey and eat it, too?

HEADLINE: Obama Backs Senate on 2 Disparities in Health Bills

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Two of President Obama's senior health care advisers said Wednesday that a proposed tax on high-cost insurance plans and a new commission to control Medicare spending were among ''four pillars'' essential to major health care legislation.
 Their remarks firmly aligned the White House with the Senate on two major disagreements facing Democratic Congressional leaders trying to pass a bill. 
 The health care legislation that the House adopted on Nov. 7 did not include the excise tax on the so-called Cadillac insurance plans. But the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, included the levy in the bill that the Senate will begin debating in earnest next week, and many health economists say it is vital to slowing long-term costs. 
 The House legislation also did not include the proposed Medicare commission, a central component of the Senate measure. 
 The White House and Democratic lawmakers have been under pressure in recent weeks over the issue of whether the legislation moving through Congress does enough to contain health care costs. Republican critics, and even some Democrats, have said the legislation does not go far enough to slow medical spending. 
 In a conference call with reporters Wednesday to highlight cost-containment provisions, the two senior presidential advisers, Peter R. Orszag, White House budget director, and Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of health reform, cited a letter to Mr. Obama by a group of respected economists who strongly endorsed the Medicare commission and the tax on high-priced plans.
 The letter also backed the two other pillars of the four embraced by the White House: that the legislation not add to the federal budget deficit and that it promote changes, known as ''delivery system reforms,'' aimed at rewarding high-quality care rather than high-quantity care.
 ''We are in favor of a fiscally responsible reform bill that includes these four pillars,'' Mr. Orszag said in the conference call. 
 Mr. Orszag declined to say whether the White House had told the House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, that to win Mr. Obama's signature, any final bill must include the provisions for a Cadillac tax and a Medicare commission.
 Aides to Ms. Pelosi pointed to comments she made last week indicating that she was prepared to work out any differences between the two houses. ''I like what we see in their bill,'' she said of the Senate measure, adding that the bills ''have a great deal in common'' and that when the Senate adopts its version, ''we'll be prepared to go to the table as soon as possible to pass this important legislation.'' 
 Mr. Obama has long signaled a preference for both an excise tax on high-end plans, which was first proposed in a version of the legislation developed by the Senate Finance Committee, and the independent commission, which some House leaders view as encroachment on Congressional authority over Medicare. 
 The president made reference to both proposals in his speech to Congress just after Labor Day as he sought to refocus the health care debate. 
 ''This reform will charge insurance companies a fee for their most expensive policies, which will encourage them to provide greater value for the money -- an idea which has the support of Democratic and Republican experts,'' Mr. Obama said in that address. ''And according to these same experts, this modest change could help hold down the cost of health care for all of us in the long run.'' 
 Of the Medicare panel, he said, ''We will also create an independent commission of doctors and medical experts charged with identifying more waste in the years ahead.'' 
 ''The commission,'' he added, ''can help encourage the adoption of these common-sense best practices by doctors and medical professionals throughout the system -- everything from reducing hospital infection rates to encouraging better coordination between teams of doctors.'' 
 The fate of the excise tax in particular is uncertain, partly because it is opposed by many labor unions, an important component of the Democratic Party's base of support. In a nod to that opposition, Mr. Reid took steps to reduce the impact of the tax when he put together the Senate's version of the legislation. 
 The Senate bill would impose an excise tax of 40 percent on the cost of employer-sponsored insurance policies above $8,500 for individuals and $23,000 for families. It provides for increasing those thresholds by $1,350 for individuals and $3,000 for families in cases where workers are in ''a high-risk profession or employed to install electrical or telecommunications lines.'' And there would be an additional increase in the thresholds, by the same amounts, in the 17 states where health insurance is most expensive. 
 The excise tax is the single biggest revenue-raiser in the Senate bill. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected that over 10 years, it would generate $149 billion toward the $848 billion 10-year cost of the legislation.
 The main revenue-raiser in the House bill is an income surtax, on individuals earning more than $500,000 and couples earning more than $1 million. It would generate $460 billion over 10 years toward the $1.05 trillion cost of that measure. 
 The budget office has projected that both bills would reduce federal deficits to levels below what they would be under current law, because the legislation's cost would be more than offset by new taxes and fees and by reductions in government spending, mostly through slowing the growth of Medicare. 
 The differing approaches in paying for the legislation are among the biggest divisions that Senate and House leaders will face, assuming the Senate's passage of its bill. Those differences would have to be worked out, with the resulting new version of the legislation approved in each chamber before the measure could be sent to Mr. Obama for his signature.

HEADLINE: Detentions At Border Are Down

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
Detentions of migrants trying to cross the border illegally dropped to 556,000 in the 2009 fiscal year, a decline of 23 percent over 2008 and the lowest number since the early 1970s, according to official figures released this week. 
 The number of detentions of illegal border crossers has been falling since 2000, when it reached a peak of 1.6 million. But the especially sharp decline in the 2009 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, was a sign of a steep decrease in the flow of migrant workers from Mexico and Central America, immigration officials and researchers said. 
 Migrants have been discouraged from coming by soaring unemployment among immigrants in the United States and tighter enforcement along the Southwest border, officials and scholars said.
 Obama administration officials have pointed to the decreasing flow as evidence that they have achieved a major improvement in border security. In a speech this month laying out immigration strategy, Janet Napolitano, the homeland security secretary, argued that a ''major shift'' in enforcement at the Mexican border had created conditions for Congress to embark on an overhaul of immigration policy, including giving legal status to more than 11 million illegal immigrants. 
 Ms. Napolitano said that heightened enforcement meant that such a program would not unleash a new flood of illegal migrants across the Southwest border. 
 Republican lawmakers said they were skeptical, because hundreds of miles of the rugged 2,000-mile-long border are still thinly patrolled and have no fencing. As a backup to border enforcement, they called for worker verification measures to block American employers from hiring illegal workers.
 ''We think it's a combination of increased border patrol and the economy,'' Fritz Chaleff, a spokesman for Representative Brian P. Bilbray, Republican of California, said of the low numbers. ''But we need measures to make sure that the jobs that are available go to the workers who are authorized to take them.'' 
 The Border Patrol hired 2,600 agents in the past year, official figures show, bringing the total to more than 20,000. 
 But the main factor in the slowing movement of immigrants is the country's deep recession, which has hit immigrants particularly hard -- especially illegal ones, researchers say. By the first months of this year, unemployment among immigrant workers was significantly greater than that of native-born American workers, reversing a trend during the boom years, according to a study by the Migration Policy Institute, a research group in Washington.
 Some researchers cautioned that border enforcement would not prevent Latino immigrants from returning if the economy picked up.

HEADLINE: Preparing, and Bracing, for New Emissions Rules

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
The nation's corporations have long been bracing for the day when they would be required to carry out sharp cuts in the emissions that cause global warming. That day seemed to move a bit closer on Wednesday, when President Obamaoutlined a national target for such reductions.
 Much of corporate America has already been thinking about how to comply. Many businesses concluded years ago that such limits were inevitable, and they have been calling on Congress to define the exact rules they will need to follow.
 Already, many companies are recording their emissions and analyzing the results. Some have set voluntary targets for reductions and are claiming substantial progress in meeting them. Sustainability -- a notion mostly heard in environmental circles only a decade ago -- has become a mainstream idea to which some companies are committed and many are paying lip service.
 Major corporations, including General Electric, the Ford Motor Company and PepsiCo, have teamed up with environmental groups to set up the United States Climate Action Partnership, a wide-ranging coalition trying to find ways to cut emissions throughout the economy. 
 Wal-Mart, the nation's top retailer, has outlined strict goals to reduce energy consumption at its stores and has instructed hundreds of thousands of suppliers to report their energy usage and carbon dioxide emissions. In a speech at a summit meeting in China last year, H. Lee Scott Jr., Wal-Mart's president and chief executive, said, ''Sustainability can and should be a big part of the solution.'' 
 In the energy sector, some corporations have also been vocal in demanding clarity on emissions. James E. Rogers, the chief executive of Duke Energy, a large power company and a major emitter of carbon dioxide, says that clear rules are needed to ensure that companies relying on coal-fired power plants can finance their transition to lower-carbon fuels, like natural gas or nuclear power. Coal accounts for half of the nation's electric generation.
 ''A well-designed cap will provide a smooth transition to clean electricity,'' Mr. Rogers said in an ad that ran over the summer.
 Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said, ''Industry needs certainty, and without a very strong role played by the administration, they are not likely to get it.'' She added, ''Real leadership from the White House is the only way to get a bill through the Senate, and a bill is how we will get certainty.''
 Until now, the United States had been the only industrialized economy to shun hard targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The nation has been overtaken by China as the top emitter of carbon dioxide, but Americans are bigger carbon polluters per person than citizens of other countries.
 The White House said on Wednesday that the president would present a provisional target at the Copenhagen summit meeting on climate next month to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will be ''in the range'' of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, and 83 percent below by 2050, the White House said. 
 That target reflects the goals specified by legislation that was passed in the House in June. A similar bill is bogged down in the Senate, which would set cuts of 20 percent by 2020.
 Limiting the growth in greenhouse gas emissions, let alone cutting them, will require a radical transformation of the nation's energy consumption and fuels that will most likely take decades. It is bound to hurt some energy-intensive businesses, like petroleum refiners and coal-fired power plants, and some manufacturers, while bolstering the development of alternative power industries like solar and wind.
 To reduce emissions, Congress has been looking at a mechanism called cap and trade, in which legislators would set a limit on the nation's emissions and it would decline each year. They would also assign pollution permits that companies could then buy and sell depending on their needs. 
 Much of the legislative horse-trading in recent months centered on which sectors of the economy would receive these carbon allowances free, as a subsidy to switch to low-carbon fuels or to invest in carbon-abating technologies, and which industries must pay for them. 
 Corporate America is by no means unanimous in embracing the idea of emission limits. Larger corporations, especially those operating in both the United States and Europe, have gone furthest in tackling their emissions. By contrast, many small businesses and domestic manufacturers have made little headway, and they are worried about the higher energy costs that an attack on global warming would require.
 Oil producers have opposed the current climate legislation being debated in Congress. Refiners and producers claim the bill would result in higher gasoline bills, lower domestic output and an increase in fuel imports. 
 ''In the midst of a severe recession with 10.2 percent national unemployment, our economy, the creation of jobs and consumer impact should take much greater precedence over attempts to impress international bureaucrats during an annual convention,'' Charles T. Drevna, the president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association, wrote on a recent blog post, referring to the Copenhagen meeting. 
 Some of the nation's biggest trade groups, including the powerful United States Chamber of Commerce and the American Farm Bureau Federation, have also been fighting the climate legislation through ads and a protracted lobbying battle on Capital Hill. 
 The National Association of Manufacturers said recently that a climate bill would result in job losses and slower economic growth. The Senate bill, it said, represents a ''significant technological and economic challenge to manufacturers while resulting in little benefit to the environment.''
 But the chamber's attacks against climate policy have also led to a wave of well-publicized resignations from the trade group -- by prominent companies like Apple and Nike, and the utilities Pacific Gas and Electric, Exelon and PNM Resources. All of them assailed the chamber's climate policy as counterproductive. 
 ''Nike believes that climate change is an urgent issue affecting the world today and that businesses and their representative associations need to take an active role to invest in sustainable business practices and innovative solutions to address the issue,'' the company said after quitting the chamber in September. 
 Since coming into office, the Obama administration has encouraged the development of lower-carbon technologies and has sought to increase the fuel efficiency of motor vehicles. Venture capital firms have also been pouring billions of dollars into alternative energy projects, car companies are working on electric vehicles, and some power utilities have welcomed incentives to switch to low-carbon sources of energy.
 Adam Sieminski, the chief energy economist at Deutsche Bank, said that setting a goal was a constructive step, but that much more work remains to map out ways the country can actually meet the president's target. That includes increasing the use of natural gas to replace coal in the short term, in his view, and adding more nuclear power in the long run.
 ''We have a lot of ideas on the table,'' he said. ''But no one has actually agreed to the blueprint that would allow us to get to the goal that the president has outlined.''

HEADLINE: OBAMA OFFERS TARGETS TO CUT GREENHOUSE GAS

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama is pledging a provisional target for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, the first time in more than a decade that an American administration has offered even a tentative promise to reduce production of climate-altering gases, the White House announced Wednesday.
 At the international climate meetings in Copenhagen next month, Mr. Obama will tell the delegates that the United States intends to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions ''in the range of'' 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050, officials said. 
 The figures reflect targets specified by legislation that passed the House in June but is stalled in the Senate. Congress has never enacted legislation that includes firm emissions limits or ratified an international global warming agreement with binding targets. 
 Mr. Obama will travel to the United Nations talks to deliver the promise in hopes of spurring significant progress there. He will appear Dec. 9, near the beginning of the 12-day session, on his way to accept the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo on Dec. 10, officials said. 
 By making the pledge in an international forum, Mr. Obama is laying a bet that Congress will complete action on a climate bill next year and will be prepared to ratify an international agreement based on the commitment. 
 But White House officials acknowledged that those outcomes were uncertain. They will depend in large measure on whether the Democratic sponsors of the legislation can win 60 votes for a measure that is at the moment unpopular and whether major developing nations, notably China and India, deliver credible emissions reduction pledges of their own.
 Mr. Obama has met over the past two weeks with the leaders of China and India, the fastest-growing sources of greenhouse gases, to discuss climate change and the Copenhagen conference. American officials said that both countries told the president they would be prepared to announce steps to reduce the rate of growth of emissions if the United States put a pledge on the table. 
 Neither has done so yet, although Chinese officials have hinted that they will announce a near-term target for reducing energy use relative to economic growth, or ''carbon intensity,'' before the Copenhagen conference opens.
 The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on Thursday that Prime Minister Wen Jiabao would attend the conference.
 ''Obviously, we hope other major economies will put forth ambitious action plans of their own,'' Carol M. Browner, the president's senior adviser for energy and climate change, said at a White House briefing on Wednesday morning.
 Mr. Obama, who had not previously committed either to emissions targets or to going to Copenhagen, has been under considerable pressure from other world leaders and environmental advocates to reassert American leadership on climate change.
 Andreas Carlgren, the Swedish environment minister, said that Mr. Obama had now raised expectations for the Copenhagen talks, but he expressed a note of disappointment about the timing of his visit. He said he hoped Mr. Obama would come in the final days of negotiations, when dozens of other heads of government were planning to arrive.
 A White House official said a return trip was ''highly unlikely.''
 It was unclear what effect Mr. Obama's promise of domestic emissions reductions would have on the slow progress of climate legislation through Congress. Until now, the administration's negotiators have said they will not get ahead of Congress in making promises in an international forum, but Mr. Obama has now essentially adopted the targets of a climate and energy bill that passed the House in June.
 The House bill aims at greenhouse gas reductions of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and sharper cuts in the following decades, through a cap-and-trade system that includes most of the nation's major sources of carbon dioxide emissions. Last month, a Senate committee passed a measure calling for a 20 percent cut by 2020, but that is expected to be weakened as the legislation moves through other Senate committees and onto the floor, perhaps next spring.
 ''By putting a serious number for U.S. emission reductions on the table, the president has just called the world's bet and then raised it for our negotiating partners,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, co-sponsor of the House legislation.
 Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, co-sponsor of the Senate legislation, said he believed that the president's actions would give a boost to the Copenhagen talks and help move the Senate bill. He called the decision to declare an American target a ''game changer,'' domestically and internationally.
 ''By announcing a provisional target, contingent on the support of Congress, the president has defined a path to an international agreement that challenges the developed and developing nations to fulfill their obligations,'' he said. ''It lays the groundwork for a broad political consensus at Copenhagen that will strip climate obstructionists here at home of their most persistent charge, that the United States shouldn't act if other countries won't join with us.''
 But Senator James M. Inhofe, the Senate's most outspoken skeptic on climate change, said that Mr. Obama's public pledge would do little to speed an international agreement and foolishly prejudged the outcome of a Senate debate that had barely started. Mr. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, said that Senate climate legislation was ''dying on the vine'' and that the Senate would never ratify a treaty that did not require strong emissions reductions from major developing countries.
 ''The U.S. Senate has made clear on numerous occasions that unilateral action by the United States is unacceptable, because it will harm our economy and have virtually no effect on climate change,'' Mr. Inhofe said.
 Mr. Obama takes little risk in appearing briefly at the Copenhagen conference because he and other world leaders punctured expectations for the session 10 days ago in a side meeting of leaders of Pacific nations. The leaders agreed that they would work at Copenhagen toward an interim political declaration on climate change that stopped short of a binding international treaty. Delegates are expected to pledge to complete work on a treaty next year.
 Mr. Obama came to office promising to end eight years of relative inaction on climate change under the Bush administration, but the inaction of Congress has limited the administration's ability to negotiate with other nations. At the Kyoto climate conference in 1997, the Clinton administration joined other industrialized nations in pledging to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2 percent by 2012, but Congress refused to ratify the agreement because it made no demands of developing nations.
 Many foreign leaders, particularly those in European nations that have been more aggressive in dealing with climate change, have become critical of Mr. Obama's seeming passivity on the issue. The White House appears to hope that the announcement of the targets and the trip to Copenhagen will quiet some of the dissension and help Mr. Obama re-establish American leadership on what he calls one of the signature issues of the time.
 Mr. Obama said recently that he would attend the session if his presence could help lead to a successful outcome. It is significant that he will appear at the beginning rather than at the end of the 12-day meeting. Most major decisions at such environmental talks come in the closing days.
 Yvo de Boer, head of the United Nations climate directorate, said in an e-mail message that he would like to see the American target in writing and a pledge of money to help poorer nations adapt to a changing climate.
 ''If the president comes in the first week to announce that,'' Mr. de Boer said, ''it would be a major boost to the conference.''
 The White House also announced that several cabinet secretaries would speak at the Copenhagen conference: Lisa P. Jackson, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator; Steven Chu, the secretary of energy; and Ken Salazar, the secretary of interior.

An article on Nov. 18 about Goldman Sachs's response to criticism of its high pay and its role in the financial crisis, using information from a Bloomberg News article, quoted imprecisely from remarks by its chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, at a conference in New York. Mr. Blankfein said, ''We participated in things that were clearly wrong and we have reasons to regret and apologize for.'' He did not say: ''We participated in things that were clearly wrong and have reason to regret. We apologize.'' The imprecise quotation was repeated in an article in Week in Review on Sunday. (The quotation appeared correctly in an editorial on Sunday.)

 Broadway
 'AFTER MISS JULIE'Patrick Marber's adaptation of Strindberg's short shocker from 1888, stiffly directed by Mark Brokaw and starring Sienna Miller, who emerges as sane, healthy and confident, which doesn't help much in her portrayal of a death-courting neurotic. The very good Jonny Lee Miller plays her sexual sparring partner (1:35). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, Manhattan , (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Ben Brantley)20091126
 'BURN THE FLOOR' A nonstop exhibition of pop ballroom dancing, directed and choreographed by Jason Gilkison.

(Charles Isherwood)20091126
 'BYE BYE BIRDIE' Robert Longbottom's color-coded revival of this 1960 musical satire is a painful example of misapplied talent.

 'FELA!' This transporting musical biography of a Nigerian revolutionary of song doesn't so much tell a story as soak an audience to and through the skin with the style and sensibility called Afrobeat. There has never been anything on Broadway like Bill T. Jones's kinetic production, which stars the charismatic Sahr Ngaujah and Kevin Mambo (2:30). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091126
 'FINIAN'S RAINBOW' A glorious cast restores the luster of this oddball 1947 musical with a first-rate score by E. Y. Harburg and Burton Lane. Kate Baldwin and Cheyenne Jackson are the frisky lovers, Jim Norton the wily Irishman with a purloined pot of gold, and Christopher Fitzgerald the leprechaun on the lam. Daft? Yes, but heaven for musical theater lovers (2:25) St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20091126
 'GOD OF CARNAGE'Yasmina Reza's farce about combustible parents in conflict, impeccably directed by Matthew Warchus. Christine Lahti, Annie Potts, Jimmy Smits and Ken Stott make up the new set of brawlers.(1:30). Bernard Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091126
 'HAIR' (Tony Award for best musical revival.) Diane Paulus's thrilling, emotionally rich revival of the 1967 rock musical delivers what Broadway otherwise hasn't felt this season: the intense, unadulterated joy and anguish of that bipolar state called youth. A production that finds the complexity and deep ambivalence in a show people tend to remember as a feel-good free-for-all (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091126
 'HAMLET'Jude Law embodies the Prince of Denmark with lots of energy, many hand gestures and little modulation. Though the look of Michael Grandage's black-on-black production is chicly of the moment, its performances suggest what a 19th-century barnstorming production might have been like. Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091126
 'IRVING BERLIN'S WHITE CHRISTMAS' This seasonal offering, a stage version of the 1950s movie with some additional songs drafted for the occasion, features new faces in the main roles this year, but it's just as lukewarm as ever. The most interesting addition is David Ogden Stiers as the retired general at whose Vermont inn most of the action takes place (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street , (212) 307-4100, ticketmaster.com. (Neil Genzlinger)20091126
 'MEMPHIS' In the city of the title in the 1950s, a pioneering white radio D.J. (the endearing Chad Kimball) falls in love with R&B music and one of its comely practitioners (the lovely Montego Glover) in this slick but essentially soulless musical written by David Bryan and Joe DiPietro (''The Toxic Avenger'') and fleetly directed by Christopher Ashley. Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20091126
 'NEXT TO NORMAL' No show on Broadway makes as direct a grab for the heart -- or wrings it as thoroughly -- as this brave, breathtaking musical. Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey's portrait of a manic-depressive suburban mom (the astounding Alice Ripley) and her family, directed by Michael Greif, isn't a feel-good musical. It's a feel-everything musical (2:20). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091126
 'OLEANNA' Doug Hughes's measured revival of David Mamet's confrontational drama from 1992, which stars the excellent Bill Pullman and a luminous Julia Stiles as a university professor and his combative student, pumps the play full of an air of thoughtfulness that paradoxically comes close to smothering it. Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091126
 'RAGTIME' Marcia Milgrom Dodge's appealingly modest interpretation of this 1998 musical about early-20th-century American growing pains, adapted from E. L. Doctorow's novel, finds an affecting, uneasy human soul within the work's panoramic sweep. This production doesn't disguise the work's hearty preachiness, but it elicits glimmers of delicate beauty (2:45). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street , (212) 307-4100, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)20091126
 'ROCK OF AGES' The Sunset Strip in the 1980s is the setting for this absurdly enjoyable jukebox musical weaving more than two dozen arena-rock hits from the glory years of MTV -- from Journey and Pat Benatar to Poison and Whitesnake -- into a story of heartbreak and warped-vinyl dreams. Big hair, songs that are trashy fun, fabulous cast (2:25). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street , (212) 307-4100, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)20091126
 'SHREK THE MUSICAL' This musical cavalcade of storybook effigies, adapted from the animated film of the same title, can feel like 40 blocks' worth of a Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, accompanied by an exhaustingly jokey commentary. But Brian d'Arcy James and the hypertalented Sutton Foster find a sweet, goofy chemistry as an ogre and a princess (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091126
 'A STEADY RAIN' Big names, little show. Keith Huff's 90-minute melodrama about Chicago cops, directed by John Crowley, is best regarded as a small, slightly wobbly pedestal on which two gods of the screen -- Daniel Craig and Hugh Jackman -- may stand in order to be worshiped (1:30). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091126
 'SUPERIOR DONUTS' The new play from the ''August: Osage County'' author Tracy Letts is a warm-hearted, bile-free comedy about the friendship between an emotionally stunted ex-radical (Michael McKean) and the brash young man he hires to help out in the establishment of the title (Jon Michael Hill, in an exciting Broadway debut). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20091126
 'WEST SIDE STORY' In a startlingly sweet revival of this epochal musical, Arthur Laurents trades insolence for innocence, with dividends and losses. If the Jets and the Sharks seem too cute to be true, the show's doomed lovers (played by Josefina Scaglione and Matt Cavenaugh) have rarely been more affecting. And as Anita, Karen Olivo is a stunner (2:35). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, near 46th Street , (212) 307-4100, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)20091126
 'WISHFUL DRINKING'Carrie Fisher's brut-dry, deeply funny one-woman show allows you to see the world through the self-dissociating gaze of a child of Hollywood who has always lived in a fishbowl (2:20). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street , (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)20091126
 Off Broadway
 'AVENUE Q' Even without legs of their own, the singing hand puppets of this Tony-winning musical are still standing tall in their new Off Broadway digs. This ''Sesame Street''-style show about being young and jobless in New York remains fresh, in all senses of the word (2:15) New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)20091126
 'THE BROTHER/SISTER PLAYS PART 1 & 2' Tarell Alvin McCraney's gorgeous trilogy of poetic plays, about hard lives in the bayou country of Louisiana, are pumped full of a senses-heightening oxygen. Directed by Tina Landau and Robert O'Hara, and acted by a rousingly good ensemble, these interconnected works are the product of that rare and great thing, an original artistic vision. (Part 1 is 2:00; Part 2 is 2:30.) Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village , (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)20091126
 'CAPTAIN PANTOJA AND THE SPECIAL SERVICE/PANTALEON Y LAS VISITADORAS' Peruvian soldiers in the Amazon need female companionship, so Captain Pantoja enlists a whole corps of prostitutes, complete with cute, midriff-baring uniforms. This rousing, sexy and surprisingly sweet new musical could give bawdiness a good name. In Spanish with simultaneous English translation. Repertorio Espanol at the Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street , (212) 225-9920, repertorio.org. (Anita Gates)20091126
 'CIRCUMCISE ME' Yisrael Campbell's highly entertaining account of his conversion to Judaism not once but three times is elevated beyond shtick by the recognition that, aside from the jokes, this is Mr. Campbell's life, and that his quest for a ''relationship with God'' continues even after the house lights rise (1:30). Bleecker Street Theater, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Daniel M. Gold)20091126
 'DREAMGIRLS' Robert Longbottom's bluntly drawn, pastels-saturated revival of Tom Eyen and Henry Krieger's landmark musical, inspired by the career of the Supremes. Audiences should feel a demi-shiver of the excitement generated by the original, but not much more. The talented cast includes the powerhouse Moya Angela (2:30). Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem , (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)20091126
 'THE EMPEROR JONES' Ciaran O'Reilly's inspired, poetic production of Eugene O'Neill's short, brutal drama -- starring a wondrous John Douglas Thompson -- finds Jungian echoes of universal resonance in a work often perceived as a dated portrait of the black man's burden (1:10). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea , (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Brantley)20091126
 'IDIOT SAVANT' Some kind of wonderful. Richard Foreman's cheerful, mad and eminently sane exaltation of the world as a stage stars an antic and very skillful Willem Dafoe, as a rogue philosopher trapped in a play. Alenka Kraigher and Elina Lowensohn are his female supplicants and tormentors (1:20). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village , (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)20091126
 'THE LADY WITH ALL THE ANSWERS'Judith Ivey, in a giant meringue of dark auburn hair, plays the syndicated advice columnist Ann Landers (a k a Eppie Lederer) in this genial solo play by David Rambo, set in 1975, when Eppie has to reveal to her dedicated readers that she's getting a divorce (1:40). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20091126
 'LET ME DOWN EASY'Anna Deavere Smith's engrossing new show, drawing as usual on verbatim excerpts from interviews with a wide variety of subjects, addresses the power and the fragility of the human body and its susceptibility to disease. Most moving are the many voices discussing the harsh realities of death, and the possibility of finding grace in its shadow (1:30). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton , (212) 246-4422, 2ST.com. (Isherwood)20091126

 'LOVE CHILD' Daniel Jenkins and Robert Stanton star in this rollicking two-hander, which they also wrote. It's a backstage story in which the two men play all the characters: a group of actors staging a ridiculous updating of Euripides, as well as a couple of overly loud audience members. No wigs or costume changes here: it's all in the tics and accents, and half the fun is seeing if you can keep up (1:20). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Genzlinger)20091126
 'MY WONDERFUL DAY'Alan Ayckbourn's charming, rueful new comedy considers what fools grown-up mortals be through the eyes of an 8-year-old girl. This perspective lends a piquant freshness to what might have been a formulaic sex farce. The remarkable Ayesha Antoine, as the child, leads a fine cast, directed by Mr. Ayckbourn (1:40). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street , (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Brantley)20091126

 'OR,' Maggie Siff (''Mad Men'') plays the pioneering female writer Aphra Behn in Liz Duffy Adams's mock-Restoration comedy, which imagines Behn as one point in a love triangle also involving King Charles II (Andy Paris) and Nell Gwynne (Kelly Hutchinson). Frisky, funny and Smart (1:30). Women's Project Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20091126
 'OUR TOWN' David Cromer strips away the folksy warmth in which Thornton Wilder's play is often saturated to reveal this classic's quietly mournful depths. This wonderfully intimate production puts a small audience smack in the middle of Grover's Corners (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village , (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Isherwood)20091126
 'THE STARRY MESSENGER'Kenneth Lonergan's gentle, compassionate comic drama about a passive astronomy teacher considers fallible, contradictory souls who can never quite articulate what's missing in their lives but always feel the void. The fine ensemble is led by Matthew Broderick, in his most affecting performance in years (2:45). The New Group at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton , (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Brantley)20091126
 'THE TOXIC AVENGER' A dopey, intermittently funny musical version of the cheapo Troma picture. A geek turned monster in New Jersey tears the limbs off evildoers while singing pop-rock anthems. The cast is fun, but Joe DiPietro's book and David Bryan's music are mostly mediocre (1:40). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton , (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)20091126
 'THE UNDERSTUDY'Julie White fabricates bountiful laughs from a sumptuous display of strained nerves in Theresa Rebeck's scattershot backstage comedy, which also stars Justin Kirk (''Weeds'') and Mark-Paul Gosselaar (''Saved by the Bell'') as actors on far different levels of the showbiz totem pole (1:30).

 'THE SUPPER CLUB OF LOST CAUSES'; closes on Sunday. Jim Farmer tells a fractured tale of faded glory in this look at a tattered supper club in Hawley, Pa., in the Poconos.

HEADLINE: Awash in Ethanol

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Two years ago, Congress ordered the nation's gasoline refiners to do something that is turning out to be mathematically impossible.
 To please the farm lobby and to help wean the nation off oil, Congress mandated that refiners blend a rising volume of ethanol and other biofuels into gasoline. They are supposed to use at least 15 billion gallons of biofuels by 2012, up from less than seven billion gallons in 2007.
 But nobody at the time counted on fuel demand falling in the United States, which is what has happened during the recession. And that decline could well continue, as cars become more efficient under other recent government mandates. 
 At the maximum allowable blend, in which gasoline at the pump contains 10 percent ethanol, updated projections suggest that the country is unlikely to be able to use all the ethanol that Congress has ordered up. So something has to give.
 ''The market is full,'' said Jeff Broin, chief executive of Poet, a company in Sioux Falls, S.D., that produces ethanol.
 In theory, the Environmental Protection Agency has the power to solve this problem by tweaking the mandates imposed by Congress, and it may act as early as next week. 
 Each potential solution would anger one interest group or another, so the agency has been subjected to fierce lobbying, including from members of Congress lining up behind various factions. One possibility is to raise the maximum proportion of ethanol in gasoline to 15 or 20 percent. 
 But that idea is opposed by some carmakers and pollution experts. They contend that high ethanol blends can cause damage to cars, including making catalytic converters run hotter. 
 The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers says it believes this could cause the converters, components that help control pollution, to fail at around 50,000 miles. They are supposed to last for 120,000 to 150,000 miles. ''We are sensitive to the issues facing the ethanol industry, but the government must make decisions based on sound science,'' said Dave McCurdy, president and chief executive of the alliance, in a letter to the E.P.A.
 Another possibility is that the agency could waive the mandates requiring use of a large volume of biofuels. But that would anger farmers, who sell a great deal of corn to ethanol factories, and the members of Congress who represent them. It might also undermine the efforts of companies that are investing millions in factories to make ethanol from waste materials, like corncobs, straw and garbage.
 ''Ethanol is the only viable, competitive alternative to foreign oil,'' said Tom Buis, chief executive of Growth Energy, the ethanol trade group that filed the petition with the E.P.A. to increase the blending percentage. ''If we're going to become less dependent on foreign oil, we've got to move forward.''
 A third possibility is that the E.P.A. could announce that it is waiting for more data on how cars perform at higher blends, but that would merely put off the hard decision. 
 When Congress wrote the rules, in 2007, gasoline consumption had been growing for years, and it looked as if the nation would be able to use considerably more ethanol in the future. Gasoline consumption hit a peak of 3.4 billion barrels that year. 
 But gasoline demand fell in 2008, after soaring gas prices early in the year were followed by the economic crisis. Consumption was slightly less than 3.3 billion barrels last year, and it could end 2009 at about the same level.
 With consumers buying more fuel-efficient cars these days, and carmakers rushing to bring even more of those to market, gasoline demand may not recover much in coming years, even as ethanol production soars. 
 As of yet, not all gasoline is blended with 10 percent ethanol, but that saturation point is rapidly approaching. Under the present rules, the nation could hit the upper limit of its ability to consume ethanol in 2011.
 Mr. Buis and others argue that Congress or the E.P.A. must do something if the country is to move to a new generation of biofuels that do not compete with food crops. The possibilities include ethanol made from wood chips, waste paper or agricultural waste like straw and corncobs. 
 Congress has also passed mandates for the blending of this type of fuel, so that the nation's total consumption of all renewable fuels, in vehicles and other equipment, is supposed to reach 36 billion gallons in 2022.
 Perhaps the easiest way for the country to absorb all the excess ethanol would be to make wider use of an ethanol blend called E85, which contains 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline. Most cars on the road cannot use it, but in recent years, millions of ''flex-fuel'' cars have been sold, especially by General Motors. (Any car with a yellow gasoline cap can use E85.)
 The problem is that at current prices, E85 does not make economic sense for drivers, and most of them use regular gasoline in their flex-fuel cars. That means gasoline stations have little incentive to install pumps for E85. The fuel can be found in the Corn Belt but is not readily available elsewhere in the country.
 Gasoline was selling on average Thursday for $2.63 a gallon, while E85 was selling for $2.23 a gallon. That might make E85 sound like a bargain, but cars go fewer miles on a gallon of ethanol than of gasoline. Adjusted for that factor, E85 on Thursday was effectively 31 cents a gallon more expensive than gasoline.
 A return of $4 gasoline might change things, by making E85 a relative bargain and spurring wider use. So would an unexpected spurt in total fuel demand. Otherwise, it is not at all clear how the nation's coming surplus of ethanol can be absorbed.
 Gregory M. Scott, executive vice president of the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association, drives a flex-fuel car in the Washington area, but said he had never put E85 in it.
 He said the amount of renewable fuel that Congress had mandated refiners to use, and the amount that can be blended for conventional automobiles, were on a collision course. 
 ''At some point,'' he said, ''those two lines cross.''

HEADLINE: When The Wheels Come Off

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
With unemployment in the city exceeding 10 percent, the timing is perfect for one of the most wrenching films about job desperation to make the rounds in some New York theaters.
 We're referring to ''The Bicycle Thief,'' directed by a titan of Italian cinema, Vittorio De Sica. Released in the United States 60 years ago, it was part of a monthlong retrospective of Italian Neorealism that ended this week at the Film Society of Lincoln Center. It had a two-week run this month at Lincoln Plaza on the Upper West Side. On Dec. 11, it is scheduled to move to Cinema Village in Greenwich Village.
 Though set in impoverished Italy after World War II, ''The Bicycle Thief'' speaks to today's widespread economic misery, said John M. Poole, the president of Corinth Films, the movie's distributor. 
 The main reason for releasing it now is the 60th anniversary, Mr. Poole said. Nonetheless, ''it absolutely dovetails with the economy these days,'' he said. ''We're in such dire times.''
 The film holds up well.
 It is the story of one Antonio Ricci, whose days are spent with other luckless men looking for work. One morning, a job comes open: pasting wall posters. It is reserved for someone with a bicycle. Antonio has one, even if he first must get it out of hock.
 On his first day, proud to finally hold a job, he is putting up a poster of Rita Hayworth when his bicycle is stolen. The thief gets away. 
 The rest of the film is about Antonio's mounting despair as he and his son search for the bike. He is a decent man, who plays by the rules. He turns to the police. But they are, for the most part, indifferent.
 Asked by a colleague what Antonio's problem is, a police captain shrugs. ''Nothing,'' he says. ''Just a bicycle.''
 Just a bicycle. For Antonio, it represents life itself.
 ''When it is stolen, everything else starts to unravel -- Antonio's status as a father and a husband, his confidence in the efficacy of the law and the decency of other people, his ethical grounding,'' the New York Times film critic A.O. Scott wrote in March.
 It is perhaps not giving away too much to note that the film's Italian title is ''Ladri di Biciclette,'' or ''Bicycle Thieves.'' Under any title, it packs an emotional wallop that can be felt today by tens of thousands of New Yorkers and millions of other Americans. 
 ''A man loves his family and wants to protect and support them,'' the film critic Roger Ebert wrote of ''The Bicycle Thief'' in 1999. ''Society makes it difficult. Who cannot identify with that?''
 Dan Talbot, a godfather of film revivals in this city for half a century, said that despite the movie's social significance, he was not trying to send a political message by showing it at Lincoln Plaza, which he owns.
 ''I have never, ever booked a film that has any intended relevance to the zeitgeist, if you will,'' he said. ''It has to do purely with aesthetics.'' 
 Edward Arentz, a booking agent for Cinema Village, similarly said that he was ''not looking for too many people to read a message in this, though you never know.''
 You never know, indeed. Mr. Talbot said that the film did well at the box office, suggesting that it continues to hold meaning for some New Yorkers.
 ON a somewhat more prosaic note, the emergence of ''The Bicycle Thief'' underlines the paucity of film revival houses in a city where they once thrived. Some still exist, like Film Forum on Houston Street, but as a group they are a shadow of what once was. Netflix rentals are useful, but they hardly offer the ''social congress,'' to borrow from Mr. Talbot, that a movie house provides.
 Mr. Talbot and his wife, Toby, used to own one of the best revival houses, the New Yorker, on Broadway near 89th Street. They took it over in 1960. (It had been called the Yorktown, with its name in neon. In rechristening it, and needing to hold expenses down, the Talbots recycled the YORK part. That way, Mr. Talbot said, the only neon letters they had to buy were NEW and ER.)
 The New Yorker was demolished in 1985. Last winter, Mr. Talbot's distributorship of vintage movies, New Yorker Films, closed its doors after 44 years. Few things last.
 ''The Bicycle Thief'' is one of the exceptions. Admirably durable, it resonates in the latest bout of tough times. In Mr. Scott's words, this film and other Neorealist works carry an acknowledgment that ''there is something in human nature that will persist in the face of defeat.''

 Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. 
 'ANTICHRIST' (No rating, 1:49) Women: evil or just misunderstood? Leave it to Lars von Trier to ask the tough question, and to provide answers that are both incoherent and appalling. (A. O. Scott)20091126
 'ASTRO BOY' (PG, 1:34) David Bowers gives Osamu Tezuka's beloved robot boy the big-screen animation treatment with a golly-gee voice (Freddie Highmore) and the usual action scenes and celebrity add-ons (Bill Nighy, Nathan Lane). (Manohla Dargis)20091126
 'BAD LIEUTENANT: PORT OF CALL NEW ORLEANS' (R, 2:01) Werner Herzog's pungent, pulpy cop story is, above all, the vehicle for a sustained display of marvelously inventive acting from Nicolas Cage, who plays the title character -- a New Orleans detective with serious problems -- with nearly lunatic bravura. (Scott)20091126 
 'THE BLIND SIDE' (PG-13, 2:00) Sandra Bullock does good, and then does good some more in this true story of a rich white Memphis family that adopts a homeless young African-American football prodigy. (Scott)20091126
 'BOONDOCK SAINTS II: ALL SAINTS DAY' (R, 2:01) Much of the original cast returns for Troy Duffy's sequel, which arrives a decade after the original ''Boondock Saints.'' Apparently the world has been waiting for another cartoonishly violent, broadly comic, Boston Irish Catholic vigilante action movie with gay overtones. (Mike Hale)20091126
 'THE BOX' (PG-13, 1:55) Richard Kelly's extravagantly ambitious adaptation of a short story by the fantasy writer Richard Matheson about a couple (Cameron Diaz and James Marsden) who receive an offer they should refuse (from Frank Langella) is sincere and sinister, but also confusingly plotted and often strained. (Dargis)20091126
 'BRIGHT STAR' (PG, 1:59) Jane Campion, following the biographical record closely, tells the story of John Keats (Ben Whishaw) and Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish), star-crossed literary lovers of the Regency period. Thanks to the passionate performances and the director's rough, almost breathless style, what might have been a prettified period drama becomes a seething, swooning inquiry into the nature of love. (Scott)20091126
 'BROKEN EMBRACES' (R, 2:08, in Spanish) Exuberant melancholy from Pedro Almodovar. A blind writer (Lluis Homar) is pulled back into his past, when he was a filmmaker in an ill-fated love affair with an actress played by Penelope Cruz. (Scott)20091126
 'CAPITALISM: A LOVE STORY' (R, 2:06) Michael Moore tracks the end of a troubled romance. (I knew they weren't meant for each other!) (Dargis)20091126
 'COCO BEFORE CHANEL' (PG-13, 1:10, in French) Less a biopic than a study in the manners and morals of a bygone era, Anne Fontaine's film follows the complicated love life and budding ambition of Gabrielle Chanel (Audrey Tautou) on her path from early poverty and heartbreak through independence toward eventual fame. Ms. Tautou, wary and astringent, is excellent, as is Benoit Poelvoorde, who plays Coco's aristocratic lover, Etienne Balsan. (Scott)20091126
 'COLLAPSE' (No rating, 1:22) Since 2001, Michael C. Ruppert, a former Los Angeles police officer, has devoted his life to connecting the dots between population, economics and energy, and concluding that the center will not hold. Here his chilling monologue of imminent catastrophe, filmed with clinical austerity by Chris Smith, dances dangerously close to a parody of Errol Morris's handling of Robert S. McNamara in ''The Fog of War.'' Yet whether delusional thinker or tragic prophet, Mr. Ruppert maintains his dignity in a film that straddles the line between shining a light on society's outsiders and exploiting them. (Jeannette Catsoulis)20091126
 'COUPLES RETREAT' (PG-13, 1:45) Everyone else should too. (Scott)20091126
 'DISNEY'S A CHRISTMAS CAROL' (PG, 1:35) A big, 3-D spectacle, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Jim Carrey as Ebenezer Scrooge (and also as some of the ghosts who haunt him), this film has a magic that lies not in its effects but in its fidelity to the language and mood of Charles Dickens's immortal tale of greed and grace. (Scott)20091126
 'DEFAMATION' (No rating, 1:31, in English and Hebrew) This Michael-Moore-style film by Yoav Shamir, an Israeli filmmaker, tries to be provocative by raising questions like, is the Jewish preoccupation with the Holocaust preventing progress in the present? But his focus on some overexposed voices to make his points -- like Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League -- makes it all seem pretty familiar for an American audience. (Neil Genzlinger)20091126
 'AN EDUCATION' (PG-13, 1:40) Jenny, a London schoolgirl in the early 1960s -- played with verve and brass by Carey Mulligan -- learns the ways of the world at the hands of an older gentleman (Peter Sarsgaard), who turns out to be sleazier and less worldly than he seems at first. Adapted by Nick Hornby from a memoir by Lynn Bradley and directed by Lone Scherfig, this film is a bit too charmed by its own period atmosphere to take account of the uglier implications of the story it tells. (Scott)20091126
 'FANTASTIC MR. FOX' (PG, 1:28) A children's adventure story or a Wes Anderson movie. Both, of course, and Mr. Anderson, using a painstakingly old-fashioned stop-motion animation technique, turns Roald Dahl's slender fable into his most satisfying film since ''Rushmore.'' (Scott)20091126
 'FOUR SEASONS LODGE' (No rating, 1:37) With help from the legendary verite cinematographer Albert Maysles, the novice director Andrew Jacobs, a reporter for The New York Times, sidesteps the formal testimony and heroic narrative of the conventional Holocaust documentary to show how the Shoah comes and goes in the lives of Jewish survivors from Poland who gather for their 26th summer at a dwindling bungalow colony in the Catskills. What can Holocaust survival possibly mean but the awesome spectacle of life triumphing over annihilation by stubbornly reasserting itself, over and over again? (Ella Taylor)20091126
 'THE FOURTH KIND' (PG-13, 1:38) This supernatural thriller may be humorless, paranoid nonsense, but its biggest failure is its inability to scare. (Stephen Holden)20091126
 'GOOD HAIR' (PG-13, 1:35) Spirited, probing and frequently hilarious, Jeff Stilson's documentary follows the comedian Chris Rock as he investigates the complex, often troubled relationship between African-American women and their crowning glory. From beauty shops in America to a Hindu temple in India, the film coasts on the fearless charm of its frontman and the eye-opening candor of its interviewees. Digging gingerly into wounds both political and personal, Mr. Rock transforms a world of hurt into a medium for insightful and often uncomfortable observations on race and conformity. (Catsoulis)20091126
 'THE HURT LOCKER' (R, 2:10) In this tense, insightful film about a United States Army bomb-disposal squad in Iraq, Kathryn Bigelow has made a crackerjack action picture that is also a drama of character, psychology and ideas. Jeremy Renner, as a soldier who approaches danger with the conviction of an artist and the compulsiveness of an addict, is simply amazing, and the rest of the cast, notably Brian Geraghty and Anthony Mackie, is nearly as strong. (Scott)20091126
 'IRENE IN TIME' (PG-13, 1:34) A valentine to women and a letter bomb to men, Henry Jaglom's latest foray into supposedly female obsessions centers on Irene (Tanna Frederick), a loveless adult trapped in idolatrous memories of her long-gone, wastrel father. Smothering insightful moments in verbal and musical treacle (courtesy of Harriet Schock's sticky songs), Mr. Jaglom displays an endearing lack of cynicism but an equal lack of discipline. (Catsoulis)20091126
 'KILLING KASZTNER: THE JEW WHO DEALT WITH NAZIS' (No rating, 2:00) This thorough but overlong documentary explores the life and legacy of Rudolf Kastner, a Hungarian Jew who negotiated with Nazis to save more than 1,600 Jews on a rescue train from Budapest to Switzerland. (Holden)20091126
 'LA DANSE: THE PARIS OPERA BALLET' (No rating, 2:38, in English and French) Frederick Wiseman, master of the long-form, fly-on-the-wall documentary, watches dancers and choreographers, marketers and managers, and the result is a blissful immersion in the world of ballet, which feels by the end like the only world worth knowing. (Scott)20091126
 'LAW ABIDING CITIZEN' (R, 1:48) A grisly, pointless story of revenge, in which a regular guy (Gerard Butler) turns himself into a murderous superman after his wife and daughter are killed. Jamie Foxx is the prosecutor who tries to stop him but only succeeds in making him madder. (Scott)20091126
 'THE MAID' (No rating, 1:35, in Spanish) Catalina Saavedra plays the title character in this Chilean movie about a live-in maid whose constricted world begins to crack, allowing life and air to slip in through the fissures. Sebastian Silva directs, slyly. (Dargis)20091126
 'THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS' (R, 1:35) Grant Heslov directs George Clooney, Ewan McGregor and Jeff Bridges in a likable, lightweight comedy, based on the nonfiction book of the same title by Jon Ronson, about an Army unit's experiments in parapsychology. (Dargis)20091126
 'THE MESSENGER' (R, 1:45) Ben Foster and Woody Harrelson are Army officers with the grim task of informing the families of soldiers that their loved ones have died overseas. Samantha Morton plays a widow who takes the news with calm sorrow. The terrific performances complement Oren Moverman's sensitive, understated direction and the rich, observant script he wrote with Alessandro Camon. (Scott)20091126
 'MICHAEL JACKSON'S THIS IS IT' (PG, 1:51) Death returned Michael Jackson's humanity, and in a curious, tentative way, so, too, does this movie. A rushed and ragged monument to the man, his work and the commercial interests of those he left behind, it has been culled from more than 100 hours of rehearsal material shot in preparation for a concert tour that never was. (Dargis)20091126
 'THE MISSING PERSON' (No rating, 1:35) Blanketed by the ghosts of the twin towers, Noah Buschel's moody, modern-day noir follows an alcoholic detective (Michael Shannon) hired to tail a mysterious man (Frank Wood). Sluggish, stylized and peppered with oddball encounters, the movie is oddly irresistible; and if it fails to achieve its ambitions, no blame should go to Mr. Shannon, whose clenched, traumatized performance is a marvel. (Catsoulis)20091126
 'MY DEAR ENEMY' (No rating, 2:03, in Korean) In this artful, slightly absurdist romance, a young woman (Jeon Do-youn) drives her former boyfriend (Ha Jung-woo) around Seoul so that he can borrow enough to pay back the money he owes her. Along the way, she appears to learn more about him than she did while they were actually going out. (Hale)20091126
 'NEW YORK, I LOVE YOU' (R, 1:50) The feeling is not mutual. (Scott)20091126
 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY' (R, 1:39) Best seen at midnight with a crowd, this minimalist fright-fest, directed by Oren Peli, demonstrates the effectiveness of simple horror-movie techniques. (Scott)20091126
 'PIRATE RADIO' (R, 1:55) A fanciful fiction from Richard Curtis about rebel broadcasters (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, among others) who, in the mid-1960s, blasted British airwaves and eardrums with the Kinks and other youth-quaking greats of the era. (Dargis)20091126
 'PLANET 51' (PG, 1:31) Almost every element of this animated film about an American astronaut who lands on a distant planet populated by ''Shrek''-like little green men and women is borrowed from earlier movies, then tweaked (and invariably softened) to become a reference rather than a copy. (Holden)20091126
 'PRECIOUS: BASED ON THE NOVEL ''PUSH'' BY SAPPHIRE' (R, 1:49) This potent blend of naturalism and melodrama, directed by Lee Daniels, unites a cast that includes the pop stars Mariah Carey and Lenny Kravitz, the comedian Mo'Nique and a fearless newcomer named Gabourey Sidibe in the story of an abused Harlem teenager struggling for dignity and survival. Ms. Sidibe, in the title role, is the key to the film, and her steady, moving performance is a revelation. (Scott)20091126
 'RED CLIFF' (R, 2:28, in Mandarin) The seminal action director John Woo returns after a six-year layoff with this tale of warring kingdoms, set in the third century A.D., that reunites him with the marvelous Hong Kong actor Tony Leung. While handsome and intelligent and perfectly easy to sit through, it never really approaches the visceral tug of Mr. Woo's 1980s-'90s crime dramas. (Hale)20091126
 'A SERIOUS MAN' (R, 1:45) Old Testament mishigas from Joel and Ethan Coen, who retell the Book of Job as a suburban shaggy-dog story about a harmless physics professor (Michael Stuhlbarg) whose life comes unraveled. The usual Coen brothers' whimsy, with its edge of nihilism, takes on a surprising metaphysical resonance. You don't have to be Jewish to like this movie, but it will hurt more if you are. (Scott)20091126
 'STATEN ISLAND' (R, 1:36) A slight, appealing fable about a mobster, a septic-tank cleaner and a butcher, James DeMonaco's directorial debut combines Tarantinoesque violence and nonlinear narrative with an almost Gallic sentimentality. It benefits considerably from its performances, not least by the inestimable Seymour Cassel, and Mr. DeMonaco demonstrates a sure hand. (Andy Webster)20091126
 'THE SUN' (No rating, 1:50, in English and Japanese) A beautiful and eccentric act of historical imagination from the Russian director Alexander Sokurov about the emperor Hirohito during the period leading up to and following Japan's surrender to the United States in 1945. (Dargis)20091126
 '2012' (PG-13, 2:38) Roland Emmerich serves up Old Testament style destruction with a smile. (Dargis)20091126
 'UNCERTAINTY' (No rating, 1:45) A taut, skillful exercise in cinematic clockwork, with dialogue largely improvised by the actors, this movie splits into two parallel stories, one a family drama, the other a thriller, after an opening scene in which young lovers (Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Lynn Collins) meet on the Brooklyn Bridge on a Fourth of July morning. (Holden)20091126
 '(UNTITLED)' (No rating, 1:36) This acutely witty art-world satire carries off a tricky balancing act. It invites us to view its fictitious avant-garde musicians and artists as fraudulent buffoons. At the same time, it takes these visionary oddballs seriously enough to force you to examine your own reflexive skepticism. (Holden)20091126
 'WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE' (PG, 1:40) Spike Jonze directs this alternately perfect and imperfect if always beautiful live-action adaptation of the Maurice Sendak children's book about a solitary boy, Max (Max Records), liberated by his imagination. The film has been pitched to a distinctly older audience than the picture book's original readers, and some younger children might be scared by the snuffling, growling wild things (voiced by James Gandolfini, among others). (Dargis)20091126
 'WILLIAM KUNSTLER: DISTURBING THE UNIVERSE' (No rating, 1:25) A refresher course on the history of American left-wing politics in the 1960s and '70s, as well as an affectionate personal biography of the left-wing political lawyer, this documentary portrays him as a heroic crusader for justice, but is not entirely uncritical. (Holden)20091126
 'ZOMBIELAND' (R, 1:21) Ruben Fleischer directs this minor, overly self-amused, splatter-slicked diversion about a world overrun with the undead. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson trade quips and zombie-killing techniques. (Dargis)20091126

HEADLINE: Water on the Moon, Reality on Earth

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''The Wet Side of the Moon,'' by William S. Marshall (Op-Ed, Nov. 20), scared me. Mr. Marshall wonders if ''the problems that bedevil us on Earth limit our interest in other worlds.'' Of course they do. And should. 
 Accordingly, domestic problems (poverty, inequality) should limit our interest in international ones (two wars). 
 But the scary part is when he suggests that colonizing the Moon is actually an essential strategy for solving our problems here on Earth: ''Humanity needs more than one home because, with all our eggs in one basket, we are at risk of low-probability but high-consequence catastrophes like asteroid strikes, nuclear war or bioterrorism.'' 
 This cheap sci-fi movie strategy would be just plain silly if it didn't threaten to divert limited attention and resources away from serious efforts to deal with threats. Aron P. Goldman
 Springfield, Mass., Nov. 21, 2009
 The writer is executive director of the Springfield Institute, a think tank.
 To the Editor:
 The discovery of water on the Moon is indeed one of the greatest discoveries in human history. The possibilities for expansion of our heretofore single home base have just multiplied to a greater extent than when early hominids first jumped down from their tree perches and began a terrestrial expansion. 
 It is indeed shocking, but not at all surprising, that outside the scientific community this discovery has next to no interest to most people. The average American is apparently more interested in what foolish thing Sarah Palin will say or do next. 
 Americans no longer want to be informed; they just want to be entertained. The promise of the 1950s and early '60s has now ended in the reality that most Americans are not ''smarter than a fifth grader'' and don't really know, or care, about things of cosmic importance. I fear for our future.
 Michael Davis 
 Madison, Wis., Nov. 20, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 William S. Marshall gives a very lucid explanation as to why NASA found large quantities of water on the Moon at this time; however, his vision of ''creating a permanent lunar habitat'' is straight out of science fiction. 
 Maybe it is just a coincidence that NASA discovers water on the Moon at the same time that the Obama administration is reconsidering manned spaceflight, but the expense of such a venture appears irresponsible in our current economic climate. Larry Hoffner
 New York, Nov. 20, 2009
 To the Editor:
 As investigators who reported some of the first analyses of hydrogen on the Moon 38 years ago, we must respond. No one except William S. Marshall has claimed ''large quantities of water'' or ''plentiful lunar water'' with nearby ''metal ores.'' Instead, productive ores on Earth derive from processes not observed on the Moon, and Anthony Colaprete, the chief scientist of the recent lunar mission, described the target crater as ''probably a little wetter than the Atacama desert in Chile.'' It's as if Martians had targeted the right South African mine, observed a diamond and then proclaimed that ''diamonds are plentiful on Earth.'' John M. Hayes

 To the Editor:
 Re ''Satellite Found Water on Moon, Researchers Say'' (front page, Nov. 14):
 What is it about space discoveries that makes NASA scientists crow like overgrown boys? Water has been discovered on the Moon. Great! This probable legacy of billions of years of cosmic history is important. But a recent panel concluded that the Moon was a poor objective for the next human spaceflights. 
 And besides, even if the Moon holds water for the taking, why should we treat it as the coal companies have treated West Virginia? Our venerable neighbors in this universe deserve better. John Cloud

HEADLINE: For Athletes in Motion, Real Estate Can Be a Burden

BYLINE: By JANE McMANUS

 BODY:
Last season, the veteran fullback Tony Richardson came to the Jets as a free agent, but he remained tethered to Minnesota by real estate. As the house Richardson bought during his two seasons with the Vikings languished on the market, he began paying rent in New York. 
 Brett Favre also joined the Jets that season, coming in a trade from the Packers and soon he and Richardson were bonding over the headaches of trying to sell in a difficult real estate market. So when Favre became a Viking this season, he knew exactly where to go. 
 ''Now all of a sudden he comes out of retirement, he calls me and asks me, could he rent my place?'' Richardson said. ''And of course it's worked out. I think he's playing well enough now, hopefully he'll rent it out again next year.''
 Professional athletes have always been a transient band -- whether relocated through free agency or traded on a moment's notice to a new team in a new city. But now, given the decline in home values resulting from the recession and the high rates of unemployment, moving on has become that much more complicated. 
 ''The economic conditions affect us just like they affect everyone else and it's really tough, particularly when you have property that you're trying to sell,'' said defensive lineman Chris Canty, who came to the Giants this spring and still has a home in Dallas that he is trying to sell. Players who were often advised that real estate was a solid investment are now trying to figure out how to protect their investments and weather this market -- be it selling at a loss or renting to other players. The experience has changed the way some players view home ownership.
 ''I'll never buy again,'' said the veteran Nets guard Keyon Dooling, who rents the downtown Orlando condominium he bought in 2005 to a Magic player. ''That was a learning experience. I'll never buy again as far as where I'm playing. It's not a good idea because you can never predict how long you're going to be in a situation. You could be stuck with a piece of property that you never go to.''
 Dooling's teammate Courtney Lee, a rookie with the Magic last season, considered buying in the same condominium building before Dooling advised him against it. Good thing, since Lee is now with the Nets, where he rents on a month-to-month basis from the former Net Bostjan Nachbar, who is playing in Turkey.
 A word-of-mouth network has developed among players, and often an N.F.L. or an N.B.A. team representative will pass along news of possible rentals to incoming players. The N.H.L. players' association has a Web site that lists homes the league's players are trying to sell or rent. It adds a sense of confidence to rent to someone within the sports community. 
 Giants linebacker Danny Clark has rented his unsold mansion in Berkeley, Calif., where he played for the Raiders in 2004 and 2005, to other Raiders, and recently dropped the $4 million asking price by a million dollars.
 ''You know where he works,'' Clark said of renting to other players. ''You can't say you know he's going to have a job, but you know where he works. It's a fraternity. Word travels fast if you get messed over by somebody in your business.''
 Some players wind up back in the city they left, in the house they were trying to sell. It happened with the new Devils left wing Dean McAmmond, who left and later returned to Calgary. Jets kicker Jay Feely bought his Upper Saddle River, N.J., home as a Giant in 2005 then returned last season as a Jet. 
 Feely had previously purchased in Tampa, Fla., and Atlanta and said he sold for a profit each time. But his home in Upper Saddle River sat on the market while he played -- and bought again -- in Miami. After one season, Feely found himself back with the Jets.
 ''Walked in, took the For Sale sign down and moved right back in,'' Feely said with a laugh. ''Although last year I had no furniture. I didn't even have a kitchen table. I didn't know if I'd be back, so I didn't want to buy any furniture.''
 Feely rents his Miami home to a Dolphin.
 Jets linebacker Bart Scott is not interested in renting the Baltimore-area home he just put on the market for $650,000. Scott, who purchased the house for $850,000 in 2005 and put in about $300,000 worth of upgrades, including a home theater, said athletes had other concerns when it came to selling, such as a parade of curiosity-seekers.
 ''You have to guard against that because some people just want to see what's in your house,'' Scott said. ''A lot of people have no intention of buying.''
 Scott said his long-term contract allowed him to buy a similar home in New Jersey despite having another house. The highest-paid athletes can do that, but mid-tier players may have a greater percentage of their equity tied up in the market.
 Brian Rolston, a veteran left wing who came to the Devils in 2008 from Minnesota, said that financially he ''got killed'' in order to sell his house quickly when he left the Wild.
 ''We're obviously paid well but when you're hanging onto two mortgages, $600-$700,000, that's not an easy thing to keep up with,'' he said. ''We took a big hit on it, but we thought it was better to get out of it than hold onto it. There were guys on this team that got traded the year before and they were holding onto their house for three years.''
 The Jets player development coordinator Dave Szott said he told incoming players that unless they had a long-term contract they should rent.
 ''The last thing you want to worry about is mortgages and loans and cutting the grass,'' Szott said. ''Why create more stress?''

HEADLINE: Dubai's Move on Debt Rattles Markets Worldwide

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY and KATE GALBRAITH

 BODY:
Global financial markets swooned Thursday, with London seeing its most precipitous drop in nearly nine months, a day after Dubai stunned investors with the news that it was asking banks to allow its main investment vehicle, Dubai World, to suspend its debt repayments for six months.
 The announcement -- the global high finance equivalent of a homeowner asking the bank to allow six months of skipped mortgage payments, presumably because the homeowner was out of cash -- sowed fear of a contagion of instability that could roil markets that are only now recovering from the near cataclysm of the last year. 
 That possibility sent markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris spiraling downward, even as analysts struggled to explain which fears of contagion were legitimate and which were overwrought. 
 Some market experts noted, for instance, that while banks that have lent money to Dubai World could suffer significant losses if the company were to default on all or part of its $59 billion debt, worries about the sovereign debt of Middle Eastern countries swimming in oil reserves were unfounded. 
 ''This is another wave of the credit crunch,'' said Christopher Davidson, an expert in Gulf politics at Durham University in Britain. 
 ''Dubai was fairly much the worst example of overextension. It had the worst debt per capita in the world by far. I would like to put it down as a really enormous white elephant that doesn't have much in common with the regular economy of a regular state.''
 Still, in the mentality of the market, guilt by association can be a powerful force. Referring to the unexpected weakness at Dubai World, Mr. Davidson said, ''It will tarnish the reputation of the Gulf region a bit, and it will certainly make investors more bearish again about emerging markets.''
 Like many Western consumers during the good times, Dubai gorged on debt and borrowed too much to finance a building boom that has gone bust in the downturn. When credit markets froze last year, Dubai, like Iceland, found itself overextended. But Dubai, which has no oil, was backed by its Arab emirate neighbors. At least that is what investors had assumed. 
 The shocking announcement on Wednesday upended the assumption that Dubai would stand behind Dubai World and that other emirates, especially Abu Dhabi, would stand behind Dubai.
 On Thursday, the first full trading day in Europe since Dubai's announcement, the FTSE 100 index in London lost 3.18 percent, to close down 170.68 points. The DAX index in Germany fell 3.25 percent and the CAC-40 index in France lost 3.41 percent. In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average, was less affected, falling about 0.62 percent. Markets in the United States were closed for Thanksgiving.
 In separate moves that could portend longer-term instability, Standard & Poor's downgraded Dubai-based banks with heavy exposure to Dubai World, and the Saudi-backed Gulf International Bank postponed a bond auction that was scheduled to be priced this week.
 The cost of insuring Dubai's debt against default quadrupled Thursday.
 No one could be certain how destabilizing a default by Dubai World would be -- banks have not disclosed their exposure to Dubai World's debt. But concern in global markets ran high. The dollar fell below 85 yen. The dollar also fell against the Swiss franc, a traditional safe haven, until the Swiss National Bank intervened in the market to bolster the American currency.
 ''Investors have gone from getting cozy to a sense of serious concern,'' said Saud Masud, head of research at UBS in Dubai.
 Mr. Masud said negotiators would feel pressure to reach some kind of deal to present to the markets before trading in the region resumes next week after the Eid holiday, because otherwise markets there might fall precipitously too.
 Dubai, one of the seven members of the United Arab Emirates, said Wednesday that it intended to ask all lenders to Dubai World, the government's main investment vehicle, and Nakheel, the conglomerate's property development unit, to sign on to a so-called standstill agreement and extend repayment deadlines until at least the end of May.
 Foremost on the minds of bondholders was the $3.5 billion sukuk, or Islamic bond, that Dubai World had been expected to redeem in December, one of the largest such financial instruments ever issued. Islamic law prohibits the payment of interest.
 In Europe, banking stocks fell amid concern that the value of loans to the emirate would have to be written sharply lower. The financial sector declined about 3 percent over all. In London, HSBC Holdings fell 4.3 percent, Royal Bank of Scotland declined 4.2 percent and Barclays fell 3.9 percent. Deutsche Bank lost 4.2 percent in Frankfurt. ING Group fell 5.3 percent in Amsterdam.
 EADS, the maker of Airbus planes, which has counted Middle Eastern customers among its most resilient, also declined, as did the French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy, Daimler and BMW, all of which have substantial sales in the region.
 Shares of companies in which Gulf investors own big stakes, including the London Stock Exchange, the grocer J Sainsbury and the German carmaker Porsche, also fell sharply on concerns the holdings would be cut to meet obligations at home.
 Booming services and real estate sectors, a gleaming new airport and a pro-business climate had for years lured businesses, as well as prominent investors, including the soccer star David Beckham.
 The Dubai government's total debt is estimated at about $80 billion, of which, Mr. Masud estimated, about two-thirds is held by local investors.
 Real estate developments for which market values have tumbled have accounted for much of the company's problems, he said, though ''the biggest liabilities for these companies isn't just the stuff on the balance sheets. It's the cost of completing the half-finished projects on which the investors have bailed out.''
 The company did not respond to requests for comment.

HEADLINE: Man Charged in Hit-and-Run That Killed Couple Outside Staten Island Church

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM and KAREN ZRAICK

 BODY:
A Staten Island man with a history of traffic violations was charged on Thursday in a hit-and-run accident that killed an elderly couple, who were struck outside their church the night before as they walked to a Thanksgiving Mass with cans of food for the poor, the authorities said.
 The man, Allmir Lekperic, 26, turned himself in to the police early Thursday. He was charged with driving with a suspended license and leaving the scene of a fatal accident, which killed the couple, Peter and Lillian Sabados, on Staten Island, the police said. Mr. Lekperic was being held pending arraignment. 
 A family friend who picked up the phone at Mr. Lekperic's home on Staten Island declined to comment on the arrest. A profile posted under Mr. Lekperic's name on LinkedIn, an Internet networking site, lists his occupation as the owner of a home improvement company.
 Mr. Lekperic's driver's license had been suspended at least 29 times since 2006, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was in its early stages.
 The official said that Mr. Lekperic had also been stopped at least four times for not wearing his seatbelt, as well as for talking on his cellphone while driving, following another car too closely and driving without a license. 
 The authorities said they expected to charge a relative of Mr. Lekperic's with falsely reporting after the accident that Mr. Lekperic's van had been stolen. 
 Mr. Lekperic was driving about 7:15 on Wednesday night when his Ford Econoline van struck the Sabadoses as they crossed New Dorp Lane at Third Street to enter their church, Our Lady Queen of Peace, the police said. The van then sped off, the police said.
 The couple were longtime parishioners, said the Rev. Pancrose Kalist, the church's pastor. On Wednesday night, the church held its annual Thanksgiving Mass, to which parishioners bring canned goods for a food pantry. Worshipers had barely started to arrive when word of the accident emptied the pews.
 The Rev. Mario V. Ramirez, an assistant priest at the church, rushed to fetch holy oil, and he said that when he reached the scene, he found Mr. Sabados unconscious and his wife still moving. Father Ramirez said he administered the last rites, reciting, ''May the Lord save you and raise you up.''
 The couple were taken to Staten Island University Hospital, and Mr. Sabados, 78, was pronounced dead less than 45 minutes after the accident, the police said. Mrs. Sabados, 77, died early Thursday morning, the police said. 
 Father Kalist started Mass on Wednesday night with 10 Hail Mary's. ''We come together so joyfully on Thanksgiving,'' Father Kalist said. ''It really broke our heart.'' 
 For almost 40 years, the Sabadoses had lived in a well-kept two-story house a few miles from the church, neighbors said. The two shared a love for fine wine. Mr. Sabados, a retired pharmacist who had worked in New Jersey, was often seen tending to the plants and flowers on their front lawn. Mrs. Sabados had worked at a local college. They had two children, and their son, Peter, also became a pharmacist, the neighbors said. 
 ''You couldn't ask for better neighbors,'' said Guernsey Jewett, 69. His wife, Caroline, added, ''We're just going to miss them so very much.''

HEADLINE: Entertainment Commission Becomes Powerful Force in the City

BYLINE: By GERRY SHIH

 BODY:
Terrance Alan has worked in construction and owned strip joints, taught handicapped children and peddled low-budget gay pornographic movies, mostly starring Terrance Alan. 
 It was, Mr. Alan says wryly, an unconventional resume for a future power broker. But the 57-year-old Mr. Alan is now a member of San Francisco's Entertainment Commission, and the visible face of the city's increasingly powerful nightclub industry, whose political heft infuriates the police and local neighborhoods.
On Nov. 3, the Board of Supervisors voted 10 to 1 to give Mr. Alan's commission day-to-day control over the rowdy, popular clubs that, owners estimate, represent $1 billion of the city's $8 billion in annual tourist revenue.
 Thanks to Mr. Alan's pressure, the Entertainment Commission has succeeded in taking over many of the responsibilities for licensing and monitoring the city's 400 clubs. Now it decides which clubs can operate from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m., and it can shutter, temporarily, clubs linked to violence. 
 Indeed, Mr. Alan and his lobbying group, the San Francisco Late Night Coalition, claim credit for the existence of the commission, whose expanding powers come at the expense of another political force in the city -- the Police Department.
 Critics say Mr. Alan is the source and symbol of the club business's coming of age. If Harvey Milk is the Thomas Jefferson of gay politics in San Francisco, giving eloquent voice to a movement for self-respect and justice, Mr. Alan is an edgier figure, a punk, pierced version of the 1930s labor organizer Harry Bridges, his charisma tied to his sheer force of will and the economic power he represents. 
 In the late 1980s, when Mr. Alan was in his 30s, clubs were the home turf of the expanding gay culture in San Francisco. Many patrons and club owners remember police raids and the condoning of gay bashing that helped to ignite Mr. Milk's political movement. During that time, Mr. Alan attracted a following by hosting benefit parties for his partner, who was dying of AIDS. 
 During the ''nightclub wars'' of the 1990s, he was among the promoters and club owners who chafed at the way the Police Department issued permits -- not enough, club owners felt -- and cracked down on underground clubs -- too much, they said. 
 With his parties shut down and their patrons arrested, Mr. Alan sought help. At the time, Bevan Dufty, the supervisor whose district included the largely gay Castro neighborhood, was the city's director of neighborhood services by day and a party-hearty clubber at night. Mr. Alan came calling. ''He was sitting at my desk in '98, '99,'' Mr. Dufty said, ''I was one of the first people to tell him, 'Look, this is how you go from being an outsider of the system to get to the inside.' ''
 In 1999, Mr. Alan formed the Late Nite Coalition to push for a new city commission that would control permitting. The rallies he held attracted a freshly elected supervisor named Mark Leno. Like Mr. Dufty, Mr. Leno was an enthusiastic clubgoer and, in his current capacity as a state senator, he remains a bulldog for entertainment interests. 
 Mr. Leno said, ''As someone who has always appreciated the vibrancy of San Francisco's night life, I felt this natural gravitation'' to the rallies.
 In 2000, a civil grand jury recommended that the police be relieved of permitting powers.
 Then, in 2002, Supervisor Leno pushed through the board a bill that created the seven-member entertainment commission and gave it the permitting powers formerly held by the Police Department. Members were appointed by the mayor and the board.
 In 2008, James I. Dudley, a police commander whose former district included most of the clubs, saw the new draft legislation sought by club owners as seeking even more power at police expense. 
 ''I was horrified,'' Mr. Dudley said. ''The first piece took out a lot of our controls for limiting applicants with criminal backgrounds. It opened things up to all entertainment, all hours, 24-7.'' The police were given emergency, not supervisory, authority.
 Club supporters pushed back. Give veteran industry insiders regulatory teeth, they said, and they would make bad operators toe the line more effectively.
 Over all, that view prevailed with the board.
 Part of the impetus for the recent change was the appearance of new, more violent club patrons. What had been raucous dance venues in the 1990s were attracting patrons from the blue-collar suburbs and tourists. All were looking for action; a few had guns. According to newspaper reports, there have been more than a dozen shootings and several stabbings near clubs in the past two years.
 Neighborhood groups were furious at the board's decision on permitting powers. ''The commission has never done anything in the neighborhood's interest,'' said Tom Ferriole, who leads a Nob Hill opposition group. ''It just hands out more permits.'' 
 Mr. Alan's muscle is being viewed warily by many who wonder how the commission will use its new power. Asked who gets the credit for the victory at the Board of Supervisors, Jim Meko, a neighborhood representative on the commission said: ''It's the Late Night Coalition. Terrance Alan is the one who pulls all the strings.'' 
 Mr. Alan bristles at the suggestion that he is a political puppet master. The criticism, he said, conjures a ''script out of Al Capone days with power, money and bribery.'' 
 But, he added, ''if I have a magic wand, then why don't we have last call at 4 a.m.?'' 
 The commission's new powers, in theory, give club owners the lucrative right to stay open longer -- and make it easier to close clubs. ''If we call a club owner in with this new power, trust me, they'll fall in line,'' Mr. Alan said in a long interview on the afternoon he lobbied in City Hall. 
 Mr. Alan's work is also visible in other arenas. He helps organize Lovefest, the Gay Pride Parade and the Folsom Street Fair. 
 That impresario role, combined with his political heft and his roguish appearance -- a row of piercings along the right eyebrow, a shock of red hair, a goatee -- gives him an aura of mystery.
 Exasperated members of community groups believe there are sinister strands to the story of the clubs' political ascent. Indeed, efforts to find conflicts of interest-- like a 5,000-word article on the business connections among club owners published by SF Weekly last summer -- have underlined the dual role of three commissioners who own clubs.
 SF Weekly first reported that the Late Night Coalition had given almost $50,000 to political campaigns since 2000. City records examined by The New York Times show the largesse spread widely; of current elected officials, Supervisor Chris Daly has received the most: $1,500 through recent election cycles. 
 Mr. Alan, in an interview this week, said that city records were incomplete, and that the recipient of most of his largess -- as much as $3,200 per election cycle -- was Senator Leno.
 Mr. Alan also said he was working with Mr. Leno to curb the power that the California Alcoholic Beverage Control agency has to close the city's clubs. He anticipates legislation sponsored by Mr. Leno to create a ''citizen's oversight group'' over the A.B.C. to rein in the regulators.
 ''Things are in motion,'' he said. ''The governor's race gives us the chance to grab some of the candidates' attention.'' 
 Still, he said: ''I have a perfectly clear conscience when it comes to what I do at City Hall. People overestimate my influence.''

HEADLINE: Hoteliers See Big Growth Ahead in Asia

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
The global hotel business is in a deep funk, but that has not kept the industry from betting on Asia, the one region of the world where growth is strong.
 In October, two major upscale hotels opened in Hong Kong, each with views of the skyscrapers huddled between the city's mountains and harbor. One is a 381-room Hyatt Regency, on top of a shopping mall in the Kowloon district. 
 The other is the 117-room Upper House, owned by the Hong Kong conglomerate Swire and within walking distance of the central business district on Hong Kong Island. A 300-room Ritz-Carlton is among the hotels due to open here next year. 
 Many of these projects began before the downturn hit the travel industry, but even in the midst of the gloom, hotel companies big and small are pressing ahead with expansion plans in Asia.
 But the slowdown that has caused a drop in occupancy worldwide has also struck Asia. For the entire Asia-Pacific region, hotel revenue is down 28.4 percent, echoing the situation in Europe, as businesses and tourists cut back on overnight stays and events, forcing operators to offer deep discounts. 
 Although some hotel companies say occupancy rates have started to pick up, room rates remain under intense pressure. And many economists say they believe the global economy is not yet out of the woods, given that United States consumer spending -- the driving force for much of Asia's growth -- will take years to return to normal. 
 ''Europe and the United States are still in a total mess, and Asia is not immune to what's going on there,'' Albert Edwards, head of global strategy at Societe Generale, said this month at a media briefing in Hong Kong.
 Still, hotel managers stand by their belief that Asia is the place to be.
 ''We're growing more rapidly here than in any other region of the world,'' said Michael Issenberg, who heads Accor's Asia-Pacific business. Accor, the French hotel giant that runs the Novotel, Mercure and Sofitel brands, is opening 54 hotels, with about 10,000 rooms, in Asia this year and about as many again in 2010. In India alone, Accor plans to have 50 hotels, with more than 10,000 rooms, by 2012, up from five hotels now.
 ''The growth opportunities in Asia-Pacific are unsurpassed perhaps anywhere in the world,'' said Frits van Paasschen, chief executive of Starwood, whose brands include Sheraton and Le Meridien and which just opened its 150th hotel in the region.
 Smaller local hotel operators are also joining the rush. Amari, a Thai hotel management company with 11 properties and 3,000 rooms, announced plans last month to add 40 hotels by 2018. Also last month, the Park Hotel Group, which is based in Singapore and runs eight large hotels, announced that it planned to open as many as 12 in the next three to five years.
 Not all projects have gone as planned. In Beijing, a 34-story building under construction and designed by the architect Rem Koolhaaswas ravaged by a blaze in February, ignited by an illegal fireworks show. The building was to be completed in May and house a Mandarin Oriental hotel. 
 Occupancy at the Beijing Marriott, which opened just before the 2008 Olympics and was booked solid, fell to about 20 percent this year, according to the China Daily, a state-run newspaper. Marriott would not comment on individual hotel statistics.
 A number of hotels opened in Beijing and Shanghai for the Olympics last year and for the 2010 World Expo set for next year, adding a lot of supply at a time of generally low demand.
 Revenue per available room, a key measure of hotel performance, plunged 56 percent in Beijing in the first eight months of this year, according to a recent report by the Deloitte consulting firm. In Shanghai, the figure was down 35 percent as many hotels stood half-empty.
 But many operators see growth opportunities, particularly in developing regions.
 ''Look at the statistics: The United States currently has 4.9 million hotel rooms catering to a population of 300 million. Europe has about 5.3 million rooms. China, with its population of 1.3 billion, has only 1.7 million, and India barely has 120,000. There's a lot of runway left in these countries,'' said Paul Foskey, who is based in Hong Kong and heads Marriott International's Asia business.
 Marriott has 72 hotels, with 19,000 rooms, in its Asia pipeline, adding to the 113 hotels it operates in the region now.
 Ian Wilson, general manager for Asia at Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, another international hotel company, said that in 10 years China was expected to have a middle class of 400 million people. ''That, and a growth rate of 6 percent-plus this year -- if you got that in the West, everyone would be high-fiving each other,'' he said.
 India, with its large population, has enormous potential. But it, too, has its drawbacks as infrastructure there remains poor, and industry executives complain about the dozens of permits and time needed to set up a hotel.
 Indonesia, by contrast, is a bright spot because expanding low-fare air travel makes the island of Bali easier to reach.
 Within China, too, the picture is varied. ''China is not a country. China is a continent,'' Martin Rinck, Asia-Pacific chief at Hilton Worldwide, said by telephone from Singapore. 
 Cities in China's interior have mostly been resilient, as those areas depend less on international travel.
 ''Domestic destinations are doing very well,'' Mr. Rinck said. ''Cities like Hefei and the resort of Sanya -- here, it's more than 80 percent Chinese clients, and they have not stopped coming. Demand here is still increasing.''
 International hotel operators are also positioning themselves for an expected huge increase in the number of Chinese traveling abroad.
 ''It's key to have an on-the-ground presence here,'' said Mr. Wilson of Fairmont, ''to establish oneself as a brand that domestic travelers will come to as and when they travel abroad, which they surely will do so more and more in future.''

HEADLINE: As State Nears Its Last Dollar, Albany Is Idling

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
New York State is running out of cash.
 Without a budget deal, New York will be left with just $36 million in the bank by the end of December, according to current projections. And the money will last that long, officials say, only if the state chooses to fully exhaust its emergency reserves by tapping several billion dollars' worth of temporary loans from its rainy-day fund and short-term investments. 
 For weeks, Gov. David A. Paterson has invoked the shrinking amount of available cash in an effort to provoke the Legislature to deal with the state's $3.2 billion budget deficit. So far, the specter of such dire fiscal outcomes has been greeted with what amount to legislative shrugs, chiefly in the recalcitrant State Senate. 
 The stalemate in Albany is familiar, of course, and there are many lawmakers and experts who predict that the Legislature will act at the 11th hour, as it has before, to avoid the worst damage.
 But with no end in sight to the negotiations, state officials are beginning to reckon with what could be an unprecedented cash crisis. And many say that even if the current deficit is closed, the state is at considerable risk going forward -- less able, for instance, to borrow money because of worsening credit ratings and ill prepared for far more severe deficits ahead.
 New York, which has a roughly $130 billion budget, the second-largest behind California, is certainly not suffering alone. The 50 states have faced cumulative deficits of more than $250 billion over their last two budget cycles, according to data compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. In New York, the weight of the recession has been coupled with the struggles of Wall Street, the state's main financial engine.
 But New York is by no means California, which has become the national measuring stick of statewide financial ruin. The state is not sending out i.o.u.'s to creditors, students at state schools are not holding sit-ins in dormitories, and Albany, unlike Sacramento, has not had to grapple with relocating a tent city for the homeless. Further, revenue typically picks up in January, when Wall Street bonuses, however diminished from previous levels, start coming in. 
 But the situation in New York is not good, either. 
 In modern times, the state's general fund has never had a negative balance, according to the state comptroller's office. If New York does in fact run out of cash, it will have to delay paying some of its biggest bills. Chief among the bills the state will face in December are $1.6 billion in aid the state is supposed to pay school districts, $2.5 billion in property tax relief to individual homeowners, and $500 million in general aid meant to go to local governments.
 ''If you put any of that off, at some point people are not getting the money they are expecting,'' said the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, a Democrat. ''That could affect local governments, school districts, nonprofits, hospitals.''
 The governor and his staff have raised the threat of layoffs and furloughs if the impasse drags on, and there is the potential for a partial shutdown of some government services.
 ''Unless we act, New York will run out of money, even after we delay payments to schools and local governments,'' the governor said Tuesday in a brief address via Web cast. ''This is an unprecedented fiscal emergency.''
 The state's credit rating is below average and at some risk of a further downgrade. The Paterson administration has already squeezed the budgets of state agencies, an action it can take unilaterally. And this year's skirmish is considered a prelude to a fierce budget fight in 2010, when the deficit is far larger in what is an election year for the entire Legislature. 
 There have already been any number of ways that the strain on the budget has been felt across the state. Billions of dollars worth of scheduled increases in school aid, enacted by Gov. Eliot Spitzer to settle a long-running lawsuit over the distribution of school aid, will be stretched out over seven years instead of four. Taxes on the wealthy have been raised, and fees of all kinds have been increased.
 For the first time in decades, the state Police Academy probably will not have a new class for either the fall or the spring. The state has closed three upstate minimum-security prison camps and six facilities operated by the Office of Children and Family Services. Hours have been limited and facilities closed at parks including Jones Beach, and parks across the state are mowing fewer lawns to save money. The state ice rink was closed last winter. 
 Budget watchdogs say far steeper cuts are needed to reckon with deficits that will escalate sharply in 2011 as federal stimulus money runs out and the new wealth tax expires. 
 But negotiations have been fundamentally stalled -- and even irrational at times. Senate Democrats, who have thus far refused to hold a vote to legalize same-sex marriage, have nonetheless floated the theory in negotiations that the state could expect to take in more than $50 million a year in new revenue from the legalization of same-sex marriage, from a combination of marriage license and tourism revenue. 
 They are also proposing to raid the treasuries of public authorities, to force Native American tribes to collect cigarette taxes, and to restructure the state's tobacco bonds. 
 And Mr. Paterson remains politically weak, with a dismal standing in the polls and an inability to provide forceful leadership, critics say. 
 The impasse involves a fundamental disagreement. The Paterson administration argues that the state must begin to reckon with severe future deficits, and this view appears to have the support of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. Senators prefer to take temporary measures and push off the day of reckoning as long as possible. 
 Budget experts are paying close attention. They say how the deficit is closed is as important as closing it. Not only will the negotiations affect the state's enormous future deficits -- out-year gaps, in budget parlance -- but bond rating agencies are scrutinizing the process. 
 ''The next three months will be critical to the state's credit rating,'' Moody's Investor Service said last week, in an analytical note that rattled the capital. 
 ''The announcement of out-year gaps is not in and of itself an issue,'' Emily Raimes, an analyst at Moody's, said in an interview. ''What we look at is how they solve them. If they solve them with one-time measures, that's going to increase the gaps in future years, and at some point they get so large it becomes difficult to solve them.''

 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THOMAS CHAMBERS (1808-1869): AMERICAN MARINE AND LANDSCAPE PAINTER,' through March 7. With this extraordinary show, a star is born, or rediscovered, or at least given a big museum survey for the first time since 1942. Chambers painted typical 19th-century fare -- Hudson River landscapes and marine views of ships, harbors and naval battles -- in an entrancing, slightly demonic style that was neither strictly realist nor naive. His paintings are like chorus lines singing and dancing their hearts out, ever so slightly off key and out of step. They amplify the understanding of the visual appetite by satisfying it so thoroughly. Chambers may have been the first American artist to have grasped -- as Cezanne and Seurat would -- the implicitly geometric nature of reality. It makes sense that even in 1942 he was called ''America's first modern.'' 45 West 53rd Street, Manhattan , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20091126 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: PATRICIA CRONIN: 'HARRIET HOSMER, LOST AND FOUND,' through Jan. 24. The contemporary New York artist Patricia Cronin channels the life and art of the 19th-century American sculptor Harriet Hosmer (1830-1908) in a show of watercolor depictions of Hosmer's works, both those that survived and those no longer traceable. Ms. Cronin has also published the watercolors -- including her ghost images of missing works -- in a scholarly book that stands as a Hosmer catalogue raisonne. The result is a complex package: a total work of art that is a historical document of the careers of two artists and a homage by one woman to another. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org.

 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'REFLECTIONS ON THE ELECTRIC MIRROR: NEW FEMINIST VIDEO,' through Jan. 10. Q: What is feminist video? A: A good way to reduce overcrowding in museums. Unless, that is, you are referring to this entertaining exhibition of recent videos by nine artists featuring the creators themselves as performers. Works by Klara Liden, Kate Gilmore, Cathy Begien and the team of Harry Dodge and Stanya Kahn are variously funny, dark and poetic. Starring in antique-looking, silent-movie-style commercials, Shannon Plumb is a wonderfully agile physical comedian. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20091126
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'WHO SHOT ROCK & ROLL: A PHOTOGRAPHIC HISTORY, 1955 TO THE PRESENT,' through Jan. 31. This entertaining exhibition presents more than 175 images of rock stars by 105 photographers. It includes album cover art, candid snapshots, publicity portraits and pictures of live performances. The downside is that only a few photographs rise to the level of fine art, and the general focus is on only the most famous and familiar musicians, from Elvis Presley to Kurt Cobain. There are some nice surprises, though, like a small Polaroid of Courtney Love on which she wrote a rude salutation. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091126
 FRICK COLLECTION: 'WATTEAU TO DEGAS: FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM THE FRITS LUGT COLLECTION,' through Jan. 10. Ranging from Watteau and Fragonard to Ingres and Degas, 64 works from a celebrated Parisian repository offer a gratifying immersion in 18th- and 19th-century French draftsmanship. For urbanity, vivacity and technical merit, these artists remain in a league of their own. 1 East 70th Street, at Fifth Avenue , (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)20091126
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'KANDINSKY,' through Jan. 13. The Guggenheim is not exactly thinking outside the spiral with this sleek retrospective, but then the pioneering abstractionist Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944) is more than just its foundational artist. He is the angel in the architecture. His swirling, unanchored abstractions are implicit in Frank Lloyd Wright's great circling rotunda, and now they fill it, bottom to top -- a sensational sight that is as much Kandinsky-Wright reunion as retrospective. One of the fullest, clearest views of Kandinsky's achievement in decades, it certainly unmoors the conventional wisdom of precipitous decline after 1921, if not 1914. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)20091126
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'ANISH KAPOOR,' through March 28. This exhibition by the celebrated British sculptor consists of just one work, but it's a doozy. Viewable only from three partial perspectives, ''Memory'' is an enormous, egg-shaped volume of Cor-Ten steel, wedged into a boxy side gallery like a dirigible that drifted off course and got stuck. One approach offers only a square window allowing you to behold the impenetrable, seemingly infinite darkness inside. Call it a womb with a view. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)20091126
 JAPAN SOCIETY: 'SERIZAWA: MASTER OF JAPANESE TEXTILE DESIGN,' through Jan. 17. Serizawa Keisuke (1895-1984), one of the most prominent Japanese artisans of the 20th century, transformed paper and fabric with intricate, hand-cut stencils. His art updated, and some might say elevated, centuries-old crafts with allusions to Korean folk art, Chinese calligraphy, Aesop's Fables, Indian miniatures and Western midcentury Modernism. This handsomely installed show includes an early artist's-book adaptation of ''Don Quixote,'' as well as curtains, screens and kimonos from Serizawa's mature and productive postwar years. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan , (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20091126
 JEWISH MUSEUM: 'ALIAS MAN RAY: THE ART OF REINVENTION,' through March 14. This show, a traditional retrospective with an irresistible biographical hook, gives roots to an artist who preferred to be seen as rootless. Born Emmanuel Radnitzky to Jewish emigres from Russia, Man Ray reinvented himself as one of the luminaries of the interwar avant-garde. Yet his garment-industry background had a material hold on him, visible in references to mannequins, coat hangers and patterns. More than 200 works, including paintings, photographs, films, assemblages and his signature ''rayographs,'' link Man Ray's frequent shifts between mediums to a more profound condition of restlessness. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20091126
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'AMERICAN STORIES: PAINTINGS OF EVERYDAY LIFE, 1765-1915,' through Jan. 24. This exhibition of 103 figurative paintings and portraits that the museum justifiably calls ''iconic'' spans the Colonial period to World War I, touching on issues like the settling of the West and the Civil War and its legacy. Many of the works are masterpieces by artists like John Singleton Copley, George Caleb Bingham, William Sidney Mount, Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, Mary Cassatt and George Bellows that will in all likelihood not be gathered together anytime soon. Others are little-known gems of genre painting; many more are less gemlike genre works full of plots, props and stilted emotions. The result is refreshingly evenhanded. Art historical viewpoints previously too often considered mutually exclusive -- pro-narrative versus pro-form -- are synthesized. The paintings benefit tremendously from the mix, as will your understanding of American art and history. A thrilling, illuminating show. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20091126
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART OF THE SAMURAI: JAPANESE ARMS AND ARMOR, 1156-1868,' through Jan. 10. This sumptuous exhibition alternates between extraordinarily gorgeous, intricately wrought suits of armor that count as some of the world's greatest works of multimedia art and an unprecedented gathering of some 60 bare sword blades whose Minimalist subtleties of line, proportion and surface form a show within a show. In between are amazing helmets; ornate sword mountings and fittings; scroll paintings of samurai dressed to kill; and the colorful surcoats they traditionally wore over their armor. Nearly all of the 200-plus works come from Japan's museums; about half have been designated National Treasures or Important Cultural Properties by the Japanese government. Because of their extreme fragility, not all objects will be on view at once: about 60 pieces will be replaced by similar objects of equal caliber during the first week in December. Visit early and often. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20091126
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LOOKING IN: ROBERT FRANK'S ''THE AMERICANS,''' through Jan. 3. In the mid-1950s the Swiss-born photographer Robert Frank made three long car trips from New York City across the United States, through the Deep South to California, and back again by a northern route, taking thousands of pictures as he went. He needed a year to develop, print and edit them down to the 83 that made up his classic book, ''The Americans,'' which was panned for its pessimism in his day, and sanctified for its political prescience since. The Met show, and the huge book that accompany it, are basically monuments to that monument. If ''The Americans'' looks more formulaic in its sentiments than it did 50 years, that is because it has had so many imitators and the country it captured has changed. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20091126
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2010. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20091126
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'YOUNG ARCHER,' continuing. Is it or is it not? ''Young Archer,'' a life-size marble carving of a naked boy drawing an arrow from his lion's paw quiver might be the earliest known sculpture by Michelangelo. Scholars disagree. On a 10-year loan from France, the legless, armless boy with a yearning expression is in the Met's bright and airy Velez Blanco Patio, where viewers may decide for themselves if it is the real thing. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091126
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'CINNABAR: THE CHINESE ART OF CARVED LACQUER,' through Feb. 21. The exhibition's approximately 50 carved lacquer dishes, platters, boxes, vases and other domestic objects -- including a spectacular folding screen -- are as engrossing for their formal beauty as for their amazing craftsmanship. The pigment cinnabar gives them a rich, dark red color, and intricate patterns, ornamental animals and pastoral vignettes carved and incised into their lustrous surfaces make every object a pleasure to behold. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091126
 MONTCLAIR ART MUSEUM: 'CEZANNE AND AMERICAN MODERNISM,' through Jan. 3. Including early works by Dove, Hartley, Gorky and more than 25 others, this fascinating show explores the art history-changing influence of Cezanne on American artists between 1907 and 1930. Nothing by the American artists looks as good as any of the 18 Cezannes on view, but the exhibition and its hefty, richly informative catalog are revelatory. 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, N.J. , (973) 746-5555, montclairartmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091126
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ROCOCO AND REVOLUTION: EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY FRENCH DRAWINGS,' through Jan. 3. The art of drawing does not get much better than this. The nearly 80 works selected from the Morgan's own collection include excellent pieces by most of the era's best-known artists, from the Rococoists Watteau and Fragonard to Neo-Classicists like Jacques-Louis David and Etienne Louis Boullee. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Johnson)20091126
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'WILLIAM BLAKE'S WORLD: ''A NEW HEAVEN IS BEGUN,'' ' through Jan. 3. Artist, poet and irritated ecstatic, William Blake listed as his primary residence the Imagination, a combination of creative command post and psychological refuge where, as he put it, the eternal and the real meet. You'll see a good amount of both in this show, drawn from the Morgan's deep holdings of Blake's hand-printed-and-painted books and from the entire series of 21 watercolor illustrations he made for ''The Book of Job.'' 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)20091126
 EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'NEXUS NEW YORK: LATIN/AMERICAN ARTISTS IN THE MODERN METROPOLIS,' through Feb. 28. A bright light at the top of Museum Mile, the city's premier Latino art center has reopened after a makeover with a dense, episodic and absorbing visual history of the Latino art presence in New York in the first half of the 20th century. As much an archival display as a standard art show, it focuses on luminous, culture-changing personalities, from the Mexican-born art impresario Marius de Zayas, who teamed up with Alfred Stieglitz to bring the first Picasso show to New York; to Joaquin Torres-Garcia, a Uruguayan who arrived here in 1920 and saw proto-Pop Art everywhere; to the Chilean Roberto Matta, who served as a dynamic agent for Old World Surrealism in the New World. In addition, El Museo now has its first permanent-collection gallery, with an installation, ''Voces y Visiones,'' that reaffirms historical connections to the nearby East Harlem neighborhood. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem , (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)20091126
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'COMPASS IN HAND: SELECTIONS FROM THE JUDITH ROTHSCHILD FOUNDATION CONTEMPORARY DRAWINGS COLLECTION,' through Jan. 4. The Modern's largest gift of drawings -- a windfall of 2,500 works by 650 artists -- started out as a kind of stunt and matured without becoming a triumph. Initially a yearlong shopping binge in pursuit of a ''cross section'' of drawing at a certain moment, it also tried to fill decades-old gaps in the Modern's drawing collection, often with works by familiar names. These dominate the sampling of the gift: a lackluster exhibition of 354 works by 177 artists that emphasizes the Modern's ambivalence about moving beyond the Minimalism/Post-Minimalist canon, and its tendency to pick big or hot names over truly great drawings. The bottom line? Connoisseurship matters. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20091126
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'TIM BURTON,' through April 26. Given the tremendous visual appeal of Mr. Burton's movies, you would expect that this expansive retrospective of his nonmoving art would be equally exciting. Alas, it is a let-down. Focused mainly on hundreds of Victorian-Gothic-Expressionist cartoons dating from his teenage years to the present and including paintings, sculptures, photographs and a smattering of short films on flat screens, it is an entertaining show, but there is a sameness to all Mr. Burton's two- and three-dimensional output that makes for a monotonous viewing experience. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)20091126
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MONET'S WATER LILIES,' through April 12. Devotees of late Monet can rejoice. The Museum of Modern Art has hung its three ''Water Lilies'' together for the first time since 2001, along with a relatively recent acquisition and two guests. That's six waterlily paintings, all completed in the last dozen years before the artist's death in 1926. In addition, these canvases are isolated from the onward march of Modernism according to MoMA, and their separateness emphasizes their meditative, immersive quality. But it also confirms their radical achievement. While bringing Monet's Impressionism to a grand conclusion, they also open the path to Abstract Expressionism. It can still stop you in your tracks. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20091126
 NEUE GALERIE: 'FROM KLIMT TO KLEE: MASTERWORKS FROM THE SERGE SABARSKY COLLECTION,' through Feb. 15. Serge Sabarsky, the art dealer and collector who founded the Neue Galerie with Ronald S. Lauder, never lived to see its 2001 opening. Most visitors to the museum know Mr. Sabarsky (1912-96) primarily through some of the Klimts and Schieles that rotate through the galleries and from the popular first-floor cafe that bears his name. They'll be better acquainted with him after a visit to this exhibition, the first at the Neue Galerie to focus exclusively on Mr. Sabarsky's acquisitions. The high point, for many viewers, will be the small second-floor room of drawings by Klimt, Schiele, Alfred Kubin and Oskar Kokoschka. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)20091126
 NEW MUSEUM: 'URS FISCHER: MARGUERITE DE PONTY,' through Feb. 7. Naming his first American museum show after a fictional character from Mallarme, the young Swiss sculptor Urs Fischer spreads himself thin, but brilliantly. Admirers of his gaping holes in walls may be disappointed by the sparseness, quiet and subtlety, but for the most part -- despite too much Surrealism 101 -- Mr. Fischer's neo-Dada formalism wins out. Nose-thumbing irreverence colludes with Minimalist space, scale and perception. Take this three-floor show from the top and watch worlds collide: abstraction, found objects and trompe l'oeil; the actual-size, the large and the enlarged; images, reflections and volumes. Each floor is a kind of implosion, although it only becomes obvious on the lowest. The perpetual twilight in the middle may be the most memorable moment. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)20091126
 NOGUCHI MUSEUM: 'NOGUCHI REINSTALLED,' through Oct. 24, 2010. In anticipation of the museum's 25th anniversary in 2010, this show presents about 200 of Isamu Noguchi's works from the 1920s to the 1980s. They include sculptures in stone, wood, metal and clay; maquettes and models for parks and playgrounds; and props for Martha Graham dance productions. Though unfailingly suave, Noguchi's polished abstraction no longer has the urgency it once had, but the museum as a whole is a wonderful time capsule, and the sculpture garden he designed is utterly blissful. Noguchi Museum, 9-01 33rd Road, at Vernon Boulevard, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 204-7088, noguchi.org. (Johnson)20091126
 THE ONASSIS CULTURAL CENTER: 'THE ORIGINS OF EL GRECO: ICON PAINTING IN VENETIAN CRETE,' through Feb. 27. With its ensemble of some 40 religious images, including 6 by Domenikos Theotokopoulos, better known as El Greco, this glowing show is essentially a triple-layered visual essay. It roughs out the complex texture of a specific, cosmopolitan, East-meets-West island culture. It tells the story of a great artist who emerged from that culture, lived outside it and lastingly belonged to it. And it begins to suggest the variety and charisma of icons as a genre: spiritually instrumental objects that lie outside and beyond ordinary definitions of art. 645 Fifth Avenue, near 52nd Street , (212) 486-4448, onassisusa.org. (Cotter)20091126
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through March 1. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20091126
 RUBIN MUSEUM OF ART: 'VICTORIOUS ONES: JAIN IMAGES OF PERFECTION,' through Feb. 15. Although Mohandas Gandhi learned from Jainism, an Indian religion that takes nonviolence as its first principle, in the West we still know little about it or its art. But now there are two exquisite shows of Jain art in the city. The smaller, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art through March 28, is made up mostly of tiny, jewel-like manuscript paintings depicting the lives of savior-heroes called jinas. The Rubin Museum has, in addition to large-scale paintings, three dozen splendid sculptures of the same figures. Together the exhibitions give an in-depth view of a great art tradition and a complex faith. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea , (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)20091126
 SCANDINAVIA HOUSE: CARL FREDRIK HILL: 'SWEDISH VISIONARY AND MODERNIST,' through Jan. 9. This exhibition of 75 drawings from the Malmo Art Museum in Malmo, Sweden, is the first American solo show devoted to Carl Fredrik Hill (1849-1911). Hill began his astounding career as a promising Impressionist and, after a nervous breakdown from which he never recovered, spent the last 30 years drawing incessantly while living in the care of his family in Lund, Sweden. As this exhibition attests, Hill worked in charcoal, ink and colored chalks in styles that presage Symbolism, Expressionism and Surrealism, not to mention cartooning. The best works are small, dense and dark and extend northern Europe's visionary landscape tradition. Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, at 38th Street , (212) 879-9779, scandinaviahouse.org. (Smith)20091126
 SMITHSONIAN NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'A SONG FOR THE HORSE NATION,' through July 7. Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing and beaded bags and much more, this exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history: the hundred-year period during which horses were central to the lives of the Plains Indians. A highly efficient form of transportation, horses enabled Navaho, Crow, Comanchee, Pawnee and others to expand their territories and flourish more than they otherwise would have. It also enabled them to make war more effectively, though ultimately not effectively enough. George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan , (212) 514-3700, americanindian.si.edu. (Johnson)20091126
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'GEORGIA O'KEEFFE: ABSTRACTION,' through Jan. 17. The focus of this surprisingly surprising show is the first two decades of O'Keeffe's long career, beginning in 1915 when she made her first abstract drawings, which were also among the first fully abstract images by any American artist, and continuing into the 1930s, when she was spending increasing amounts of time alone in New Mexico. In between comes a body of bold, graphically punchy and sensuous painting that you tend to experience whole and fast, as you do a strong scent or a touch. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)20091126
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART : 'RONI HORN A K A RONI HORN,' through Jan. 24. Two floors is one floor too many for this late-phase Post-Minimalist. She is best represented here by some exquisite cast-glass sculptures, photographs of Iceland's extraordinary topography and several large drawings that combine aspects of carving, cartography and quilting. The catalog is even more elaborately stage-managed; the main take-away from the combination is that Ms. Horn's ostensibly androgynous (but actually butch) persona is her most engaging creation and that self-portraiture and language are her truest modes of expression. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20091126
 YALE CENTER FOR BRITISH ART: 'MRS. DELANY AND HER CIRCLE,' through Jan. 3. This fascinating show celebrates the contributions of the exemplary 18th-century Englishwoman Mary Delany to botany, the decorative arts and English court society. A widow twice over with no children, Mrs. Delany thrived in middle and old age as a naturalist, amateur artist and close friend to Handel, Jonathan Swift and the Duchess of Portland, among others. The exhibition includes her drawings, silhouettes and floral embroidery, and a selection from the ''Flora Delanica'': a series of some 1,000 botanical collages, begun when she was 72. 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven, Conn. , (203) 432-2800, yale.edu/ycba. (Rosenberg)20091126
 Galleries: Chelsea
 CARROLL DUNHAM, through Dec. 5. This joyous show of sweet, goofy and raunchy paintings might be the best of Mr. Dunham's nearly three-decade career. Sex is still his main subject, and he continues to work in a style that amalgamates Pop, Surrealism and Expressionism. But he has taken a surprising turn away from the angry, inter-gender warfare of previous years. His sensuously painted images of female bathers and big trees are turbulent but exuberantly so; they find Mr. Dunham, it seems, on the threshold of a new Eden. Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street , (212) 206-9300, gladstonegallery.com. (Johnson)20091126
 SISTER MARY CORITA, through Dec. 5. Sister Corita, who was born Frances Elizabeth Kent and entered the Roman Catholic order of Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in Los Angeles at 18, became famous in 1960s America for her jazzy, colorful, politically forthright brand of protest and inspirational art, most of it in the form of prints. This packed survey of work made before and after she left the convent gives a good sense of her combination of Pop and agitprop, and of her ferocious productivity. Zach Feuer Gallery, 530 West 24th Street , (212) 989-7700, zachfeuer.com. (Cotter)20091126
 Galleries: Other
 BARRY X. BALL: 'MASTERPIECES,' through Dec. 12. A striking departure from the surrealistic heads for which Mr. Ball is known, this show replicates three Italian Late Baroque busts in different kinds of exotic stone, using a combination of high-tech machinery and manual labor. Two glowing pieces represent ''Purity'' by Antonio Corradini, an image of a woman whose head and face are covered by a sheer veil. The third, based on ''Envy'' by Orazio Marinali, is a snarling Medusa. Salon 94 Freemans, 1 Freeman Alley, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side , (212) 529-7400, salon94.com. (Johnson)20091126
 FREDERICK HAYES: 'BUILD AN EMPIRE,' through Dec. 6. Frederick Hayes, 54 and having his first solo show in New York, paints like someone who has paid his dues. The centerpiece here is ''Urban Grid,'' a painting made of 32 smaller canvases, each a vigorous portrait of a city dweller that could easily stand on its own. Faces are constructed carefully if bluntly, with an opulent and inventive sense of color and fearless contrasts of shadow and light. Whether artists like Max Beckmann, Marsden Hartley and possibly Emil Nolde contributed to Mr. Hayes's style, they stand as precedents for its adamant and considered vitality. Number 35, 39 Essex Street, between Grand and Hester Streets, Lower East Side , (212) 388-9311, numberthirtyfive.com. (Smith)20091126
 'ICONS OF THE DESERT: EARLY ABORIGINAL PAINTINGS FROM PAPUNYA,' through Dec. 5. With their bold, diagrammatic compositions; finely coordinated colors; and dotted textures, paintings by indigenous Australians appeal to Western eyes trained to respond to abstraction and folk and so-called outsider art. The paintings in this excellent show are mostly from the 1970s, the early years of the modern Aboriginal painting movement. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village , (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Johnson)20091126
 Last Chance
 BENNY ANDREWS AND WILLIAM VILLALONGO: 'LIBERTY & THE LAND'; closes on Saturday. This small show, organized by Dean Daderko, brings together work by two artists of different generations with an interest in the fracturing politics of race and the piecing together technique of collage. William Villalongo, born in 1975, surrounds George Washington with an interracial bevy of cavorting nymphs and fills the faces of the dour, suspicious-looking couple in Grant Wood's ''American Gothic'' with many unblinking eyes. Benny Andrews (1930-2006), a child of Georgia sharecroppers, offers views of an American farm family stranded on the side of a road, and of the Statue of Liberty mired in trash. Mr. Andrews's career is ripe for a fresh, serious, full-dress retrospective, one accompanied by publication of his journals documenting black activism from the 1960s onward. Cuchifritos Gallery, 120 Essex Street, at Delancey Street, Lower East Side , (212) 420-9202, aai-nyc.org/cuchifritos. (Cotter)20091126
 MIKE KELLEY AND MICHAEL SMITH: 'A VOYAGE OF GROWTH AND DISCOVERY'; closes on Monday. This entertaining and thought-provoking exhibition features a six-channel video following Michael Smith, dressed as Baby Ikki in droopy diapers, bonnet and dark glasses, as he wanders around Burning Man, the weeklong celebration of all things psychedelic in the Nevada desert. With jungle-gym-like structures in the gallery and a towering junk-metal sculpture of Baby Ikki looming over all, the whole project represents Burning Man as a festival of infantilism. SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Johnson)20091126
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'VERMEER'S MASTERPIECE ''THE MILKMAID'' '; closes on Sunday. This small contextual show surrounds ''The Milkmaid'' (1657-58) with all five of the Met's Vermeers and a smattering of domestic scenes by other 17th-century masters, among them Pieter de Hooch, Gabriel Metsu and Nicolaes Maes. The 18-inch-high ''Milkmaid'' is one of Vermeer's strangest and best works. In this arresting treatment of a prosaic subject -- a young woman laboring in the kitchen -- Vermeer forsakes his well-known optical sensations for earthier pleasures. And in unprecedented fashion, he endows this domestic worker with traits typically reserved for higher-class women: virtue, diligence and a rich interior life. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20091126
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'WATTEAU, MUSIC, AND THEATER'; closes on Sunday. Informed by new research in music and theater, this show highlights the influence of the performing arts on paintings, drawings and prints by Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684-1721) and his contemporaries. It includes several elaborate fetes galantes and smaller works depicting actors and musicians, and cultivates an atmosphere of civilized hedonism. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20091126
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ROXY PAINE ON THE ROOF: MAELSTROM'; closes on Sunday. An awesome spectacle awaits visitors to the museum's roof garden: a gnarly thicket of trees and branches extending from one end of the open-air deck to the other. It looks as if a tornado had ripped through Central Park and deposited its gleanings here -- except that it is all made of shiny metal pipe, as if all that wood had been transformed by someone with a stainless-steel Midas touch. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20091126
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WHAT WAS GOOD DESIGN? MOMA'S MESSAGE, 1944-1956'; closes on Monday. With 102 objects and excellent labels, the Modern explores its role as arbiter of postwar American design, when, channeling the Bauhaus, it deemed good, affordable design a human right. Its campaign included exhibitions titled ''What Is Good Design?,'' design competitions and use of the MoMA seal of approval by selected department stores. Signature items like the Eames storage unit and the Chemex coffee maker mingle with surprises like a back-to-basics chair of string and wood by, of all people, Alexey Brodovitch, Harper's Bazaar's influential art director.

 MATTHEW RITCHIE: 'LINE SHOT'; closes on Wednesday. It is hard to know if this artist is a genuine polymath or an ambivalent painter, unwilling to commit to his medium. The canvases in his latest New York gallery show are some of the best of his career. More abstract, they have a cosmic turbulence that is less obscurely narrative, more affectingly formal. His videos continue to impress, especially when used as stage sets; his sculptures increasingly just get in the way. It may be unnecessary, if not self-defeating, to show the different mediums together. Andrea Rosen Gallery, 525 West 24th Street, Chelsea , (212) 627-6000, andrearosengallery.com. (Smith)20091126

HEADLINE: Retailers Take a Wait-and-See Approach to Holiday Hiring

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The traditional kickoff of the holiday shopping season normally coincides with a flurry of seasonal hiring in the city, amounting to as many as 25,000 extra jobs. But last year's financial crisis caused holiday hiring to fall off, and this year's recession had a similar effect
 By this time of year, stores usually have hired and trained all of their extra help. That has not been the case in New York, where doubts about whether shoppers will turn out in force have caused retailers to delay hiring until the eve of Thanksgiving and beyond. 
 ''Our clients are waiting until much later than normal,'' said Allyson Goodman, chief executive of Pyramid Consulting Group, a placement agency in Manhattan. Ms. Goodman's firm has a program called Retail Rescue that provides temporary sales clerks and other holiday-season workers to stores in the city on short notice.
 Those who have hired their seasonal help are taking on fewer workers and demanding that they be on call from early morning until midnight, leaving many unemployed city residents unable to scratch out some additional year-end income even at rates as low as $10 an hour, retail industry executives and labor-market watchers said.
 So far, official job statistics indicate that hiring for the holidays will be as anemic in 2009 as it was last year, when the city's retail trade added just 9,200 jobs from September through December, compared with a normal range of about 13,000 in a recession to 25,000 in a boom year, said James Brown, who analyzes the local job market for the state Department of Labor. 
 Last month, the number of retail jobs in the city declined by 1,100 after getting off to a slightly better start than in 2008. ''So far in 2009, retail hiring is on the same disappointing pace,'' Mr. Brown said.
 At Brooklyn Industries, a growing chain of moderately priced clothing stores, holiday hiring was still taking place in mid-November, said Lexy Funk, the company's chief executive. Ms. Funk said the company would hire two or three seasonal employees, at $9 to $10 an hour, for each of its 10 stores in the city, but would expect them to be flexible about when and where they work.
 The typical Brooklyn Industries customer is in her late 20s and tends to procrastinate, so the preholiday rush at the company's stores starts in mid-December, not this Friday, Ms. Funk said.
 ''We'd love them to shop earlier,'' she said. ''That would be wonderful. But that doesn't seem to happen with us.''
 With the city's unemployment rate above 10 percent, Ms. Funk and other retailers have found that it is a buyer's market for labor. Ms. Funk said she did not consider lowering pay rates because of the recession, but she felt no pressure to pay more than the $9 to $10 an hour the company offered last year.
 ''We're not taking advantage of the bad economy and saying, 'Oh, we can pay them minimum wage,' '' Ms. Funk said.
 When the company runs help-wanted ads, ''there's not a flood of people, but it hasn't been difficult to find good candidates,'' she said. ''There is more demand than prior years; that's partly a testament to the economy.''
 That hunger for work was most evident last month, she said, when Brooklyn Industries held an open house in a hotel conference room to interview applicants for full-time and temporary jobs for its newest store, in Grand Central Terminal. ''We had 250 people lining up around this room,'' she said.
 When Aon Consulting surveyed the 100 largest retail companies in the country about their holiday-season plans, fewer than one in five said they planned to hire more seasonal workers this year, while more than two in five said they would hire fewer, said Patrick Tomlinson, a senior vice president of Aon. About 70 percent of those who planned to hire more were companies whose stores employ fewer than 50 people, suggesting that the bigger stores planned to stretch their permanent staffs during the holidays instead, he said.
 Some national chains, like Macy's, Borders and the Container Store, were still advertising online for holiday help at the start of this week. But even those that are hiring are expected to hire no more, and in some cases fewer, temporary workers than they took on last year.
 The Container Store, whose 47 stores sell dozens of small, inexpensive items during the holidays, has hired more than 380 seasonal workers nationally since mid-September, said Audrey Robertson, a spokeswoman for the chain. That is fewer than in past years because the company's sales have declined this year for the first time in its history, she said.
 The two Container Store locations in the city will probably hire about 10 temporary workers each for the holidays because they are ''doing phenomenally well'' compared with expectations, Ms. Robertson said. The company is proud, she added, that ''we have not done any layoffs or closed any stores during this kind of icky economic time.''
 As hard as holiday work is to come by, it still does not appeal to some unemployed city residents. Janet Raiffa, a Brooklyn resident with two Ivy League degrees who lost her job as a recruiter for a big law firm last spring, said a friend of hers had just accepted a temporary job at the Whole Foods store in the Time Warner Center, but Ms. Raiffa has opted for short-term odd jobs, like selling designer clothes at a sample sale in SoHo instead.
 A part-time retail job that pays $9 or $10 an hour is unlikely to yield more take-home pay than her unemployment benefits of $430 a week, she said. Additionally, it could be an obstacle to landing work -- even brief assignments or attractive volunteering opportunities -- more fitting for a professional, Ms. Raiffa said.
 ''I could probably get a job now, but the jobs that are being created are at the bottom end of the ladder,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Cheaper Books Come at a High Cost to Worthy Literature

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco.

 BODY:
Kathleen Caldwell is ready for the day after Thanksgiving. At her charming shop in Oakland's Montclair Village, A Great Good Place for Books, a large table is laden with a smorgasbord of hardbound tomes she thinks will be hits this season.
 ''Over a third of my sales are hardcovers, especially this time of year,'' Ms. Caldwell said from a cramped back office filled with stock. 
But holiday sales of hardcovers are suddenly more than just thoughtful gifts; they are now the latest chapter in the nation's culture wars, with corporate giants accused of trying to seize control of an influential medium and push political agendas. Some fear beloved Bay Area independent booksellers like Ms. Caldwell will be casualties.
 Amazon.com, Target.com and Walmart.com are in a book battle royale, selling popular hardcovers for as little as $8.98, compared with retail prices of up to $35. Companies take a loss with each sale, but the tactic has lured shoppers.
 Even though these deals can be found only on the companies' Web sites, the American Booksellers Association called the practice ''predatory pricing'' intended to control the market for hardcover bestsellers everywhere, including bookstores. The group wants the Justice Department to investigate.
 In the digital age, hardcover books may seem like quaint anachronisms. They are heavy, expensive and do not run the latest apps or send text messages. If someone controls the market for them, does it really matter?
 ''When a book is released in hardcover, it signals its importance,'' said Bridget Kinsella of Oakland, a bestselling author and veteran reporter for Publishers Weekly. Hardcovers affect the national conversation, dominating news coverage of books. The New York Times Book Review, Ms. Kinsella notes, rarely features paperbacks on its cover.
 So if this is all a scheme to control those influential bestsellers, just what would a future look like if, say, Wal-Mart became the last bookstore standing? 
 A visit to Wal-Mart stores in Oakland and Mountain View revealed a remarkably limited selection, a narrow worldview and a political bent that can be summed up best with two words: Glenn Beck. The Oakland Wal-Mart carried only 21 hardcover titles: Mr. Beck's ''Arguing With Idiots'' (plus the audio book) and his holiday offering, ''The Christmas Sweater''; ''Going Rogue'' by Sarah Palin; the book of Carrie Prejean, the dethroned Miss California, ''Still Standing''; and titles from the Rev. Rick Warren and the television minister Joel Osteen.
 The Mountain View store in the heart of Silicon Valley had 36 hardcover titles, but they were dominated by the same conservative writers. Both stores also had shelves devoted to ''inspirational'' titles, almost entirely Christian, and the complete works of Stephanie Meyer, the ''Twilight'' author.
 Wal-Mart would not release sales figures but said the company did not stock books simply on popularity. A survey of bestsellers lists from this same time period shows Americans reading a variety of books, not just voices from the political right.
 ''The Wal-Mart customer is a mom,'' said a company spokeswoman, Linda Blakely. Books selected cater to that customer, she said, adding, ''You're trying to pick the ones that will be her bestsellers.''
 That is what worries critics: If Wal-Mart becomes the nation's dominant bookstore, only books that pass this ''mom'' litmus test will be printed. ''Other books won't get published,'' said Bill Petrocelli, co-owner of Book Passage in Corte Madera.
 Praveen Madan, co-owner of The Booksmith in San Francisco, disagrees with this fear. He said people would not start ''reading this rightist propaganda literature instead of reading more worthy things'' simply because the books cost less.
 Mr. Madan said bookstores were more threatened by the recession and e-books than the current price war. Censorship? Not with the Internet selling virtually every book. He, Ms. Caldwell and Mr. Petrocelli -- all independent bookstore owners -- sell online, and even Wal-Mart's Web site has a larger, more diverse inventory.
 Independent booksellers say their survival depends on building relationships with customers to determine their tastes, not relying solely on the latest bestsellers. There is not a single copy of Mr. Beck's book in Montclair. ''No one would buy it,'' said Ms. Caldwell, though she will order it upon request.
 Mr. Madan said of his sales philosophy: ''It's the business of recommending and selling books based on books we love. It's the love business.''
 Love can be fickle, though. Mr. Madan bought a few copies of Ms. Palin's memoir at the online low price of $9, figuring someone might be a little curious. The books remain unsold.
 ''It's like buying porn,'' he said. ''People might want to buy it, but they don't want to be seen buying it in the Bay Area.''

HEADLINE: The Art of the Book, the Book of the Art

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Whatever shape the Dow is in, the holidays are traditionally the time to spend big, and art and architecture books are a relatively guilt-free gift choice. They may cost a bundle, but they are built to last, often gorgeous and almost always edifying, designed to be revisited, for pleasure and instruction, over the years. 
 With that in mind, the art and architecture critics of The New York Times have chosen these as the most notable books published this year. HOLLAND COTTER 
 If you are prepared to go for broke, by all means go for VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE LETTERS, a fabulous six-volume hardcover edition of the artist's complete surviving correspondence, edited by Leo Jansen, Hans Luijten and Nienke Bakker. Van Gogh was a prolific, eloquent, emotionally unguarded writer, as the 819 letters here demonstrate. (An additional 83 are letters written to him by Gauguin; his brother Theo; and others.) And what he couldn't fully say in words, he drew in the middle of letters and in the margins: sketches of people, landscapes and interiors, many of which appeared, verbatim, in his painting. They are like snapshots of his creative process, and they are all reproduced in the six volumes, along with family photographs, maps of the artist's whereabouts from year to year, and reproductions of art, by himself and others, that he refers to in the letters. The set costs $600 and weighs a ton, but as a total immersion experience, it is worth every penny and hard-to-lift pound. (Thames & Hudson in association with the Van Gogh Museum and the Huygens Institute, $600).
 A notable byproduct of the recession has been a flurry of small museum shows with very large catalogs. Can it be that, freed from having to track down hundreds of loans, curators are able to devote more time than usual to research? I don't know, but the book titled MARCEL DUCHAMP: ETANT DONNES, which accompanies a fall exhibition focused on a single work by Duchamp at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (through Sunday), is both immense and immensely entertaining. Written largely by the curator Michael R. Taylor, it gives an exhaustive account of ''Etant Donnes,'' the artist's final masterwork -- inspired by a clandestine affair and kept hidden from the world for 20 years -- and still manages to be a terrific read. (Philadelphia Museum of Art and Yale University Press, $65)
 Also in the monster-catalog-for-modest-show category is LOOKING IN: ROBERT FRANK'S 'THE AMERICANS,' which accompanies an exhibition of the same title now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Jan. 3). In some ways, the book is a more cohesive and complete experience than the show itself. At the Met, the 83 pictures that made up Mr. Frank's touchstone 1958 cross-country travelogue wind disjointedly through several galleries . In the book, they are presented in their intended clear sequence. In addition, images from the hundreds of contact sheet images from which Mr. Frank edited the book are far easier to see and follow in the reproduction than in the gallery display cases. If you add to those features a handful of deeply engaged and readable scholarly essays and the original introduction by Jack Kerouac, you have a book that is already a classic: a monument to a monument. (Steidl, $85.) 
 Duchamp and Robert Frank are marquee names; the American artist Paul Thek is not, at least not in his homeland. A hippie-era visionary who died of AIDS in 1988, he has long been influential in Europe, where he lived for years. And it is thanks to a recent retrospective in Germany that we have the visually intoxicating book titled PAUL THEK: ARTIST'S ARTIST, edited by Harald Falckenberg and Peter Weibel. Most of Mr. Thek's installations, part ritual, part fairy tale, were made of throwaway materials and are now long gone. Yet they reappear, like pure magic, in hundreds of photographs, along with reproductions of paintings, drawings, letters and diaries. Anti-establishment (including the art establishment) and anti-market, pro-spirit and pro-poetry, he embodied a side of 1960s and '70s art that we still don't know. With luck, the Thek survey scheduled for the Whitney Museum of American Art next year will help reveal it. (MIT Press, $54.95.)
 ART WORKERS: RADICAL PRACTICE IN THE VIETNAM WAR ERA by Julia Bryan-Wilson, is an intensive account of how four important figures -- Carl Andre, Hans Haacke, Robert Morris and the critic Lucy Lippard -- combined creativity with activism to make political art in the 1960s and '70s, which extended to agitating for artists' rights. Ms. Bryan-Wilson's book is of immediate, practical value to young artists today who want to re-establish art as an alternative place in the culture, though her clean prose will also make the book inviting to more casual readers. (University of California Press, Berkeley $39.95.)
 One of the year's outstanding beauties, AMAMONZEKI: A HIDDEN HERITAGE, TREASURES OF THE JAPANESE IMPERIAL CONVENTS is in Japanese, with an English translation. In 2002 the World Monument Fund and the Institute of Medieval Japanese Studies at Columbia University began restoring the few remaining old Buddhist convents in Kyoto and Nara. Last summer, a display of material from those convents -- paintings, textiles, and ritual objects -- was mounted at Tokyo University of the Arts, and this rigorous, exceptionally tender, book was a result. (Sankei Shimbun, Tokyo $60.) With it appeared a related publication, IN IRIS FIELDS: REMEMBRANCES AND POETRY BY ABBESS KASANOIN JIKUN, DAISHOJI IMPERIAL CONVENT, KYOTO, edited by Barbara Ruch and Katsura Michiyo. The Abbess, who died in 2006 after living in her convent for almost 90 years, was a writer of rare, simple eloquence. If I could have only a single gift from my own holiday list, the choice would come down to one of these two modest-size treasures. (Tankosha, Tokyo, $30.)

HEADLINE: Testing Bloomberg's Grip on the Budget Ax

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
As he sought to persuade wary voters that he deserved a third term as mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg sold himself as a no-nonsense financial watchdog who was ready to swing the budget ax. 
 But City Hall's contract negotiations with the United Federation of Teachers are sorely testing those claims.
The powerful union is asking the city for 4 percent annual raises for its 87,000 teachers, the same pay increase that the Bloomberg administration gave municipal workers throughout the mayor's second term. 
 A year ago, the teachers' raises seemed inevitable. In fact, the city has already set aside enough money to give teachers 4 percent increases over the next two years.
 But the economic landscape has changed drastically, and Mr. Bloomberg is grappling with a tricky question: In a severe economic downturn, can the city justify giving $700 million in raises to teachers?
 The decision is rich in symbolism, and will reveal much about how Mr. Bloomberg intends to govern in his third term. 
 If he snubs teachers and hurts their morale, he risks jeopardizing his signature policy initiative: overhauling the city's once-troubled schools. If he demands no serious concessions, organized labor may decide he is weak and resist his spending cuts for the next four years. If he is overly combative, he could alienate unions that paved the way for his re-election, either by endorsing him or staying neutral, as the teachers' union did. 
 ''How to handle this is a tough decision for him,'' said Carol Kellermann, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group that analyzes government spending. 
 Publicly, at least, the mayor appears to be spoiling for a fight. In a speech in Washington on Wednesday, he called for a raft of education changes, like factoring in student test scores when determining if teachers earn tenure, that will inflame the union.
 Mr. Bloomberg did not mention the contract in his speech, but his message seemed unmistakable: big raises, if they are granted, will require painful sacrifices from teachers. 
 The tense talks have reached an impasse and may require the intervention of an arbitrator, people briefed on the negotiations said. The current contract has expired.
 To many students of the city's budget, the 4 percent raises, at a cost of $344 million a year, are out of the question. ''There is no justification to do this in the deepest recession in most people's lives,'' said Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who focuses on New York labor costs. 
 She and her colleagues have assembled what they see as an iron-clad case. The city must plug a $4 billion budget gap over the next year, leaving big raises looking like a luxurious holdover from a different era. (The mayor has just ordered $1.7 billion in spending cuts, roughly the equivalent of what the teachers' union is seeking in pay increases over the next three years, according to the Citizens Budget Commission.) 
 The local unemployment rate is 10.3 percent, leading to a flood of job applicants to the city's schools, many of whom would be eager to earn a teacher's current salary. 
 And New York City teachers are hardly impoverished: their pay has risen 43 percent under Mr. Bloomberg, well above the average for unionized city workers, whose pay has grown 35 percent during the same period.
 Teachers at the top of the pay scale now earn more than $100,000 a year, and starting pay is about $46,000. With the raises now under consideration, those figures are poised to hit $108,000 and $49,000, respectively. 
 The teachers' union acknowledges the new economic reality but says that depriving teachers of a raise could hurt the economy rather than help it. 
 Higher pay has attracted a better, more stable corps of teachers, the union argues, which has improved schools and prepared millions of students for the job market. ''Keeping a very rigorous school system moving forward helps the economic development of the city,'' said Michael Mulgrew, the union president. 
 ''We don't want the school system sliding backward,'' he said. 
 Mr. Mulgrew said previous pay increases had helped his members catch up to the salaries of teachers in surrounding suburbs, who, by and large, are still paid more. And the union has tried to save the city money, by accepting a less generous pension plan for new teachers, a proposal that, to Mr. Bloomberg's chagrin, has stalled in the Legislature. 
 Despite the economic downturn, the union has a potential trump card in its contract negotiations: a tradition known as pattern bargaining. City Hall rarely, if ever, withholds raises to one union that it has granted to another, arguing that comparable pay increases (or decreases) are fair and predictable. 
 But the practice is by no means sacrosanct, and budget watchdogs, like the Citizens Budget Commission, say this may be the moment to consider straying from it. ''This is an unusual time,'' Ms. Kellermann said. 
 The mayor could cut the 4 percent raise in half, for instance, or demand big concessions, like the abolition of a controversial absentee teacher reserve, which pays people even if they do not work, at a cost of roughly $74 million a year. 
 Mr. Bloomberg has suggested that the days of large raises, with no strings attached, are over. The mayor refuses to discuss the details of the negotiations, but when he was asked about the contract recently, he said, ''Teachers now get paid as well in the city -- roughly -- as they do in the suburbs,'' which he said ''lets them focus on the classroom rather than how they're going to pay the bills.''
 But, tellingly, he added, ''I would love to pay them more, but the reality is we only have so much money.''

HEADLINE: Bank Returns To Its Roots In Hong Kong

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER and LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
HSBC is so tied to Hong Kong that when the bank's shares dropped sharply earlier this year a local television commentator burst into tears while reporting the news. 
 Never mind that for the better part of two decades, HSBC's focus has been less on its 144-year-old roots in Asia and more on expanding into Europe and the United States -- a shift that produced a sprawling behemoth with branches in 86 countries. 
 Now, with huge subprime losses in the United States still a drag on earnings and demand for credit declining in Europe, the London-based bank is returning its focus to Asia, looking to benefit from rapid growth in China and other emerging markets. As a first step, its chief executive, Michael F. Geoghegan, will move to Hong Kong from London in February with the bank's head of strategy and about a dozen staff members. 
 ''The center of gravity has shifted significantly towards Asia,'' Christopher White, a fund manager at Threadneedle in London, said of the global business growth. ''It's been a quantum shift and Geoghegan moving over to Hong Kong is a statement of that.'' 
 In fact, some critics say that HSBC waited too long to turn to Asia and that its return was too timid.
 Knight Vinke, an asset management firm based in Monaco that owns a small stake in HSBC, pushed management as early as June 2007 to abandon its ailing operation in the United States and focus on Asia instead. Now, the investor says the bank should commit exclusively to the region, as demand for credit in Western markets is unlikely to recover in the medium term.
 ''They have something in the market which no one else has: a huge heritage, a footprint, deep connections in a way that Barclays, JPMorgan and Citi have not, and as an investor I'm looking for a way to tap into that,'' Glen P. Suarez, a Knight Vinke executive, said.
 HSBC is not the only company eager to tap into the faster-growing Asian markets. Coca-Cola, Wal-Mart and NYSE Euronext are among firms that recently said they planned to grow in the region. Morgan Stanley plans to set up its own brokerage there, BBVA of Spain might increase its stake in China's Citic bank, and Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse recently moved global division heads to Asia.
 A growing middle class, a rising number of high-net-worth individuals and relatively underdeveloped banking products make China an attractive hunting ground for banks. HSBC's own economists in October raised the forecast for China's economic growth this year to 8.5 percent from 8.1 percent. HSBC might be the biggest foreign bank in China but it has only a 1.3 percent share of the highly fragmented banking market, according to figures by KPMG and Goldman Sachs.
 But few banks have the strong ties to local businesses and a rich heritage in the region HSBC can point to. Founded in 1865 as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation by Thomas Sutherland, a Scot who was then working for the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation, it established itself as the main financier for British shipping and trade in opium, silk and tea. It handled China's first loan in 1874 and grew so important to Hong Kong that many consumers hold their entire pension in HSBC shares.
 It was a good business for the better part of a century. But in the 1980s, when financial markets in the West were booming, HSBC decided to expand into the United States and Europe. It bought Marine Midland Bank in the United States and, after doubling its assets with the purchase of Midland Bank of Britain in 1992, HSBC moved its headquarters to London from Hong Kong.
 Still hungry for market share in the American market, HSBC bought the subprime mortgage lender, Household International, for $14.2 billion in 2003, a purchase it now says it regrets. It was that business that made HSBC the first major bank in 2007 to sound the alarm about mortgage market losses after its own piled up.
 Almost three years later, provisions for bad loans at the unit are finally starting to decline as HSBC winds down most of the business. Over the last two years, HSBC has relied on its earnings from emerging markets to compensate for losses in the United States. 
 Along the way, it was supported by Hong Kong investors like Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's richest man, who helped HSBC raise $:12.5 billion, or $18.5 billion, in a rights issue earlier this year while many rivals had to accept government succor.
 HSBC already generates 52 percent of its earnings from Hong Kong and the rest of Asia-Pacific but the company plans to increase that share to 60 percent in the short term. 
 The bank's leadership denied that the Hong Kong move meant it was turning its back on the United States, Europe or its London home, which will remain its global headquarters, at least for now. 
 Douglas Flint, the chief financial officer, said the bank was unlikely to again try to grab domestic market share in the United States. Instead, it will seek to generate about 10 percent of earnings from its American business, which is currently unprofitable, by using its large Asian operation to tap into huge capital flows between the United States and China. 
 ''The incremental demand is increasingly going to be out of Asia,'' Mr. Flint said in an interview on Wednesday. ''Our differentiator to other banks is not just that we are big in some emerging markets, it's that we connect those markets to each other and the rest of the world.''
 Mr. Geoghegan, 56, will be the bank's first chief to be based in Hong Kong in 16 years, but he knows the Asian market well. He joined HSBC 36 years ago and spent eight of those years in Asia. Mr. Geoghegan's wife will move with him to Hong Kong while his two sons, both university students in Britain, will stay behind. Mr. Geoghegan plans to spend about one week a month in Britain.
 Analysts disagree whether his move will turn out to be more than just symbolic but said it would probably help the bank with its plan to list shares on the Shanghai stock exchange, which would give HSBC access to local currency needed for its expansion. HSBC, whose shares are already listed in London and Hong Kong, plans to hire about 1,000 employees in China next year, open branches and invest in technology. 
 Over the last 12 months, its shares have performed better than those of many rivals but have lagged behind those of BNP Paribas of France, Banco Santander of Spain and Standard Chartered, another London-based bank that generates most of its profit from emerging markets.
 Even as Mr. Suarez of Knight Vinke expresses concern that HSBC is leaving itself too yoked to the moribund American market, he also worries about the rapid growth of bank loans in China. He acknowledges that the billions of dollars the Chinese government pumped into its economy to cushion the effects of the global economic downturn could pose a problem in the short term by creating a credit bubble.
 In fact, HSBC already started to notice how increased lending by Chinese banks has started to hurt its loan margins. Falling interest rates have narrowed the difference between what HSBC pays on deposits and what it can charge for loans.
 Encouraged by the government to increase lending to offset the drag on the Chinese economy from falling exports, Chinese banks lent more money in the first seven months of this year than in the two previous years combined.
 ''Whenever people borrowed that much over that short period of time it ended in tears,'' Colin Morton, a fund manager at Rensburg in Leeds, England, said. But in the long term, he said, exposure to emerging markets will be beneficial for HSBC. 
 ''The only problem is that it's already reflected in their share price,'' he said. ''The stock is not cheap anymore.''

HEADLINE: Dollar Hits a 14-Year Low Versus the Yen

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI; Bettina Wassener contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
The dollar tumbled to a 14-year low against the yen on Thursday, reinforcing concern in Tokyo that America's already-strapped consumers would buy even fewer Japanese cars and gadgets.
 The move was part of a wide, multiyear decline in the dollar, set off by worries about the American economy and its swelling debt -- and more recently, a belief that the United States was unlikely to raise interest rates soon.
 In early trading in Tokyo on Friday, the dollar briefly fell below 85 yen, its lowest level against the Japanese currency since hitting 79.75 yen in April 1995. 
 The dollar traded at $1.5057 against the euro on Thursday, strengthening slightly from $1.5134 the day before, when the dollar hit its weakest level against the common currency since August 2008.
 Many analysts say the dollar has further to fall, a prospect that may be good news for the United States because it will make its goods and services more competitive.
 The dollar's weakness is causing jitters in countries like Japan, however. Earlier this decade, Japan frequently intervened in currency markets to weaken its currency, thereby keeping its exports affordable for overseas markets. 
 But Japan has held back from similar moves amid increasing signals from Washington that Asia's export-driven economies should no longer count on American consumers to keep them afloat. 
 On a recent trip to the region, President Obama urged countries like Japan and China to cultivate domestic demand instead, while allowing their currencies to appreciate against the dollar.
 Mr. Obama is concerned by what economists call a global imbalance: a huge trade and current-account deficit in the United States and trade surpluses in the rest of the world. The president said Americans must spend less on imported goods -- and increase their household savings -- while consumers in Asia must spend more.
 ''It was just two weeks ago that U.S. President Obama stressed the necessity for the United States to reduce its trade deficit, and for Asian countries to grow domestic demand,'' Osamu Takashima, an analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, wrote in a note to clients. ''International circumstances make it difficult for the Japanese government to halt the yen's rise by intervening in currency markets.''
 The slump in the dollar, so soon after Mr. Obama's visit, is putting the Japanese government to the test, however. Japan has not meddled in currency markets since 2004, but the recent trend upward had prompted speculation that an intervention might be imminent.
 ''It's not desirable for the currency to move so rapidly,'' Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama told reporters Thursday. ''The most important thing is we must handle economic management properly. Immediate steps will be needed to avoid falling back into recession.''
 A weak dollar hurts Japanese exporters because American consumers must pay more to purchase the same Japanese cars and gadgets -- making them less competitive alongside products made in the United States or by other exporters with weaker currencies. Any profit earned in American dollars will also be worth less when converted into yen, hurting companies' bottom lines.
 Automakers like Toyota Motor, which still makes many of its cars in Japan to ship overseas, could be hit if the dollar remains weak. Toyota, the world's biggest automaker, estimates that a 1-yen fall in the dollar shaves 30 billion yen off its operating profit. 
 Japanese exporters have already been battered in the global economic crisis, which decimated demand worldwide. Meanwhile, a dark outlook for the country's export sector could in turn depress share prices and business sentiment, worsen deflation and weigh on the wider economy -- just as Japan has been showing signs of recovery.
 ''If the situation continues to worsen at export companies, it could nip the Japanese economy's green shoots in the bud,'' said Mr. Takashima, the bank analyst.
 The last time the dollar fell so low against the yen was in 1995, amid the lingering effect of the agreement known as the Plaza Accord a decade earlier, when the world's leading economies agreed on a common policy to weaken the dollar and tackle America's trade deficit.
 But near-zero interest rates set by the Japanese government for much of this decade encouraged the rise of the so-called yen carry trade, where investors borrowed money in Japan to invest in countries with higher yields. 
 Those carry-trade bets helped keep the yen cheap against other currencies, including the dollar. Exports boomed, and Japan racked up a huge trade surplus.
 The carry trade started to unravel in 2007 as subprime worries spread in the United States, causing panicked investors to pull their money from riskier investments and pay off their yen loans.
 Meanwhile, the United States Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates to below those of Japan, and analysts see little prospect of a rate increase soon, making the dollar a less attractive currency to hold. A dollar carry trade is also in the making, analysts say.
 Tomoko Fujii, a currency strategist at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, said she saw an increased chance that Japan would intervene in currency markets if the dollar dipped below 85 yen.
 Despite the dollar's slide against the yen on Thursday, it rose against 14 of the 16 most-traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg, after Dubai's attempt to reschedule its debt caused investors to flee to the dollar from some other currencies.
 The government of Dubai said Wednesday that it had asked its banks for a six-month stay on its schedule of debt repayments, in a blunt acknowledgment of the once-booming Middle Eastern emirate's financial woes.

HEADLINE: To Pay for Longer School Days, Some Parents Try Raising Money

BYLINE: By CRYSTAL YEDNAK

 BODY:
After raising $35,000 for gym mats, musical instruments and other extras last year, parents at Disney II Magnet School in Chicago now face a more daunting price tag -- $100,000 -- to keep their children in class an extra hour each day.
 The city's public school students have some of the shortest days in the country, as both President Obama and Education Secretary Arne Duncan are encouraging educators to extend school time. The Obama administration is even dangling $4 billion in new education money in front of states that innovate in different areas, including class schedules.
Historically in Chicago, the conversation about extending the school day has been short. To do so for all 417,000 students in the Chicago Public Schools would cost around $280 million, said a system spokeswoman, Ana Vargas, making such a move virtually impossible at a time when the school system faces a deficit that could reach $900 million in the 2010-11 fiscal year, which begins July 1.
 ''Most people would absolutely say more time is better,'' said Erica L. Harris, head of the school system's Office of Extended Learning Opportunities. But, Ms. Harris added, ''That conversation ends before it starts.'' 
 The $100,000 fund-raising drive at Disney II shows how parents at one magnet school are scrambling to make it happen. The cost estimate runs to $385 per student at the 260-student school, but the hours add up to an extra month of school over the course of an academic year. 
 ''I can't change C.P.S., but I'm willing to do what I can here,'' said Allison Mutlu, 38, who has children in preschool and first grade at Disney II.
 The standard day for elementary students in public schools is 5 hours 8 minutes of instruction. By comparison, students in New York City go for 6 hours 30 minutes. In Boston, they spend 6 hours in class, and in Los Angeles, most students are there 5 hours 19 minutes.
 Chicago's charter and contract schools, which operate with more autonomy, offer the longest school days in the city, with some in session more than two hours longer per day than neighborhood schools.
 ''If you look across the country at the highest performing urban schools, one thing they have in common is that they have lengthened the school day, the school week and year,'' said Timothy Knowles, director of the Urban Education Institute at the University of Chicago. But Mr. Knowles emphasized that schools must use the time wisely, not just do more of what had not worked.
 After-school programs including arts, physical education and tutoring extended the day for about 150,000 Chicago students during the 2008-9 school year. Even so, those services are not always aligned with the academic curriculum and do not involve every student. 
 A district suffocating from chronic budget shortfalls is left using piecemeal measures to lengthen the day for as many children as possible. Yet the absence of a centralized program inevitably raises equity issues.
 The Disney II fund-raising drive has raised $15,000 in three weeks, but parents organizing the effort are concerned about their ability to meet the goal in this economy.
 Financing by parents is not realistic for many city schools. Parents of many students in the magnet schools are struggling to make ends meet and cannot write a check to their public school for extra class time.
 At Marquette Elementary on the Southwest Side, serving children in prekindergarten through eighth grade, the principal, Paul O'Toole, has used a $3.5 million foundation grant to extend the day for his middle school students. The money runs out after the 2010-11 school year, though, and Mr. O'Toole knows a pledge drive is not practical for his community, where 96 percent of the students qualify for free or reduced-price lunches.
 ''We would be asking for money from people who don't have a lot of money,'' he said.
 Other schools have found ways to lengthen the day using grant money, corporate donations, creative budgeting and restructured class schedules.
 Richard Morris, the principal at Burroughs Elementary on the Southwest Side, uses about $75,000 of discretionary federal financing to add extra class time and recess to the school day.
 ''All we've done by extending the day is level the playing field,'' Mr. Morris said. ''Our day is no longer than the Catholic schools' or suburban schools'.''
 From the day Disney II opened in 2008 as part of the school system's Renaissance 2010 initiative, the children have benefited from extended class time. 
 Obtaining the extra hour at the outset was no easy task, said the principal, Bogdana Chkoumbova. A $500,000 Renaissance Schools Fund grant from the Boeing Company alleviated her concerns about costs, but scheduling and work force issues complicated the effort.
 Efforts to lengthen the school day failed in the last negotiations with the Chicago Teachers Union. Officials with the union say that they do not oppose a longer day and that they support waivers of work rules case by case, so long as teachers are compensated for the extra time.
 As Mrs. Chkoumbova, 40, recruited people for her initial staff, she informed teachers of her plans for the longer day, with extra pay. All signed on, she said.
 With an extra hour of classroom time -- meaning 6 hours 45 minutes a day, 4 days a week -- Mrs. Chkoumbova could set aside two-and-a-half hours a day for literacy. Students would also get an hour of math, an hour of science or social studies, and then art, gym and music twice a week. Students, who range from ages 3 to 9, also would get a 20-minute recess, something often dropped from the shorter schedule at other schools. Students are dismissed one hour earlier on Fridays.
 Once Disney II opened its doors -- with Mayor Richard M. Daley and Rahm Emanuel, then a congressman and now the White House chief of staff, at the ribbon-cutting ceremony -- teachers soon found they preferred the extra school time.
 With the standard schedule, Betsy Callaghan, 27, a kindergarten teacher, said she felt she was rushing through too much. ''I knew they needed more than I could give them,'' she said.
 For the 2009-10 school year, Mrs. Chkoumbova said, Disney II was flooded with applications -- 650 for 50 kindergarten slots.
 The Boeing grant runs out at the end of the 2009-10 school year, and without extra money, Disney II could face a budget gap for the extended-day program. More money should be available once the student body grows, bringing in more per-pupil financing from the state. Until then, parents will have to cover the difference. 
 Parents working on the fund-raising program fear that it will be impossible to replace the financing, if it is lost. The staff cost alone for adding an hour each day to the school year is $100,800.
 Still, some parents have mixed feelings about the private financing of public education.
 One, Renee Linnemeyer, values the additional instruction time, but her husband bristles at the idea of trying to raise $100,000.
 ''He felt like once we got a child in the public school, that burden of payment was off us,'' Ms. Linnemeyer said. ''I tried to help put things in perspective for him, reminding him if we didn't have this option, we had committed to paying for a private school education to stay in the city.''

HEADLINE: CHINA PROPOSES A PLAN TO SLOW GREENHOUSE GAS

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and KEITH BRADSHER; Edward Wong reported from Beijing, and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong. John M. Broder contributed reporting from Washington, James Kanter from Brussels and Jonathan Ansfield from Mequon, Wis. Zhang Jing contributed research from Beijing.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
The Chinese government announced Thursday that it had set a target to slow the growth of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, a day after the Obama administration set a provisional target for reducing United States emissions.
 The Chinese offer, which focuses on energy efficiency, contrasts with the strategy of the United States and most other nations to reduce total emissions. China has resisted demands from American and European negotiators to adopt binding limits on its emissions, arguing that environmental concerns must be balanced with economic growth and that developed countries must first demonstrate a significant commitment to reducing their own emissions.
 With its enormous population and breathtaking pace of economic development, China surpassed the United States two years ago as the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. 
 It was unclear whether the timing of China's announcement was coincidental, though the Chinese have been preparing an opening position ahead of international talks on climate change in Copenhagen next month. In the past, Beijing has tried to avoid looking as if it has been directly influenced by American decisions. 
 A senior Obama administration official said that the United States had pressed hard for a public commitment from China and was relieved that it had delivered. But the official, who spoke anonymously because of the delicacy of the matter, called the carbon intensity figure ''disappointing,'' and said that the administration hoped it represented a gambit that would be negotiated upward at Copenhagen or in subsequent talks.
 The Chinese propose, by 2020, to reduce so-called carbon intensity -- or the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of economic output -- by 40 to 45 percent compared with 2005 levels. By that measure, emissions would still increase, though the rate would slow. That falls far short of what many in Europe and other nations had hoped for -- an increase in energy efficiency of at least 50 percent. 
 Analysts said the Chinese offer might take some of the pressure off the United States, which is offering to reduce the total tonnage of its greenhouse gas emissions ''in the range of'' 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. But now China seems to be offering almost no deviation from its business-as-usual path, a more troubling development to some. 
 In a sense, the Chinese offer is less ambitious than the American proposal because China is already well on the way to its target with existing energy efficiency initiatives, while the American offer would require changes in many government policies. American efforts, though, have been mired in Congressional infighting.
 Yet the offers by the United States and China both amount to politically safe opening bids in what is likely to be a long, tough process of negotiations on concrete steps that the two countries should take to address climate change. 
 How that will play out in Copenhagen, where nations will negotiate terms for a post-2012 treaty on reducing emissions, or in follow-up sessions next year, is unclear.
 President Obama discussed climate change with Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, when the two met in Beijing on Nov. 16. Officials from the two countries were in talks on the issue under President George W. Bush, but Mr. Obama earlier this year made climate change a top priority in diplomacy between the governments.
 China's arguments about balancing environmental concerns with economic growth resonate with other developing countries like India, and both countries propose slowing the growth of emissions relative to the growth of their economies. 
 The target announced Thursday ''is not so low that China can get to it easily without actual effort, nor is it too high to believe,'' said Jin Jiaman, executive director of the Global Environmental Institute, an advocacy group based in Beijing.
 China, India and the United States are expected to be crucial players among the 190 or so nations at the meetings in Copenhagen. Leaders have said they do not expect to come to a firm agreement there. 
 The State Council, China's cabinet, said Thursday that fixing the target for 2020 was a ''voluntary action'' taken by the Chinese government ''based on our own national conditions,'' according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. Chinese officials also announced Thursday that Prime Minister Wen Jiabao would attend the Copenhagen talks.
 Michael A. Levi, director of the climate change program at the Council on Foreign Relations, called the target announcement disappointing because it did not move the country much faster along the path it was already on. 
 ''The Department of Energy estimates that existing Chinese policies will already cut carbon intensity by 45 to 46 percent,'' Mr. Levi said. ''The United States has put an ambitious path for emissions cuts through 2050 on the table. China needs to raise its level of ambition if it is going to match that.'' Some environmental advocates have also said that the substance of Mr. Obama's announcement on Wednesday was weak as well. 
 Ahead of Copenhagen, China has been trying to deflect criticism by showing that it can make commitments to battling climate change. In September, Mr. Hu said at the United Nations that China would slow its emissions growth by 2020, but drew some criticism by not giving a target at the time.
 Both Washington and Beijing face domestic pressure from business and political constituencies pressing their governments not to make energy and environmental pledges that could limit economic growth during a recession.
 Meanwhile, the two countries have come under increasing pressure from European and other nations to bring some sort of commitment to the Copenhagen talks or risk their total collapse. Officials in China and the United States waited until just two weeks before the start of the conference before putting their offers on the table.
 Some analysts said China might be unwilling to make larger commitments until Congress passed stalled legislation on emissions reduction targets. 
 The figures released by the White House on Wednesday were based on targets specified by legislation that passed the House in June but is stalled in the Senate. Congress has never enacted legislation that includes firm emissions limits or ratified an international global warming agreement with binding targets.

HEADLINE: The Ephemera of Protests, Carefully Hoarded, Is Going to an Archive

BYLINE: By COLIN MOYNIHAN

 BODY:
More than 20 years ago a Lower East Side plumber turned environmental apostle named Bill DiPaola founded an activist group called Time's Up and began organizing parties meant to publicize the dangers of acid rain, nuclear power and pesticides.
 Mr. DiPaola spread word of the events with wheat paste and photocopied fliers, converting lampposts on Avenue B and St. Mark's Place into billboards upon which to promote events like bike rides and Earth Day parades. 
 Over the years, Mr. DiPaola held on to those fliers. He also collected posters and communiques from other local groups -- many of them long vanished -- that meshed with his conservationist agenda. 
 There were squatters who used sweat equity to make abandoned buildings habitable. There were the men and women who carted rubble from empty plots and then returned to plant trees and flowering shrubs. And there were groups like the Lower East Side Collective and Reclaim the Streets, that organized public spectacles, replete with fire breathers and stilt walkers, in an effort to provoke questions about ownership of public space.
 Now the old fliers and other material, including correspondence, photographs and videotapes, are about to become part of a collection run by the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives, which record labor history and radical politics, at New York University. In mid-November Mr. DiPaola signed an agreement to begin transferring items there.
 ''I call this the true history project,'' he said recently as he stood in his Lower East Side apartment, where volunteers helped sift through the collection. ''The body of work we saved shows a side of things that not everybody knows about.''
 Tamiment seemed like a natural home for the items, Mr. DiPaola said, so he contacted Dr. Michael Nash, the director of the library, and offered to donate his collection. Dr. Nash said he quickly became interested in the Time's Up material, which sheds light on issues and groups that helped shape the Lower East Side in the last quarter century.
 ''Time's Up has, in many ways, defined the ways in which environmentalism challenges our economic, political, and social system that has been built around the automobile, private space, and policies that undermine our ecology,'' Dr. Nash wrote in an e-mail message, adding: ''Time's Up has been at the center of a new generation of activist politics in New York.''
 To a large degree those politics developed during territorial disputes in the 1980s and 1990s involving developers, city agencies and people living on the Lower East Side. In the days of nascent gentrification, the blocks below East 14th Street abounded with groups that were defiant, decentralized and often exuberantly anarchistic as they sought to lay claim to their surroundings.
 In recent days the relics of those years have been crammed into Mr. DiPaola's apartment, a fourth-floor walkup where handbills and colorful cloth patches emblazoned with logos and slogans hung from the walls. Pictures and stacks of videotapes spilled from cardboard boxes.
 As Mr. DiPaola talked, one volunteer cut articles about the group from newspapers, while another labeled videotape that showed people protesting the sale of community gardens to developers by locking themselves to trees outside the Gold Street office of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. 
 Nearby, Laetitia Baviere, an intern from the University of Toulouse, cataloged Time's Up events calendars going back to 1995, when the group promoted a fledgling bike ride called the Wedge, which began each month at Astor Place.
 These days Time's Up is best known for pushing another monthly bike ride called Critical Mass, in which cyclists ride through the streets of Manhattan, often running red lights while deploring the primacy of the internal combustion engine and calling for cleaner modes of transport.
 The police have responded by arresting hundreds of participants, seizing bikes and making a rule that groups of 50 or more cyclists must obtain a permit before riding together. That requirement was challenged in a federal lawsuit brought by, among others, the Five Borough Bicycle Club and the historian Kenneth T. Jackson, who are awaiting a decision.
 A spokesman for the New York City Police Department did not respond to a request for comment on the archive. 
 The court battles brought Time's Up recognition. But for years before that controversy, members of the group were involved in other causes and campaigns rooted in the rebellious culture of the Lower East Side, evidence of which was spread across tables and floors in Mr. DiPaola's apartment.
 There was a flier from 1995 for a protest on East 13th Street to oppose the eviction of squatters and a leaflet from 1999 urging people to ''defend Esperanza,'' a community garden on East Seventh Street that was bulldozed by the city to make way for luxury apartments. There was also a sign-up sheet from 2000 for people who wanted to be notified if the police moved to evict the Charas/El Bohio Community Center on East Ninth Street.
 Other objects included zines, self-published newspapers, a program schedule for a pirate FM station called Steal This Radio and manifestos that extolled recycling. One of Mr. DiPaola's favorites, ''The Dumpster Diving Map of Lower Manhattan,'' was created in 2001 by two people identified only as Deadbolt and Ariel, who charted spots to recover abandoned yet edible food.
 ''I knew that map was a classic as soon as I saw it,'' Mr. DiPaola said. ''I've been saving it for years.''
 A few minutes later Mr. DiPaola was looking at video footage from 2002 that showed people flooding into a rubble strewn lot in Dumbo, then picking up trash and planting seeds as police officers wearing helmets and padded vests looked on.
 The guerrilla-style garden did not last, he said, but he still considered the effort to be successful because the city and New York State created Brooklyn Bridge Park in that same spot a few years later.
 ''We're always trying to give the city good ideas,'' Mr. DiPaola said. ''But sometimes we're a little ahead of our time.''
