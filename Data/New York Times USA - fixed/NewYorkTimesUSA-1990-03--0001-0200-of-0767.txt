HEADLINE: Shearson Deal May Embrace The Man Who Built the Firm

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
A remarkable comeback appears to be taking shape on Wall Street.
The man who stitched together a patchwork of investment firms to build what is now one of Wall Street's biggest brokerage houses, only to lose control after selling it to the American Express Company, may return to run his old firm, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
Sanford I. (Sandy) Weill garnered the respect of Wall Street as his once small firm grew ever larger over two decades. Then he knocked the Street on its ear in 1981 when he sold the firm to American Express in a bid to create what he, and many others, thought would be the financial services company of the future.
But the corporate culture of American Express and the maverick mentality of Mr. Weill did not mesh. In 1985, he resigned, and the next year he took charge of a financial services operation in Baltimore from the Control Data Corporation. For a couple of years, he lived in relative obscurity running the firm, the Commercial Credit Company. 
But in 1988, Mr. Weill returned to his familiar surroundings with a vengeance, buying the Primerica Corporation, a diversified New York financial services company that is the parent of the brokerage house, Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
And yesterday, the circle in the career of Sandy Weill appeared to be nearer than ever to closing. Wall Street executives said Mr. Weill was in negotiations with the American Express Company that could lead to the creation of the largest brokerage firm in the country and put him back as chairman of Shearson.
Shearson has been in financial and internal turmoil over the last year, resulting in the recent resignation of its chairman and chief executive, who was a protege of Mr. Weill. As a measure of its trouble, the firm yesterday told its employees that it planned 2,000 layoffs by April.
The serious negotiations between Mr. Weill's Primerica Corporation and American Express began last week, and have focused on the possible merger of Smith Barney with Shearson to form what would become the largest brokerage on Wall Street.
People directly involved in the negotiations stressed that the talks were at a tentative stage, meaning that they could result in a preliminary agreement as soon as a matter of days, or could fall apart. One person involved in the talks emphasized that no agreement had been reached, while another said last night that they had ended.
''Right now, it's the magical mystery tour,'' a person involved in the talks said. ''We'll see where it takes us.''
 
Assets for Stock
Under the terms of the deal that has been discussed, Mr. Weill would assume the post of chairman of Shearson, while retaining his position as chairman of Primerica. The potential deal, which was described as a swap of assets for stock, would merge the two brokerages, with Primerica receiving a large stake in Shearson. The two companies would then be partners as parents.
The sources said that there were no talks under way yesterday, but that they were expected to resume soon. They added that other possible structures to the deal have been considered, including bringing in another party along with Mr. Weill.
A spokesman for American Express confirmed the talks, but stressed that no deal had been made and that many possible structures for one had been considered, including the type of deal described by the other Wall Street executives as under discussion. He said, however, that none of the proposals involved the sale of Shearson.
Mr. Weill did not return a call for comment, and a spokeswoman for Primerica would not comment.
Howard Clark Jr., the chief executive of Shearson, also confirmed last night that talks had been held and said that the deal that had been discussed involved the purchase of Smith Barney by Shearson. Shearson would have paid for the transaction by issuing new stock in the firm to Primerica, Mr. Clark said.
Mr. Clark said the talks between the various parties had broken off. But other Wall Street executives directly involved in the situation said that while they thought the talks could go either way, they had no reason to believe they had ended.
For Mr. Weill, an emotionally charged executive with a strong leadership manner, such a deal could well be his ultimate achievement. The 56-year-old executive would be able to run a firm with the strength of Shearson and maintain the relationship with American Express. At the same time, he would be able to stay as the top man at Primerica, and therefore shape his own culture.
 
Two Top Executives
The talks began between Mr. Weill and James D. Robinson 3d, the chairman and chief executive of American Express. The two men, who have remained friends since Mr. Weill was president of American Express and Mr. Robinson was his boss, reportedly had spoken about a possible combination in general terms for some time and recently began to consider such an action aggressively.
Since the serious talks began, lawyers and investment bankers have been brought into the negotiations. For example, Joseph Flom, a partner with Skadden, Arps, Slate Meagher & Flom, was said to be playing an active role in the deal, as was J. Tomilson Hill 3d, the head of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson. Neither man returned telephone calls yesterday.
''You've got law firms all over the place now,'' one Wall Street executive said. ''It seems like there are 19,000 people involved.''
Other recent attempts by American Express to support the sagging Shearson by bringing in outside parties have quickly failed. For example, late last year the company held talks with Ronald O. Perelman, the chairman of Revlon Inc., in an effort to get him to invest $250 million in the firm. Those talks fell apart shortly after they were revealed.
 
Reaction of Market
The market reacted positively to a possible deal between American Express and Primerica. American Express shares closed yesterday at $29.125, up $1, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shearson stock rose to $12.625, up 62.5 cents. And Primerica shares also rose, closing at $26.875, up 25 cents.
Indeed, a deal would seem to pose benefits for all the parties involved. Mr. Weill is well known for his interest in running a giant securities firm and has long been rumored as someone who could take charge, again, at Shearson. American Express, which controls more than 60 percent of Shearson, has been seeking a way to decrease its holdings in the firm in order to remove Shearson from its balance sheet.
In addition, Shearson has experienced a succession of embarrassing stumbles since 1988 that have cost it a good deal on the bottom line. The missteps resulted last month in the resignation of Peter A. Cohen, the firm's chairman and chief executive and once Mr. Weill's protege. Mr. Cohen was succeeded as chief executive by Mr. Clark, the former chief financial officer of American Express.
Warren Hellman, an investment banker who was formerly president of Lehman Brothers, has assumed the title of chairman, although he has said it will only be for a short time.
In his memorandum telling employees about the dismissals, Mr. Clark said that the reductions would entail significant one-time charges that would have a negative impact on first-quarter results. He added that the changes should result in $400 million in savings annually.
 
Increase in Investment
Earlier this week, American Express announced it was increasing its investment in the firm in order to shore up Shearson's capital position. The company said it would invest $750 million to purchase common and preferred stock in the firm. People involved in the talks with Mr. Weill said yesterday that those shares are expected to play a role if any deal is reached.
Despite the uncertainty surrounding the negotiations with Mr. Weill, Wall Street executives reacted to the irony of the unfolding events with an anticipation that bordered on giddiness. If completed, the deal would result in bringing together some of the central players in the Wall Street drama of the 1980's. Since taking charge of Primerica in 1988, Mr. Weill has hired a number of people who have been casualties of the upheavals on Wall Street.
These executives include Jeffrey B. Lane, the president of Primerica who until late last year was president of Shearson; Lewis L. Glucksman, the respected Wall Street trader who was chairman and chief executive of Lehman Brothers when it was purchased by Shearson in 1984 and who is now the chief trader at Smith Barney, and many former employees of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. who went to work for Mr. Weill after the now-defunct firm began to deteriorate.
Moreover, the deal would revive a number of old relationships. For example, Mr. Hellman, the current Shearson chairman, worked with Mr. Weill in a failed attempt in 1985 to take over BankAmerica.
The firm that Mr. Weill built into Shearson originated in 1960 as Carter, Berlind & Weill. When Arthur Levitt, who would later become chairman of the American Stock Exchange, joined it and attached his name, the firm was nicknamed by Wall Street ''corned beef with lettuce,'' after the initials of the partners.
By mid-1981, Mr. Weill had engineered a stream of acquisitions of brokerages houses, putting his firm, then known as Shearson Loeb Rhoades, into the position of a player on Wall Street. When American Express purchased it for $915 million, Mr. Weill essentially exchanged control of Shearson for a personal gain of about $30 million from the deal and an opportunity to help shape the much larger financial conglomerate. In 1983, he was named president of American Express.
But the post did not wear well with him. And by 1985, he decided that he preferred running his own show and resigned.

HEADLINE: Justice Officials See Exxon Trial as Risk for U.S.

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
One day after the indictment of the Exxon Corporation on charges stemming from the Alaska oil spill, Federal officials expressed disappointment today about the failure to arrange a plea bargain in the case.
The officials said that because of the collapse of plea bargaining, the Government faces a risky criminal trial based on untested legal principles, and they predicted a difficult court battle to convict Exxon.
The bargaining collapsed following strong opposition by the State of Alaska. State officials objected to any settlement that they felt would prevent them from seeking financial damages from Exxon in separate civil suits, or weaken their chances in such suits.
The unusual statements from the Justice Department officials, some of whom spoke on the promise of anonymity, seemed to be aimed in part at pressing the Alaska officials to reconsider. The Federal officials said the Justice Department remains open to the possibility of negotiating a settlement with the company at Exxon's initiative. 
Today's developments put the Government in the unusual position of pointing up the problems in its own case. This reflected the complex legal and political negotiations that have gone on among state, Federal and oil company officials as a result of the spill, which occurred when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound last March, leaking nearly 11 millions gallons of crude oil.
Commenting on the difficulties facing the Justice Department, legal authorities said today that to convict the company of two felonies, the Justice Department will have to prove that Exxon officials intentionally violated statutes calling for them to man their ships with fully qualified and competent crew members.
Department officials said they were confident that they had the evidence to support a conviction. But no jury has ever been asked to convict on these grounds, and Exxon, which was also accused of three misdemeanors, has vowed to mount a vigorous defense if the case eventually goes to trial.
 
Hard Case, Novel Issues
''It is going to be a hard-fought case presenting some novel issues,'' said Richard Stewart, assistant attorney general for the department's lands division. Mr. Stewart led the negotiations with the company in recent weeks.
Justice Department officials do not usually discuss the strengths or weaknesses of their cases before trial, but the highly public collapse of the plea bargaining and the charges by environmentalists that the department was shaping a favorable deal with Exxon have led officials to make an exception in the Exxon case.
Complicating the situation is the fact that the outcome of a criminal prosecution, one way or another, is bound to influence civil cases brought by the State of Alaska, the Federal Government and private parties. Parts of the proposed plea bargain involving the future civil suits infuriated Alaskan officials and led to the failure of a deal between the Justice Department and the company.
Justice Department officials said the risk of an acquittal, along with a desire to reach a broad and immediate agreement on environmental restoration without a long trial, was a major motivation in the department's attempt to reach a plea bargain.
Exxon first approached the Justice Department about a settlement last year. The two sides began intensive negotiations two months ago as a Federal grand jury met in Alaska to consider charges against the company.
By February, department lawyers believed they had the basic outline of a proposal, although they did not have Exxon's approval, said Government officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
 
Two-Pronged Approach
The approach involved a two-pronged plea-bargaining arrangement. First, the company would be asked to admit to ''serious charges along the lines of what is charged in the indictment,'' said one Government official.
In addition, Exxon would be required to contribute up to $550 million to a fund for restoring the environment. The company would be asked to pay $150 million into the fund right away and would provide installments of $50 million up to the agreed-upon total as studies showed that further restoration was required.
But if the case goes to trial, nothing is certain. Although it is possible that conviction on all five counts could lead to substantial penalties, there is no certainty that a court will accept the Justice Department's formula for setting fines. This formula calls for penalties equal to twice the economic costs suffered by private parties and government agencies because of the spill, plus twice the value of natural resources damaged by the spill, which killed thousands of birds and animals.
The Justice Department said a conservative estimate for the fines would be more than $600 million, but Exxon has already disputed the legal basis for that calculation.
 
Alaska Had to Agree
By contrast, the penalties involved in the plea bargain might not have been as high, but the settlement would not have been open to dispute.
Many political figures, environmentalists and Wall Street analysts believe that once the outline of the plea bargain became public late last week, the Government, fearful of appearing lenient, toughened the terms.
''That plea bargain was a sweetheart deal that did not go down well with environmentalists and the state,'' said Sarah Chasis, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Frank P. Knuttle, a financial analyst with the brokerage firm Prudential Bache, said: ''If the Government started taking the goodies away, Exxon might just have said 'no way.' They had a deal, then Washington started backing away.''
Throughout the negotiations, the company had insisted that Alaska officials agree to the final settlement; otherwise, Alaska could argue in its civil suits that it never endorsed the assessment of environmental damages as set forth in the plea bargain.
Alaska's Attorney General, Doug Baily, said in an interview today that each time he sought changes to the proposed plea bargain, Mr. Stewart would say that the changes needed to be checked with Exxon. In that sense, he said, Exxon always had the last word. Some Alaskans objected to that perception - even though, in a sense, any defendant or prospective defendant has the final say in plea bargaining, since no defendant can be forced to plead guilty.
 
Optimism at the Start
Federal officials said they initially felt optimistic that a settlement could be reached, but as negotiations proceeded over the next two weeks, Alaska officials raised a series of objections. One of their major concerns was the ''forebearance'' component of the plan, in which the Federal Government said it would delay the filing of civil lawsuits for a four-year period after the settlement of the criminal charges.
That arrangement would not have prevented Alaska from filing its own suits, as it has done. But state officials said they needed the Federal Government's help in preparing their civil lawsuits during the four-year period. Federal prosecutors said the provision would not bar them from preparing the suits, but would only keep them from filing such suits. This disagreement eventually proved central to the state's rejection of the proposed settlement.
 
Unwilling to Go Further
During the ensuing two weeks, a series of discussions took place. By the end of last week, state officials indicated they would not support the agreement. Without the state's approval, the company was unwilling to go further.
A spokesman for Gov. Steve Cowper of Alaska said today that state officials had been kept in the dark about the imminence of the indictments even as they met with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh one hour before the announcement that the charges had been filed.
Alaskan officials complained today that they had been subjected to intense pressure from the Justice Department to accept a plea bargain they did not like - pressure that they resented..
''They came down on us with this heavy hand of take it or leave it,'' one state aide said, The stock market reacted negatively today to the indictments, with the price of Exxon's shares falling $1.38. to $47 a share. Analysts said uncertainty over the size of the financial penalties that the company may now face had led to widespread selling.
''There is no way of quantifying the ultimate liability the company faces,'' said William H. Brown 3d of Kidder Peabody.

HEADLINE: A SPLINTER PARTY FORMED IN ISRAEL

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Five Likud members of the Israeli Parliament, 13 percent of the party's strength in Parliament, announced the formation of their own opposition party today, putting Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who is already in deep political trouble, in an even more excruciating predicament.
Faced with an imminent and unavoidable decision on whether to go forward with his plan for Palestinian elections or to let the proposal die, Mr. Shamir and his aides say they are, to use a common Israeli adage, ''between a hammer and an anvil.''
If the Prime Minister chooses to stall or kill his elections proposal, the Labor Party says it will bring the Government down, and the United States Government is likely to give up hope and reduce support for the Shamir Government.
But if Mr. Shamir chooses to go ahead with the plan, members of his own party led by Ariel Sharon and the dissidents who made their announcement today, plan to try to vote him out of office. 
 
Calls for Resignation
Already some Likud members are calling on Mr. Shamir to resign, while others - including several close allies of the Prime Minister - are openly upset.
Justice Minister Dan Meridor, one of Mr. Shamir's closest aides, said: ''It's a struggle with the United States, with the Arabs. But it's also a political struggle with Labor, which is trying to change the Government, and to my sorrow also a struggle within the Likud.''
Another senior aide said today: ''The pressures are enormous. I don't think there has been a time like this. The room we have to maneuver, well, there is none. He cannot govern without the support of his party.''
Mr. Shamir, under pressure, is considering moving ahead with his plan for Palestinian elections. And as numerous officials commented, today's troubles give only a hint of the anger and violence that Israel will probably face from within if the Government ever does actually try to make peace with the Palestinians.
 
Decision in 2 Weeks
Speaking to a parliamentary committee on Tuesday, Mr. Shamir promised to decide within the next two weeks whether to accept the American and Labor Party terms for attending a meeting of foreign ministers from Israel, Egypt and the United States next month - the first step toward opening direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians.
A senior aide who spent the morning with Mr. Shamir today said he had not made up his mind. Earlier this week, aides said, he had decided to accept the American terms and ''break the siege by moving ahead with the process,'' as a senior Government official put it at the time.
But once word of that decision became known, the right-wing opposition grew to be so intense that Mr. Shamir is now reconsidering, the aides added. On Tuesday evening his office issued an unusual public statement saying ''everything that has been published indicating that the Prime Minister has given his consent'' to the American plan for starting talks ''is without basis.''
At issue is the composition of the Palestinian delegation that would hold talks with Israel. The United States has indicated that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d will not attend the three-way meeting until agreement is reached on this question.
 
On the Delegation
Under the American plan openly endorsed by the Labor Party, the delegation would include at least one Palestinian deported from Israel and at least one resident of Arab East Jerusalem.
Fearing that Mr. Shamir will accept those terms, even some of the Prime Minister's allies within the Likud and his own office are openly questioning him.
Several officials said Mr. Shamir was particularly concerned that Benjamin Begin, the son of the former Prime Minister who is a Likud Parliament member and an important political figure in his right, was upset and might defect from Mr. Shamir's camp. Mr. Begin would not return phone calls today.
In an interview today, Mr. Sharon, head of the large and growing dissident faction within the Likud party, said that the three-way Foreign Ministers' meeting ''is the red line we would not like Mr. Shamir to cross.'' If the Prime Minister does cross the line, Mr. Sharon says he will be able to call another meeting of the Likud Central Committee, at which Mr. Shamir might lose a no-confidence vote by his own party.
 
Party for 'Zionist Idea'
This week, 23 of the Likud's 40 members of Parliament signed a letter demanding that Mr. Shamir explain himself before the Parliament. After word of that became public, three or four of those people came forward to tell the Prime Minister that they were still with him, though they were concerned.
Still, a senior aide said the Prime Minister now counts between 13 and 15 of the Likud's Parliamentary factions as inalterably opposed to Mr. Shamir and his elections plan while another five, at least, are troubled and wavering.
The five who formed their own minority party today are headed by Economics Planning Minister Yitzhak Modai, and the separate but affiliated group is calling itself ''The Party for the Promotion of the Zionist Idea.''
Mr. Modai declined to rule out the idea that this group might abandon Likud altogether and join the Labor Party. Already, the defection of these five from Likud has made Labor Israel's largest political party with 39 seats, compared with 35 for Likud.
Along with the dissent within Likud, Mr. Shamir must fight three smaller far-right parties that control seven seats in the 120-seat Parliament. They openly declared war this week.

HEADLINE: Senators Debate Ways of Using Military Savings

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The Senate abruptly opened debate today on whether to use the anticipated reductions in military spending for tax cuts or to finance domestic programs, including education and anti-drug efforts.
The debate was the first time that lawmakers have taken to the floor to lay out their priorities for how to allocate the ''peace dividend'' expected to result from diminished East-West tensions. It came as an unexpected finale to the Senate's consideration of a bill to create a new voluntary national service program, and it set Democrats against Republicans with competing visions about what to do with money that both sides agree has yet to materialize.
Neither side offered a vision of how American military forces or national security priorities should be changed, although that was not the point at issue. 
But the low-key debate, punctuated by recitations of conflicting budgetary and economic statistics, instead offered a preview of how the battle lines will be drawn in the fights to come over cuts in the capital gains and Social Security taxes and the appropriate spending levels for scores of domestic programs that lawmakers in both parties support. To many lawmakers, Republican and Democrat, liberal and conservative, the peace dividend will plainly serve as a catalyst in the effort to try to transform the domestic agenda.
 
Gramm Starts the Debate
''The halls are filled with those planning new programs and new expenditures,'' said Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who began the debate by offering an amendment expressing the sense of the Senate that any military savings beyond those needed to balance the Federal budget should be returned to ''the long-suffering American taxpayer.'' While it is to early to proclaim a peace dividend, he said, it is not too early to plan for it.
Democrats, who were expecting Mr. Gramm's move, quickly weighed in with their own nonbinding amendment stipulating how savings from the military budget should be used. The amendment called for applying them first to balancing the Federal budget without using the Social Security surplus, referring to the issue raised by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who proposed cutting Social Security taxes.
The Democrats said their other priorities were ''urgent'' national concerns, including anti-drug and anti-crime efforts, education, health care and the environment, and then tax cuts for ''working men and women.''
''Before we start indicating what's to be done with a peace dividend, before we start creating a desire for a tax cut, or creating a desire for anything else,'' said Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and who sponsored the Democratic amendment, ''we should first address the issue of is there going to be a peace dividend.''
Mr. Sasser noted that President Bush's proposed budget for the 1991 fiscal year would actually increase military spending and said that if there is any peace dividend to be declared Congress would have to carve it out.
There is no consensus on how large the peace dividend is likely to be or when it is likely to become available. But few doubt that the reduced international tension will allow the United States to spend billions of dollars less on the military in this decade that was believed possible only a few months ago.
But Mr. Sasser saved his real fire for the issue of tax cuts, reiterating Democratic contentions that the reductions in capital gains taxes sought by President Bush would benefit only the wealthiest Americans, while those with lower incomes face rising taxes because of the Social Security payroll tax.
By the time it was all over, the Senate very nearly adopted both amendments. Mr. Gramm, who praised Mr. Sasser for acknowledging the need to balance the budget, declared that he had no trouble voting for the Democratic measure, because it was ''kind of like kissing your sister.''
Mr. Sasser's measure was approved on a vote of 79-19, and Mr. Gramm's then lost narrowly, 50-48.

HEADLINE: Successes of New York's High Schools Aren't Credited Enough

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Two news articles that appeared side by side Feb. 12 - a report on trying times for guidance counselors and a column about low test scores for black children in South Africa and the United States - present two facets of the same problem.
Perhaps the time has come for us in New York City to recognize that there is indeed a typical teen-ager, a youngster who comes from a (usually) single-parent family facing severe economic pressures, where English may not be the home language, where housing and neighborhood are of such poor quality as to be life threatening and where few role models are available for emulation.
Today, the school truly acts ''in loco parentis,'' for the school is called upon to provide a host of life-sustaining services. To say that George Wingate High School, Boys and Girls High School and Prospect Heights High School achieve only 2 percent of their students graduating with a Regents diploma is to miss the point. These schools, and many others like them, receive youngsters who are reading and writing on a fourth-grade level, yet that these schools are successful in moving youngsters to the point where they can pass a Regents competency test in reading and writing is a remarkable achievement. 
Perhaps we should also recognize that the four-year high school career of yesterday is no longer relevant today. At Newtown, we receive students overage for their grade who come to us with horrendous life experiences, from countries undergoing social upheaval, knowing no English. That these students take more than four years to complete their high school education is surely not a criticism of the students or of the school. It is a minor miracle that in the time these students spend with us, they not only learn a new language and adjust to a new culture, but also gain sufficient proficiency to go on to college or into the world of work.
The problems facing these students are indeed overwhelming, and guidance counselors are overwhelmed by these problems. As your article points out, guidance counselors deal with problems ranging from physical and sexual abuse to health and housing. Academic counseling is the least of their responsibilities. Counselor caseloads are such that of necessity they can deal only with the most pressing issues.
At Newtown, we not only feed students, but also provide English classes for their parents. We work closely with Elmhurst Hospital and other community organizations to meet the many needs of our population. In addition, we fulfill the traditional role of a school, providing courses to meet the needs of students at all levels of academic interest and ability.
Schools do not shrink from their responsibilities, but we need the support and the understanding of the greater community. The request by the Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, for increased personnel in all schools was made in recognition that if he is to succeed in his mission, and if the schools are to succeed, we all must recognize the extent of the problems and make a commitment to solve them.

HEADLINE: Change in Europe Demands New U.S. Policy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
President Bush proposes decreasing United States troops in Europe to 225,000, while maintaining the initiative in nuclear warfare by development of the Stealth bomber, ''Star Wars,'' mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles and sea-based nuclear missiles (front page, Feb. 1). At the same time, Washington and Bonn insist that a future reunified Germany cannot be neutral and will be militarized, thus presumably taking sides in a unilaterally maintained cold war. 
These contradictions have not passed unnoticed in the European press. Following reunification of Germany and completion of Soviet disengagement from Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union will not have any troops deployed outside its own borders in two or three years. There is no longer justification for United States armed forces in Europe or to enhance the military potential of the United States or any country in Europe. United States armed forces in Europe in the post-cold war 1990's are of no benefit to the people of either continent. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization military alliance was an outcome of a particular historical situation. In the wake of its deconstruction, there is no basis for foreign military presence on European soil.
The 25 percent military portion of the United States budget is a major deterrent to solving such problems as America's huge debt payments and decay in its social and economic infrastructure (education, medical care, the banking system, the design and technological level of industry).
A good deal of fresh-thinking glasnost and radical perestroika is required in the West, not simply modification of the policies of the last 40 years.

HEADLINE: Nicaragua, Victory U.S. Fair Play

BYLINE: By David K. Shipler; David K. Shipler is a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Nicaraguan election has proved that open, honorable support for a democratic process is one of the most powerful foreign policy tools at Washington's disposal. It is more effective than the sordid practice of using the Central Intelligence Agency to engineer coups and secretly finance political parties. It is more legitimate than military force, and, in this case, it has been more decisive.
In dislodging the Sandinistas, Nicaraguan voters have done peacefully what the U.S.-backed contras could not do violently. The few million U.S. dollars that financed international election observers and made the centrist opposition viable were much better spent than the hundreds of millions that purchased weapons and cost thousands of lives. 
Some will argue that without the contras' military pressure, President Daniel Ortega Saavedra would not have agreed to hold elections at all. It is true that partly because of the confrontation with the U.S., Nicaragua's economy suffered terribly, setting the stage for the widespread public discontent with the Sandinistas reflected in Sunday's balloting.
But few governments become moderate during a war; the contra war strengthened Sandinista hard-liners and probably contributed to their oppressive policies. The way to resolution opened only when Congress suspended the war, in effect, to give the Sandinistas a chance to proceed democratically. International scrutiny, spurred by President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, provided the context in which voting could be conducted in a relatively free atmosphere.
By that time, considerable groundwork had been laid for about five years with small grants from the National Endowment for Democracy, a nongovernmental institution wholly funded by Congress. La Prensa, the opposition newspaper of the new President-elect, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, was kept afloat with newsprint and other supplies subsidized by the endowment. Money went to build a centrist democratic movement, to bolster an independent trade union, to train oppositionists in organization and campaign techniques and to persuade voters to register.
Thus, Nicaragua's election has vindicated Washington's fledgling program of providing public, above-board funding to help democratic procedures take root in countries with authoritarian regimes.
But there are cautionary notes and subtler morals to this story. One is the virtue of supporting the electoral process rather than a particular party.
Last fall the Bush Administration foolishly proposed making direct contributions to the opposition's campaign. The endowment was poised to convey the funds until some of its supporters on Capitol Hill objected; the endowment's board then voted to rebuff the Administration and hew to the line that had been drawn elsewhere in the past: funds to enhance the fairness of the election, not to promote the success of a candidate.
The line was quite thin in Nicaragua. Congress voted $9 million, most of which went through the endowment, to help the opposition level the playing field against the Sandinistas' power to muster the resources of government. Under the law, the opposition could use U.S. funds to purchase cars, fax machines and other equipment - but not to buy bumper stickers, produce buttons or print campaign posters. The distinction was probably lost on most Nicaraguans, although the opposition obviously overcame the stigma of being Washington's client.
Significantly, the nonpartisan funding proved the most important - for the get-out-the-vote campaign, in which Nicaraguans were reassured repeatedly that their ballots would be secret, and for the monitoring teams, which publicized and curtailed Sandinista harassment of oppositionists.
The money intended to help Mrs. Chamorro's campaign most directly was probably the least effective. Most equipment and payments were delayed by Sandinista bureaucrats until the last three weeks, too late to have much impact. Her victory suggests that such campaign aid was unnecessary.
Now the Administration has pledged economic aid, but Nicaragua also needs help in building democratic institutions - an effective legislature, an independent judiciary and a free press. A strong U.S. commitment to that effort would be a sign of a lesson learned.

HEADLINE: Low U.S. Savings Rate: It's A Myth

BYLINE: By Robert Eisner; Robert Eisner is professor of economics at Northwestern University.

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill.

 BODY:
The buzzword now is ''saving.''
President Bush has proposed a program to lift a national saving rate that, we are told, is far too low. Our saving rate suffers by comparison with the Japanese, and with our own past. All this threatens long-term decay, if not disaster.
The fault lies, supposedly, in private profligacy and public budget deficits. The failure to pay enough in taxes, or to curb excessive government handouts, encourages our proclivity to live high on the hog, to think only of the present. 
There are some real issues here, but they are hard to discern among the statistical distortions and self-serving political rhetoric.
It should be neither surprising nor alarming that the U.S. is generally saving less than many other countries, especially those that are growing more rapidly. Rapidly growing nations have to save more, since more capital must be acquired to produce more output.
As higher levels of income are achieved and growth rates taper off, saving rates decline. And saving rates have indeed been declining in the rest of the world. For example, net national saving in Japan, as a percentage of net national product, declined by 7.9 percent from 1976 to 1987.
As they are usually presented, moreover, our deficiencies in saving are badly overstated. The rest of the world follows the sensible United Nations systems of accounts, in which government investment in roads, airports and other infrastructure is classified as public saving. Perversely, we do not. If we did, our net national saving would have risen by $53 billion in 1988, from 2.95 percent of net national product to 4.17 percent - an astonishing 41 percent.
Net saving consists of all activities that increase future production and income. Thus, we add to our children's income not only by saving to leave them a bequest but by investing in their education so that they can be more productive.
But education is not counted in conventional saving. Nor is spending on the environment, infrastructure and research and development, or consumer spending on durable goods like cars and clothes washers. But these all contribute to future income, and thus should be considered saving.
Using an appropriate, broader measure of saving, the real saving rate would rise to about five times the conventional rate that has occasioned nearly universal hand-wringing. But that does not mean that the national saving rate is not a problem. Rather, it points to the true nature of the problem and the absurdity of many of the recommended solutions. We are told, for example, that we must reduce the budget deficit to raise national saving. Yet there is ample evidence budget deficits have contributed to more conventional saving, as the deficits stimulate the economy.
Larger deficits, it is true, bring more consumption. But they also inspire more private investment, as businesses respond to increased sales by increasing their plant. This investment, in turn, increases income, providing more than enough additional private saving to finance the greater deficits.
To the extent that they slow the economy, reductions in the deficit and other devices to reduce public or private spending may well reduce saving - even by its narrow, conventional measure.
But it is in the vast and critical amounts of public saving, not included in the conventional measures, that we are indeed gravely deficient. Our 13-year-olds score last in international tests of math and science skills. A third of an American generation is in the process of growing up illiterate or semi-literate, utterly unequipped to function productively in a technologically advanced society.
We lag in expenditures for basic research. A ''war on drugs'' is given primacy, but the means are sorely lacking. Planes are delayed in landing - and crash - at our overcrowded and understaffed public airports. Billions more are proposed for dubious military defense against a presumed international menace that is crumbling before our eyes.
Here's a simple proposal for Congress: Stop starving the public, national saving that provides the real defense of our future in deference to self-imposed accounting constraints and fiscal myths.
Bring Federal accounting into conformity with the rest of the world by counting public investment as saving. In one stroke we will ''solve'' the phantom saving problem and make a start on our real problem of underinvestment in the future.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Bush and Managua

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
The overwhelming defeat of the Sandinistas in Nicaragua has left the Bush Administration with an obvious first order of response - the immediate disbanding of the ''contra'' army organized and directed by the United States and still in place along the Honduran border.
The next step for Washington is equally obvious and equally important - to find means to help the new Chamorro government not only to take power peacefully but to govern successfully. Money, even the ''big bucks'' specified by Bob Dole, the Republican Senate leader, will not be enough.
The logic of disbanding the contras - and of sending them no more U.S. dollars for anything but repatriation - is apparent. In the first place, the Sandinistas fought the C.I.A.-created rebels for too long to turn over control of Nicaraguan armed forces to the new government, if reason exists to believe the contras will either renew the war or move into Nicaragua as an organized political force. Keeping the rebels in being would create that suspicion. 
The demobilization of the contras, moreover, was the other prong of the Central American peace plan that led directly to the free elections in which the Sandinistas were defeated. By holding those elections and letting the people vote without hindrance, the Sandinistas met their part of the bargain - and that's true even if international pressures left them little choice. Now it's only fair, honorable and good hemispheric politics for the U.S. to honor the other half of the plan - even if the contras resist being sent home, or into exile.
In fact, they were supposed to be disbanded before Sunday's elections, under the terms of the peace plan. The U.S. nevertheless continued to send them ''non-lethal'' aid, allowing their continued existence, on grounds that their threatening presence on the Nicaraguan border was necessary to guarantee that free and fair elections would be held. They were, and no conceivable need for a rebel army remains.
Finally, Dona Chamorro's new government could only be damaged if it appeared to be dependent upon, or to welcome, the support of an army organized by the C.I.A. and operating from foreign bases. The new president will have enough troubles without having to explain such a situation.
Those troubles go far beyond an effective takeover of power in Managua. The Sandinistas lost the election - as it appears from here - because the Nicaraguan people were tired of war and sick of economic deprivation. The war should now be over, which will help but by no means rectify the dismal economic conditions that the new government will face.
The Bush Administration is offering such financial aid as it thinks it can afford, and to lift economic sanctions as the Sandinistas relinquish power. That's the least Washington can do to redeem hardships it did much to create; but Nicaragua's real need will be harder to meet.
Arturo Cruz Jr., a former Sandinista and a former contra, predicted the possibility of Dona Chamorro's victory in a recent speech to the Americas Society in New York. But he also pointed to the hemorrhage of a half-million or more skilled artisans, professionals and managers who had fled Nicaragua during the Sandinista regime. As a result, he said, an influx of ''money capital'' could not rebuild an economy suffering most grievously from the loss of so much ''human capital.''
That loss, he suggested, was a major factor in the decline of Nicaraguan exports from $780 million in 1978 to an expected $200 million this year. Exports are necessary to earn the foreign exchange that could bring an end to the crippling shortages felt throughout the nation's economy.
How to make up for the huge outflux of essential workers, Mr. Cruz said, would be the major problem for Nicaragua, no matter who won the election and no matter how much aid in money the U.S. provided. Many of those workers now are more advantageously employed in Florida and elsewhere than they could be if they returned to even a newly democratic Nicaragua.
Without economic success, Violeta Chamorro will find it hard to achieve political stability - as has another widow of an assassinated leader who was elected President not least in his memory, in the Philippines. To help Dona Chamorro overcome her country's daunting economic problems is thus a necessity for democracy in Nicaragua, and an obligation on the Bush Administration as imperative as the disbanding of the contras.

HEADLINE: No-Fault for Doctors Is Called Feasible

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
A system of no-fault medical malpractice insurance, which would compensate victims of medical injury without a judicial finding of negligence, would not cost significantly more than the existing liability system, according to a state-sponsored study of malpractice in New York hospitals that was released yesterday.
The study projects that a no-fault system in New York State would cost a little more than $1 billion, approximately the same amount currently being spent by New York doctors and hospitals for malpractice insurance premiums.
The study conducted by a team of Harvard University researchers is considered by health-policy experts to be the most thorough survey of malpractice conducted in the nation.
It also concludes that the incidence of negligence in public hospitals is 50 percent higher than in private nonprofit hospitals and three times higher than in for-profit hospitals. 
The researchers speculated that the severity and complexity of cases at public hospitals, where illness is often complicated by drug abuse, AIDS and poverty, increases the likelihood of negligence.
Some preliminary results from the study, including the rates of injury and negligence, were reported by news organizations in late January. But additional results were released yesterday, including the conclusions about the cost of a no-fault malpractice system and the comparative rates of negligence at different hospitals.
 
Effect on Opponents
The findings about cost may diminish a major argument made by opponents of the no-fault malpractice insurance plan proposed recently by the state's Health Commissioner, Dr. David Axelrod. Opponents have contended it would be inordinately expensive to compensate all victims of malpractice for their lost wages and fringe benefits, the value of their household work and their medical costs.
The criticism of Dr. Axelrod's proposal, which was first floated in a speech in January, has also examined whether a compensation system that carries no threat of litigation would provide adequate deterrence to poor medical practice.
''One of the reasons why the no-fault idea in the malpractice field has been a non-starter is this sense that the cost is unmanageable,'' said Paul C. Weiler, a Harvard law professor and one of 12 researchers who conducted the Harvard Medical Practice Study. ''These numbers are startling to us because you can't rule out the no-fault idea on the basis of cost alone.''
The researchers who conducted the four-year study found that 3.7 percent of all hospital patients are injured as a result of their medical care and 1 percent of all patients are treated negligently.
 
Calculating the Cost
The study also concludes that the net compensable losses suffered by patients in New York hospitals in 1984, the year chosen for the analysis, amounted to $894 million when adjusted for inflation to 1989 dollars. In 1988, the latest year for which figures were available, doctors, hospitals and other health-care organizations in New York paid approximately $1 billion in malpractice premiums, according to the study.
Because of the administrative cost of a no-fault system, which was estimated by the researchers to be at least 20 percent of the $894 million in compensable losses, the price of a no-fault plan in New York would also probably exceed $1 billion.
The researchers calculated the cost of a no-fault plan by surveying nearly 800 malpractice victims about their economic losses and applying the results to the state's estimated pool of injured patients.
Many legislators in Albany consider no-fault medical malpractice insurance a radical prescription with little chance of becoming law. It has generated intense opposition from trial lawyers, who are concerned about the loss of both patients' rights and lawyers' fees, and from consumer advocates, who believe the best deterrent to poor medical practice is provided by the threat of legal action augmented by more vigorous state policing of the medical profession.
 
Study Called Biased
Even before the study was released, critics began to attack its methodology, particularly its means of determining negligence and its calculation of the cost of a no-fault system. A critique written for the New York State Bar Association by Maxwell J. Mehlman, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, said the study is ''heavily biased in favor of no-fault.''
But the no-fault concept has gained some momentum recently. Last week, President Bush directed his Domestic Policy Council to propose solutions to the country's malpractice litigation crisis, and White House aides said a no-fault system is one option that should be explored.
Dr. Axelrod, who has a history of pursuing politically difficult initiatives like universal health care, has not issued a detailed proposal for a no-fault plan, but he believes such a system would extend compensation to more malpractice victims. He also believes a no-fault system would protect doctors from the increasing insurance premiums that are driving many specialists from their fields, especially obstetrics.
Under a no-fault system, all victims of medical malpractice could file claims with an independent panel, much like a workers compensation board. Awards for compensatory damages would be made from a pool of funds created largely by insurance premiums paid by doctors and hospitals, though other sources, like insurance companies and the state, could be called upon to contribute.
The study, which analyzed the cases of 31,429 patients at 51 hospitals, found that eight times more patients suffered an injury because of medical negligence than filed malpractice claims and that 16 times as many suffered negligence than received compensation through litigation.

HEADLINE: The Battle Of Bedtime: Children Won

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
STEPHEN CECCHETTI, an economist who lives in Columbus, Ohio, says his 2-year-old son Daniel stays up every night until 10 or 10:30. Mr. Cecchetti would like Daniel to go to bed earlier, but he doesn't insist. ''We're not disciplined people,'' says Mr. Cecchetti, whose wife, Ruth Charney, is a mathematician.
Bedtime was far different when he was growing up. ''My father had rules,'' said Mr. Cecchetti. ''You could fight, but it wouldn't do any good.''
In many American households, a child's bedtime has become a flexible matter. While parents remember being sent to bed at 7 P.M., their children are going to sleep at 9, 10 or even 11 at night. Almost all the experts agree that bedtimes are later and structure less rigid because of the increasing number of single-parent families and dual-income families. 
''Kids are staying up late because they want to see their parents,'' said Ellen Galinsky, a child development expert who is co-president of the Families and Work Institute in New York.
Some are up late because their hectic lives leave them wound up. Others are watching hours of television. And some parents are unable or unwilling to exert the kind of authority over their children that earlier generations did.
Child development experts say there is nothing necessarily wrong with later bedtimes, if the children make up for it on the other end. ''As long as they're getting enough sleep, it doesn't make too much difference,'' said Richard Ferber, director of the Center for Pediatric Sleep Disorders at the Children's Hospital in Boston and an assistant professor of neurology at the Harvard Medical School.
Indeed, later hours can be a sign that children are participating in a rich family life. Morris Wessel, a pediatrician in New Haven who is a clinical professor of pediatrics at Yale, said some children go to sleep because they are bored. ''If the parents don't stimulate their kids, it's not worth staying awake,'' he said.
But late bedtimes can become a problem when a child starts school and can no longer sleep later in the morning or take naps. Bedtime then must be changed to allow for earlier rising.
Some parents are apparently not making the change. School officials report an increase in the number of children who are cranky and tired.
''We have kids who can tell me what's on David Letterman,'' said Susan Korn, the guidance counselor at Public School 3 in Manhattan's West Village. ''They're so tired, they're really not focused.''
The change in bedtime seems to be occurring in big cities and small towns, among the rich and the poor. ''I have first graders going to bed at 9:30 or 10,'' said Ruth Tetschner, principal of the elementary school in Dallas, Pa., a small town in the northeastern part of the state. ''One first-grade teacher has had children fall asleep in the classroom.''
Teachers, pediatricians and therapists who work with families say children tend to go to bed earlier when they are from families where one parent stays home during the day. When both work, the evening's activities begin and end later.
Nancy Lisagor, editor of a new magazine in Philadelphia called Metro Kids, said her two sons, who are 4 years old and 15 months old, go to bed at 8:30 or 9. ''I think that's terribly late,'' she said. ''I think they should sleep 12 hours, and they don't.''
But she said they aren't ready to sleep earlier. ''They get excited at the end of the day when everybody is all together,'' she said. Ms. Lisagor tries to keep the weekends relatively quiet so the children can get plenty of rest.
Later bedtimes represent a greater integration of the child into the evening life of the family. ''We've always been a society that was split in terms of children and adults,'' said Yvonne Young, a New York social worker who sees children and families.
In Europe, there is more mingling of different ages. When Ilike Pesenti moved to New York from Milan five years ago, she was shocked to see American parents putting their children to bed at 7. ''It's very convenient,'' she said. ''But do they really go to sleep? And when do they get to see their parents?'' Children in Italy often join their parents on evening outings, especially in the summer when they don't have to get up for school. ''If the parents want to have fun, they take the child with them,'' said Mrs. Pesenti, who has two children. ''A Mediterranean mother would not depend on a baby sitter.''
Not all children need the same amount of sleep. Dr. Ferber of the Pediatric Sleep Center said some parents expect a child to sleep for 12 hours and become frustrated when the child who needs only 10 hours refuses to go to sleep or stay asleep.
Like adults, children today generally have busier lives that leave them tired but restless at the end of the day. Many of them attend special programs before and after school because both parents are working. Like their parents, they seem to use the weekend to catch up on sleep.
''For the most part, they are very overscheduled,'' said Carol DeVine, principal of Caedmon School, a private school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. ''Fatigue creates tensions. They go from school to class. It takes some time to wind down.''
Today's adults are generally more lax in their attitudes toward child rearing, and it shows up in bedtimes, said Michael Ferrarese, a psychologist with a private practice in Eagon, Minn. ''The kids are likely to just fall asleep on the couch,'' he said.
This may be due to the increase in the number of families in which both adults work. Peggy Marble, director of the Christ Church Day School in New York, says parents who work may be less able to tolerate the crying or protests from children that sometimes greet an early bedtime. ''It is a painful way for them to end the day,'' she said.
Generally, school officials say that preschool and elementary school children from families with two working parents tend to go to bed at 9:30 or 10, while children from households in which one parent stays home tend to go to bed at 7:30 or 8.
Gretchen Lengyel, co-director of the Madison Playgroup in New York, said later bedtimes are understandable. ''Young parents who are climbing up the corporate ladder get home at 9 or 10,'' she said. ''They are desperate to see their children. They leave the baby sitter instructions to have the child take a long nap so they can stay up later.''
Ms. Lengyel believes that more than a quarter of the children in her school are not getting enough sleep, which leads to less productive days.
''They can't make choices,'' she said. ''They get frustrated by a puzzle that is within their capability. They can't settle an argument over who is going to wear the fireman's hat.''
Sometimes children go to bed later than their parents, usually because they are transfixed by television. One 11-year-old girl who lives in New York with her father said she rarely goes to bed before 10:30. She stays up late, by herself, watching television in her room. She said she is often so tired in math class that she keeps her hed upright by resting it on her hand.
Even if the child manages to get the needed sleep, later bedtimes may cause trouble for parents. ''It is important for parents to have some time to be with each other,'' said George Lazarus, a pediatrician and associate clinical professor of pediatrics at Columbia University.
Parents who cannot make a bedtime stick may find the school doing their job for them. John Melser, the principal at P.S. 3, said many of the children sent to him as troublemakers go to bed at 10 or later, and they are tired. For those occasions, he has an immediate solution.
''I bring that cot down,'' he said, pointing toward a wall of his office, ''and they drop off very quickly.''

HEADLINE: In the Weill Empire, Some Mixed Results

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Sanford I. (Sandy) Weill built one Wall Street empire with a keen eye for value that helped make up for the fact he did not start with a lot of money.
Now, he has a lot of money, a new empire and is discussing putting together the biggest brokerage house of them all, a combination of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, which he now controls, and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which he built and then lost.
If the two are combined, the result would be a firm that is bigger than Merrill Lynch, long Wall Street's largest retail firm in terms of registered brokers.
Mr. Weill's Wall Street reputation has flourished despite disappointments for those who ''invested with Sandy'' when he returned to the financial community more than three years ago. Investors who bought shares in the company he ran, now called the Primerica Corporation, have seen them underperform the general stock market since then, although the company has produced good earnings. 
Primerica may be best known on Wall Street as the owner of Smith Barney, but the brokerage house plays a relatively small role in the success of the company, which is largely built on making small consumer loans and on selling insurance policies to Main Street America.
The insurance and consumer finance operations provided 75 percent of Primerica's profits last year, a proportion that Samuel Liss, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, forecasts will rise to 77 percent this year. He expected Smith Barney's share of the corporate profits pie to shrink to 10 percent, from 11 percent.
But while Mr. Weill's financial empire may not be centered on Wall Street, there is little doubt that a part of his heart is there. Starting as a partner in a small firm in 1960, he engineered a series of mergers that eventually left him in command of Shearson Loeb Rhodes. In virtually all of those mergers, Mr. Weill bought when brokerage firms were not doing well and when the firms being taken over had troubles. In 1981, he sold Shearson to American Express, where he rose to president before departing in 1985.
Mr. Weill, who is 56 years old, got back into the financial fray in October 1986, when the Control Data Corporation, a computer maker that had diversified into consumer lending, signed him on to run its Commercial Credit subsidiary as it was sold to the public in an intial public offering. The shares were priced at $20.50 each, a bit below what the company had hoped for, but the fact that the sale went as well as it did was widely ascribed to Mr. Weill's standing on Wall Street.
 
Steady Profits
Those shares initially performed well, hitting a peak of $34.625 in 1987, as financial services companies were the stars of Wall Street. But after the stock market crash they fell to a low of $17.
Mr. Weill seems to have done a good job at Commercial Credit, getting out of a variety of businesses, including lending to companies, to concentrate on the lucrative business of making second-mortgage and personal loans to consumers around America. Profits rose sharply in the first year he ran Commercial Credit and have risen steadily since.
Mr. Liss of Salomon puts the pretax profit margins there at 26 percent last year, meaning that for each $4 in revenues, the company manages to earn $1 before taxes. But Wall Street has not been eager to pay much for those profits, in part because of worries that in a recession many loans could default.
In 1988, Mr. Weill made his way back to Wall Street with a deal to take over the old Primerica Corporation. That company was the former American Can Corporation and was being run by Gerald Tsai, a star money manager in the late-1960's bull market whose reputation took a tumble along with stock prices as that decade ended.
 
Can Operations Sold
Making his comeback, Mr. Tsai redirected Primerica into financial services, selling the can operations at prices well below what they would have fetched a few years later, while paying high prices for financial services operations. He capped that buying spree shortly before the crash by paying $750 million for Smith Barney a few months before the crash. Having overpaid, Primerica needed a buyer.
After Commercial Credit took over Primerica in a $1.5 billion deal, mostly for Commercial Credit stock, the surviving firm was renamed Primerica, helping to confuse many an investor. While that deal may prove to have been a good one in the long term, it has done nothing for the stock price so far, in part because the new company pays a small dividend of just 32 cents a share a year. The old Primerica had paid high dividends, and many of those holders have been selling.
Cash had been pouring out of Primerica before the takeover, but that has turned around. While insurance operations remain the most important part of the company, Smith Barney's results have improved to show a record profit last year of $63 million, before writing off $13 million in ''good will'' stemming from its acquisition. In a move typical of Mr. Weill, the brokerage swooped down and acquired a part of Drexel Burnham Lambert's retail network last year at almost no cost.
All told, the new Primerica reported 1989 profits of $289 million, or $2.87 a share. But the shares, even after rising 25 cents, to $26.875, yesterday, are trading at less than 10 times last year's profits, and just eight times estimates of this year's earnings. Those are not impressive figures, and reflect the general disrepute in which financial services companies are now held.
But Mr. Weill, while he may be a man of Wall Street, has never been especially enamored of its collective wisdom. He built his first empire by making cheap takeovers of brokerage firms when others feared to do so. He wisely stayed out when prices were soaring in 1987, only to get back in at much cheaper prices in 1988. Whatever comes of the talks, the fact that he is interested in Shearson now may indicate that in the wake of Drexel's collapse and layoffs around the Street, he thinks Wall Street is undervaluing itself.

HEADLINE: G.N.P. Rate For Late '89 Put at 0.9%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The nation's economy grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of nine-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 1989, somewhat stronger than the Commerce Department had initially estimated, but still the weakest quarterly performance since 1986, even allowing for last year's long strike at the Boeing Company.
The revised figure for the gross national product was four-tenths of a point higher than the number published last month; most analysts had expected the revision would be slightly downward instead of modestly higher. The numbers also showed a surprisingly strong improvement in the nation's foreign trade situation.
Still, the data did little to alter basic assessments of economic performance, and few analysts saw the slight overall increase as a sign of economic revival. 
 
Weak Points Are Seen
''It still conveys that there is weakness in key sectors,'' said Kathleen Stephansen, an economist at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation.
There is a consensus, however, that the economy has at least stabilized. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said today, ''I think the probability of a recession has slipped below 50 percent.''
The report released today also showed that inflation ran at a 3.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter, as measured by the fixed-weight G.N.P. price index, instead of the 3.8 percent estimated last month.
The nation's international trading account was $13.6 billion better than originally estimated, today's report showed, moving from a $4.7 billion deficit to a $8.9 billion surplus. Roughly two-thirds of the change came from lower imports, and the remainder from higher exports.
 
Big Changes in Trade Data
A report on the December trade deficit, released two weeks ago, had shown an exceptionally big drop, and analysts were expecting this sector to lift the G.N.P., but the amount was well above what was anticipated.
Another heartening sign was an upward revision in the final sales category to show an advance of five-tenths of 1 percent instead of the decline of five-tenths of 1 percent that was reported last month. This suggested that consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of economic activity, was advancing at a faster, albeit modest, clip during the final three months of 1989 than previously believed.
The final sales figure removes the effects of changes in business inventories. Goods that pile up on merchants' shelves add just as much to G.N.P. as those that find buyers, so economists look at final sales for clues as to whether production levels will need to be raised or lowered.
Brian M. Jones, an economist at Lloyds Bank North America, called the final sales data 'the most encouraging'' part of the report. It shows the economy is ''certainly not recessionary,'' he said.
 
Two Negative Numbers
Two negatives in today's report were hefty downward revisions in business inventories and business investment, down $6.4 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. Those declines offset most of the gain from net exports.
The revision in the overall number seemed to catch some economists and others off stride, perhaps because of its unexpected direction, but the size of the revision was well within normal bounds.
During the eight quarters of 1988 and 1989, the average revision between the ''advance'' and ''preliminary'' reports was just over six-tenths of a point, with the largest being a 1.6 percent upward adjustment in the first quarter of 1988.
The ''final'' report on fourth-quarter G.N.P. - a second revision - is to be published a month from now.
At one time the department compiled an early ''flash'' estimate for G.N.P. even before a quarter ended, but the number was often substantially revised and its release was discontinued.
Today's revision did raise G.N.P. growth for all of 1989 to 3 percent, from 2.9 percent. This fell short of the 1988 increase of 4.4 percent and the 1987 increase of 3.7 percent. It exceeded, however, the 2.7 percent growth of 1986. <Slowest Since 1986 The nine-tenths of 1 percent rate of advance for the fourth quarter was the slowest since an eight-tenths of 1 percent increase in the third quarter of 1986. The Boeing strike is estimated to have reduced fourth-quarter output by five-tenths of a point.
Other data in today's report showed that the G.N.P. price deflator was at a 3.2 percent rate instead of the 3.5 percent estimated last month and that the personal savings rate was 5.7 percent instead of 5.8.
Current-dollar G.N.P. - the output of goods and services without adjustment for inflation - rose at a 4.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter rather than the 4.3 percent estimated a month ago.

HEADLINE: Shifts in U.S. Policy Sought To Spur Caribbean Trade

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

 BODY:
By most accounts, the 1984 Reagan Administration plan to increase American trade with 27 nations in the Caribbean and Central America has yet to become what many hailed it at the time: the catalyst needed to generate new industries and more varied agriculture among a largely poor assemblage of one-crop economies.
Even so, Congress is taking up a measure today to extend indefinitely the original 12-year Caribbean Basin Initiative, as the plan is called. And supporters are optimistic that the Senate Finance Committee will change some of the program's policies that they say have kept it from becoming the revolution in trade and industry for the region that some economists and politicians predicted.
The debate over the future of the program takes on added significance as the United States discusses ways to provide economic assistance to the ravaged economies of Panama and Nicaragua, which are eligible to participate.
While there have been strong gains for many products, like flowers and electrical equipment, many countries have been slow to turn out new exports that are being encouraged under the program's liberalized trade rules. At the same time, tariffs and quotas on more traditional exports, like sugar and textiles, have remained in force. Relaxation of these policies is sought. 
''The initiative has had some impact on our economies but it certainly hasn't lived up to what many of us expected,'' said Derick R. Heaven, the Jamaican representative to the United Nations. ''There is a long list of commodities that have duty-free access to the U.S., but most of these are not things we have the capacity to produce in large quantities.''
Mr. Heaven's temperate remarks stand in contrast to those of some politicians and economists six years ago who suggested that the initiative would quickly bring about a historic shift in global investment from the bubbling, upstart economies of the Far East to the muggy and somnolent ports of the Caribbean.
Overnight, the program eliminated import duties on all but a handful of goods shipped to the United States. Soon afterward, increasing amounts of American Government aid and private investment began to flow to many countries in the region.
Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida and a sponsor of a bill to extend the program, said, ''The impact of C.B.I. has been significant but diluted by other events, like the declining quota of sugar entering the U.S. from C.B.I. nations, which occurred around and independent of it.''
 
Three Products Excluded
The mixed appraisals reflect the frustrations of the officials of many Caribbean countries that the initiative's potential to help them has been greatly tempered by the exclusion of three of the region's most important products: sugar, textiles and petroleum products.
Despite wider doors for the bulk of the region's exports, tariffs and quotas on these products and falling commodity prices combined to cause an annual drop of $2.3 billion since 1983 in the total value of United States imports from the Caribbean Basin countries, according to a recent State Department report.
In defense of the program, United States officials say the main cause of the Caribbean countries' deteriorating balance of trade with this country is the $4 billion drop in the value of oil exports from three countries, Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas and the Netherlands Antilles.
The officials say that since the Caribbean initiative began, exports of products exempted from duties have grown more than 46 percent, or at an average annual rate of 5.2 percent.
 
The Major Gains
The most significant export gains for the Caribbean region during the last six years have been in apparel, electrical equipment, fruit, flowers, winter vegetables and shellfish - all defined under the program as non-traditional exports. Traditional exports include sugar, coffee, bauxite, bananas, cocoa and rum.
Testifying in February before the Senate Finance Committee's Subcommittee on International Trade, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, said the region's nontraditional exports to the United States ''have been increasing so fast that for the first time in 1988 they exceeded the value of traditional exports, compared to representing under one-quarter of our total imports from the region in 1983.''
Mrs. Hills cited the growth of the nontraditional goods, as opposed to the region's mainstays, as ''concrete evidence that the C.B.I. is making progress in helping the economies in the region diversify and achieve self-sustaining growth.''
 
U.S. Companies Active
A number of American companies have reacted enthusiastically to the program, taking advantage of the region's low labor costs and the initiative's tax exemptions to perform offshore labor-intensive tasks, like the assembly or finishing of goods, on this country's doorstep.
One American company that has shifted much of its manufacturing from the Far East to the Caribbean, introducing new industry to the region, is the Conair Corporation, a Princeton, N.J., manufacturer of blow dryers and other small appliances.
''Right now we have 250 people employed in Costa Rica and will probably have about 600 people there in the next year or so,'' said Arthur A. Taylor, director of imports for Conair. ''We are saving a couple of million dollars a year on duties alone'' because of the program, he added.
But many business executives and lobbyists for the region say that without greater access to the American market for the region's traditional export products, like sugar and textiles, sustained economic growth in much of the Caribbean will remain elusive. Textiles is a fairly recent growth industry, Sugar Imports Down Sharply ''There has been more unemployment caused by our sugar policy than jobs created by our basin initiative,'' said Peter B. Johnson, executive director of Caribbean/Central American Action, a Washington-based organization of American and Caribbean businesses.
Sugar imports from Caribbean producers to the United States, which has its own sugar industry, are restricted and have fallen sharply since 1984. Attempts to lower or eliminate tariffs on clothing have stumbled in the face of powerful union lobbying efforts.
In her testimony to the Senate, Mrs. Hill opposed one proposal that would guarantee a minimum volume of sugar sales by Caribbean Basin countries to the United States. She said such a provision would violate United States commitments to end support for suagr production under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
The House of Representatives recently approved a floor for sugar imports when it passed a bill to indefinitely extend the life of the initiative. But at the same time, the House rejected the elimination of duties for textiles and footwear.
 
Hopeful on Textile Plan
Senate supporters of new Caribbean Basin legislation and lobbyists representing Caribbean governments and companies doing business in the region say they are optimistic that the Senate Finance Committee will approve lower barriers on garments made of fabrics cut and formed in this country when it takes up the matter next week.
Senator Graham said he hoped that with Administration support Congress would soon approve more generous textile provisions. But citing Mrs. Hill's opposition to easing sugar restrictions, he said passage of a new measure for that commodity was less likely.
Even with gaps remaining in some trade categories considered vital by eligible countries, Mr. Johnson of Caribbean/Central American Action said, ''The initiative has clearly helped them reduce the devastating impact of falling sugar, oil, coffee and other commodity prices, over which they have absolutely no control.''

HEADLINE: Talking Deals;
The Bass Profits In Savings Bailout

BYLINE: By Nathaniel C. Nash

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A FAVORITE pastime of banking experts in late 1988 was to try to figure out which were the sweetest of the deals the Government had struck to sell insolvent savings and loan institutions to investors.
Such analyses focused on tax breaks that gave the new owners the right to offset taxes with huge operating losses from the sick institutions and guaranteed yields on certain assets that assured profits for as many as 10 years to come.
One of the most celebrated deals was the purchase in December 1988 by the Robert M. Bass Group of the American Savings and Loan Association of Stockton, Calif., the country's largest ailing savings institution. In return for a $400 million investment, Mr. Bass, the Fort Worth billionaire, received control of an institution with $30 billion in assets and more than 170 branches in California. 
A little more than a year later, Mr. Bass's institution, renamed the American Savings Bank, has stunned analysts with news that it earned $214.2 million in its first year - making it one of the most profitable savings and loans in the country.
But regulators and analysts who have looked closely at the deal say Mr. Bass did not profit from a Government handout. While he did receive a healthy dose of tax breaks and guaranteed profits, a larger portion of American Savings' 1989 earnings came from fortuitous changes in the industry and the fact that Mr. Bass purchased an essentially healthy institution whose bad assets had been cleaned out.
''The transaction left the Bass group wth a relatively clean thrift institution, which they subsequently managed in an intelligent way,'' said R. Dan Brumbaugh, senior fellow at the Center for Economic Policy Research at Stanford University and a former deputy chief economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. ''And that is exactly the kind of transaction that the Government should attempt to negotiate, the point being that an acquirer should be left with a solid institution with which to go forward.''
What is more, these people say, the institution's profits will be cut because a ruling by the Office of Thrift Supervision in January rescinded some lenient regulatory provisions. In Mr. Bass's case, the change will force him to invest an additional $240 million of the company's profits into the institution to increase its capital.
What helped American Savings most in 1989 was probably the major rally in the bond market, which pushed interest rates down, and a program by the Government to force sick savings institutions to stop paying excessively high rates on deposits.
As market rates fell, American Savings found that the value of its loans rose sharply, and it began a program of selling large volumes of fixed-interest mortgages and corporate bonds at a big profit, replacing them with adjustable-rate mortgages.
At the same time, it was able to reduce drastically the rate it paid on its deposits, in comparison with other big California institutions, by almost a percentage point.
Mario Antoci, the chairman of American Savings, said last month that the institution made $50 million on the sale of loans and earned another $50 million by lowering its cost of deposits. About $40 million in profits was attributable to closing some branches, laying off personnel and other cost cutting, he added. The institution benefited greatly from two arrangements it had made with the Government.
One involves an $8 billion, 10-year note from the Government that American Savings carries as an asset. This note essentially replaced bad loans in the old American Savings that were not passed on to Mr. Bass. Some competitors see this as a guaranteed profit stream for the next decade, since the Government agreed to pay an interest rate that was initially 2.25 percentage points above the average cost of deposits for California savings institutions.
Although that premium drops to 1.75 points by January 1992, analysts note that there is little administrative expense to servicing that giant loan, unlike an $8 billion portfolio of mortgages, and estimate that the profits could total more than $40 million a year, or almost $500 million through the end of the century.
Bass officials disagree, saying their profit margins are much thinner and that profits from the 10-year note will depend on how efficiently they run the institution.
The second area that assures profits is the $2.2 billion in losses from the old American Savings. That can offset taxes on future earnings. While that may seem high, the final payoff will be far less, since American Savings will have to pay 75 percent of its tax savings to the Government. Thus, officials calculate the institution's net savings at less than $200 million.
Regulators and analysts said that in the end the real value that Mr. Bass bought was American Savings itself, with $15 billion in consumer deposits that do not flee in hard times. They give Mr. Antoci high marks for the dramatic one-year turnaround and note that the institution is now a conservative traditional savings and loan, which makes a profit on the difference between what its pays for deposits and charges for mortgage loans.
Indeed, American Savings' one real bust of 1989 was a foray into high-risk bonds: the purchase by American Savings of $493 million in ''junk bonds'' just before the market began to crumble.
''And would you believe that the portfolio was a very conservative one?'' one Bass official said. ''It was just the worst time in the history of the world.''

HEADLINE: Home Resale Rate Off 2.2%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes declined 2.2 percent in January, as rising mortgage interest rates and the usual winter lull combined to reduce sales to their slowest pace since last summer, a real estate trade group said today.
The National Association of Realtors said resales of single-family homes totaled a seasonally adjusted 3.48 million units in January, compared with 3.56 million one month earlier. It was the slowest pace since the rate of 3.44 million last August.
Surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation show that the interest rate on fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages rose from 9.83 percent to 10.05 percent during January.
The association's survey found the median price of an existing home to be $96,200, up 4 percent from December and 7.1 percent from January 1989. The median means half of the homes cost more, half less.
The only increase in resales occurred in the South, where 1.4 million units were sold on an annual rate, up seven-tenths of a percent from December.
The West had the biggest decline, down 11.5 percent, to 540,000 units. The Northeast posted a 3.4 percent drop, to 560,000 units. The Midwest had a decline of 2 percent, to 960,000 units.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Sees Slow Growth

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said today that he expects that economic growth in the first three months of the year will be ''slow but positive.''
 
His remarks helped bolster
Wall Street stocks, which had already been buoyed by a Government report showing the economy grew by a stronger pace in the last quarter of 1989 than had been estimated. 
 
Testifying before the House
Budget Committee, Mr. Greenspan was asked whether he thought the first three months of this year would show similar results to the fourth quarter.
''I expect the growth rate to be slow but positive,'' he said.
Mr. Greenspan said that weakness in durable goods manufacturing had made the economy resemble a tire with a slow leak. On Tuesday, the Government reported that durable goods orders plummeted by a record 10.5 percent in January.
''That leak has ended,'' he said. ''The system is no longer eroding. It has stabilized and has not exhibited any weakening.''
Mr. Greenspan told the panel that although the danger of a recession had been increasing most of last summer and into the fall, ''the period of highest vulnerability probably came in the fall.''
He added that whenever growth was slow, the economy was vulnerable to a recession, but chances of one occurring soon had dropped.

HEADLINE: Prices Paid To Farmers Decline 0.6%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Prices farmers received for raw products declined six-tenths of 1 percent from January to February, but the overall commodity index still averaged 2.7 percent more than a year ago, the Agriculture Department said today.
Lower prices for milk, eggs, lettuce and wheat were mostly responsible for the decline from January, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary report. The report said higher prices for cattle, chickens and tomatoes partly offset the decline for the other commodities.
''Tomato prices for February were at the highest level of record,'' the report said. ''During the past two months prices have been about twice the previous record established in March of 1985.''
The price climb reflected short supplies caused by the December freeze in Florida, the report said.
On the other hand, the report said the drop in milk prices paid to farmers - which had been at record levels - was the largest month-to-month decline ever recorded. The egg price drop was the third largest ever.
The report did not include new figures on farm expenses. Those are computed every three months. In January, however, quarterly figures showed that prices paid by farmers were up 1.1 percent from October, the previous reading, and averaged 2.9 percent more than a year earlier.
Department economists say the net cash income of farmers in 1990 may be in the range of $52 billion to $57 billion, compared with about $53 billion in 1989. Net cash income is the money that farmers have left from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash expenses.

HEADLINE: Stocks Advance a Third Day; Dow Up 10.13

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stocks rose for the third session in a row yesterday on moderately higher volume, and the Dow Jones Industrial average, which was up more than 28 points in the early afternoon, finished 10.13 points higher at 2,627.25.
So far this week, the Dow has risen more than 63 points.
Advances on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered declines, 917 to 565, as volume rose to 164.4 million shares, from 152.6 million on Tuesday.
It appeared that once again the movement of the stock market in Tokyo had little impact on the course of equities in the United States. The 225-stock Nikkei index climbed 694.04 points, or 2.05 percent, relatively a much larger increase than the Dow, which gained only four-tenths of 1 percent. Indeed, some analysts characterized this week's upward move by equities as primarily technical in nature. 
''The stock market is exhibiting a markedly more durable tone in the midst of what appears to be a massive shift in both trading psychology and industry leadership,'' said Eugene E. Peroni Jr., chief technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia.
''The Dow's technical features are improving from the standpoint of both breadth and volume, and stocks are showing a more tolerant attitude toward the unsettled Japanese market and conjecture about the course of interest rates.''
Traders said prices were buoyed early in the day by futures-related trading and a comment by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, that he expects slow but positive growth in the nation's first-quarter gross national product.
 
Durable Goods Weakness Ends
Traders noted that in his remarks, Mr. Greenspan also said that weakness in durable goods manufacturing had ended. On Tuesday, the Government reported a 10.5 percent drop in durable goods orders for January, the biggest decline on record.
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index moved up 1.63 points, to 331.89, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 0.91, to 183.07.
The Dow transportation average continued strong, rising 12.80 points, to 1,129.09, on the collective strength in airline issues. UAL rose 2 1/2, to 131; AMR 7/8, to 60 3/8; Delta Air Lines 1 1/4, to 69 5/8, and USAir 2, to 32.
Among individual issues, American Express added a point, to 29 1/8. The company said it had held preliminary talks with the Primerica Corporation and its Smith Barney, Harris Upham unit about achieving economies of scale with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which is 61 percent owned by American Express.
Shearson gained 5/8, to 12 5/8. The company announced that as part of a cost-cutting plan designed to save about $400 million a year, it would cut its employment rolls by about 2,000 people during the first quarter.
Boeing jumped 2 1/4, to 63 7/8. Howard Rubel, aerospace analyst with C.J. Lawrence, citing a positive outlook for earnings, reiterated his ''buy'' recommendation on the company because of the prospects of sharply accelerated earnings.
Digital Equipment soared 6 points, to 78, in late trading as rumors circulated that Japanese companies were accumulating Digital stock in order to make a bid for the company.
Union Carbide rose 1/2, to 24 1/4, on continued but unsubstantiated rumors of a possible takeover of the company or a sale of some of its units.
Active glamour stocks included Exxonei, off 1 3/8, to 47; Philip Morris, down 5/8, to 37; Pfizer, off 1/8, to 59; General Electric, up 1/4, to 61 3/4, and A.T.&T., up 1/8, to 39 3/4.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 1.50 points, to 352.90, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index jumped 3.22 points, to 425.83.
In over-the-counter trading, Intel rose 3/4, to 40 1/4. Thomas Kurlak, Merrill Lynch analyst, reiterated a ''buy'' recommendation on the company on expectations of continued demand for its proprietary 32-bit microprocessors used in high-end personal computers.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Makes Broad Gains Against Mark and Pound

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Making one of its first broad upward moves of the year, the dollar yesterday rose against the mark, the pound and the Swiss franc.
But dollar selling for Japanese yen by the Federal Reserve helped stem any gains against the flagging yen, whose weakness played a major role in the steep declines in the Japanese stock market last week and on Monday. Both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan have been selling dollars since Friday in an effort to support the yen. 
Traders said the dollar's rise was not initiated by any economic news or significant change in the economic outlook in the United States or Europe. Rather, they said the move appeared to be an adjustment, or correction, to the too sharp drop of the dollar against the mark and other European currencies in response to the proposed unification of Germany and the opening of Eastern Euorpe.
These events drew money to the mark and other European currencies so investments could be made in hopes of profiting from the economic developments. The dollar has fallen sharply from the 1.84 level last November, when the Berlin wall was dismantled, to 1.65 marks to the dollar this year.
''This is a correction of the downward trend that was exaggerated,'' said Robert A. White, vice president at First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. Will Trend Continue? But he also warned that he was not sure if the trend would continue. ''The market has had a habit of not following through this year on trends,'' he said.
In late trading in New York, the dollar was at 1.7045 marks, up from 1.6887 on Tuesday and 1.6681 a week ago. The dollar also gained against the pound. At the close yesterday, a pound was worth $1.6765, down from $1.6890 Tuesday and $1.7145 a week ago. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was at 1.5000, up from 1.4850 Tuesday and 1.4800 a week ago.
Against the yen, the dollar ended at 148.92, up from 148.73, but below the 149 level at which it has been trading.
Alan C. Leveten, managing director at Balfour Maclaine in New York, said the fall of the pound against the dollar was partly a correction of the pound's sharp rise this year that has made it once of the best-performing currencies of the year. The sharper-than-expected widening of the British current account deficit also hurt the pound.
Francoise Soares-Kemp, vice president at Credit Suisse in New York, said the rise in the dollar appeared to be ''a precautionary move'' because of the uncertainity surrounding the developments in Germany and Eastern Euorpe. She said this uncertainity should continue until at least the elections in East Germany on March 18. But she said that after that, if the unification began to go smoothly, the mark would strengthen again and the dollar would weaken.
Mrs. Kemp also said the mark was hurt by a report that the Deutsche Genossenschaftsbank A.G. was involved in dispute with a group of French banks over a bond deal that could involve as much as 600 million marks, about $352 million.

HEADLINE: WORLD DRUG CROP UP SHARPLY IN 1989 DESPITE U.S. EFFORT

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
The State Department reported today that global production of opium poppies, coca, marijuana and hashish soared in the last year. This occurred despite President Bush's highly publicized effort to curtail drug supply and demand.
Worldwide drug abuse has also increased, as higher yields have pushed drug traffickers to aggressively seek out new markets, the report said.
The State Department's report has become an annual admission of the inability of the United States to single-handedly fight the war on drugs, which it has portrayed as a crisis of global proportions beyond the ability of the United States to control.
 
Some Successes Claimed
The document cited some encouraging developments, including record drug seizures; the capture, extradition and imprisonment of leading traffickers; the seizing of assets; new international treaties of cooperation, and new laws against money laundering. But it acknowledged that these limited successes were far overshadowed by the failures. 
''Worldwide narcotics production reached new levels, corruption undermined enforcement efforts, and a number of governments still failed to exhibit a serious commitment to reducing drug production and trafficking,'' the report said. It singled out as particularly troublesome corruption among officials in Bolivia, Thailand, Laos and the Bahamas. A similar problem was reported among Syrian officials operating in the Bekaa, Lebanon's major narcotics cultivation, refining and trafficking region, which is under Syrian control.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, said: ''Corruption remains a major problem wherever narcotics are produced or trafficked. And there are governments which simply seem unwilling to stand up to the trafficking organizations and take the tough actions necessary to rid their countries of the scourge of drugs.''
 
Administration Defended
This year's report did not repeat last year's candid admission that the United States had subordinated the ''drug control agenda'' to concerns that punishing drug-producing countries with weak economies and political institutions might further destabilize them. It also stopped short of reiterating the 1986 directive by President Reagan that elevated drug trafficking to a national security issue.
Rather, it praised the Bush Administration's drug control strategy that aims to ''disrupt and dismantle the multinational criminal organizations that support the production, processing, transportation and distribution of drugs to the United States and to other nations.''
In testimony on the report to a House Foreign Affairs task force on drugs today, Melvin Levitsky, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Matters, defended the Administration strategy against lawmakers' attacks and explained that it had only been in effect a ''very short time.'' He attributed the rise in drug production in part to the unwillingness of governments to ''go after the poor elements of the population growing opium or coca.''
''The figures are not what we'd like to see,'' said John P. Walters, chief of staff to William J. Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. ''We're disappointed but I'm not surprised. It reflects the fact that we are doing a better job at demand than supply. That is why we have proposed expanded programs in Latin America to begin to better stem the flow of drugs.''
Mr. Walters emphasized that that past figures have not been as accurate in ''presenting the level of the problem'' and that global drug production ''is not something that radically increased over the last year.''
But in light of the increased production figures, Representative Larry Smith, a Florida Democrat, criticized the Bush Administration for not being tough enough against governments that have failed to cooperate. ''We are slipping backward badly,'' he said.
In one major shift in strategy, the Administration no longer considers aerial eradication of drug crops, especially coca, as the key to curbing production, as it has been in for a number of years. Last year's report, for example, called aerial spraying the only way to significantly curb cocaine production.
But coca-producing countries have routinely opposed plans for eradication efforts largely because they would cause vast economic dislocation, political unrest by stripping peasants of their livelihood and severe environmental problems in the tropical forests. For example, Bolivia, second only to Peru in coca production, in 1989 eradicated only about 6,175 acres of coca, half of its own legal target and less than one percent of its total production.
''These countries are not our country,'' Mr. Levitsky said, acknowledging the limited influence of the United States in persuading countries to eradicte their drug crops.
The report estimated that from 1988 to 1989, the production of opium increased by a staggering 47 percent. Coca production increased 12 percent among the four coca-producing countries: Peru, Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador, while hashish rose 16 percent. Estimates of marijuana production were up 210 percent, most of it in Mexico, although much of that increase reflects an improved methodology based on new United States satellite surveillance, rather than an outright increase in production, the report said.
 
Heroin Threat Cited
A major concern, according to the report and senior Administration officials, is the increase in opium production, which it said threatens the United States ''with a potential heroin epidemic.''
David L. Westrate, assistant administrator for operations at the Drug Enforcement Administration, told the Congressional task force that heroin might eventually become a bigger worry that cocaine, which in its smokable form - crack - has caused such serious addiction problems in the United States in recent years, particularly in its inner cities. Heroin problem may worsen dramatically in the next 10 years, he said, because it is grown in so many regions of the world, in countries that use diverse traffic routes. By contrast, 80 percent of the world's supply of cocaine comes from the processing and distribution networks of one country, Colombia.
The drug production increase is even more dramatic when compared over five years. Since 1985, opium production has increased 187 percent, coca 43 percent and marijuana 502 percent. Burma, for example, which last year suspended all narcotics control programs, doubled its opium production last year.
In Afghanistan, opium production has increased significantly over the last decade, much of it in areas controlled by United States-backed Afghan guerrillas. It is feared, the report said, ''that once hostilities end, refugees will turn to poppy cultivation during the period of economic disruption as they seek to rebuild a livelihood interrupted by 10 years of war.''
Another significant finding of this year's report is that Mexico produces 10 times more marijuana than the United States has previously estimated, making it by far the world's leading marijuana grower.
 
Ties With Mexico Strained
The report emphasizes that the increase does not suggest a sudden surge in production but that previous estimates based largely on data provided by the Mexican Government were far too low. Nevertheless, the assertion already seems to have further strained relations between the two nations.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly last week, for example, Mexico's Attorney General, Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, strongly ruled out any United States-Mexican military cooperation in the war on drugs. The revised estimate in the case of Mexican marijuana also highlights just how imprecise the estimates of production can be.
The report cited ''widespread corruption'' in Bolivia's judiciary, police and some military units as a ''major impediment'' to the country's drug eradication and interdiction campaign. But it fell far short of a recent classified internal State Department memorandum stating that Bolivia's performance almost always indicates lack of commitment to anti-drug efforts.
Accompanying the annual report is a statement in which the the President declares whether a foreign country is eligible for American aid. Under a law passed in 1986, the President must certify by March 1 that countries where major drug trafficking occurs are ''fully cooperating'' in anti-drug efforts as a condition for receiving aid.
Despite the negative tone of the State Department's report, the penalties that the United States imposed were few and mild.
 
No Ally Penalized
In fact, no ally of the United States has been penalized in the last four years for lack of cooperation, and there has been growing sentiment in Congress that the law is flawed because it is applied selectively. In practice, penalties are imposed only against those countries where United States Government believes it has little to lose politically or economically.
That pattern was repeated today. Mr. Bush announced mostly symbolic penalties against four nations with which the United States has no relations or has severely strained relations: Afghanistan, Iran, Syria and Myanmar, former Burma.
In a statement of explanation, Mr. Bush said he was formally lifting the decertificaion imposed last year against Panama, because the new Government of Guillermo Endara ''immediately demonstrated a willingness to fully cooperate with the United States,'' and against Laos, because American-Laotian counternarcotics cooperation had improved.
Lebanon, an important drug producer and transit point, was cited as needing to do more to cooperate with the United States. But it was certified as ''fully cooperating'' because it is Syria that actually controls the Bekaa region.

HEADLINE: SENATORS ACHIEVE ACCORD WITH BUSH ON CLEAN AIR BILL

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
After weeks of negotiations in closed sessions, Senate leaders today diluted some provisions of their proposed clean air legislation to meet President Bush's demand for a less costly solution to the nation's pollution problems.
Announcing the result of negotiations with the White House, the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, said the bill was ''sound comprehensive legislation'' that would reduce acid rain, urban smog and toxic chemicals released in the air by industry.
The White House said the senators, in settling for less stringent standards and a slower cleanup schedule, had satisfied in part Mr. Bush's demand for anti-pollution measures that do not pose risks to the economy.
 
Action in Senate Scheduled
The agreement cleared the way for a Senate action on the bill, which is to start next week. The original bill had been approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee last fall. A separate clean air bill is before a House committee. 
The President's chief domestic policy adviser, Roger Porter, said that while the Administration would support the package announced today with the Senate, it may seek further changes in the House.
The senators gave ground on several points. They agreed to stretch out the first stage of new regulations on automobile emissions to 1995 from 1993 and to allow a second stage, with even stricter limits on carbon monoxide and other pollutants, only under certain conditions.
On acid rain, the Senate leaders agreed to allow power plants in Western and Midwestern states to continue burning low-sulfur coal for a longer period. When burned, low-sulfur coal produces sulfur dioxide, the major component of acid rain.
 
Economic Impact Cushioned
Senators from the affected regions wanted this provision to cushion the economic impact of reducing pollution from coal-fired power plants.
The senators also softened a plan to reduce the risk from toxic substances released into the air by industrial plants. This step will lower the costs to industries for reducing airborne toxic chemicals.
Both sides hailed the agreement as a fair compromise that would lead to significant improvements in the nation's air quality and in the protection of public health. But environmental groups and several senators said they had serious objections to many of the provisions and would fight for amendments on the Senate floor.
Gene Karpinski, director of the United States Public Interest Research Group, an environmental and consumer advocacy organization, said, ''The clean air bill went into the back rooms and it looks like a dirty air bill is coming out.''
William Fay, administrator of the Clean Air Working Group, the chief industry lobby working on the legislation, called the compromise ''a move in the right direction.'' But he added that industry still had ''some problems'' with the legislation, particularly with the proposed rules for airborne chemicals.
The compromise removes the threat of a White House-sponsored filibuster in the Senate. In particular, senators from the Midwest and West objected to provisions for reducing the pollution from coal-fired power plants that cause acid rain, contending they would put a heavy burden on industrial and residential customers and hurt the coal industry.
Senator Mitchell repeatedly stated today that he could not have prevented or ended a filibuster without a negotiated agreement. The agreement strikes a middle position between the ambitious cleanup requirements of the Senate bill drafted last fall and the less expensive approach of the legislation proposed by Mr. Bush last summer.
 
Under $21 Billion Yearly
When negotiations started in late January, President Bush said he would not accept legislation that exceeded the costs of his own proposal. Mr. Bush estimated the cost of the Senate bill at $41 billion a year and the annual costs of the Bush proposal at $19 billion a year.
Mr. Porter, the assistant to the President for domestic and economic affairs, who headed the Administration negotiating team, said the package announced today would cost the nation ''under $21 billion'' a year.
''The President is extraordinarily pleased with this agreement,'' Mr. Porter said, adding that the concessions made by the Senate resulted in a bill that would provide important environmental benefits ''in an economically efficient way.'' But in saying the White House might push for additional amendments in the House, Mr. Porter seemed to be reserving the right to further reduce the cost.
 
Serious Problems Remain
The legislation still faces a long and difficult path to enactment.
A number of senators, environmental groups and industry spokesman said today that they had serious problems with provisions of the compromise. Amendments are likely to be introduced and debated at length on the Senate floor. And there are many differences between the today's compromise and the clean air legislation that is before the House committee.
The proposed amendments to the Clean Air Act of 1970 are intended in part to provide new tools for reaching the unachieved goals of the original law. Despite deadlines that were originally described as mandatory, many areas of the country were unable to comply with requirements for reducing urban smog and toxic air pollution, even with repeated extension of deadlines by Congress. The initial deadline for controlling smog in urban areas, for example, was 1975.
Senate negotiators gave ground on several critical points. They agreed to stretch out the first stage of a crackdown on pollution from auto tailpipes, originally scheduled to take effect in 1993, over a three year period ending in 1995. The negotiators also agreed to impose a second round of more stringent restrictions on auto exhausts, scheduled to go into effect in 2003, on a mandatory basis, only if 11 of 27 cities now seriously polluted are still out of compliance with the maximum pollution levels by the end of 2001.
The Administration, which originally strongly opposed a second round of auto emission controls as being too expensive, has now accepted the additional controls on a conditional basis.
 
Los Angeles an Exception
The compromise bill envisions that all cities will come into compliance with the law's anti-smog requirements within 5, 10 or 15 years, depending on the current severity of the problem. An exception is made for Los Angeles, the city with the nation's most polluted air, which would be given 20 years.
Both the Senate and the Administration had proposed that chemical producers be required to install the ''maximum available control technology'' to reduce the volume of toxic gases sent into air. The controls would be installed over the next 2 to 10 years, depending on the chemicals involved.
The Senate also called for mandatory additional controls if, after the original equipment had been installed, people living near the plant were still exposed to a cancer risk of more than 1 in 10,000 over a 70-year lifetime of exposure to the pollutants. The Administration wanted additional controls only if deemed necessary by the Environmental Protection Agency on a case-by-case basis.
The agreement retained the second round of controls based on estimates of risks to human health. But it changed the method by which the risks were calculated in a way that would reduce the number of people protected.
The Senate and Administration were in basic agreement on the goal for acid rain control from the beginning. Both wanted a 10-million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants in the Midwest by 2000, with the first reduction coming at a preliminary deadline of 1995. They also called for a ceiling on future pollution from power plants at levels not exceeding emissions in 1980.
Sulfur dioxide, along with nitrogen oxides, are the precursor chemicals of acid rain, which has been found to damage aquatic life and buildings in the Northeast and Canada. Currently more than 20 million tons a of sulfur go into the nation's air each year, 17 million of which come from power plants.
But many senators in the Midwest argued that the cost of reducing sulfur dioxide would place a heavy costs on utilities, which would then be passed on to industrial and residential customers. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and other Senators from states that produce coal with a high percentage of sulfur, said they feared that coal miners' jobs would be lost as utilities switched to low-sulfur fuel to meet the new requirements.
Bowing to these concerns, the Senate leaders and the Administration extended the initial deadline to 1997 from 1995 for plants that choose to reduce sulfur dioxide by using scrubbers on high-sulfur fuel rather than switching to low-sulfur coal.

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
C.I.A. Says a Gorbachev Removal Is the Sole Threat to Soviet Change

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
The Director of Central Intelligence said today that changes in the Soviet Union's political and economic structure had progressed so far that only the removal of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and a forced return to Stalinist-style government could reverse them.
In testimony to the House Armed Services Committee, the director, William H. Webster, acknowledged publicly for the first time that reactionary opponents of Mr. Gorbachev's policies could seek to remove him from office, possibly by force, if the Soviet Union's economy and internal order continue to deteriorate.
Although Mr. Gorbachev's allies have increased their political standing in recent months and he now appears secure in office, the Soviet leader's long-term prospects for remaining in power are uncertain, Mr. Webster said. 
Even if a coup against Mr. Gorbachev were to succeed, he said, the Soviet Union would be so consumed by its internal economic and political difficulties that it would probably pose no increased threat to the United States or Europe. 'Win-Win Situation' for U.S. ''Soviet citizens are increasingly impatient with low living standards, shortages, rising crime, ethnic unrest and other problems,'' Mr. Webster said. ''Labor unrest could intensify this year, raising serious new challenges to central authority and further constraining the economy. Under such circumstances, it is possible that reactionary forces opposed to President Gorbachev's reforms could move to oust him.''
The chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, called Mr. Webster's statement ''ground breaking,'' adding that Mr. Webster was almost saying the United States is in ''a win-win situation'' with regard to the Soviets.
Mr. Webster's remarks represent the intelligence agency's view of the Soviet situation and Mr. Gorbachev and, in general, reflect the assessment that the C.I.A. is providing to the White House.
Within the intelligence bureaucracy, however, some experts question whether Mr. Gorbachev is still leading the crusade for internal change, as Mr. Webster's statement suggests, or instead has already moved toward the right to pacify his conservative critics.
 
Little Room for Middle Course
In his most direct public statements on the Soviet changes to date, Mr. Webster said the Soviet political process had become so polarized between advocates of revisions and reactionary opponents that ''it has become clear that a middle course is no longer viable.''
Mr. Webster indicated that he expected the rapid pace of Soviet internal change to continue as long as Mr. Gorbachev remains in power. He also made these points:
* ''A good chance'' now exists that the Baltic states - Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia - will reach agreement with Moscow on a peaceful transition to independence ''during the next few years.''
* Local elections in the 15 Soviet republics this spring ''will probably strengthen the reform process and give additional authority to legislative institutions at the expense of the party.''
* It is highly unlikely that the Soviet Union could reassert its authority over the formerly Communist states in Eastern Europe, in part because such an effort would require military expenditures that the crippled Soviet economy could no longer tolerate.
In the Soviet Union, he said, ''the internal political process there is tending toward a polarization between those demanding retrenchment and others who seek more radical reforms.''

HEADLINE: Asian Population in U.S. Grew by 70% in the 80's

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
A sustained wave of Asian immigration in the past decade fueled a 70 percent increase in the Asian population of the United States from 1980 to 1988, said a report made public today by the Census Bureau.
The bureau reported that the Asian population grew nearly seven times as fast as the general population and three times as fast as the black population. Asian Americans numbered about 6.5 million on July 1, 1988, up from 3.8 million eight years earlier, the report said.
The increase changed the political and social landscape of California, where more than one-third of those from Asia and the Pacific islands settled. The rise is largely due to the influx from the Philippines, China, South Korea and India, said officials of the bureau and of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
Asians and Pacific Islanders are in a heterogeneous category, the officials said. Many are native Americans who trace their descent to China, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Japan, the Philippines and Micronesia. Some trace their origins to the Indian subcontinent.
 
Combining of Statistics
The figures in the census report are extrapolated from data derived from the 1980 census, during which those who participated with the census-takers classified themselves a white, black, Asian or American Indian and, if necessary, Hispanic.
These figures were then combined with the Federal Government's annual birth and death statistics and with immigration and emigration data from the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Census demographers assigned racial categories to the immigrants of the 80's based on the way earlier immigrants from the same countries identified themselves in the census. For instance, if 95 percent of the Cambodians called themselves Asians, 95 percent of subsequent Cambodian immigrants would be considered Asian. Soviet immigrants, for the purpose of the report, were considered white.
The Census Bureau, for the purposes of this study, considered all Soviet emigres white. Under Soviet emigration law, the only ethnic groups allowed to leave the country in the 1980's were Jews, Armenians and ethnic Germans, all of whom would have been considered white by the Census Bureau.
Although some individuals will be included in a given category incorrectly, the overall estimates using this inference are statistically sound, experts said. At least 80 percent of the Asian immigrants of the past eight years were from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Micronesia and the subcontinent.
 
'It's an Unusual Migration'
The 1980's Asians, for the most part, have far higher professional and educational qualifications than most earlier groups, one expert says.
''It's an unusual migration - I don't think there's been anything like it in our history,'' said Ronald Takaki, the author of ''Strangers from a Different Shore,'' a book about Asian immigration published last year by Little, Brown & Company.
''People in earlier migrations were squeezed out of economies in transition from agriculture to industry,'' Mr. Takaki said. ''What's happenning today is that, while you do find accelerated modernization in Korea, India and the Philippines, it is not fast enough to accommodate a large new class of professional workers.''
Mr. Takaki, who is also a professor of Asian-American studies at the University of California at Berkeley, said these immigrants tend to choose the United States, in part, because its policies favor skilled applicants.
 
Factor of Reuniting Families
But Michael Hoefer, chief of demographic statistics for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, said most immigrants in the 1980's were admitted under ''family reunification'' priorities. Preference was given to applicants with relatives in the United States.
Annual Asian immigration figures ranged from 268,000 to 281,000 in the latter part of the 1980's, and the Philippines, with an average of 50,000 immigrants annually from 1985 through 1989, was the leading source of Asian and Pacific Island immigrants. The combined annual figures for China, Taiwan and Hong Kong in the same period averaged more than 40,000 from 1985 to 1989.
Mr. Hoefer said he expected the rates of Asian immigration to remain high. Since 1975, from 40 percent to 45 percent of all immigrants have come from Asian countries, including Iran and the Middle East.
The Census Bureau report, by a demographer, Frederick W. Hollmann, is the first to offer statistics on Asians and Pacific Islanders out of a general ''other'' category including American Indians, Aleuts and Eskimos.
The report says that in addition to 6.5 million Asian Americans, there are 30.5 million blacks and 20 million people of Hispanic descent in the total United States population of 247.6 million.
The increase in the black population, about 1.8 percent a year in the 1980's, was ''fueled by a higher fertility rate than that of the general population,'' the report said. There was, however, some immigration from Haiti, Jamaica and African countries like Nigeria in that period, according to Mr. Hollmann.
Immigration and natural growth were equally responsible for the increase in the Hispanic population, which grew at an average annual rate of about 3.4 percent annually from 1980 to 1988, according to the census report.
By comparison, the white population of the country has been growing at a rate of about 0.7 percent annually, a significantly lower rate than any of the minorities.
Mr. Hollmann said he was not sure how long the numbers of Asians and Pacific Islanders could continue to grow at the current rate, in part because it will take larger and larger numbers of new immigrants or a higher fertility rate simply to maintain the rate.
 
Concentration in California
More of this country's Asian and Pacific Islander population is centered in California. The Los Angeles suburb of Monterey Park has become a Chinese enclave, Filipinos are one of the largest minorities in Daly City, outside San Francisco. As of 1985, David Ward, a bureau demographer, estimated that more than a fourth of San Francisco's population was either Asian, Pacific Island or American Indian descent.
In Manhattan and Queens, New York City, in 1985, about 7 percent of the population was of Asian, Pacific Islander or American Indian descent; in Brooklyn and the Bronx the percentage was from 2 percent to 3.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Ben Hill Griffin Jr., 79, Is Dead; Leader in Florida Citrus Industry

BYLINE: By ALFONSO A. NARVAEZ

 BODY:
Ben Hill Griffin Jr., a major figure in the Florida citrus industry, died yesterday at his home in Avon Park, Fla., after a long illness. He was 79 years old.
Mr. Griffin was chairman and president of Ben Hill Griffin, Inc., one of the largest citrus producers in Florida, with 10,000 acres of citrus groves and 85,000 acres of ranch and timberland in central Florida, where Avon Park is situated. 
He was also chief executive and a major stockholder of Alico, Inc., a publicly held company that controls more than 175,000 acres of citrus groves, grazing land, oil and mineral deposits and timber. From 1958 to 1981 he was also a major producer of orange juice concentrate, including Orange Nip, his regional brand.
He became a millionaire in 1962 when his groves escaped a freeze that destroyed more than a million orange trees and caused the price of concentrate to jump to 65 cents a pound from 25 cents.
Over the years Mr. Griffin's interests also included a fruit-packing house, a canned-juice operation, a bank, a car dealership, a fertilizer plant, a country club and a 15,000-acre ranch with about 25,000 cattle. Forbes magazine listed him among its 400 richest Americans, citing him in 1989 as 261st, with estimated assets of $390 million.
''It doesn't affect my ego a damn bit,'' he said in a 1982 interview when asked about being on the Forbes list. ''There are people who would give $10,000 to get on that list. I wouldn't give 2 cents. I wouldn't give 1 cent.''
 
Started With 10 Acres
Mr. Griffin began his business empire in 1933, after studying agriculture at the University of Florida. His father gave him 10 acres of orange groves as a wedding present. Through hard work, business acumen and the seizing of opportunities, he became one of the five largest growers in Florida.
One opportunity came in 1958 when the Justice Department, acting in an antitrust case, ordered Minute Maid to divest itself of some holdings in the orange juice industry. Mr. Griffin agreed to buy a juice processing plant for $1 million, if Minute Maid financed the deal and added a packinghouse.
He was a major benefactor of the University of Florida, endowing a chair of agricultural economic marketing and establishing a citrus research and education center. The university named the stadium at its athletic field in his honor.
He was also a member of the major citrus industry organizations.
A conservative Democrat, Mr. Griffin served in the Florida Legislature for 12 years, 8 in the House and 4 in the Senate. In 1974 he ran unsuccessfully for Governor.
He is survived by his wife, Eleanor; a son, Ben Hill Griffin 3d of Frostproof, Fla.; four daughters, Harriett Harris of Bartow, Fla., Sarah Jane Alexander and Lucy Anne Collier, both of Frostproof, and Francie Milligan of Marseilles, France; a stepdaughter, Julie Chapman of Avon Park; a sister, Naomi Drane of Sebring, Fla.; 16 grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Killing Cocaine at the Source

 BODY:
What, fight drugs at the source? The very idea has prompted ridicule among many Americans who believe it simply can't work. But suddenly there's mounting reason to believe that the idea is right and the ridicule is uninformed.
Colombia's ongoing campaign against drug traffickers warrants increasing respect. And now Bolivia adds heartening evidence for the effectiveness of tough law enforcement combined with economic incentives. 
To be sure, the State Department's latest annual report on narcotics trafficking concludes, depressingly, that drug production and sales are up around the world; it mentions, among other things, past problems of corruption in Bolivia. But new data document a startling fact: The Bolivian market for coca leaves has collapsed. That means getting the Andean countries out of the drug business is a plausible goal.
In the 1980's, Bolivian dirt farmers and tin miners flocked by the thousands to the Chapare region, where they found it easy to grow coca. At harvest time, agents of drug cartels would buy the leaves and haul them away. A hundred pounds that cost about $30 to grow sold for up to $200. By last year, so many people were growing coca that the price sank to about $60. But that still provided a fine living for people used to a few hundred dollars' income a year.
The Bolivian Government, with U.S. backing, began offering the growers $2,000 per hectare to tear out coca and plant something else. But with the price of raw leaf holding up, the program sputtered. Growers eradicated only 200 hectares a month for most of last year.
Then last summer the Colombians began their offensive against drug trafficking, and in late fall, a new Administration in Bolivia stepped up its own campaign of disruption. With the cocaine market in chaos, the middlemen stopped buying raw leaves and the price plunged to $12 per 100 pounds.
Suddenly the substitution program looked more attractive. In December growers cashed in about 600 hectares, in January about 700, and the figure for February should exceed 800.
That's a significant start, but to make the gain permanent will take a larger investment. At $2,000 per hectare, it would cost $80 million to eradicate Bolivia's 40,000 hectares of coca. And success with substitute crops will inevitably require investments in roads and development aid.
While the Bush Administration acknowledges the need, Bolivia will receive only about $20 million this year. More money won't begin to flow before fall. But coca market economics won't wait. Thus Senator Joseph Biden plans to introduce legislation calling for $125 million in emergency economic aid for the Andean countries this fiscal year.
That's a sound idea. When Andean coca farmers, like U.S. drug addicts, demonstrate a strong motivation to reform, it's in every American's interest to help.

Non-Lawyers to Be Partners In Firms in Nation's Capital

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
The District of Columbia Court of Appeals adopted a rule today that will allow non-lawyers to become partners in Washington law firms, the first time that will be permitted anywhere in the nation.
The rule, which will take effect in January, comes after years of debate on the subject in many states and before such forums as the American Bar Association. It was drawn as narrowly as possible in response to the concerns of some lawyers about its potential effect, supporters of the rule say. 
The rule will require that non-lawyer partners be involved only in helping a lawyer deliver legal services. For example, an economist could help work on antitrust cases.
A firm's lawyers will be responsible for seeing that non-lawyers adhere to legal ethics rules.
 
No Outside Partners Allowed
Under the rule, investors who do not work in a law firm will not be allowed to become part-owners, a concern that has figured largely in the debates, said Robert E. Jordan 3d, a partner in the Washington firm of Steptoe & Johnson. Mr. Jordan, a former president of the District of Columbia Bar Association, was instrumental in promoting the change.
The new rule was formulated by the local bar association but required approval by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which serves as a kind of state supreme court for the District. In most jurisdictions, the highest court is the final arbiter of legal codes of professional responsibility.
A far broader proposal was rejected by the American Bar Association in 1983 when opponents voiced fears that law firms would become like variety stores, diluting their legal specialization.
In the last decade, many law firms have expanded beyond legal practice to offer services like lobbying and economic and investment counseling. Because they could not offer partnerships to lobbyists or economists, many law firms have spun off subsidiaries.
 
Firms With Subsidiaries
Arnold & Porter, for example, Washington's largest law firm, with 340 lawyers, now has three subsidiaries. These includes APCO Associates, which offers lobbying, public relations and market research services.
James Jones, Arnold & Porter's managing partner, said the subsidiaries were started partly in response to the inability to have non-lawyers as partners of the firm. But because the new rule is so tightly drawn, he said, it will have little effect on the way his firm does business, and Arnold & Porter will still need to have subsidiaries.
''If you have a non-lawyer professional who is really top-rate, that person is not going to be willing to accept the restriction that he devote himself only to legal services,'' Mr. Jones said.
Mr. Jones said the law might be used to allow firms to attract senior administrators and managers.

Information: 945-0505.
 
Sunday
 
ISRAEL FILM FESTIVAL
The Palestinian uprising in occupied territories and the Palestinian exile community in West Berlin are the backdrops for a politically charged friendship between an Israeli Jew and a Palestinian Arab in Judd Ne'eman's film ''Streets of Yesterday.'' This thriller will have its New York premiere on Sunday at 7:30 P.M., and will open the annual Lens on Israel Film Festival at the 92d Street Y, on Lexington Avenue.

Three rap groups - Third Bass, a duo of white New Yorkers who have the highest-ranking rap album on the black charts; the Jungle Brothers, whose newest record, ''Done by the Forces of Nature,'' is one of the best new rap albums, and a Tribe Called Quest, whose single ''I Left My Wallet in El Segundo'' is a surreal underground favorite - will try to make a claim for themselves on the stage.
But instead of the standard-issue self-aggrandizement of many rap acts, the three bands plan to bring something new and less single-minded to their audience.
With the huge success of the group De La Soul last year allowing for eccentricity and individuality in rap, hip-hop's vanguard has moved into richer, more detailed territory, using humor, surrealism, politics, more intricate and literate wordplay, and even more arcane and nonsensical sampling to construct records. 
Hip-hop has become a repository for nearly all recorded information. The form is capable of absorbing almost anything: a hip-hop album will use a message left on a rapper's answering machine, dialogue from B movies, classical-guitar strumming, excerpts from spoken-word albums, bass lines from a Parliament-Funkadelic album and music borrowed from just about every other source. It is the reproduction of the world, but on vinyl and under the ordering of a coherent mind. And in the similarities between groups, there is the mark of a movement.
 
'We Like to Sample'
''I see a lot of similarities between us and De La Soul and the Jungle Brothers,'' said Pete Nice of Third Bass. ''When De La Soul's record came out, our record was done and they had used a lot of the samples that we had used. It surprised me. But it makes sense, because we like to sample from things that are really out there.
''The rhymes and the word structures and patterns are more complicated now as well; we're all trying to be more ambiguous, so that a listener has to dig in more to get more out of it.''
Q-tip of a Tribe Called Quest said he agreed. ''Yeah, it's new,'' he said. ''We're known as trying to interject a new flavor alternative to the music. We don't just want to hit the hard-core crowd; we want to hit Middle America as well. Digital Underground, Third Bass, De La Soul, the Jungle Brothers: they're part of the genre. It's changing because everybody needs something different to break the monotony.
''Rap is a good medium; a million and one kids with a million and one ideas want an expression that they can use.''
The Jungle Brothers and a Tribe Called Quest are part of a loose coalition of rap performers with similar ideas about culture and politics. That association, called Native Tongues, includes Queen Latifah, Monie Love, De La Soul and Karen Wheeler.
''The whole thing just clicked about two years ago when we were touring with Latifah,'' said Mike G from the Jungle Brothers. ''We realized that we had a lot in common, shared the same thoughts about being ourselves and expressing it in our way and doing our own thing. We're all family.
''Other groups want to be like Big Daddy Kane or Heavy D, but deep down we all realize that what it is about yourselves that makes you an individual is important. And we're different because we weren't raised to be loud, and we're not for material values. We're for mental power instead.''
 
Race and Rap
Black nationalism and Afro-centric thinking has seemingly left out the white rap duo Third Bass. But the band, which is headlining the show at the Ritz, is respected by most rap performers, and it has produced music that is idiomatically accurate. More important, Third Bass's record is selling big in the black community. The duo's success and the integrity of its music point out that race in America is an endlessly complicated issue.
''Obviously, despite the similarities between us and the other groups, there are lots of differences,'' said Pete Nice of Third Bass. ''The Jungle Brothers have a more militant and Afro-centric approach, while De La Soul is just bugged out. We're white and harder than De La Soul, which I think is a reaction. We have different things to say. We've grown up differently.
''They grew up in different place, and while we've been heavily influenced by black culture - it's in our song 'Product of the Environment' -all these things have an effect.''
Among other things, the duo is actively political and anti-racist, putting it in the mainstream of the new movement. Though it is almost a novelty record, the band's newest hit, ''The Gas Face,'' is political. ''This kid Doom was saying 'gas face' all the time when he was talking about being dissed,'' Pete Nice said. ''He kept on saying it, and everybody we were hanging around with started saying it. So I decided we should do a record about it. My verse talks about record companies exploiting us, and we talk about how evil racial stereotypes can be when things like black cats are signs for bad things and the word 'black' is defined as dirty in Webster's.
''And we haven't had it easy, and neither has our black deejay, Richie Rich. When the three of us go into a store, security follows him around, and not us. Not too many white people have come straight out and said in pop music that whites are, in essence as the majority, pretty racist. It's not being said on a record. So it's important that we are saying what we are saying.''
 
A Showier Setting
That the concert is being held at the Ritz, hardly a bastion of black youth culture, is also an indication that things may be changing for rap. For the last several years, rap bills have been virtually banned from stages in urban centers all across the country. Fear of violence has made producers wary of booking rap acts. As usual, the economic consequences are felt esthetically.
Rap shows are notoriously threadbare, with little concern given to visual or performance values. Rap acts, used to playing in small clubs with little time or money, have suffered. But Third Bass puts on a good show, and a Tribe Called Quest says it intends to try.
''We're going to come out with black capes that I made, which will freak the audience out,'' Q-tip of the Tribe said. ''Then music drops. I can't tell you what will happen after that, except that we'll be wearing Afro-centric garments. We definitely have a big show, and it won't be violent. The type of people who will come aren't about violence: they're into listening and having a good time. People will be there with notes and pencils, taking down what we have to say.
''People are still throwing rocks at us: people like Peter Townshend and Wynton Marsalis. I can't figure it out. Townshend wrote 'My Generation' because people downed rock-and-roll, and now he's doing it to us. It doesn't matter, because they're going out like suckers.''
Show time at the Ritz (254 West 54th Street near Broadway) is at 9 P.M.; tickets are $17.50. Information: 956-3731.

HEADLINE: Bush Seeks Japan Shift On Imports

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
When leaders of the two biggest economic powers meet during the weekend in Palm Springs, Calif., the United States will offer a closer global economic partnership but insist that Japan slash import barriers, Administration officials said today.
Japanese officials in Washington and Tokyo said they did not expect Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to make any commitments.
The officials also said they feared that American demands for rapid action on trade issues could undermine the chances of Japanese concessions down the road and that high expectations for the talks could backfire. [Page D6.] Lowered Expectations ''I find it difficult to think that something specific will come out of this meeting,'' a senior Japanese official said. 
Although Mr. Kaifu's plans were said to be subject to last-minute change, Japanese officials here said today that they did not expect a Cabinet-level trade officer to accompany him - an indication that the Japanese expect the meeting to deal with broader global issues rather than the nitty-gritty of trade.
President Bush is taking the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, and Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher with him to Palm Springs.
One Administration official said Mr. Bush's short-term goal was to send a clear signal to the bureacucracies of both nations to settle trade issues quickly.
 
Bush Takes Initiative
Usually, Japanese prime ministers request meetings with American Presidents. This time it was President Bush who took the initiative, proposing the meeting with Prime Minister Kaifu less than two weeks after the Japanese leader's party retained power in parliamentary elections.
The White House is being forced to pursue the Japanese issues vigorously because, unlike the situation in other trade conflicts of the last decade, the President faces a series of deadlines imposed by Congress. The Administration must decide in the next few months whether to impose sanctions on Japan, and the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act allows it less discretion in such decisions than it had in the past.
By inviting Mr. Kaifu on such short notice, the President has given a signal that he intends to be forceful on the trade issue, if only to deflect some heat from Congress.
In the past, meetings of Japanese and American leaders have not yielded breakthroughs. In light of the opening position taken by Tokyo, the weekend meeting may be little more productive. The White House has tried to lower expectations by insisting that the meeting, the second between Mr. Kaifu and Mr. Bush, is not intended for decision making, but for general talk about the relationship between the two nations.
 
The President's Goal
While Mr. Bush and Mr. Kaifu will hardly discuss technical differences over wood-product tariffs or Japanese reluctance to buy American satellites, Mr. Bush is seeking a political commitment that would shift Japan from an export superpower to a leading importer.
''It's like arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union,'' a senior American official said. ''There's the need to get the political level engaged before progress can be made at the technical level.''
What Mr. Bush is seeking, as one White House official put it, is ''broad, conceptual, forward-looking'' talks about where the Japanese-American relationship is headed.
 
Full Opening Sought
But an expanding relationship, in the Administration view, requires a full opening of the Japanese market.
The weekend meeting comes as public opinion polls show that most Americans consider Japan a greater threat to security than the Soviet Union. On Capitol Hill, tensions were heightened by last year's debate over letting Japan have military aircraft technology that it might use to develop a commercial aviation industry.
And in Japan, attitudes about the United States are hardening. If the United States imposes trade sanctions, some people have suggested, Japan should retaliate by cutting back on its purchases of Treasury securities, which finance the Federal debt.
In Washington's view, the trade frictions arise from the failure of American exports to Japan to reach the levels they would in an unfettered market.
The problem with Japan is compounded by the existence of both a protected Japanese market and the popularity of Japanese products in the United States. Last year imports from Japan rose by 13 percent, compared with 7.3 percent from all countries. From Germany, imports actually fell by 5.8 percent.
 
A Number of Fields
But if the trade problems can be dealt with, American officials see a bright future of strengthened cooperation in a number of fields, including the military, technology, international peacekeeping, overseas development assistance, environmental protection, the war against drugs and aid to fledgling Eastern European democracies.
''The time has come for Japan to translate its domestic and regional successes more fully into a broader international role with increased responsibility,'' Secretary of State Baker said in one recent speech.
The call for deeper cooperation is bipartisan. Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's national security adviser, envisons what he calls an ''Amerippon'' arrangement that would involve coordination of foreign policy and international economic decision making, more industrial collaboration and eventually even a common consumer market across the Pacific, without restrictions.
''If Japan and the U.S. can't agree now, I don't know when they will,'' added Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee's trade subcommittee.

HEADLINE: New England Bank Signs Lending Pact

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Bank of New England Corporation, which lost more than $1.1 billion last year, said yesterday that it had signed agreements with Federal banking regulators that describe in unusual detail how it will improve its lending procedures and seek to recover its financial health.
The agreements, called cease and desist orders, were proposed by officials of the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a part of the Treausry Department that regulates national chartered banks. Although several dozen of the agreements are arranged each year, the Bank of New England's problems were severe enough that the agreements were much more detailed than normal.
Most of the bank's losses stemmed from real estate loans that soured as property values in New England flattened last year after years of growth. 
Ellen Stockdale, a spokeswoman for the Office of the Comptroller, said the 35-page agreement ''does not give us the authority to take business decisions away'' from the Bank of New England. ''The fact that it is more detailed than some others just reflects the suggestions we have to help them,'' she said.
H. Ridgely Bullock, acting chairman of the banking company, described the agreements as a ''partnership with Federal regulators'' that will strengthen the bank, mostly from bad real estate loans, Over the last two months the company has sold its credit card and leasing businesses, and has plans to sell other assets, including $1.3 billion of home equity loans, $900 million of loans to communications companies, $900 million of asset-backed loans to borrowers outside New England and $3 billion of commercial loans.
Mr. Bullock said discussions were under way to sell the Bank of New England Corporation's subsidiary banks in Maine and Rhode Island, ''which do not fit our strategic plan.'' But there are currently no discussions for the sale of the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, the second-largest bank in the company and the No. 2 bank in that state.
Some of the requirements in the agreement, such as improved procedures to limit lending risks by evaluating borrowers and using improved real estate appraisals, are part of approved practices described in the Comptroller's handbook for national bank examiners. Others, like a review of every officer in the bank with the rank of senior vice president or higher, are a consequence of special management problems Federal regulators found at the bank.
To rebuild shareholder capital, the money that serves as a cushion for future losses, the agreement with regulators bars the payment of dividends on common or preferred stock until the Fed approves. The company promised to increase its capital and reduce its assets by the end of May so that capital equals 3 percent of assets, rising to 5 percent of assets by the end of 1991. At mid-February, the company had more than $600 million of equity, or roughly 2.5 percent of its $26 billion of assets.
Other parts of the agreement with the Comptroller's office require the company to keep close track of its large deposits and compile a list of all assets it might sell.
Because the company had canceled its January common stock dividend and is operating with inadequate capital, analysts were not surprised by the company's statement that it does not expect to pay dividends ''for some time.'' Bank of New England stock fell 37.5 cents yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, to $4.50 a share.
''They have a fighting chance of survival, but they cannot afford further deterioration in the New England economy,'' said Dan Kauth, an analyst at the First Albany Corporation, a securities firm. To satisfy regulators' capital standards, Mr. Kauth said that ''some of the subsidiary banks will have to be sold.''
In addition to the Bank of New England, based in Boston, which recently absorbed other subsidiary banks in the region, the company has a subsidiary bank in western Massachusetts, as well as those in Maine, Rhode Island and Connecticut.
Warren L. Dennis, a partner at the law firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn of Washington, noted that detailed agreements like the one regulators forced the Bank of New England to sign, ''can be a way for regulators to impose more control over a bank, without going so far as to put the bank in receivership or conservatorship.''

HEADLINE: A 'Baby Bell' Outgrows Its Siblings

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
The Pacific Telesis Group, which was considered one of the weakest of the seven regional Bell companies after the Bell system breakup six years ago, is emerging as perhaps the strongest.
The company, parent of Pacific Bell in California and Nevada Bell, is benefiting from a robust California economy and an aggressive diversification strategy that has paid off in several overseas contracts in recent months, including a huge one to build West Germany's first private cellular telephone system.
Pacific Telesis, which had revenues of $9.59 billion last year, has also been helped by regulatory changes in California over the last few years, particularly the state's recent adoption of a new regulation that removes the cap on profits the company can make, encouraging it to cut costs.
Pacific Telesis has wasted little time in exploiting the new regulation: In January the company announced that it would eliminate 11,000 jobs, or 16 percent of its work force, in the next five years to reduce overhead. 
At the time of divestiture in 1984, Pacific Telesis was the financial runt of the ''Baby Bell'' litter. It was assigned a higher amount of Ma Bell's debt relative to its equity than the other regional companies, its network contained old equipment that was costly to operate and California had one of the strictest regulatory structures in the nation. But the debt was substantially paid down, the equipment improved and California eased it regulations.
Pacific Telesis's success is apparent in a number of important industry measurements. From 1985 through 1989, the company's net income increased 7.8 percent, compared with an average of 5 percent for all seven regional companies. The company now has the highest growth in new telephone lines among the Baby Bells, and earns more from each of those lines than any of the other regional Bells.
In addition, the number of phone lines in Pacific Telesis's service area increased by 4.3 percent last year, to 13.4 million, compared with an average increase of 3 percent for all the Baby Bells. And the company earned an estimated $185 per line in service last year, compared with an average of $165 for the seven regional companies. Its operating margin on a per-line basis was 26.3 percent last year, second only to the St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell Corporation, which had a per-line margin of 27.3 percent.
Pacific Telesis's stock has performed especially well since the Bell System breakup. Shares of Pacific Telesis have risen 213 percent since 1984, compared with an average of 167 percent for the other Baby Bells. [Pacific Telesis shares closed at $44.625 on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, up 50 cents.] ''Pacific Telesis is the best combination of everything you would want - liberal regulation, a high-growth region, top-notch management, and successful non-telephone businesses,'' said Frank J. Governali, a telecommunications analyst with the First Boston Corporation. ''No other Baby Bell has all these things going for it.''
 
Clouds in the Short Term
For the short term, however, Pacific Telesis's outlook is not as bright. The company's earnings are expected to be significantly reduced by the higher capital spending necessary for ventures overseas and by a $391 million refund that the company must provide customers as part of the new California profit-incentive regulation. In addition, some analysts are concerned that a recession or further cuts in military spending - a major contributor to California's economy - could slow growth.
Sam Ginn, Pacific Telesis's chairman and chief executive, has said that 1990 will not be ''a strong year of growth for earnings-per-share'' because of rate reductions mandated in the new regulatory framework, higher labor costs and increased capital investments.
''We are no longer talking about where we want to go in terms of regulation and international expansion -we are already there,'' Mr. Ginn said in a recent interview. ''It's just a matter of continuing to grow these businesses.''
Among those businesses is mobile cellular telephones, where Pacific Telesis has been among the most successful of the Baby Bells. It quickly acquired cellular franchises in high-growth markets like Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego, and became the first regional telephone company to report a profit from its cellular operations.
Pactel Cellular, which is the nation's fourth-largest cellular company, had 381,000 subscribers at the end of last year, a 45 percent increase over 1988. Revenues for the cellular division rose 46.8 percent last year, to $453.2 million, and net income more than doubled, to $55.4 million, accounting for 4.4 percent of the company's total profits.
Pacific Telesis has also invested heavily in wireless communications, cable television and information services throughout Europe. It holds 26 percent of a consortium that won a $6 billion contract in December to build the first private cellular-telephone network in West Germany, beating out five other regional Bell companies. It has acquired interests in four cable-television companies in Britain, and is part owner of a fiber-optic cable link between the United States and Japan.
Since their formation at the breakup of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company in 1984, the regional companies have been seeking to become more than just providers of local telephone service and to escape the decades-old regulatory structure that limits their profits. The Baby Bells are already earning close to their allowed return on equity from local telephone operations, so profits from nonregulated businesses have become crucial to growth.
Last year, Pacific Telesis - telesis means intelligently planned progress - became the envy of the other Baby Bells when it persuaded the California Public Utilities Commission to allow Pacific Bell, its local phone subsidiary, higher profits if it cut costs.
Under the new regulation, the rates of Pacific Bell are no longer calculated by adding a profit margin to the company's costs. Instead, the commission sets price caps on the services. The new regulation is intended to give the phone company the incentive to keep costs low and to introduce new products and services.
But the new incentive regulation has raised concerns among consumer advocacy groups, who argue that staff reductions at Pacific Telesis and less regulatory oversight will ultimately diminish the quality of telephone service in California.
''How can Pactel maintain a high quality of service when it is laying off large numbers of employees just to take advantage of the incentive regulation?'' said Audrie Krause, executive director of Toward Utility Rate Normalization in San Francisco.
The consumer group plans to appeal the commission's decision in California Supreme Court.
In response, Pacific Telesis said it was streamlining its work force, taking advantage of new technology that increases the quality of the phone network and requires fewer workers.
California is the first state to adopt the new framework for price caps, following the Federal Communications Commission's decision last March to allow A.T.& T. to price its services within a floor and a ceiling. Regulators in other states have adopted or are considering local telephone deregulation, and California has become a test case.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Opposes Rescue Of Failing Securities Firms

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, the first Government regulator called before Congress to discuss the bankruptcy of the Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, said today that the authorities would almost certainly refuse to rescue even the largest securities firms from the brink of collapse.
The notion that some financial institutions might be too big to fail ''is not good policy,'' Mr. Greenspan told a House judiciary subcommittee. ''It's not good for discipline'' - nor is it fair, he said, adding that regulators are seeking an alternative approach to what has almost become a policy of giving large banks special consideration for protection. 
Mr. Greenspan, who was among various Government officials who monitored the bankruptcy of Drexel, said that contingency plans were in place to aid in the overriding goal of keeping financial markets functioning. But he said that even if the Fed was so inclined, it would be precluded by its legislative charter from providing cash from its discount window to securities houses.
 
Pleased With Markets
In general, Mr. Greenspan said he was pleased with the way markets absorbed the shock of the Drexel Burnham failure but he offered three tentative suggestions to help head off similar future episodes.
The most radical, which he acknowledged would require major change, would be to shorten the period between the time most securities transactions are made and the time of financial settlement, normally five business days. Mr. Greenspan said that Drexel's Government-securities business, which provides for payment at time of delivery, was smoothly unwound during the crisis and that some consideration might be given to ''extending this type of settlement and bookkeeping procedure to other markets.''
Mr. Greenspan also suggested requiring additional capital for institutions with assets like high-yield, high-risk ''junk bonds'' that might be illiquid or subject to big price swings.
A third area for study, he suggested, would be the ''possible need for an overview'' of holding companies, including entities not now regulated, because Drexel showed that impairment of one kind of activity is not automatically isolated by present structures.

Ford Settles Dispute At 2d Mexican Plant

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 1

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company said today that it had reached a new labor agreement with the union representing 2,100 hourly workers at its plant in Hermosillo, Mexico.
The agreement removes a significant hurdle in the company's introduction of new Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer models, which will be assembled in Hermosillo beginning in April.
Ford needs the fuel-efficient Escort and Tracer models to increase its overall corporate average fuel economy and to meet higher Federal standards for 1990 models. The Escort and Tracer, which were developed with the Mazda Motor Corporation of Japan, are also assembled at Ford's Wayne, Mich., assembly plant. 
The labor agreement in Hermosillo resulted in a 27 percent increase in wages and benefits. ''While that appears very large by U.S. standards, it is actually considerably lower than wage and benefit increases in recent years in Mexico,'' said Al Chambers, a spokesman for Ford. Rapid inflation in the 1980's has strained the Mexican economy and sharply cut the buying power of wage earners.
The Hermosillo agreement also means that Ford has settled labor problems at two of its three Mexican plants. Three weeks ago, 800 hourly workers at an engine plant in Chihuahua ratified a new contract, according to a Ford spokesman, ending a walkout that began in the last week in January.
Separately, the company has dismissed about 2,400 workers at its assembly plant in Cuautitlan, near Mexico City, which assembles six Ford car and truck models for the Mexican market. About two-thirds of the 3,700-member work force occupied the Cuautitlan plant in January after an intra-union dispute led to a shooting in which seven workers were injured and one killed.
Mr. Chambers said the company had hired back about 1,200 of those who received dismissal notices, and plans to replace another 1,200 who occupied the plant. The Cuautitllan plant is currently producing about half as many cars and trucks as it did before the labor unrest, Mr. Chambers said.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Up Last Month; Wal-Mart Posts 33% Gain

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Some of the nation's largest retailers yesterday reported good February sales growth, but analysts say that 1990 is expected to be another tough year for the industry.
One standout for the month was Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The discount chain, based in Bentonville, Ark., said its February sales surged by nearly 33 percent, to $1.95 billion, from $1.47 billion a year earlier.
In contrast, Sears, Roebuck & Company, the nation's biggest retailer, continued to struggle. The Chicago-based company, which began a new merchandising strategy a year ago to try to reverse losses in market share, had virtually flat sales last month, at $2.127 billion in the four weeks that ended on Feb. 24, compared with $2.126 billion a year earlier. 
 
Weather a Factor
Walter F. Loeb, a retail consultant in New York, said unusually warm weather in the first half of the month helped the retail business.
Fewer general merchandise chains, discounters and department stores issued their results than usual on the first Thursday of the month because of differences in sales-reporting calendars.
Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, said, ''We remain somewhat cautious,'' given continuing high consumer debt levels and sluggish trends in the financial and real estate markets.
The retailers could have a tough time this year coping with the effects of the so-called rolling recessions, which are rippling through parts of the manufacturing sector, like the automobile industry.
Monroe Greenstein of Bear, Stearns & Company, said retailers would probably have a mediocre year in 1990, similar to 1989. February marks the start of the fiscal year for many retailers.
 
February a Slow Month
The analysts were reluctant to attach too much significance to the results because February is typically a slow time for retailers. January and February are transition months, as winter merchandise is cleared to make room for new spring lines.
Despite the general softness in the economy, Wal-Mart has consistently been a star performer among retailers as it expands across the country. Besides its overall gain of nearly 33 percent in last month, the sales at Wal-Mart stores open a year or longer posted a 17 percent increase.
The sales at Sears stores open a year or longer edged up by only 1.5 percent.
Retailers and analysts prefer to focus on sales comparisons for stores operating at least a year, called same-store or comparable-store results. New stores typically enjoy a period of unusually brisk business that is not sustained over time.
 
Ranked No. 3
Wal-Mart, the nation's third-largest retailer, could overtake Sears and the K Mart Corporation in sales volume in the United States, many in the industry believe.
K Mart, which is based in Troy, Mich., recently stepped up efforts to respond to the challenge. To improve sales and profit, the second-largest retailer will accelerate its store-opening and renovation program, reducing its after-tax earnings by $422 million to carry out the plan.
K Mart's report on last month's sales will be released on March 8, along with the Limited Inc.'s and those of several other large retailers.
Many of the retailers who in recent years have reported their monthly results on the first Thursday of each month will be reporting later in March. An effort is being made within the industry to reach a compromise on a single monthly reporting date.
Several top retailers do not report their sales monthly at all, including: the Campeau Corporation's Federated Stores Inc. unit, R. H. Macy & Company and Batus Inc., which owns Marshall Field & Company and Saks Fifth Avenue.
Following are retailers who reported their February domestic sales yesterday:
 
Sears, Roebuck & Company: Four weeks ended Feb. 24: $2.127 billion, up less than one-tenth of 1 percent from $2.126 billion.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.: Month of February: $1.95 billion, up nearly 33 percent from $1.47 billion.
J. C. Penney Company: Four weeks ended Feb. 24: $880 million, up 8.1 percent from $814 million.
Melville Corporation: Four weeks ended Feb. 24: $503.2 million, up 11.7 percent from $450.6 million. First two months: $929 8 million, up 10.4 percent from $841.8 million.
Montgomery Ward & Company: Four weeks ended Feb. 24: $299 million, up 1.7 percent from $291.8 million, comparing continuing lines only.
Woolworth Corporation: Four weeks ended Feb. 24: $330 million, up 13.7 percent from $291 million.
TJX Companies: Four weeks ended Feb. 24: $133.7 million, up 15.8 percent from $115.5 million.B.A.T.d(Batus), Penney, J. C., Macy, R. H.

HEADLINE: Personal Income and Spending Up

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
Personal income rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in January despite a new tax bite from Social Security, the Government said today.
The report also showed consumer spending climbed six-tenths of 1 percent, a pace that analysts attributed to caution in the face of mounting inflation.
The Commerce Department said personal income ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.60 trillion in January, after gaining five-tenths of 1 percent in December. 
Several factors affected the January income increase, including cost-of-living increases in Social Security and other Federal benefits, and a 3.6 percent pay increase for Federal workers.
Those increases were offset by a rise in taxes withheld for Social Security, as well as a reduction in farm subsidy payments.
Excluding these special factors, personal income increased five-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Increase in Consumer Prices
Analysts cited the 1.1 percent increase in consumer prices in January for the slowdown in consumer spending, from a 1 percent gain in December to six-tenths of 1 percent in January, or an annual rate of $3.60 trillion.
''Consumers behaved fairly cautiously in January, probably because they had to pay so much for energy and food that they didn't have that much to spend on other items,'' said Michael K. Evans, head of Evans Economics Inc.
The Labor Department said food and energy costs, driven up by the effects of the fourth-coldest December on record, accounted for 60 percent of the jump in the January Consumer Price Index.
''Once food and energy prices settle down, consumer spending will pick up,'' Mr. Evans said.
Personal consumption, which includes everything except interest payments on debt, totaled $19.9 billion - down from $36.7 billion in December.
But purchases of durable goods -big-ticket items expected to last more than three years - rose $24.3 billion. Analysts said this spending was spurred in part by automobile sales incentives.
Nondurable purchases were up $2.5 billion, while spending on services fell $6.8 billion.
Consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health because it represents about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
The key component of the income category, wages and salaries, edged up $16.2 billion in January after gaining $16.8 billion in December.
Americans' incomes after taxes rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, the department said, up from December's four-tenths of 1 percent gain. That category does not count Social Security withholding as a tax; the department, instead, treats it as a ''contribution,'' just as it does other retirement program costs.
The personal savings rate, as measured against disposable income, advanced 5.9 percent, compared with a 5.5 percent rate a month earlier.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Decline Slows a Bit

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Despite increases in the level of new orders and exports, the manufacturing sector of the nation's economy remained in decline in February for the 10th consecutive month, the National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday. But the decline was at a slower rate than in previous months.
The association said its index of economic activity rose to 48.3 percent, from 45.2 percent in January. The group says a reading below 50 indicates that the manufacturing sector of the economy is in decline, and a reading above 50 indicates an expansion. A reading below 44 is said to indicate a decline in real gross national product. 
The February level was the highest since June 1989, when the index stood at 48.8 percent. The survey indicated that suppliers' deliveries were faster and that inventories levels declined sharply. Prices declined for the ninth consecutive month and at the greatest rate since December 1982.
 
No Recession Is Seen
''This confirms our expectations that the economy is not in the process of going into a recession,'' said Wayne C. Stevens, chief economist with Duff & Phelps Inc. in Chicago. ''The economy is in a slow growth mode. The numbers reinforce our feeling that manufacturing in the United States is weak, but not recessionary.''
Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc., said that despite the increases registered in production and new orders since ''the continued improvement in supplier deliveries and significant decline in prices suggests a lack of underlying strength in the economy.''
The purchasing managers' report is considered an important economic indicator because it is compiled from information supplied by purchasing executives from a range of more than 300 industrial companies in 20 industries.
The index for new orders rose above the 50 percent level for the first time since June of last year, to 51.8 percent, from 45.8 percent in January. The report said that the increase reflected a rebound from the severe reductions in auto production in January and problems related to cold weather during December.
The level of new orders continued to grow in February, but at a slower pace than the previous month. The survey's new order index fell to 53 percent, down from 55.5 percent in January. Also, the level of imports continued to increase in February, remaining at the same index level as January's 50.5 percent. That figure was the highest in five months.
For the first time since the middle of last year, production increased in February as the production index rose to 51.5 percent, up from 45.4 percent in January. The February level was the highest since June of last year. The association attributed the increase to lower production activity in January, particularly from the automobile industry.
The supplier deliveries index fell to 43.3 percent in February, down from January's 47.2 percent, a reflection that production increased and that there were fewer shortages than in January, when the availablity of some items was hampered by severe cold weather.
Nine items were reported to be in short supply in February, including bearings; castings; electric motors; acrylic acid, which is used in making plastics; caustic soda and soda ash, used heavily in making paper, soap and refining petroleum; hydrogen peroxide and sodium chlorate, which have been the replacement used by paper makers who are avoiding the dioxins in chlorine. Also in short supply were titanium dioxide and polyethylene resins.
Prices declined in February for the ninth consecutive month as the price index fell to 42.2 percent, from 49.7 percent in January. Higher prices were reported for a number of items, including Freon, coal, corn products and methanol. Lower prices were reported for aluminum, steel, copper, nickel, rubber, gasoline, eggs, zinc and corrugated shipping containers.
Employment continued to decline for the 12th consecutive month, but at the lowest rate since the middle of last year. The employment index rose to 46.7 percent in February, from 44.1 percent in January.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Fewer Companies Lifting Dividends

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
THE economy may not be in a recession, but more and more companies are acting as though they think it may enter one. They are doing that by forgoing dividend increases that might have been made in other years.
Last month, the number of companies raising dividends fell by more than 25 percent from the previous February, the Standard & Poor's Corporation reported yesterday. The report said 149 companies increased their payouts in the month, compared with 200 a year earlier. Not since 1971 have there been fewer February increases. 
''It surprised me,'' said Arnold Kaufman, the editor of S.&P.'s Outlook newsletter, which compiles the figures. ''I did not think it would be off that much. I was looking for a relatively small decline in the number of increases this year, with a pickup in the later part of the year.''
There are seasonal patterns to dividend increases, as company boards hold regularly scheduled meetings to decide whether to change dividends. February has traditionally been one of the most popular months for increases, in large part because most companies have figured out their annual profits for the previous year by then. In the last three years, more companies increased their payouts in February than in any other month.
The weakness in dividend increases began to appear last summer, before most analysts saw the downturn in corporate profits. In eight of the last nine months, the number of companies raising their payouts was lower than in the comparable month in the preceding year.
The decline in dividend increases has not been matched by a sharp rise in the number of companies lowering their dividends, something most corporate boards hate to do. But there has been a large increase in the number of companies eliminating their payouts entirely. For the last several months, that figure has been running almost as high as in 1986, when the economy slowed and almost went into a recession.
Mr. Kaufman said the sharp falloff in dividend increases might be a signal that companies were worried that their business would get worse. ''Although they are perhaps not transmitting that message to analysts, they are assuming that earnings will not be good, and they are therefore holding back on dividends,'' he said.
 
New Bets on Tokyo and London
One of the oldest policies on Wall Street, seldom stated but normally followed, is ''Sell them what they want to buy.'' Responding to demand this year, the investment banks that create products have offered Americans ways to bet that European stocks will rise and that Japanese issues will fall.
There is still no new product to allow buyers to be bullish on Japan, but Salomon Inc. said yesterday that it would offer one to enable investors to be bearish on British stocks.
The new products, among the few bright spots for underwriters in 1990, have fallen into two groups. For those bullish on Europe, as well as many other countries, there have been country funds, closed-end mutual funds that buy stocks in the specified market. They have often traded at levels far above the values of the stocks they own, to the amazement of many. That particular craze seems to be waning. This week's new German fund, the Future Germany Fund, slipped $1.125 a share yesterday, to $18.125. That is still above the original offering price of $18 but not by nearly as much as expected.
The new Japanese products have consisted of four series of put warrants, sold in January and February. Details vary, but put warrants enable investors to bet that the Japanese stock market will be lower in three years than it is when the securities are issued. They have been popular and, with the recent slump in Japan, good performers.
The new Salomon issue, to be sold next week, offers similar put warrants on The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British stocks. It is expected that to buy a put, betting that the British market will be lower in three years, will require buyers to put up a premium of 8.8 percent to 9.3 percent of the underlying value. In other words, to break even, the buyer would have to see the market drop by that much over the period.
Unlike the Japanese products, Salomon's British plan will also offer call warrants, which will be much more expensive, carrying a premium of 25 percent or so and providing a way to bet on a British bull market. Salomon is initially registering an equal number of puts and calls but is willing to sell more of one than the other.
Why has Wall Street not yet offered call warrants on Japan, providing a way to bet on that market rising? Part of the reason, investment bankers say, is that Americans seem uninterested. But another reason is that the bankers who issue the warrants hedge their bets in the home market, and that in Japan, unlike Britain, such hedges are difficult. ''The Japanese market is a classic case of the Japanese institutions not believing the market can fall and everybody else not believing it can stay up,'' a banker said.

HEADLINE: Supercomputer Accord With Japan Advances

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 1

 BODY:
On the eve of a meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Japanese and American negotiators said today that they had agreed to scrap a failed 1987 accord on supercomputers and ''work out new language'' to improve American access to the Japanese market.
The announcement was the first sign of progress in any of the major trade disputes that have divided the United States and Japan for the last year.
One American negotiator said tonight, ''The Japanese have been willing to address all of our proposals,'' and Japanese officials were equally optimistic.
 
A Host of Other Issues
While negotiators said they were confident that a final settlement was near, they also said the supercomputer issue was probably the easiest of a host of nettlesome conflicts to solve. And the new language on that must still be worked out on a mutually satisfactory basis. 
While progress was reported on this front, an impasse continues in a parallel set of talks between the two nations being conducted here, known formally as the Structural Impediments Initiative, in which the two nations remain at odds how to make fundamental changes in their economies and business practices to improve their relationship.
In the trade dispute over supercomputers, makers of the American machines have complained that stringent Japanese rules force them out of Government bidding when their models, which often exceed the performance specifications set by the Government, cost more than a less powerful Japanese computer.
''Even if your machine is twice as good as a competitor's, you lose if your price is a dollar higher,'' one American negotiator said tonight.
 
Setting Other Criteria
As part of the talks, the negotiators are establishing criteria other than price that the Japanese Government could use in buying supercomputers.
Access to the Government supercomputer market here has long been a point of friction, because the technology touches so many areas in which the United States and Japan compete: microelectronics, software, advanced computer designs and a number of problems in physics and biotechnology that require a supercomputer's huge number-crunching ability.
But the progress on the computer front does not signal a breakthrough in the meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Kaifu. Rather than discuss specific trade disputes, the President will offer Japan a closer global economic partnership but insist that Japan slash import barriers, Administration officials said today.
While American-made supercomputers - particularly those manufactured by Cray Research Inc. of Minneapolis - have been extremely popular in private industry here, the Japanese Government and universities have bought only a few, and those purchases were made under tremendous pressure from the United States.
The United States contends that Japan is protecting its own supercomputer industry, and last year it invoked the ''Super 301'' section of the nation's trade act, threatening retaliation unless Japan ends by this spring what Washington views as the exclusion of Americans from its supercomputer market.
 
Two Disputed Areas
Despite the progress on computers, negotiators said they had made no headway on satellites and wood products, two other areas named under the Super 301 provisions. Mr. Bush is expected to raise those issues, at least in a general way, during the meeting with Mr. Kaifu, which starts Friday night in Palm Springs, Calif.
A senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official warned today against ''raised expectations'' that any pending trade issues would be solved during the weekend talks. ''This is not a negotiating session,'' he said.
And Japanese officials in Washington and Tokyo said they were fearful that any American demands for rapid action on trade issues could undermine the chances of Japanese concessions down the road.
While Japan is discussing all three areas named under the Super 301 clause, it has refused to recognize the deadline set under the trade legislation. Japan contends that Super 301 violates the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the international body that oversees world trade.
In August 1987, after heated negotiations, the United States and Japan signed an accord intended to make Tokyo's process for seeking bids on supercomputers more ''transparent'' or understandable to outsiders. But American supercomputer makers have complained that it did not improve access to the Japanese market.
During a visit to Tokyo not long ago, John Rollwagen, the chief executive of Cray, said that the accord ''worked'' only in that it now allows Japan's supercomputer rivals ''to see all the contracts that we are excluded from.''
 
Obstacles Remain
In recent months Japanese negotiators have begun to acknowledge publicly that many obstacles that Americans have long complained of are still present.
For example, Japanese manufacturers often offer - or feel compelled to offer - ''academic discounts'' of up to 80 percent to get their computers installed on university campuses. American companies have said they could not match such huge discounts.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry has talked publicly of new rules that will forbid ''academic discounts'' that exceed 50 percent, about what the International Business Machines Corporation offers to some universities in the United States.
Complicating the issue is the fact that the United States has yet to buy a Japanese-made supercomputer, asserting that Japan's models do not offer the variety of software that Cray does. Japan, however, has used that fact to argue that the United States also has trade barriers in supercomputing. The Pentagon has often expressed reluctance about depending on foreign-made supercomputers, saying a healthy domestic industry is needed for national security.

HEADLINE: Japanese Fear Problems From a Hasty Meeting

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 1

 BODY:
As Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu prepares to meet President Bush this weekend, Japanese officials say they are suddenly fearful that American demands for rapid action on trade issues could undermine the chances of Japanese concessions down the road.
''No Japanese politician wants to rush off as if he is a mere vassal and President Bush is the lord,'' a Japanese official said. ''If Bush tries to force some sort of commitment on Mr. Kaifu at this moment, it will simply make the job of following up more difficult.''
Associates of Mr. Kaifu, who led his party to a re-election victory less than two weeks ago, said the Prime Minister was still struggling to gain supremacy over rivals in his own party and needed more time before he could forge a consensus to meet American economic demands. 
 
Fear of High Expectations
An atmosphere of concern has permeated Japanese planning for the Bush meeting, especially since Japanese officials greatly prefer structured sessions planned in advance.
Several officials here said they were taken aback and puzzled by Mr. Bush's abrupt decision last Friday to invite Mr. Kaifu to Palm Springs, Calif., this weekend.
Officials also say they fear that high expectations could backfire on both Japan and the United States.
''I find it difficult to think that something specific will come out of this meeting, especially when it was proposed several days ago,'' a senior Japanese official said, adding that Mr. Kaifu would prefer not to negotiate any specific trade matters himself.
Echoing this view, an American official in Washington said Mr. Bush and Mr. Kaifu simply wanted ''to step back from the immediate kinds of problems and set a direction for the 1990's.''
 
Growing Anxiety
The worries of the Prime Minister's aides reflect growing anxiety in the Japanese Government over what the Foreign Minister, Taro Nakayama, recently described as a deterioration of relations with the United States.
Recently, American negotiators have focused not only on specific trade areas, like supercomputers and telecommunications, but also on broad demands that Japan change some fundamental business and government practices. The talks over these fundamental issues are at an impasse, and Mr. Kaifu's Government is unlikely to make major concessions, Japanese officials say.
For instance, they say, Mr. Kaifu will find it impossible to break up the big Japanese business combines or to revise the Japanese law that permits small stores to block big retail stores from coming into their areas. These steps are being pushed by Washington as possible ways to open Japanese markets to more imports.
Mr. Kaifu plans to leave Friday evening for Palm Springs, where he is expected to talk with Mr. Bush on Saturday and Sunday in informal settings, perhaps even on a golf course. He returns to Japan on Sunday.
 
A Question of Emphasis
Mr. Kaifu and his aides are trying to dispel speculation about substantive discussions. American officials are playing down trade matters and emphasizing the growing importance of Japan in supporting American political, economic and security interests in Asia and elsewhere.
Japan has supported such American initiatives as the restructuring of Mexico's debt and aid to the Philippines. It has also backed the Bush Administration on global environmental issues and other matters.
Lately, the Bush Administration has begun to talk of ways that Japan could increase assistance to Hungary, Poland, Panama and Nicaragua, now that a more friendly government is in the offing there.
Mr. Kaifu took office in August but has spent most of his time since then working to keep the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in power. Since the elections on Feb. 18 that gave the party control of the lower house of Parliament, Mr. Kaifu has devoted most of his attention to forming his Cabinet.
 
Comparison to a Bird
''When the invitation came, Kaifu had to accept,'' a business executive with close ties to the Government said of the Palm Springs meeting. ''But the Kaifu Government is like a fledgling bird. If you put too much weight on it, the bird Kaifu will not be able to fly.''
Mr. Kaifu is generally seen to be in a weak position because of widespread fears in Japan about the economy, prompted by the recent drop in stock prices and fears that higher interest rates could slow growth.
Mr. Kaifu has said his Government's most urgent challenge is to reach a consensus on what steps to take to improve ties with the United States. At the same time, he has warned against expectations of quick action.
''There is no magic word that will erase the $49 billion trade surplus,'' Mr. Kaifu said at a news conference on Wednesday. He said Japan had done a great deal already and would do more in the future.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Issues Decline

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury issues dipped yesterday in light trading, as dealers sold securities in the wake of a series of economic reports that were somewhat stronger than anticipated.
Specifically, traders were disappointed that a survey of the nation's purchasing managers showed that manufacturing activity improved slightly in February from the previous month. In addition, data on construction spending and personal income growth during January were above expectations.
Such positive economic news tends to be viewed negatively in the bond market, since it reduces the chance that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary policy, setting the stage for lower interest rates. 
Despite the market's negative reaction, analysts said the data did little to support the notion that the pace of economic activity was quickening.
''Almost all the numbers depict an economy that is recovering from a temporary decline rather than one that is beginning to take off,'' said Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist for Fuji Securities Inc. in Chicago. ''But the market chose to react negatively to numbers that were mixed, at best.''
 
End of Small Rally
Bond prices had fallen on Wednesday, as well. The price drop over the last two sessions has wiped out what had been a small rally in the secondary market for Treasury securities. But most market participants said they expected market interest rates to move in a narrow range from current levels, rather than continue to move higher.
''I would expect that we will do better soon,'' one Government-bond trader said. ''These numbers were a little stronger than anticipated, but they are not strong enough to make the Fed tighten policy. In this sort of market, with no supply coming until the end of the month, you have to buy on dips. I think that will happen soon.''
By late yesterday, the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 98 29/32, down 3/4 point, or $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.60 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 1/2, down 14/32, to yield 8.57 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent two-year notes were offered at 100, down 6/32, to yield 8.50 percent.
''I think yields on the long bond will slosh around for a while, with 8.50 percent being the center of a very tight trading range,'' said Mitchell Held, chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''The economy has not shown any evidence of slowing down nor of speeding up.''
 
Higher Short-Term Rates
Short-term Treasury-bill rates moved higher for the second straight session. In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.79 percent, up 4 basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bills rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 7.74 percent. And one-year bill rates rose by 8 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.63 percent.
Yesterday, the Treasury sold $10 billion of 52-day cash management bills. The bills, which mature on April 26, were sold at an average discount rate of 7.95 percent.
In the investment-grade corporate bond market, J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. acted as lead manager on a $137.9 million offering for the Dow Chemical Company's employee stock ownership plan.
The 9.42 percent amortizing stock ownership plan notes, which have a final maturitiy of Dec. 31, 2004, were priced at par, or 100, 87 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 8 1/2 percent 10-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The issue is rated A-1 by Moody's and A by the Standard & Poor's.
 
Some Secondaries Slump
Participants in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal securities said that prices of most actively traded issues slumped in sympathy with the declines in Treasury prices.
Prices of most intermediate-term corporate bonds fell by 3/8 point, while long-term issues fell by about 1/2 point.
Meanwhile, municipal-bond traders said most prices fell by about 1/2 point.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week that ended Feb. 19. The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Continues Advance, Helped by Economic News

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Lifted by reports showing strength in the United states economy and by economic uncertainty in Japan, the dollar continued to climb against most foreign currencies yesterday.
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that the nation's economy declined in February for the 10th consecutive month, but at the lowest rate since June. The Commerce Department said that personal income rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in January; that consumer spending increased six-tenths of a percent, and that construction spending rose 1.8 percent. The construction figure was the biggest increase in more than a year. 
 
'Economy Is Doing All Right'
Craig Sloane, a currency futures analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, said the reports ''seemed to paint the picture that the economy is doing all right.''
Traders said the Federal Reserve sold dollars in an attempt to halt the rise of the dollar against the yen, but the intervention appeared to have limited impact. The yen was also weakened by the slump in the Tokyo stock market, said Chris Mendell, a vice president at Security Pacific Bank in Los Angeles.
Mr Sloane said that although the dollar flirted with the 150-yen level, it never reached it.
The West German mark continued to be hurt by concern that a plan for exchanging East German marks for the West German currency would cause inflation, Ms. Mendell said.
 
Dollar Higher in Tokyo
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 149.78 yen, from 148.52 yen Wednesday. Later, in London, the dollar traded lower at 149.67 yen. But in New York, the dollar rose to 149.85 yen, from 148.92 late Wednesday.
The dollar has not closed that high against the yen in New York since June 15, when it reached 151.30.
The dollar also rose against the British pound. In London, one British pound cost $1.6655 late yesterday, cheaper for buyers than $1.6895 on Wednesday. In New York, the pound closed at $1.6640, down from $1.6752.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday rates, included: 1.7194 West German marks, up from 1.7074; 1.5095 Swiss francs, up from 1.5010; 5.8070 French francs, up from 5.7695; 1,267.25 Italian lire, up from 1,260.75, and 1.1910 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1927.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 10 cents, to $406.20 a troy ounce.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Large Supplies of Gasoline Prompt Heavy Selling in Oil

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Reports of large supplies of gasoline prompted heavy selling of petroleum futures yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
On other commodity markets, coffee futures surged to their highest levels in seven and a half months. Precious metals also advanced, and grain and soybean futures finished mixed. 
On the Mercantile Exchange, futures of West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, settled 28 cents to 37 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in April at $21.17 a barrel. Wholesale home heating oil was 1.13 cents to 1.93 cents lower, with April at 54.63 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 0.80 cent to 2.43 cents lower, with April at 55.81 cents a gallon. The April gasoline contract traded as low as 54.70 cents a gallon.
Jim Ritterbusch, an energy analyst for Paine Webber Inc., said gasoline supplies were so high ''that on the East Coast they're having some difficulty finding available storage for all this stuff.''
He said gasoline demand was off by about 5 percent from a year ago, possibly reflecting a weakness in the economy.
The price slide ran contrary to the seasonal pattern of rising prices for petroleum products at this time of year as some refiners shut down to retool for greater gasoline production after concentrating on heating oil for the winter months.
Peter Beutel, the head of the energy trading group at Elders Futures Inc., said that while the so-called turnaround season was already under way, the markets were not responding as they usually do. ''It just seems at this point,'' he said, ''that there is too great a supply and not enough demand.''
On the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, coffee futures rose sharply for the second straight day, reaffirming a strong upward trend linked to tight short-term supplies. Some support stemmed from reports that Mexican roasters might need to import up to 400,000 of the 132-pound bags of coffee to meet a domestic shortfall caused by a freeze during the Christmas season.
Coffee futures settled 1.02 cents to 3.94 cents higher, with the March contract at 96.75 cents a pound, the highest settlement of a near-month coffee future since July 5.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold and silver futures rose modestly. The rally in silver, the second in as many days, erased the rest of the losses posted Wednesday. Gold futures settled unchanged to 10 cents higher, with April at $409 an ounce, and silver was 2.5 cents to 3.1 cents higher, with March at $5.154 an ounce.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures fell sharply, reflecting slack export demand and improved growing conditions for the winter wheat crop. Corn futures finished lower, while soybeans ended mostly higher.

HEADLINE: 'Roger & Me': Narrow, Simplistic, Wrong

BYLINE: By David Bensman; David Bensman is chairman of the labor education department at Rutgers University.

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.

 BODY:
Many people were outraged that Michael Moore's documentary, ''Roger & Me,'' was shut out in the Academy Award nominations. I can't understand why. The film mocks American culture brilliantly, but forfeits any claim to distinction by manipulating its audience to believe that General Motors abandoned Flint, Mich., in the pursuit of profits.
In reality, General Motors poured billions of dollars into its domestic plants, including Flint's, in the 80's. In fact, it embarked on the largest industrial modernization drive in the history of the world. The company bought thousands of robot welders, computer-controlled machine tools, sophisticated computer systems and automated paint shops. 
Because of this modernization effort, 50,000 G.M. employees still work in Flint, in the new Buick City complex. Some of the highest-quality cars made by Big Three auto makers are manufactured there.
Mr. Moore conveniently ignores G.M.'s efforts so he can convey his sense that American society has turned its back on the working class. In ''Roger & Me'' he tells the viewer that G.M. closed down 11 plants, including several in Flint, and opened 11 plants in Mexico to take advantage of cheaper labor. Profits earned by making cars were spent to acquire Hughes Aircraft, which makes weapons at government-guaranteed profits.
He then shows how these decisions wrought devastation on Flint. The historic Fisher Body N1 plant is filmed being torn down, and there are shots of ruined houses infested by rats, of whole blocks standing empty and forlorn.
The film crew's efforts to meet Roger Smith, G.M.'s chairman, and invite him to see all this for himself are met with indifference, and impatience. The audience comes away feeling the company deserves every bit of red ink on its balance book.
The story of Flint's ruination is much more complicated than Mr. Moore's explanation of G.M.'s arrogance and indifference to the working class.
There is bungling: As Mary Ann Keller's book ''Rude Awakening'' documented, much of G.M.'s massive investment was wasted because the company's attempts to find quick, technological fixes simply threw money at problems.
There is bureaucratic paralysis: Though G.M. started planning its Lumina model at the same time Ford started planning its similar Taurus, the car that brought Ford back from the brink, wars within General Motors stalled the Lumina's introduction for four years.
There is corporate authoritarianism that undermines efforts to achieve labor-management partnership often necessary in achieving efficiency. And public policy played a role: High consumer interest rates and the elimination of tax advantages on consumer debt and sales tax certainly do not encourage consumers to buy cars.
Had Mr. Moore considered these factors, his analysis of the auto industry would have been more politically useful. If the audience knew that G.M. did not simply abandon Flint, but rather reinvested fruitlessly everywhere, they might have been inspired to think how America can preserve its working-class jobs: Should labor cooperate with management? If not, is trade protectionism a solution to preserving American jobs? Can government help corporations become globally competitive when corporate management is incompetent?
Mr. Moore, however, appears unwilling to provide such inspiration. Instead he wants us to laugh with him at those who believe that companies like G.M. are good for America. He plays on our moral and cultural superiority to the rich corporation that destroyed the beloved working-class community of the past.
The truth is that these working people have not let themselves be destroyed. They've organized food banks, church service societies and unemployed movements. They've run for political office, lobbied their legislators - often with success - to gain trade restrictions, trade adjustment assistance and improvements in unemployment coverage.
They've gone back to school, learned new skills, started new careers. Precisely because they've demonstrated such resilience, there can be hope that the nation will begin to address its problems.
Mr. Moore depicts Flint's working people as industrious. But he concludes that they are politically ineffective. They cry at their fate, they curse, they complain - in other words, they are pathetic. They are victims.
Only Michael Moore and his film crew seem to have any spunk, any persistence, any desire to understand what's happening and to call G.M. to account. At least the title is perfect: ''Roger & Me.''

HEADLINE: Nicaragua Victor Plans to Return Some Land Seized by Sandinistas <f1081>

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, March 2

 BODY:
The government of President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro will move promptly to return or make compensation for most land confiscated by the Sandinista Government, and will sell many state enterprises, aides to Mrs. Chamorro say.
The new leadership, which is to take office on April 25, will seek the recovery of buildings, farms, vehicles and other property now in the hands of members of the Sandinista National Liberation Front. It also plans broad incentives to encourage professionals and other Nicaraguans who have left the country to return, the aides said. [A team of advisers to the new leadership is to arrive Monday in Washington seeking at least $550 million in assistance from international lending institutions and the United States to help revive Nicaragua's war-shattered economy. Page 2.] Mrs. Chamorro's chief economic adviser, Francisco Mayorga Balladares, emphasized that the new government would not displace any farmers or workers who have received property under Sandinista land-reform programs. And he asserted that her government's policies would be guided by economic prudence, not political revenge. 
''We are going to respect the rights of the people who are already settled,'' Mr. Mayorga said today in an interview. ''But we are going to take a lot of wealth that has been misused, mismanaged, pilfered by the Sandinista Government, and distribute it to the society in a very democratic way.''
Before Mrs. Chamorro's victory over President Daniel Ortega Saavedra in national elections last Sunday, many senior opposition leaders spoke of their platform only in broad terms.
But backed by an electoral victory margin of more than 14 percentage points, the opposition has given its program new definition. And it has drawn the lines for what is expected to be a political battle over the practical legacy of the decade-long Sandinista revolution.
The most critical points to be negotiated with Sandinista officials, opposition leaders say, are the dismantling of the contra army and the ending of Sandinista control over Nicaragua's large military and security forces. Those issues, which are being discussed by negotiating teams established on Tuesday, are expected to define what opposition leaders say is a critical test of Sandinista good faith.
''It is their obligation to hand over power,'' said Virgilio Godoy Reyes, Mrs. Chamorro's Vice Presidential running mate, ''and to hand it over completely, not in pieces or installments.''
But broader conflicts have begun to emerge over the opposition's intention to dismantle the large government sector created by Sandinista policy, and to use the proceeds to reverse or make compensation for the extensive confiscation of property by the Sandinista leadership in its early years of power.
 
How Property Was Redistributed
Since the Sandinista revolution succeeded in 1979, opposition economists say, the Government has taken control of approximately 40 percent of the country's arable farmland.
Of that, they estimate, a little less than half belonged to the family or associates of the ousted dictator, Anastasio Somoza Debayle; the rest was seized for political, military and economic reasons by Government decree.
Mr. Mayorga said the new government does not intend to return the land that belonged to Mr. Somoza and his associates because it considers those confiscations justified. But he said all other seized property would be subject to recovery by its original owners under provisions being worked out by the new leaders.
In the case of unoccupied farmland, he said, the former owners will be able to apply for new titles. For land that has already been given to small farmers under Sandinista agrarian-reform programs, original owners will be compensated with transferable coupons redeemable at special auctions of Government land, he said.
Roughly 20 percent of all confiscated land has been distributed in the form of private parcels or state-organized cooperatives, and would fall into the same category, Mr. Mayorga said.
He did not identify the state enterprises the new government is planning to sell. But they are expected to include businesses ranging from the state monopoly on grain distribution to confiscated sugar mills, textile factories and seafood processors.
 
Hopes of Enough for Everyone
Mr. Mayorga expressed confidence that, given the large amount of property left in state hands from the Somoza family's holdings, there will be enough idle land to redeem all outstanding claims by Nicaraguans. If there is not enough, he said, the government will issue long-term bonds to compensate the original owners.
''We'll make sure everybody gets a piece of the rock,'' said Mr. Mayorga, a Yale-educated economist.
The return of such property is bitterly opposed by Sandinista leaders, who view the redistribution of agricultural land as one of the most important achievements of their 10-year rule.
Opposition officials also said they planned to encourage the return of the Nicaraguan professionals who fled the country in large numbers during Sandinista rule. Mrs. Chamorro's advisers hope to pass new legislation providing broad tax incentives and even direct aid to Nicaraguans living in exile so that they can return.
Those plans will depend in part on foreign assistance, which has yet to be confirmed. But Alfredo Cesar Aguirre, a top opposition adviser, said Mrs. Chamorro has already received offers of help from dozens of countries. There have been unofficial talks with the Soviet Union, whose Ambassador in Managua, Valery D. Nikolayenko, visited the President-elect today.

HEADLINE: Panel Says Broad Health Care Would Cost $86 Billion a Year

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
A sharply divided bipartisan commission today recommended an $86.2-billion-a-year program to provide health insurance and long-term nursing care to every American who needs them. But the panel could not recommend specific ways to raise the money.
Some members of the panel, the Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, said the program stood little chance of being enacted without a way to finance it.
''We are not dealing with the world's easiest problem,'' said Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia, who is chairman of the 15-member Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive Health Care, created by Congress in 1988 to recommend legislation on health issues. ''We can't offer easy answers, but we can offer a challenge to this country.'' 
The Bush Administration had asked Republicans on the commission to hold out against any recommendations for tax increases. That, along with a general nervousness among Republicans about significant new health care initiatives, accounted for the narrow 8-to-7 vote by which the panel approved the ambitious plan unveiled today.
Representative Fortney H. Stark, a California Democrat who joined the Republicans in voting against the plan, took note of its bleak legislative outlook. Mr. Stark, chairman of the health subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the split vote indicated ''that it's hopeless to get a comprehensive plan passed in the U.S., with politics being what it is.''
''Without a way to pay for it, it is a non-starter,'' Mr. Stark added. ''It is legislatively dead.'' In forming the panel, Congress had directed it to recommend ''the sources of those funds.''
Although the legislative prospects were described as ''nil'' by one member, the program does provide an accounting of how much major improvements in health care would cost the nation.
The commission put the total Federal share of the programs covering health insurance and nursing homes at $66.2 billion a year. Of this, $42.8 billion would pay for expanded nursing home care for elderly people with low and moderate incomes and for others with severe disabilities.
The remaining $23.4 billion in Federal money would provide health insurance for those who do not already have it. The total cost of the health insurance program would be $43.4 billion, with the remaining $20 billion paid through private employers. The employers would pay 80 percent of that cost and the employees 20 percent.
 
Broad Agreement on Nursing Care
The health insurance section of the plan was adopted by 8 to 7, with some members saying they opposed any additional charges for private employers. On the nursing care proposal, the vote was 11 to 4 in favor.
Under the plan, nursing home coverage would be greatly expanded. The ''severely disabled'' of all ages would receive three months of free care. And the Government would pay the nursing home costs of individuals with assets of $30,000 or less or couples with assets of $60,000 or less.
Under current law, only the elderly receive nursing home coverage, and only for the first 100 days after hospitalization for each spell of illness. To get more Government coverage, they must then divest their assets. They can qualify for Medicaid, the Federal-state program of health care for the poor, if their assets are an average of $2,000 or less.
The plan approved by the panel, named the Pepper Commission after its first chairman, the late Representative Claude Pepper of Florida, does not require such divestiture.
''This gets us out of povertizing people because they're disabled,'' said Senator Dave Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota, a commission member who voted for the nursing care program but joined the three other Republican members in opposing the health insurance program.
 
'No Consensus,' Sullivan Says
The panel was appointed in 1988 by President Ronald Reagan, the Senate and the House. It has eight Democrats, four Republicans and three members who were not appointed on the basis of party membership, including a past president of the American Medical Association.
Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, called the report ''a sincere and commendable effort.''
''However, it is important to note the wide divergence of views within the commission itself,'' Dr. Sullivan continued. ''This divergence reflects the simple fact that there is no consensus in this country today on how to achieve the kind of health care system we want, or how the cost of improvements in our system should be borne.''
Senator Rockefeller was more optimistic. He said there was growing recognition that ''the American health care system is in total crisis.''
''We're plunging ahead in this country toward a health care catastrophe,'' he added.
The commission proposal differs in many respects from the short-lived Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, repealed last year, which covered the costs of hospitals and doctors for the elderly, but not long-term nursing care, which many older Americans sought and indeed thought the act had provided.
The proposal also calls for ''reforms'' in the health insurance industry. It would require insurers to base their premiums on the health experience of a community, and prohibit insurers from refusing to sell policies to people with health problems.
''We would pre-empt state health insurance laws,'' Mr. Rockefeller said.
The commission report received mixed notices. The American Medical Association hailed it. ''The American people were the real winners,'' said Dr. James E. Davis, the former A.M.A. president who was a member of the panel.
Ron Pollack, president of Families United for Senior Action, an advocacy group for the elderly, said that the report ''calls to mind President John F. Kennedy's proposal of Medicare 30 years ago.''
 
'A Mixed Bag'
But the United States Chamber of Commerce called the recommendations ''a mixed bag,'' and said, ''We are disappointed by the emphasis on mandated benefits as a solution to the access problem.''
Similarly, the Health Insurance Association of America called the report ''a blueprint for economic disaster.'' The organization warned that the requirement that employers provide health insurance for their employees ''could result in increased unemployment and an additional burden on the publicly funded programs.''
Besides Senators Rockefeller and Durenberger, Mr. Stark and Dr. Davis, these are the members of the commission: James Balog, chairman of the Lambert Brussels Capital Corporation.

HEADLINE: Nicaraguans Plan To Unlock U.S. Funds

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
A team of economic advisers to the Nicaraguan President-elect, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, is to arrive here on Monday seeking at least $550 million in aid from the United States and international lending institutions to revive a war-shattered economy.
Jose Antonio Alvarado, a Nicaraguan-born investment banker from Miami who is serving on Mrs. Chamorro's delegation, said in a telephone interview that she would seek $500 million in loans and grants over 18 months to create jobs, reinvigorate Nicaraguan agriculture and develop the country's industrial base.
The four-member delegation will also seek $50 million or more for a special government fund to encourage small business.
Mr. Alvarado said his group's itinerary included meetings with the International Monetary Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank. Describing the Nicaraguan request as ''very modest,'' he emphasized the importance of an economic revival to ''the consolidation of a democratic government.'' 
''We, the United States and the international banking institutions have to move forward as a team,'' he said.
 
Persuading the Policy Makers
The most important mission of the Nicaraguan delegation will be to describe the incoming government's needs to a group of officials from the State, Treasury and Commerce Departments and other United States agencies. The interagency panel is headed by Bernard W. Aronson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs.
''We are prepared to give significant economic aid to Nicaragua,'' Mr. Aronson said. ''Mrs. Chamorro says her two priorities are economic recovery and national reconciliation, and we want to support her on both as effectively and generously as we can.''
Mr. Aronson said it was too early to specify how much aid the United States would be willing to give the new Nicaraguan leaders, who are to take office on April 25.
His group met for the first time on Thursday. A participant who asked not to be identified said the panel had not readied a plan beyond agreeing that the American trade embargo against Nicaragua should be lifted.
''There was nobody at the table who gave a serious analysis of specifics on the economy,'' the official said. ''People first have to look at how we can undo what we have done.''
 
Washington's Budget Limits
Several experts are concerned that Washington will not be able to meet all of Nicaragua's needs. The United States already faces commitments to aid Panama and several countries in Eastern Europe at a time of large American budget deficits.
''For 10 years we had money for the contras and every single effort to destroy Nicaragua, but now there is no money left to rebuild it,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, the chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that deals with foreign aid.
Several members of Congress and of the Bush Administration ''talk of helping Nicaragua, but I have the checkbook here and it is already overdrawn,'' he said in an interview.
A senior official at an international lending institution, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: ''Nicaragua needs large bridge loans, but there will be delays. Bankers and investors will say, 'Before I invest, I want to see how these new guys work out.' ''
 
Legacy of War and Disasters
The new government headed by Mrs. Chamorro will face a difficult challenge. As the President-elect seeks the smoothest possible transition from Sandinista rule, particularly the handing over of control by the security forces, she will also be dealing with the legacy of civil war, natural disasters, the United States trade embargo and poor economic management.
Inflation in Nicaragua was 1,700 percent last year. Unemployment stands at 25 percent, and an estimated 45 percent of Nicaraguans are underemployed. The Government in Managua is effectively bankrupt, and many in the private business sector and the skilled labor force have fled the country.
As April approaches, Nicaraguan farmers need immediate financing to buy seeds and fertilizer.
Commercial bankers and aid specialists at the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank say they cannot lend money to Nicaragua as long as it remains in arrears on its $8 billion foreign debt. Additional loans are unlikely to be granted, they say, unless the United States persuades Japan and Western European Governments to join in providing $500 million in interim loans to bolster Managua's foreign exchange reserves.
Washington must also allow American shipping companies to return to Nicaraguan ports to pick up coffee, cotton and sugar, something they have not done since President Ronald Reagan imposed the trade embargo in 1985.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Decisions On Taxes? Forget Numbers

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
When it comes to tax policy, how you count often depends on where you stand.
Take, for example, the disagreement between the staffs of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation and the Treasury Department over President Bush's proposed capital gains tax cut.
The committee staff says the proposal would cost the Government about $11 billion in lost revenue over the next five years. The experts at the Treasury believe the proposal would lead to an increase in revenue. Who's right? Who knows? 
The amount of money generated by the tax depends on two factors: the tax rate and, because no tax is paid until a profit is realized, how many people decide to sell stocks, bonds and other property.
The tax rate on capital gains is now the same as the tax rate on other income, generally 28 percent or 33 percent. Mr. Bush would lower the rate to around 20 percent in most cases. That would lead more people to sell. The question is, Would enough people sell to increase total tax revenue despite the lower rate?
The problem is that decisions to sell are based on more than the tax rate. They depend, for instance, on how well the stock market will do, what will happen to real estate prices and what kind of new opportunities will become available to entice investors. Experts make different judgments on those matters. And so the fact is that the question of whether to lower the capital gains tax is political and not simply budgetary.
Democrats argue that the tax break would be unjust because it would mostly benefit the wealthy directly. Republicans say it would help the economy so much that everyone would benefit at least indirectly.
No one doubts that the staff experts are honorable. But those in Congress are answerable to Democrats; those in the Treasury, to Republicans.
A similar disagreement has arisen over the fairness of recent changes in the tax system. The question is central to the issue of how the country changed in the Reagan years.
Last month, the staff of the House Ways and Means Committee, controlled by Democrats, published a study examining whether, the tax system became more progressive or regressive over the last decade. A tax is said to be progressive if the ratio of taxes to income rises as incomes rise. It is regressive if the ratio falls as incomes rise.
The pivotal table in the study shows that counting all taxes - income taxes, Social Security and Medicare taxes and excise taxes - the effective tax rate for the poorest 20 percent of the population rose by 16.1 percent from 1980 to 1990. The effective rate, the proportion of taxes to total income, for the wealthiest 20 percent fell by 5.5 percent in that period. Moreover, the table indicates, the rate for the wealthiest 10 percent fell by 7.3 percent and for the wealthiest 5 percent, it fell by 9.5 percent.
After the study received a bit of publicity, the Administration came out swinging. The staffs of the Office of Management and Budget and the Council of Economic Advisers published their own analysis, attacking not the Ways and Means Committee's facts, which are unassailable, but the study's ''serious conceptual problems and methodological flaws.''
The Administration's economists argued, for example, that the Congressional staff had skewed the results by choosing 1980 and 1990 as its ''end points.'' In 1980, the economists said, ''inflation-induced bracket creep'' had led to unusually high tax rates. Moreover, 1987 is the last year for which the Internal Revenue Service has full data. Thus the Congressional report relied on projections to arrive at its figures for later years.
From 1977 to 1980 and from 1985 to 1990, the Administration observed, producing a table of its own, the tax system became more progressive. A better 10-year period to measure, these economists said, would be 1977 to 1987.
But that would skew the results also. In 1987, the lower rates enacted in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 were not fully in place. Income taxes were clearly more progressive in 1987 than they have been since.
That the data are inconclusive underscores an important point. Changes in the tax system may indeed be in the offing this year. Capital gains taxes may be cut. The top income tax rate may be raised. The Social Security tax may be lowered. But the impetus will be politics, not the numbers.

A Writer in Castro's Stifling Shadow

BYLINE: By Herbert Mitgang

 BODY:

Self-Portrait of the Other
By Heberto Padilla
Translated by Alexander Coleman. 247 pages. Farrar Straus & Giroux. $19.95.
Fidel Castro looms like a wraith over the remarkably calm but highly revealing pages of Heberto Padilla's memoir, ''Self-Portrait of the Other.'' The author, one of Cuba's leading poets (''Legacies: Selected Poems'') and novelists (''Heroes Are Grazing in My Garden''), knew Fidel Castro at the beginning of the revolution, became one of his followers and was given a cultural post in the Foreign Commerce Ministry. Then, as the revolution turned into an oligarchy, the poet allowed his disenchantment to show openly. 
Although we know it has happened in dictatorial countries on the left and right, it is still hard for an American reader to imagine that an author could be thrown into jail because his poetry was out of favor or that a book review he wrote could so displease the powers in the official Writers' Union that he would be placed under house arrest. Only after growing protests by people like Bernard Malamud, then president of the American branch of PEN, Robert Silvers of The New York Review of Books and Senator Edward M. Kennedy and an international outcry by dozens of distinguished authors was Mr. Padilla permitted by the Maximum Leader of Cuba to leave for the United States in 1980.
Mr. Padilla comes through as an honest observer who seems able to distance himself from his oppressors and from the beatings he received that led to a forced confession of wrongdoing. He even forms a dispassionate judgment about Fidel Castro, who, like the right-wing rulers in Latin America, never sheds his uniform. The surprising portrait of Mr. Castro that emerges is not of an ogre but of a tragic figure unable to hear himself talking, deaf to the opinions of his own countrymen and stuck in a time warp of failed Marxist theory.
In a final face-to-face meeting with the Maximum Leader, Mr. Padilla is told that he is free to leave Cuba -and to return some time in the future. ''Stay as long as you want,'' Mr. Castro tells him, ''and when you want to come back, give me a call. If you are a true revolutionary, you will want to return.'' Then Mr. Castro lectures his old friend in these antediluvian words in defense of a police state:
''What is most obvious in your conduct over the past years is your blind hatred for State Security. Would you mind telling me what government on this earth is able to do without it? It is inevitable in a revolution. People who criticize a revolution may be mistaken, they may be sincere, but they are dangerous nonetheless. To create a new society, we have to demand national unity. Marx and Lenin are the prototypes of a revolutionary and they were both implacable with their enemies.'' To which, the author comments, ''For Fidel, an enemy was anyone who displayed the merest disagreement with his ideas.''
Of equal interest in ''Self-Portrait of the Other,'' which was translated from the Spanish by Alexander Coleman, are the author's encounters with literary personages he met in the 1960's while a correspondent for Prensa Latina, the Cuban press agency, in Moscow, Paris and London before returning to Cuba to serve the revolution.
Yevgeny Yevtushenko, the Russian poet, told Mr. Padilla that he knew what disappointed him about the Soviet Union: ''The lack of freedom, the power of the Secret Police, the untouchable bureaucracies known as the Nomenklatura, the hegemony of the party, the stagnation of literature, the constant pressure of the censor, the cynicism of most of the writers.''
Albert Camus, the French novelist, made him ponder the effect of the sun on writers: ''Also, my impression was that the fact that he was born in Algeria and extolled life, sun, and the sea had irritated those born in the rain and gloom of Paris. Evidently, Camus attracted people with the same intensity as he drew their hatred.''
Mr. Padilla also quotes Jean-Paul Sartre, the French philosopher, on writing and weather: ''Yes, I would have preferred for the characters in 'Nausee' to have had an encounter with the meridional atmosphere of North Africa. But apparently you Cubans react antagonistically toward the milieu into which you were born. You have a prenatal nostalgia for snow.''
''Self-Portrait of the Other'' ends sentimentally as the author gets airborne and leaves his country for self-imposed exile: ''I looked out the window at the great brilliant expanse -that vivid frieze of greenness and luminosity that is Cuba.''
It is too bad that the memoir lacks an epilogue about Cuba today in light of the changes taking place in Moscow, Mr. Castro's source of economic and military aid. An index would also have helped to make ''Self-Portrait of the Other,'' with its many little-known names, more valuable as a reference work. But these omissions do not detract from Mr. Padilla's own story, which he relates with controlled emotional power.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
Now for Election Groupies

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Compared with difficulties ahead, winning Nicaragua's election was the least of Violeta Chamorro's problems. But the elections had to be the first step toward creating (not rebuilding - there never was a substantial foundation) a peaceful, democratic society with a functioning economy.
It is tempting to note superficial similarities of the Nicaraguan lady in white and Corazon Aquino, who wears yellow. Both were catapulted into politics after their crusading husbands were murdered, both have strong support from the Catholic Church, both face a ravaged society. The experience of the Philippines' President holds some warnings for Mrs. Chamorro, too: watch out for corruption and abuse of connections by a large, entrenched family. 
But there are important differences. Fragile and feminine as she is, Mrs. Chamorro has a will of steel, a complete lucidity of purpose and a talent for reconciliation. She held her family together although two of her children are ardent Sandinistas and two are pro-contra. Her troubles in turning the Sandinista-run army and police into non-political forces will be considerably greater than Mrs. Aquino has had, and the economy is run down much worse. Making democracy stick won't be easy.
Still, the successful conduct of free and fair elections in the context of a regional plan brings a starting advantage. Apart from the Nicaraguans themselves, credit goes to Costa Rica's outgoing President, Oscar Arias, who persistently pushed the peace plan despite repeated setbacks, and to Secretary of State James Baker and House Speaker Thomas Foley, who forged the bipartisan compromise establishing U.S. support for a political settlement.
They saw that elections offered the only chance for solution. The vote could have gone the other way. But the thing was to make sure people had the chance to speak for themselves and not through their self-appointed revolutionary or counterrevolutionary armed ''vanguards.''
This is a new development in international affairs. The idea of free elections is as old as democracy, of course. But the idea that foreigners have a right and responsibility to monitor introduces accountability to the world as well as to the electorate.
The monitors' verdict invokes only the force of international opinion, yet a growing force. Acceptance of human rights as a subject for diplomacy only took hold in the last decade or so, and it brought important changes in Europe. Attitudes about the sovereign impunity of states in their domestic deeds have evolved.
Elections are next. Mr. Baker wants to add guarantees for regular, free elections to the Helsinki accords. When they were signed in 1975, many wrote off the human rights commitments as a delusion. Ask Eastern Europeans if they were worth the paper they were written on.
Surprisingly, the Soviets also say elections should be included in a new Helsinki document. It would apply to Europe, themselves and America, and so much the better. International supervision of the campaigning, voting and counting process should not be seen patronizingly as a way for legitimate governments to put nannyish pressure on bad ones, leaving the nannies to look after themselves.
On occasion, the U.S. could have used some certified onlooking. A recent New Yorker series by Robert Caro on Lyndon B. Johnson's Texas elections provided stunning documentation of plain theft, especially in his first election to the Senate. Questions about propriety of the Chicago vote count that assured John F. Kennedy's becoming President might not have arisien if international election watching were the rule.
It's no shame to invite outside observers into the family precincts. The more countries that accept monitoring as standard, the harder it will be for cheaters to refuse, and the more obvious their reason.
There's a certain tasty irony in Nicaragua's being the country to prove the value and effectiveness of a horde of foreign ballot overseers. Nicaragua was one of the countries that played host to thousands of revolutionary groupies who ran from Havana to Lisbon to Madrid and on in the 1970's and 80's. If they weren't all the same people, they were look-alikes in their leather sandals and their defiant rejection of grooming.
The Nicaraguans called them ''sandalistas,'' and Mrs. Chamorro's newly elected Vice President, Virgilio Godoy, has invited them to go home. Replacing them with a new set of well-shod itinerant groupies keeping the vote honest would do a world of good, in a world loudly signaling that's the way it wants to go.

HEADLINE: Bush's 'Whitewash Effect' on Warming

BYLINE: By James H. Scheuer; James H. Scheuer, Democrat of New York, is chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Environment.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In his recent speech to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, President Bush, who promised in his campaign to use the ''White House effect'' to counter the ''greenhouse effect,'' delivered the ''whitewash effect'' instead.
Coming in the wake of the Hague conference, in which the U.S. was virtually alone in opposing proposals to cut emissions of gases that cause global warming, the speech was another example of his abdication of global leadership on the environment.
His top advisers reportedly were unanimous in urging him to take action to reduce emissions. They included William Reilly, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency; James Watkins, Secretary of Energy; Secretary of State James Baker, and the science adviser, Dr. D. Allan Bromley. 
Such unanimity is astonishing: for years, the Energy Department fought to protect the U.S. fossil fuel industry from E.P.A. forays. But this hard-won unanimity was overturned by the White House chief of staff, John Sununu, whose supposed qualification is a mechanical engineering degree.
Attacking ''faceless bureaucrats'' for trying to ''create a policy in this country that cuts off our use of coal, oil and natural gas,'' Mr. Sununu defended his veto on the grounds of two beliefs: that scientific evidence was insufficient to warrant action and that antipollution measures would sap U.S. economic growth. The first proposition is dubious; the second, preposterous.
Days later, when eight prestigious environmental organizations sent Mr. Bush a letter criticizing his aide's action, Jay Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation, said with exasperation, ''The American people did not elect John Sununu.''
No one denies that pollution has dramatically changed the world's atmosphere. What is in question, and fiendishly difficult to prove, are the effects of the changes.
Most scientists agree that increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will inevitably lead to global warming. But no one is certain how fast and how much temperatures will rise, and what the effects will be in any geographical area.
Scientific uncertainty does not mean we have to wait for more research to take action. We do not need to know everything in order to do anything. The relevant policy question is not whether the scientists are right but whether policy makers can afford to be wrong. Suppose we take reasonable, cost-effective steps to slow down global warming, and learn later the scientists were wrong and we didn't have to do anything after all.
Admittedly, we will have spent billions of dollars to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. But, wisely spent, that investment will have brought us billions of dollars of benefits: reduced pollution, improved health, more energy-efficient cars, U.S. industry that is more internationally competitive and the creation of new global markets for American-made environmental technologies and services.
But suppose we gamble that global warming won't happen, and are wrong. When we have unambiguous evidence that warming is happening, it will be too late to slow it down.
Scenarios of sudden change - temperatures climbing three to five degrees in a decade - pose the greatest risks. Predicted plagues will come to pass: forests will die, crops will wither, oceans will rise, disease will increase. And we will be defenseless before them. Money in the bank, unspent to reach environmental goals, will then be cold comfort.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Sununu would have us believe we can protect ourselves from global warming only at the expense of economic growth. But Japan's impressive economic growth has hardly been stymied by its huge investment in some of the world's toughest air pollution controls and its development of an economic sector twice as energy-efficient as ours.
On the contrary, Japanese companies see environmental protection as a major market opportunity, and are aggressively developing and selling environmental technologies.
The ''jobs vs. environment'' argument is a myth handed down by an earlier generation of industrialists and long discredited. It deserves a decent burial, even by Mr. Sununu, who surely knows better - or should.

HEADLINE: After 12 Years, Koch Says Rohatyn Misuses Watchdog Power

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
In a stinging personal rebuke that unleashed the pent-up frustrations of 12 years in office, former Mayor Edward I. Koch of New York City has accused Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker and chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, of misusing his power as head of the fiscal watchdog agency.
Responding to recent published criticism of his fiscal stewardship by Mr. Rohatyn, Mr. Koch broke his past posture of wary respect for Mr. Rohatyn's powers and accused him of parlaying his reputation into millions of dollars in investment-banking fees.
Mr. Koch said Mr. Rohatyn had used ''his considerable political and presentational skills'' to acquire ''sole and inappropriate discretion'' in disposing of billions of dollars in city tax revenues. He called him ''the Robert Moses of municipal finance,'' a reference to the powerful but unelected ''master builder'' who dominated planning in the city for decades. 
The former Mayor made his comments in a letter that he sent to the weekly magazine 7 Days, which recently published an article in which Mr. Rohatyn said that Mr. Koch had ''squandered a lot of opportunity'' by increasing New York City's work force and granting labor settlements that were too generous and that contributed to the city's current fiscal problems. Mr. Rohatyn's office said last night that Mr. Rohatyn had left for Europe and could not be reached for comment. The office said it could not provide a telephone number for him in Europe.
The article quoted Mr. Rohatyn as saying, ''I could argue that if Ed Koch had been more austere in his labor contracts and the size of the city's payroll and the number of people on the public payroll - in squirreling away in some of the good times to deal with what was coming - that we wouldn't be in the shape we're in today.''
Mr. Rohatyn has made similar comments in the past and Mr. Koch has chafed at them, as he has at statements by Mr. Rohatyn and others that he interpreted as suggesting he had not played a major role in helping the city out of the fiscal crisis of the mid- and late 70's. But Mr. Rohatyn's comments were often couched in the dry language of fiscal reports and Mr. Koch has never before criticized Mr. Rohatyn so harshly in public.
''You have to understand that that kind of letter I wanted to write a dozen times,'' Mr. Koch said last night, after making a copy of it available to The New York Times. ''But every time I thought of writing it and discussed it with our people, they said, 'Listen, the law allows him to tie up city monies, and we are dependent on his largesse.' ''
''But I don't have that constraint any more, and I can tell him exactly what I think is truthful.''
''I would not have sent this letter except for the unprovoked, gratuitous, false attack launched by him,'' Mr. Koch added.
The Municipal Assistance Corporation was created by state legislation in the wake of the fiscal crisis. Its purpose was to issue bonds so the city could borrow indirectly in the public credit markets from which it was barred because of its precarious situation. The bonds are backed by the city's sales tax revenues, which the assistance corporation diverts to pay the interest and principal.
 
Koch's Accusation
Appointed in the mid-70's by Gov. Hugh L. Carey, Mr. Rohatyn has dictated how the city could spend any surplus revenues after the bondholders are paid.
But Mr. Koch said Mr. Rohatyn had created artificial surpluses by assuming that diverted revenues waiting to be paid out would earn unrealistically low interest. When more interest is earned, Mr. Koch said, Mr. Rohatyn declares a surplus and keeps control over the money, rather than returning it to the city's general fund. He said Mr. Rohatyn had created similar surpluses by periodic refinancings of the corporation's bonds.
''In other words,'' Mr. Koch's letter said, ''Felix through M.A.C. accumulates funds that otherwise would be available to support the city's operating expenses and insists that these funds, which he should never have accumulated, be used for specific one-time uses that he thinks have the highest priority.''
''Who elected this guy to make those kinds of decisions?'' the letter asked. ''Certainly not the people of the City of New York!''
 
Challenge on Work Force
In recent years, Mr. Rohatyn has proposed using surpluses mostly for mass transit and schools, insisting on the creation of a new School Construction Authority before he would make some money available. Mr. Koch said the money could well be used for other purposes.
In the 7 Days article, Mr. Rohatyn is quoted as saying: ''What Ed wanted to do was for us simply to give him the money for the expense budget, and we just didn't want to do it.''
Mr. Koch said most of the staffing increases that Mr. Rohatyn had faulted were for mandated programs like special education, child abuse, jails and homeless shelters. He challenged Mr. Rohatyn to specify how many thousands of workers should be cut.
The former Mayor also said he took quick action in the wake of the 1987 stock market plunge to limit the city's spending and ''continued that retrenchment until the day I left office.''
Mr. Koch also faulted Mr. Rohatyn, a member of Mayor David N. Dinkins's council of economic advisers, for not attacking the city's plan to help close its budget gap for the current fiscal year by using $150 million in one-time revenues from the sale of long-term bonds by the Battery Park City Authority to meet current expenses - a move some fiscal monitors have criticized.
 
'Talk Is Always Cheap'
''Yet rather than be the watchdog at the gate,'' Mr. Koch said, ''he is acting like a pampered poodle lying quiet as a lap dog.''
Mr. Koch's letter also accused Mr. Rohatyn, a senior partner in the investment banking concern Lazard Freres & Company, of profiting from his repuation for fiscal probity.
''Talk is always cheap,'' he added. ''Felix has parlayed that talk into millions of dollars in fees received from other cities and individuals based on his fame as M.A.C. chairman.'' Mr. Koch noted that Mr. Rohatyn takes no pay as chairman of the commission.
''Some sacrifice,'' he wrote. ''He is also exempt under the law for all conflicts of interests.''

HEADLINE: 3 Cities in Connecticut Begin Laying Off Workers

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 2

 BODY:
Facing declining revenues and a rising demand for more social services, three of Connecticut's largest cities - Bridgeport, New Haven and Stamford - have begun laying off employees and paring municipal programs to balance their budgets.
So far the layoffs have been small: 89 employees in New Haven, 15 in Bridgeport, 13 in Stamford. But layoffs are often viewed as a last resort for fixing city finances.
Officials in the three cities blamed their fiscal troubles on factors ranging from the Northeast's economic slowdown, particularly the depressed real-estate market, to the financing of social services, a burden that has been shifted to cities by Federal and state governments. 
''It's the trickle-down effect of 10 years of Reaganomics,'' said Stamford's Commissioner of Finance, Paul A. Pacter.
 
It Could Get Worse
They also criticized neighboring suburbs for not helping solve regional problems, like homelessness, that manifest themselves most often in urban areas.
The officials warned that the budget troubles in the three cities - as well as in some cities in New Jersey and New York - could worsen during the year, forcing more layoffs, service cuts and tax increases.
In New Haven, the newly elected Mayor, John Daniels, has already reduced a shortfall in the city's $235 million budget from $11.7 million to $3.5 million by laying off 89 workers and eliminating another 26 jobs through attrition. None of the cuts came from the police or fire departments. The city has about 4,000 employees, including school personnel.
New Haven was recently placed on Standard and Poor's CreditWatch list, suggesting that its bond rating might soon be lowered. Besides the layoffs, New Haven has closed an ice rink, restricted overtime, and cut back on publications.
Officials have also started negotiations with Yale University about possibly taxing some of its properties in the city, like athletic facilities.
 
Blames Previous Mayor
''They understand the plight of the city,'' said Allen Howe, an assistant press secretary to Mayor Daniels.
The Acting Controller, Peter Halsey, blamed the shortfall in part on slow collection of back taxes and a soft real estate market, which has made it difficult to sell some municipal properties.
But the largest cause, he said, was the unrealistic budget of the previous administration headed by Mayor Biagio DiLieto.
''It was unrealistically optimistic,'' Mr. Halsey said. ''The revenue projections were way too high, and expense projections were too low.''
Bridgeport, the state's largest city, with about 135,000 residents, is expected to have a small surplus this fiscal year. But Mary Moran, the city's newly elected Mayor, said this week that the city may have to lay off more workers next year to trim a projected $28 million deficit.
 
Long History of Trouble
Already, 15 employees in the parks and public works departments have been dismissed. ''There are going to be more,'' said Richard V. Robinson, the city's financial director.
Bridgeport, which has about 4,000 employees and an operating budget of about $285 million, has a long history of financial troubles. Three years ago, it obtained state-backed bonds to cover a $60 million deficit. In return, the state appointed a special panel to oversee the city's finances.
Mr. Robinson added that the city's unions' contracts may have to be renegotiated to bring down next year's projected shortfall.
The city is one of the state's poorest and has one of its highest property tax rates. ''Raising taxes is an option that the Mayor has said she will look at last,'' Mr. Robinson said. #5 Percent Cuts Requested By contrast, Stamford, with a population of 110,000, became one of the wealthier cities in Connecticut in the 1980's as it became the business center of Fairfield County. It has had budget surpluses every year for the last seven years, but not for the current year. No estimate of the projected deficit has been announced.
This week, however, Mayor Thom Serrani laid off 13 public works employees and ordered all city departments, including the police, to cut their budgets by 5 percent. The city has an operating budget of about $250 million and a 3,200-employee payroll.
Mr. Pacter blamed the deficit in part on the loss of at least $500,000 in conveyance taxes and building permit fees because of the slow real-estate market. He also said the market is so depressed that the city has been unable to find a buyer for $3 million of the $5 million in property it hoped to sell this year to help pay for the $45 million office building it bought from G.T.E. in 1986 for a new city hall.
''The real estate market is in the doldrums,'' he said.
 
Not Just Connecticut
Cities in New Jersey and New York are facing similar fiscal pressures. None of the major cities, though, have resorted to laying off workers so far.
''It's a problem that's starting to come to a head in certain communities, but it hasn't reached a critical point'' said Christopher J. Carew, analyst with the New Jersey League of Municipalities in Trenton.
In Yonkers, the fourth-largest city in New York with a population of about 190,000, revenue from three sources -real-estate transfer taxes, income-tax surcharges and sales taxes - is declining. The city is considering labor cutbacks.
City Manager Neil J. DeLuca estimated that the city's 1,943-person work force will be reduced by about 40 positions through attrition.
He said revenue from the city's property tax has remained constant, but declines in the real-estate transfer tax and city income tax are hurting the city's $372 million budget.
 
Slowdowns All Over
''We derive over $30 million from the two sources, but a soft real-estate market and a generally declining economy is hurting both,'' he said.
He added that sales-tax revenues have also slowed. ''We get about $30 million from the sales tax, and we are projecting a 2 to 3 percent growth rate,'' he said. ''If that number doesn't come up, we'll have to start laying people off.''
In White Plains, a city of 45,000 that swells by 200,000 commuters every weekday, Mayor Alfred Del Vecchio said the city was feeling the effects of a decline in revenues because of a stagnant housing market and a slow market in office space.
''There's a slowdown in new construction - by popular demand,'' he said, explaining that the city had reached a saturation point.
''We have 1,000 residential units for sale, which is a lot. Office space also is not renting, and new construction is coming on line. In fact, our new construction has practically come to a halt.''
He said municipalities also continue to suffer from mandates imposed by the state and Federal governments. ''The Federal E.P.A. says we'll have cleaner air and water, and the state passes the new regulations on to us, sometimes adding their own higher standards,'' he said. ''So we have to hire our own consultants and absorb other costs to fulfill these requirements.''
Mr. Del Vecchio also said that the state recently passed a telecommunications bill barring the city from taxing equipment inside a building. ''We have a lot of telephone company equipment in this city, so it will mean a $20 million loss to us over the next four years,'' he said.

HEADLINE: 2 Investor Groups Go To Waterford's Aid

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, March 2

 BODY:
Investor groups led by Morgan Stanley & Company and Anthony J. F. O'Reilly have come to the rescue of Waterford Wedgwood P.L.C., the troubled maker of crystal and china.
Under the investment plan anounced today in Dublin, the two groups will together hold a 29.9 percent stake in the company, which is staggering under a burden of $233.7 million in debt.
Both Morgan Stanley and Mr. O'Reilly, who is chairman of the Pittsburgh-based H. J. Heinz Company and a leading industrialist in his native Ireland, said they were eager to invest in a company with luxury brands. ''There are 250 quintessential brands in the world,'' Mr. O'Reilly said in a telephone interview from Dublin, ''With Waterford and Wedgford, we have two of those.'' 
Morgan Stanley Leveraged Equity Fund II L.P. and Fitzwilton P.L.C., the group led by Mr. O'Reilly, will each pay about $61.5 million for their stake. They also plan to raise about $35.8 million through a share offering to Waterford shareholders. A substantial portion of the $158.9 million will be used to reduce Waterford's debt to about $80 million.
''I look forward to spending more of my time on operations and less on servicing an untenable level of debt,'' Patrick P. Bryne, Waterford Wedgwood's chief executive, said today in a telephone interview.
The heavy debt - a result of the $360 million-plus purchase of the British Wedgwood by the Irish Waterford in 1986 - proved to be too much as the company was hit by a host of problems.
When they merged, Waterford and Wedgwood had hoped to modernize their production and increase their worldwide marketing power. But the company found itself spending more time digging out of problems than exploiting opportunities.
Last April the Waterford crystal unit was found to be suffering from serious accounting and operation problems and had overstated 1988 earnings by some $21 million. That produced deep losses for the unit, largely offsetting the record operating earnings of Wedgwood.
Patrick Hayes, who was then chairman and chief executive, resigned, as did the finance director. The head of the crystal unit retired.
The company was dealt another blow when the crucial American and British markets softened last year. With Waterford's losses remaining high and Wedgwood's profits sinking, the company had a pretax loss of $32 million in 1989 on sales of $542.5 million.
The United States accounts for 40 percent of total sales and 70 percent of crystal sales. Britain accounts for about a third of total sales and 32 percent of china sales.
 
Labor Troubles
The company's problems have been compounded by an exodus of Wedgwood management and labor difficulties. After agreeing to a three-year wage freeze last summer, the 2,100 workers at Waterford crystal, who are among the highest paid in Ireland, rebelled when asked to make further concessions to increase productivity and lower costs.
Although the reduction in debt will certainly help, ''there are formidable problems to overcome,'' said John Hogan, head of research at Riada & Company, a Dublin brokerage.
Indeed, the labor impasse remains to be broken. The American and British economies are barely growing. Several department store chains in the United States are in bankruptcy proceedings or on the auction block. Dr. Hogan believes the company will be lucky to break even on a pretax basis in 1990.
Nonetheless, the leaders of Morgan Stanley and Fitzwilton say they are confident Waterford Wedgwood will become highly profitable. A Record of Winners Both Morgan Stanley and Fitzwilton have a strong record of picking winners. Morgan Stanley's first leveraged fund invested $30 million and returned $700 million.
The current Morgan Stanley fund, which is two years old, has invested about $900 million in 12 companies, including big American corporations like Colt Industries, the diversified manufacturer, and Fort Howard, the paper-products maker. The fund has a target rate of return of 40 percent pretax a year. ''To date, all of the investments, except one, are on track,'' said Robert H. Niehaus, a managing director of Morgan Stanley.
Mr. Niehaus is optimistic that Waterford will not be the second disappointment.
''Almost all the problems and losses are on the crystal side, and we are confident that the new management team will get that business to a reasonable cost position,'' he said. ''We see significant growth potential in the china business in the United States and Japan and we see additional growth opportunites in both the United States and Britain for the crystal business.''
Mr. O'Reilly will be applying his marketing skills to helping Waterford Wedgwood exploit those opportunities. He will be one of the four non-executive directors of Waterford Wedgwood from Fitzwilton and Morgan Stanley.
 
To Help Map Strategy
While he does not intend to play a day-to-day role, Mr. O'Reilly made it clear that he intended to help Wedgwood with its marketing strategy ''particularly in the North American market, with which I have considerable familiarity,'' he said.
He also intends to push management to do what he did successfully at Heinz: cut costs and increase volume to raise profit margins substantially, and then plow much of that cash into ''extra marketing.''
Another way to increase profits, he said, is to expand in Japan, where Wedgwood china is already doing well and where Waterford crystal has recently been introduced. Other makers of luxury goods - including Cartier, Dunhill and LVMH - have made ''very, very substantial profits'' by selling to the Japanese, he noted.
Mr. O'Reilly, 53 years old, is one of Ireland's leading press entrepreneurs. He also has interests in hotels and oil prospecting and owns a 500-acre estate in County Kildare, with a 28-room, 18th-century mansion.
He owns 10 percent of Fitzwilton, as does Metromedia, which is headed by John Kluge, and the Power Corporation, the Canadian company headed by Paul Demarais.
 
Diversified Investments
Fitzwilton's investments include Ford and General Motors dealerships in Britain, an Irish exporter of commercial freezers, a manufacturer of reflective materials and a big distributor of food and non-food cash-and-carry goods. Its companies have sales of about $600 million, and analysts estimate it earned $20 million in 1989. After the $61.5 million it plans to spend on Waterford Wedgwood, its investment will total about $190 million.
The price of 37.5 Irish pence, or 58 cents, a share that the two groups are paying for their stake in Waterford compares with the stock's peak of 150 pence in 1987. Fitzwilton initially began talks with Waterford two and a half years ago, but dropped out when the stock reached 140 pence.
On the London Stock Exchange, the stock closed today at 47 pence, up 2 pence.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Germany And Japan Sell Dollars

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
In an unusual double-barreled assault, the central banks of West Germany and Japan intervened in foreign exchange markets yesterday to defend their currencies against a weeklong rally in the dollar.
The Bank of Japan, even with aid from the Federal Reserve's sale of dollars in New York, was not successful. The dollar rose to 150.25 yen, its highest level in more than two and a half years. The dollar was up from 149.85 yen Thursday and from 147.07 a week ago. 
The Bundesbank of West Germany, with help from the central banks of France and Spain, was able to slow the dollar's rise but it will not be clear for some time if the bank will be able to cap it. The dollar ended at 1.7177 marks, down from its day's high of 1.7230 and a little below Thursday's 1.7197. It had fallen to 1.7080 after the Bundesbank intervened yesterday but then rallied back. For the week, the dollar is up almost three pfennigs.
 
Varied Reasons for Rise
The dollar's strength against the Japanese currency is a result of troubles in the Japanese economy that have weakened investors' desire to hold yen. Against the mark, the rally is, in part, a response to uncertainty about the economic effect of the unification of the two Germanys.
For the Japanese, the dollar-selling is a determined effort to stem the yen's decline. The Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve have been selling dollars together for a week in support of the yen, which now is well above the 140 level thought to be the top of the range agreed to by the United States and its economic allies in the Group of Seven industrial nations.
Market experts say the weak yen is a major cause of the sharp stock market decline in Japan.
Of the two tools used by governments to support their currencies -intervention and higher interest rates to attract investors - only intervention is available to Japan right now because of a stalemate over interest rate policy.
In a very public dispute, the Bank of Japan is backing higher interest rates to support the yen and fight inflation, but the Finance Ministry is worried that higher rates would further depress the stock market. As a result, no action has been taken and the official discount rate in Japan, which is used to signal the direction for interest rates, remains at 4.25 percent.
The declining yen is also likely to hurt the effort by Japan to reduce its trade surplus with the United States, an issue that is expected to be addressed as President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu meet this weekend in Palm Springs, Calif.
 
Prediction on Rates
Ian Spence, the chief foreign exchange trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, said he thought it would now take a steep rise in Japan's discount rate to help the yen.
For the Bundesbank, traders said, the dollar-selling was more of a gentle reminder to the market that the central bank does not want the mark to weaken much because a stronger currency helps German officials control inflation.
While inflation is now low in West Germany, the plan for unification of the two Germanys has led to fears of sharply higher inflation. So the dollar-selling was also a way the Bundesbank could signal its determination to resist future inflationary pressures.
The action also suggests that the Bundesbank would prefer to keep the dollar at or just below 1.70 marks, which is believed to be the bottom of the range agreed to by the United States and its economic allies.
John Lipsky, director of international bond trading at Salomon Brothers in London, said the move by the Bundesbank was a ''signal to show the market that the central bank was still around.''
 
A Credibility Problem Is Seen
He said the central bank was facing a credibility problem because it had to convince the markets that it could curb the inflation that is expected when unification causes a burst of spending by the West German Government and East German consumers.
Yet, with inflation now so low in Germany, it is hard to justify any major policy shift, like raising interest rates, that would display the Bundesbank's commitment. Inflation for the 12 months ended in February was 2.6 percent, the same as the January number and down from a 3 percent annual rate for November and December.
This was the first dollar-selling by the Bundesbank since Jan. 4, when a surprise intervention sent the dollar down sharply. This round was less of a surprise because the dollar had risen this week to 1.72 marks, around the level at which the Bundesebank intervened in January.
A German official familiar with Bundesbank policy said the dollar-selling yesterday did not represent any new policy.

HEADLINE: Leading Indicators Unchanged

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
The Government's barometer of economic vitality was flat in January and might have fallen but for a jump in building permits ascribed to mild weather, the Commerce Department said today.
The index of leading indicators was unchanged for the month after rising a revised six-tenths of a percent in December, the department said.
January's performance was weaker than expected by economists, who had generally forecast that the index would rise by three-tenths of a percent. The report comes at a time when other economic data show little growth. 
 
Markets Post Gains
Bond prices rose on the prospect of lower inflation in a weaker economy, which helped support the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up 24.77 points, to 2,660.36.
The department originally said the index, intended to signal the direction of the economy in six to nine months, had risen eight-tenths of a percent in December but revised that to six-tenths.
Seven of the 11 components were negative for the index in January: manufacturers' orders for consumer goods, money supply, orders for plant and equipment, stock prices, commodity prices, an index of consumer expectations and weekly jobless claims.
Three components were positive: building permits, faster vendor deliveries and manufacturers' unfilled orders.
Building permits and housing starts, which had been suppressed by bitterly cold weather in December, rose strongly during the exceptionally mild weather in January.
One indicator, the average workweek, was unchanged in January.
 
How Economists See It
Economists said the report suggests further slow growth in the economy. They said it would not sway the Federal Reserve to change its neutral credit policy.
''I don't think the leading indicators tell us much about the economy,'' said Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank. ''They only reinforce the notion that there are pluses and minuses and we're growing at a pretty slow rate.''
For the near future, economists see the economy plodding along, without sharp upturns or downturns. Inflation, more than growth, will be raising questions in the second quarter, they said.
''For now, it's a continuation of a non-recessionary, non-booming economy,'' said Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
 
G.N.P. Shows Weakness
The Commerce Department said Wednesday that the nation's gross national product, the total output of goods and services, expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of nine-tenths of a percent in the final three months of 1989. That was up from an initial estimate of five-tenths of a percent but was still the weakest quarterly performance since 1986.
With January unchanged, the leading indicators index was at 145.3 of its 1982 base of 100.
The index of coincident indicators, which shows current economic trends, declined seven-tenths of a percent in January after rising two-tenths of a percent in December.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Off 7.1% In January

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
Sales of new single-family homes fell 7.1 percent in January to the lowest level in 10 months, the Commerce Department said today.
The seasonally adjusted January drop, which followed an 8.4 percent decline in December, surprised and distressed industry economists.
They had thought that mild weather and the prospect of higher mortgage rates would prove an incentive for buyers during the month. 
 
Good Weather, Poor Sales
''We were looking for a pretty solid number, largely because of the wonderful weather swing,'' said Dave Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.
Many areas of the country had their warmest January on record, and builders had responded enthusiastically. New-home construction soared 29.6 percent, and 26.7 percent more building permits were issued in January than in December.
But buyers stayed home. The January sales rate, at 589,000 units, was the lowest since March 1989, when the annualized rate was 556,000 units.
''What this means is that builders were stimulated by good weather, but buyers weren't,'' Mr. Seiders said, and that means the level of building activity will be curtailed quickly.
Mr. Seiders said of the outlook for 1990, ''This kind of a start worries us.'' 2 Regions Down and 2 Are Up The biggest regional drop occurred in the South, where sales fell 18.9 percent in January from December levels. Sales dropped 5.9 percent in the West.
But in the Northeast, sales were up 13.5 percent, while the Midwest had a rise of 1.1 percent.
The average price of a new home in January fell to $152,600 from $157,200 in December, the department said, as builders sought to draw in buyers. Many builders also offered free or low-cost options like fireplaces and decks as a sales incentive, Mr. Seiders said.
The median sales price, however, rose to $127,000 from $125,200, meaning half of all sales were above that figure and half were below.
Dick Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, said long-term mortgage rates by mid-January had hit 10 percent for a 30-year loan and were rising.
Normally, rising interest rates encourage sales as buyers seek to lock in mortgages before they climb further, Mr. Peach said.
 
Lack of Demand Cited
''Now that we're very late in the economic recovery, it seems that pent-up demand has largely been satisfied,'' he added, so the potential for sales is weaker.
He said the inventory of unsold homes had risen to a 7.3-month supply by the end of January, up from 7 months in December.
''I don't think we're out of the woods yet as far as the backed-up inventories that builders have to sell,'' Mr. Peach commented. ''That's not a good sign for housing starts.''

HEADLINE: Dow up 24.77; Week's Gain is 96.17

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks closed a week of five consecutive gains yesterday, as bond yields declined and individuals and small institutional investors appeared to move strongly into telephone issues.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.77, to 2,660.36, closing out the week with a cumulative rise of 96.17.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange rose slightly, but was still relatively modest at 164.3 million shares, up from 157.9 million on Thursday. Advances outnumbered declines, 982 to 484. 
 
Best Week Since Plunge
The 3.8 percent rise in the Dow for the week was the best gain since the average rose 4.7 percent, to 2,689.14, in the week ended Oct. 20. That was the week after the Dow fell 190.58 points on Friday, Oct. 13.
The last time the industrial average rose in five consecutive trading sessions was the week ended Nov. 28, when it jumped 69.97 points, to 2,702.01.
Laszlo Birinyi, the president of Birinyi Associates, a Wall Street research firm, said the week's gain was ''no big deal - it's happened 381 times since 1915,'' which was the year that Dow calculations began in their current form.
''The most positive thing today,'' he added, ''is that except for one 'buy program' in the morning, we've had very little program trading. That means you have real buyers in there.''
He said he had spotted numerous orders of fewer than 10,000 shares for the telephone stocks - a sign that individuals and small institutions were buying them.
''It's a positive sign,'' he said, ''and suggests they think interest rates have peaked, or are near the peak.''
American Telephone and Telegraph and the seven regional telephone companies all advanced. Nynex was up 1 3/4, to 81 3/4; Southwestern Bell gained 1 1/4, to 57 1/4; BellSouth was up 1/2, to 53 1/4; U S West rose 5/8, to 69 3/4; Bell Atlantic gained 3/8, to 91 1/4; Pacific Telesis was up 5/8, to 45 1/4, and Ameritech rose 1 1/4, to 59 1/4. A.T.& T. tacked on 1/2, to 40 3/8, with 1.2 million shares changing hands.
Philip Morris, the second-most-active issue, rose 7/8, to 36 7/8, on volume of 2.6 million shares.
Ford Motor rose 1 1/4, to 47 1/8, on 1.36 million shares. General Motors advanced 1, to 46, on nearly 2.5 million shares. Chrysler tacked on 3/4, to 17 1/4. Traders said that analysts were becoming a little more optimistic on American car sales and are now looking for volume to improve.
 
Transportation Issues Gain
The Dow transportation index rose 12.09 points yesterday, to 1,145.98, a 6 percent jump for the week. UAL gained 1 3/4, to 134 1/4, and Conrail rose 1 1/8, to 48 1/8.
Among issues showing strong gains were Circus Circus, the casino operator, which rose 3 1/8, to 50, on a recommendation by Steven Eisenberg, an analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company.
Motorola, which is expected to introduce a new computer on Monday, rose 2 3/8, to 63.
Other averages recorded small gains. The Dow utilities rose 0.50, to 219.63; the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 2.80, to 335.54, and the New York Stock Exchange composite rose 1.45, to 184.97.
The American Stock Exchangex market value index rose 2.08, to 356.12, while the Nasdaq composite tacked on 3.81 points, to 431.02.

Coffee Prices Rise Sharply; Copper Hits a 4-Month High

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Arabica coffee futures rose sharply yesterday on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, and copper futures reached their highest level in nearly four months at the New York Commodity Exchange.
A flurry of late buying lifted coffee for March delivery by 2.25 cents a pound to close at the day's high of 99 cents. The rise was set off by reports that Mexico may buy 500,000 of the 132-pound bags this year. Mexico, a large producer, said on Thursday that it might have to import coffee to make up for short domestic supplies. That amplified existing concerns of tight supplies for immediate needs.
Traders said Mexican processors had already made small purchases.
 
Copper Rises on Supply Concerns
Copper prices rose, meanwhile, in reaction to concerns that supplies are shrinking.
The lack of deliveries against the March contract has signaled traders that supplies are tight. Owners of the deliverable copper may be withholding it, hoping for higher prices.
Helping fuel copper's rally was widespread talk that supplies in London Metal Exchange warehouses may have shrunk by 10,000 metric tons this last week.
Copper contracts for March soared 4.6 cents a pound, to $119.80.
Civil unrest in the Ivory Coast, the world's leading cocoa producer, also set off a wave of nervous buying in cocoa at the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, with the spot March contract rising $50, to $1,123 a ton. Cocoa traders and analysts said they doubted that the price rise would continue.
A slump in cocoa exports has hurt the Ivory Coast's economy, leading to riots and calls for the resignation of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny.

HEADLINE: Soviet Trade Pact Expected

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, March 2

 BODY:
United States officials said today that they expect to conclude a new trade accord with the Soviet Union in time for a superpower summit meeting in June, a move that would end a 16-year dispute linking trade with Soviet emigration policy.
''It is highly likely we will be able to come to a trade agreement in time for the summit,'' the deputy trade representative, Julius Katz, said after two days of talks between United States and Soviet teams in London. ''I don't see any obstacles to that.''
A broad trade pact is a prerequisite for the United States to grant the Soviet Union most-favored-nation status, which would greatly reduce the tariffs on Soviet goods exported to the United States and clear the way for lending to Moscow by the American Government.
The status has been withheld by Washington under the 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment, which denies it to countries that restrict emigration. A law to liberalize emigration is expected to be passed soon by the Soviet Parliament.
President Bush has made the trade pact and most-favored-nation status a centerpiece of his economic show of support for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program. The moves are likely to be portrayed as significant achievements of the June summit meeting.
United States officials said today that they expected a trade pact to be reached by April or May, which would give Congress time to ratify it.
Soviet negotiators were unavailable for comment today, but the delegation leader, Yuri Chumakov, deputy minister for foreign economic relations, said earlier that he was optimistic about an accord, although it would take months to reach.

HEADLINE: Revenue Problems Endanger Budgets In Half the States

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
More than half of the states are battling serious budget problems as they approach the final months of the fiscal year, and eight Eastern states are striving to avoid deficits that could disrupt statewide and local programs.
In the past month there has been a steady drumbeat of fiscal bad news: revenue falling short, programs cut back, workers laid off, economies weakening. The situation has startled the states' officials and prompted partisan squabbling over faulty forecasts and excessive spending. All the fiscal years start July 1 except New York's, which starts April 1.
Congress is also being widely blamed for forcing the states to pay for costly new Medicaid services, and Democratic governors say President Bush's stand against taxes makes it difficult to raise local taxes. 
 
What Bush Said or Didn't
Gov. William A. O'Neill of Connecticut, a Democrat, has personal experience of the unpopularity of raising taxes. ''The tax increase last year for Connecticut is causing me serious political problems, and I certainly won't recommend any this year,'' he said in an interview. ''President Bush has said'No new taxes' so often that people now honestly believe they can get all kind of services without paying for them.''
But Gov. John R. McKernan Jr. of Maine, a Republican who raised taxes last year, retorted in an interview: ''That's whining! President Bush didn't say the Governors shouldn't raise taxes. The President said if taxes have to be raised, raise them at the level closest to the people affected so you can get a debate about whether they are really necessary.''
But experts in public finance say the revenue shortages are primarily a result of a slowing of the national economy that was far worse than had been expected and of state budget forecasters' inability to warn of sudden declines.
 
Bad, but 'Perfectly Ordinary'
''It is the most widespread set of budgetary imbalances that we have seen since the depths of the 1982 recession,'' said Herman B. Leonard, who teaches public finance at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, ''but it is a perfectly ordinary and anticipated outcome of a cooling national economy.''
There is no crisis, Dr. Leonard and other experts say, but there could be greater hardship if states fail to maintain adequate cash reserves to cope with economic slumps.
Interestingly, the Northeastern states are in the most trouble because they enjoyed so much prosperity in recent years, said Dr. Harold A. Hovey, president of State Policy Research, an Alexandria, Va., publisher of periodicals on states' economies. ''Northeastern states estimated better economic growth than the national average, and they are getting economic performance that isn't as good as the national average,'' he said.
 
Where the Deficits Will Be
Potential deficits are ahead this year for Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and West Virgina, according to the National Conference of Legislatures. Those states' revenue shortage is so severe that they are not expected to meet their obligations without raising taxes, floating deficit bonds or making substantial reductions in spending.
New Jersey, for example, expects to eliminate a projected $550 million deficit on its $12.1 billion budget this year through measures like imposing a freeze on state hiring, deferring maintenance on state buildings and returning 500 automobiles in state use to car dealers.
Nineteen other states scattered over every region except the Far West are collecting taxes well below anticipated levels, according to the conference of state legislatures. After conducting a survey, the conference reported Feb. 8 that most states can offer no firm estimates of how slack their revenue has become.
Slack tax revenue usually forces states to draw on cash reserves, postpone some expenditures, or both. Unlike the Federal Government, all states but Vermont have enacted mandatory budget-balancing.
 
Surpluses in the West
California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon and other Western states are still growing, their employment has held steady and they are running surpluses. Budget directors report that Southwestern states, hard hit by sagging oil prices, and Midwestern states, which saw a drop in farm prices in the early 1980's, have stabilized themselves fiscally as a result of improving economic conditions and austerity budgets for several years.
Dr. Hovey said only Nevada and Washington were enjoying a boom, based on substantial growth in personal income, population and employment.
The budget problem in the State of Washington, for example, is figuring the best way to spend an unexpected $724.7 million, Gov. Booth Gardner, a Democrat, said in an interview. ''It's allowing us to fund services that are so badly in need, especially those that help children,'' he said.
Nevadans measure economic conditions by counting big hotels. ''When the Mirage Hotel Casino opened last Thanksgiving in Las Vegas, it was the largest hotel in the world,'' said Lieut. Gov. Robert J. Miller, who has also been Acting Governor since January 1989, after Gov. Richard Bryan was elected to the Senate. ''The Mirage is already the second-largest hotel in Las Vegas. By summer it will be the third largest in Las Vegas, and in two years it could be the fifth largest.''
 
And a Boost for Las Vegas
He said 5,000 people a month move into the Las Vegas area, which helps explain why Nevada is the fastest-growing state in proportion to its population. Nevada expects to have a $30 million surplus in its $3.9 billion two-year budget.
But healthy states can sicken quickly, as the series of deficits in once-booming states demonstrates. ''While there are no overt signs of fiscal stress in the states as a whole, the condition of the Northeastern states is cause for concern,'' says a report on the states' 1990 budgets by the National Association of State Budget Officers. ''The decline in their revenue streams came very quickly and could portend equally rapid downturns in other states.''
Budget forecasts this year have generally fallen in the accepted realm of accuracy, said Ronald K. Snell, program director of the National Conference of Legislatures. He said achieving that level of accuracy requires states to maintain cash reserves equal to 5 percent of their budgets. But one in five states, including many with large deficits this year, have little or nothing in reserve. On average, Mr. Snell said, states have only about half the reserves they should.
 
Impossible, Some Governors Say
But some governors say it is impossible to maintain large reserves for contingencies. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York defends his plan to borrow $615 million in deficit notes to cover part of this year's $1 billion shortage.
''It would be ludicrous to save $615 million just in case the econcomy suddenly and unexpectedly plummets,'' Governor Cuomo said. ''It would be ludicrous to have that money doing nothing when we don't have enough beds for AIDS patients, when we don't have enough treatment beds for people on drugs, when we don't have enough prison cells for violent felons and when we don't have enough money to rebuild our bridges.
''Especially when the alternative is so reasonable - we can take out a short-term loan for $615 million and pay it back in the next budget.''
The rug was pulled out from under the Northeast in the last three months of 1989, when the states' economies declined much more rapidly than their budget directors had forecast. In Massachusetts and New Hampshire, forecasts have been off by 10 percent.
 
The Crisis in Massachusetts
''Over the last 18 months, tax revenues have fallen precipitously and we still don't know where the bottom is,'' said S. Stephen Rosenfeld, chief secretary to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, which is in the worst fiscal condition of any state. The deficit was $1.1 billion last year. Cuts in spending reduced it to $500 million on a $12.8 billion budget.
Mr. Rosenfeld said that discussions on resolving the deficit have deadlocked, with legislators resisting the Governor's proposals for new taxes. As a result, he said, Massachusetts will probably have to dump the problem on counties and municipalities. They are the last to receive state funds each year.
''Massachusetts is literally paralyzed,'' said State Senator David H. Locke, a Republican. Mr. Rosenfeld did not argue.
The picture is bleak elsewhere, partly because of the drop in revenue from sales taxes, income taxes and corporate taxes.
New York's anticipated $1 billion revenue shortage for the fiscal year 1990, now the largest in the nation, is threatening the state's credit rating. Vermont, which faces a $90 million deficit on a $1.2 billion budget, has closed some of its civil courts until June 30. Maine is trying a new lottery to raise $7 million, offering a tax amnesty to raise $15 million and reducing aid to higher education and local governments.
Connecticut is reportedly exhausting its cash reserves and cutting 2,300 jobs. New Hampshire has already frozen spending and increased many fees charged by the state government to eliminate a $60 million deficit on a $642 million budget. West Virginia proposes to sell its state liquor business to raise $20 million. Arizona is cutting back nearly all state services and proposing to raise $170 million in taxes.
 
When It Really Will Hurt
Belt-tightening in some states will be painful. West Virginia, for example, plans to close a state-run nursing home with about 150 patients that provides about 60 jobs for residents of Hillsboro, a town of 300 people in Pocahontas County, the poorest in the state.
Gov. Gaston Caperton, a Democrat, said eliminating the nursing home was one of some ''very tough'' measures this year to make up for a $40 million shortage in revenue on a $1.7 billion state budget.
Nationally, economic troubles were evident in the fiscal year 1988 and the economy soured in 1989, said Sara L. Johnson, managing economist at DRI/ McGraw Hill, an economic forecasting company. ''The entire Northeast region has made the transition from economic boom to stagation,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''In fact, New England is in recession and mid-Atlantic economies are stalled, in our estimation.''
She said that no single industry nor any group of industries was responsible for the slump, but that the dominant industries in each state were obviously leading the decline.
Governors and budget directors say they cannot control spending because of a recent surge in state and federally mandated programs and court-ordered prison expansions.
 
Mandated Programs' Squeeze
In South Carolina, budget officials said 98 percent of the $7.3 billion budget this year was being spent on mandated programs, leaving little flexibility for adjusting to economic conditions or increasing costs of services.
''Practically everything we spend is mandated by statute,'' said Mike L. Shealy, a spokesman for South Carolina's state budget division. South Carolina, which has $360 million in reserves, had projected a shortage this year, but the boom in construction after Hurricane Hugo improved business tax receipts.
Two weeks ago Standard & Poor's indicated that New York's and Connecticut's excellent ratings were imperiled by rising deficits. New York's revenue forecasts have been ''overly optimistic'' in the past two years and Connecticut is trying to solve its problems by depleting cash reserves and using other resources that will not recur, said Hyman C. Grossman, managing director of Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: FOREST SERVICE ABUSING ROLE, DISSIDENTS SAY

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: SEATTLE, March 3

 BODY:
Saying the Forest Service has abused millions of acres entrusted to it, supervisors and professionals in the service are rebelling against Federal policies that promote logging, mining and road-building in 191 million acres of public forests.
The dispute could also determine how the country manages nearly half its clean water supply, its biggest and oldest trees, its largest wilderness areas, its most bountiful wildlife habitats and resources, which provide the most jobs in many Western communities.
In the rush to sell Federal timber, the agency created by Theodore Roosevelt to manage the vanishing wilderness has lost sight of its original goal, say the supervisors of many national forests and hundreds of lower employees who have joined a dissident group in the service.
 
The Leading Road-Builder
They say the Forest Service has become the No. 1 road-builder, hacking more than 340,000 miles of logging roads in the woods in the last half-century, and that it is now spending more money on cutting down trees than for any other purpose.
''We're managing our resources horribly,'' said Jeff DeBonis, a Eugene, Ore., forester who organized the Association of Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics in an attempt, he says, to change the service's direction. His group claims it has 1,500 service members out of a total of 38,000 employees. 
The protests are not unheeded. At the very top of the Forest Service, officials who were saying a decade ago that boards are more valuable than old trees have been replaced, Current appointees, the dissidents say, who believe century-old stands of trees have a value beyond lumber's value.
F. Dale Robertson, chief of the service since 1987, said in an interview that the internal debate was good for the service. Reflecting a change in its direction and a shift in the public's view of forests toward more concern for the environment, the service's proposed budget for the fiscal year 1991 is ''better-rounded than we've ever had before,'' he said.
President Bush has proposed that $175 million be spent on a tree-planting program to be supervised by the service. But critics say that merely planting new trees while another arm of the service is knocking down centuries-old trees will leave America's woodlands impoverished.
 
Change in Society
''There's a change going on in society, and the Forest Service can't just ignore that,'' Mr. Robertson said. ''We intend to be more environmentally responsible.''
Many top agency officials from around the country applaud the philosophical changes, but they say more should be done to change programs and spending priorities to reflect the good stewardship values of the service.
Its budget is established by the President and Congress, but the process of deciding how to spend the money begins with the philosophy and requests of the 156 forest supervisors.
For example, Tom Kovalicky, supervisor of the 2.2 million-acre Nez Perce National Forest in Idaho, makes a request each year on how much money to spend on his forest. He has complained that his efforts to restore salmon and steelhead runs receive minimal financing, while the timber-cutting program, which he says harms those streams, receives the lion's share of the $14 million Nez Perce budget.
 
'Troubling Times'
''These are troubling times for many of us,'' Mr. Kovalicky and supervisors of national forests in Montana, Idaho and the Dakotas wrote three months ago in an open lettter to Mr. Robertson. ''Many people, internally as well as externally, believe the current emphasis of national forest programs does not reflect the land-stewardship values embodied in our forest plan.''
Citing continuing logging programs in pristine areas and ''sagging'' public support for the service, the supervisors from the northern Rocky Mountain region who signed the letter wrote, ''We have become a dysfunctional Forest Service family.''
Similar letters to Mr. Robertson came from supervisors of national forests throughout the West. He said this ''straight talk'' could help fashion for the agency a new conservationist role, which he said many have been seeking for a long time.
Even with its enormous acreage, $3 billion annual budget and legion of rangers and biologists, the service has long operated in virtual anonymity. But now, driven by a revolt from within and criticism from outside, the agency is going through a major, and very public, transformation.
''There are a lot of good, dedicated people in the Forest Service, but there is also a lot of dead wood left over from 25 years of rape-pillage-and-plunder mentality,'' said Don Kern, a hydrologist with the Flathead National Forest in Montana. ''Unfortunately, many of those people are in key management positions.''
 
Critics in Logging Industry
Some leaders in the logging industry say the revolt in the Forest Service is fueled by environmental zealots.
''They're rabble-rousers,'' said Troy Reinhart, a former service employee who is executive director of Douglas Timber Operators. The group represents Oregon companies that depend on public land for their wood supply.
Mr. Robertson said he would prefer that the dissidents promote change by quietly working within the agency, but he said he is ''officially neutral'' about the group.
Mr. DeBonis, founder of the group, resigned last week as a Federal timber sales planner after 12 years with the service because, he said, he wanted to stop supporting the timber policy and devote more time to the organization.
Mr. DeBonis, who now publishes a quarterly newsletter, Inner Voices, started his campaign early last year, when he wrote a blistering letter to Mr. Robertson.
 
A Letter of Protest
''Our basic problem right now is that we are much too biased towards the resource-extraction industries, particularly the timber industry,'' Mr. DeBonis wrote to the chief. ''We support their narrowly focused, shortsighted agenda.''
He also sent a computer memorandum to other employees reporting on a conference that singled out the Forest Service as being mainly responsible for severe logging of old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest.
After being reprimandeded for using the service's computer, Mr. DeBonis began organizing the dissident group on his own time, he said, by sending fliers to other Forest Service offices.
His criticism that the Forest Service has become too much of an industry ally has been repeated by supervisors of some national forests, pointing to the increased logging on public lands.
For most of the last five years, the share of the service's budget for wildlife and stewardship has been in steady decline, while more than a third has gone to the timber program.
 
Rise in Logging on Public Land
Before World War II, very little logging was done on national forest land. But as the last of the big trees disappeared from private land, attention turned to the reserves, set aside 100 years ago, as a source of the industry's wood supply. In the last three years, a record number of trees have been cut from the national forests, more than 12 billion board feet a year, or triple the number of a generation ago.
In the Pacific Northwest, where almost half of all the logging on national forests is done, the Forest Service has cut the oldest and biggest trees first and replacedthem with new trees.
In the early 1980's, John B. Crowell was the Assistant Secretary of Agriculture in charge of the national forests. Mr. Crowell said one of his main goals was to speed logging of the 3 million to 4 million acres of original forest left in the West. That policy is now under review, Mr. Robertson said.
Since the mid-1980's, the last of the old growth has been cut at a pace of about 70,000 acres a year. Most national forests in the Northwest are now laced with roads and clearcuts. In the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in Washington (named for the service's founder) less than a tenth of the 1.1 million acres of the original forest remains as it was in Mr. Pinchot's time.
''We are trading our forests in on European-style plantations that are really nothing more than economic tree farms,'' Chris Maser wrote in his book, ''Forest Primeval,'' published last year by Sierra Club Books. Mr. Maser is a former research scientist with the Interior Department.
 
A Legacy in the Balance
In the view of Mr. Maser and some top scientists in the Forest Service, the Government is wiping out the biological archives of the old forest, a legacy of several generations of plant life that may be needed as a hedge against disease, global warming and fires.
''Our forest lands should be more than just agricultural lands with a slow-maturing crop,'' said Dr. Jerry Franklin, an ecologist with the Forest Service who is considered the Government's foremost expert on old-growth forests. He advocates keeping much of the remaining ancient forest of the West intact as a storehouse of information for future foresters.
After years as an outside voice, Dr. Franklin's warnings are finding a home in the upper echelons of the Forest Service.
''For the first time as an agency we are recognizing the importance of old growth on a national level,'' said Mr. Robertson, who noted that this new policy was influenced by the work of Dr. Franklin. ''Old-growth forests are an important ecosystem that we are just beginning to understand.''

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: Soviet Union;
Soviet Union Opposition Hits Democracy Circuit for Votes

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 3

 BODY:
At 2 A.M. today, Ilya I. Zaslavsky, political kingpin, was on the phone with his pollster. A last-minute survey of the Oktobr district of Moscow showed the tide running against the Communist establishment and in favor of Mr. Zaslavsky's slate in Sunday's local elections.
''He's smelling victory already,'' smiled the pollster, Aleksei G. Levinson, who urged his client to take aim at a few working-class high-rise apartment buildings for a final wall-poster assault.
Mr. Zaslavsky, a 30-year-old member of the Soviet Parliament, is at the center of a new and increasingly sophisticated network of pro-democracy insurgents from within and outside the Communist Party who believe that they have a real chance on Sunday to wrest control of Moscow and other cities from the party regulars.
More than a million seats are at stake in the electoral sweepstakes that American diplomats have dubbed Slavic Super Sunday, elections to local councils and republic parliaments in Russia, the Ukraine and Byelorussia. 
Hampered by voter confusion, the Communist Party's domination of the electoral laws, and their own inexperience, groups advocating greater democracy are doubtful of winning control of the Slavic heartland as a whole.
But with the help of campaign techniques borrowed from the West, they have mounted their most formidable challenges in Moscow, Leningrad and other big cities. True Democracy? If they succeed, they have audacious plans to turn these urban governments into strongholds of real democracy and free enterprise, and to step up pressure on President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for bolder changes.
''In the districts and cities where we take power, we will register new parties,'' Mr. Zaslavsky explained over tea late the other night, following a day of barnstorming. ''We'll publish newspapers, create free radio stations, support democrats in other districts. We'll begin recall campaigns against conservative deputies to the national Parliament.
'''What we have now is a permanent revolution, and not the kind Lenin or Trotsky had in mind.''
Yuri A. Prokofiev, the Moscow Communist Party chief, conceded in an interview this week that the insurgents stand a fair chance of winning a majority in the 498-member Moscow City Council, and naming one of their own -possibly a radical economist, Gavriil K. Popov, or a political scientist, Sergei B. Stankevich - as the city's chief executive.
''Well, I see no harm in it, and if it happens we will cooperate with them,'' Mr. Prokofiev said, although he regards most of the opposition as political dilettantes who do not really want to take responsibility for the city's cratered streets and empty stores.
The Communists have not yet delivered on their promise to legalize rival parties, but in each of the republics preparing for Sunday's balloting, the opposition has stitched together a campaign coalition to take on the Communist monopoly.
In the Russian Republic, the eclectic umbrella group Democratic Russia includes the anti-Stalinist group Memorial, the Moscow Voters Association, the Association of Social Democrats, and a patchwork of local Popular Fronts and Communist clubs impatient with the mainstream party.
At least half of their candidates are Communist Party members, most of them disgruntled with the party leadership.
 
No Admirers of Gorbachev
The candidates differ on specific planks, but they share a commitment to unfettered, multiparty democracy and more Western-style market economics, and a general sense that Mr. Gorbachev has frittered away his credibility in making compromises.
''Personally, I'm against perestroika and glasnost,'' Mr. Zaslavsky said wryly, dismissing the Gorbachev emphases on economic and politics restructuring and on openness. ''I'm for democracy and freedom of speech.''
Political independents who won seats in the Soviet Parliament last year are now spreading their coattails.
Boris N. Yeltsin, one of the leaders of the opposition faction in the Soviet Parliament, is now campaigning for the Russian Republic's legislature and is trying to take enough like-minded candidates with him to be chosen the President of the republic. Soviet law allows a politician to hold elected positions at any two levels.
Others like Mr. Zaslavsky are focusing on local councils, hoping to create little islands of power.
Mr. Zaslavsky is a deceptively frail-looking man, crippled by a childhood illness and elected to the Soviet Parliament last year as the nominee of the Society for Invalids.
In the Oktobr district of Moscow, a region of about 200,000 voters, one of them Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Mr. Zaslavsky has built an impressive non-Communist political machine.
He has endorsed a slate of about 150 candidates to represent that district on its regional council, the Moscow City Council and the Russian republic's parliament. He has also worked in close league with the Democratic Russia group to help candidates in other districts.
Mr. Zaslavsky has organized seminars for candidates, consulted psychologists on preparing election materials, and enlisted writers with connections to printing presses. He has tapped a nonpartisan civic fund to get around campaign spending limits.
 
Voter Meetings
He often speaks to three voter meetings a day on behalf of his slate, taking questions from the audience for two hours at each stop while the candidate basks in his reflected popularity.
''It's a kind of papal blessing,'' said Mr. Levinson, whose polls give Mr. Zaslavsky a local approval rating that Mr. Gorbachev would envy.
Mr. Zaslavsky's team has used political polling more extensively than any independent political group in the past.
He first commissioned an extensive poll in late December by Mr. Levinson, a sociologist. It provided a detailed picture of voter attitudes that was valuable for orienting candidates.
In precincts where several progressive candidates had been nominated, small opinion surveys were used to identify those with little chance and to persuade them to withdraw.
By all accounts, the toughest battle for independent candidates has been getting the attention of voters dazed by the new profusion of politics.
Most voters on Sunday will be confronted with at least four ballots containing the names of 30 or more candidates in all. The six-week election sprint has allowed little time for individual candidates to distinguish themselves.
''Where there is a clear choice between a party-apparatus candidate and a progressive candidate, it is nine to one the democrat wins,'' Mr. Levinson said. ''So the party strategy has been to hide who is who.''
 
Propaganda Aplenty
Although the election law banned advertising and required that all material be printed by supposedly neutral election commissions, it is clear from the papered walls of any Moscow housing complex that both the party and its challengers have circumvented that rule with abandon.
Supporters of the democracy slate have stuffed mailboxes with lists of candidates - the Soviet equivalent of palm cards - and finagled enough paper to print thousands of wall posters boasting of their independence from the Communist machine.
''We're having a lot of difficulties making copies of the list because practically all typesetting shops are controlled,'' said Vladimir O. Bokser, a campaign coordinator for the Moscow Voters Association. ''You make an agreement with one place where there's a xerox machine, it turns out today there's no paper, tomorrow there's no copying powder, the day after tomorrow the machine breaks down, and on the fourth day, the party secretary comes and stops the whole process.
''The only thing that will work now are these lists. If we manage to spread them, I have no doubts about the outcome of the elections.''

HEADLINE: Wine Equation Puts Some Noses Out of Joint

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Calculate the winter rain and the harvest rain (in millimeters). Add summer heat in the vineyard (in degrees centigrade). Subtract 12.145. And what do you have? A very, very passionate argument over wine.
Prof. Orley Ashenfelter, a Princeton economist, has devised a mathematical formula for predicting the quality of red wine vintages in France. And the guardians of tradition are fuming. 
Robert M. Parker Jr., generally regarded as the most influential wine critic in America, calls Professor Ashenfelter's research ''ludicrous and absurd.''
William Sokolin, a New York wine merchant, said the Bordeaux wine industry's view of the work ranges ''somewhere between violent and hysterical.'' Those reactions are not surprising. No formula could capture the variations in estate-bottled wines from the same vintage. But if widely accepted, Professor Ashenfelter's approach to judging the quality of the red wines of Bordeaux and Burgundy long before they are drinkable could turn the clubby, exclusive world of wine rating on its ear.
 
Alas for the Human Element
And even if it does not, enthusiasts who care more about drinking wine than talking about it could use what seem to be startlingly accurate forecasts to gain an edge at the expense of wine brokers and dealers.
For the moment, though, Professor Ashenfelter is too distracted to ponder the cosmic implications of removing the human element and the romance from vintage rating. That is because his just-completed calculations suggest that the 1989 Bordeaux wines will be the greatest of the century.
Most wines are bottled soon after they are made and are ready to drink shortly thereafter. The small fraction of French red wines destined to be sipped and savored spend 18 to 24 months in oak casks and are then set aside for aging in bottles.
Tastes from the barrel heavily influence the prices of wine futures, sold the year after the harvest. Samples from the newly bottled wines help determine the wholesale price - rarely less than $10 a bottle - at which the wines are first shipped around the world.
Only years later can vintages be ranked by taste with any precision. And as most experts acknowledge, there is many a slip between barrel, bottle and lip.
In 1967 Andre Simon, the prominent wine writer, predicted that the 1965 Bordeaux would be as good as the promising 1961 vintage. Today, few of the weak, acidic 1965's are available. One that is, Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, sells at auction for just one-fifteenth the price of the truly great 1961 wines from the same vineyards.
Mr. Ashenfelter, a 47-year-old specialist in labor economics who is the managing editor of The American Economic Review, is convinced he has found a better way.
It is widely agreed that weather influences wine quality. What few understand, he argues, is that a mere handful of facts about the local weather tell almost all there is to know about a vintage. And using the same techniques employed to forecast, say, the effect of a change in wage rates on employment in the auto industry, he has gone a long way toward proving his audacious theory.
 
It's Laptop vs. Nose
Weather-based vintage prediction is not a new idea. What is new is the notion that laptop computers can outperform the most sophisticated noses and palates.
The critical concept, Professor Ashenfelter acknowledges, came from Bruno Prats, owner of Chateau Cos d'Estournel in the St.-Estephe region of Bordeaux. Mr. Prats charted both the average temperature during the growing season and rainfall during the harvest months to make systematic comparisons between vintages.
Professor Ashenfelter added data for winter rainfall and then rigorously measured their statistical relationships to the most objective measure of quality he could devise: an index of auction prices for about 80 wines after they have matured in the bottle.
According to this ''multivariate regression analysis,'' heavy rains in the winter followed by a hot summer improve wine quality, while rainfall before the harvest damages it. The statistical fit from 1952 through 1980 is remarkably snug for the red wines of Burgundy as well as Bordeaux.
 
Year-to-Year Variations
Michael Broadbent, director of wines at Christie's auction house in London and a leading authority on Bordeaux, points out that the system cannot predict quality differences between estate-bottled wines of the same vintage. And it may yield systematic errors by lumping together wines primarily based on the cabernet sauvignon grape with the minority based on the softer-tasting merlot grape, which matures earlier.
But as Steve Ross, a wine enthusiast who is a professor of finance at the Yale School of Management, points out, the simple statistical model does explain basic year-to-year variations without major slips. ''If you did not tell them a machine did it,'' Mr. Ross said, ''I think it would pass muster with the wise heads in the business.''
Interest in the system has mostly been confined to the small group of wine buffs who are comfortable with econometric techniques. Circulation of Mr. Ashenfelter's semiannual newsletter, ''Liquid Assets'' ($30 for a yearly subscription), numbers about 600 - a tiny fraction of the readership of The Wine Advocate ($30, with a circulation of more than 27,000), which Mr. Parker publishes from his home in Maryland. But that could change if two of the Princeton economist's predictions prove accurate.
For most young Bordeaux vintages, the Ashenfelter forecasts are within hailing distance of the tasters' conventional wisdom. For the 1986 vintage, however, they are poles apart.
 
'Sometimes Exceptional'
Mr. Parker rates the 1986's as ''very good and sometimes exceptional.'' Peter A. Sichel, author of the influential Bordeaux Vintage and Market Report, said the 1986's have ''elegance and classic Bordeaux structure.'' New York stores, brimming with the vintage, are pricing the wines in the same range as the much-praised 1985's.
But according to the Ashenfelter system, below-average growing season temperatures and above-average harvest rainfall doom the 1986 Bordeaux to mediocrity. When the dust settles, he predicts, it will be judged the worst vintage of the 1980's, and no better than the unmemorable 1974's or 1969's.
Perhaps the most dramatic Ashenfelter prediction, the one likely to vault the ratings system into prominence or doom it to obscurity, is for the 1989 vintage.
These wines are barely three months in the cask and have yet to be tasted by critics. By Professor Ashenfelter's calculations, the hottest growing season in memory, combined with a very dry harvest, all but guarantee that the 1989 Bordeaux will be stunningly good. Adjusted for age, he predicts, these wines will eventually sell for a substantial premium over the great 1961 vintage.
For the moment, though, the wine industry's assessment of the champion of vintage rating by the numbers is hardly flattering. To paraphrase James Thurber, they are most definitely not amused by his presumption.

HEADLINE: Message for Nicaragua's Victors: Things Must Get Better, and Fast

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, March 3

 BODY:
With the store shelves largely bare and one-third of the work force without a job, Nicaraguans are serving notice that they expect the newly elected government to bring about rapid improvement or face political consequences.
Ten years of economic decline under the Sandinista Front, compounded by eight years of civil war and five years of an American economic boycott, have reduced living standards here to the same level as in 1940. Perhaps as much as the desire for peace, dissatisfaction with the state of the economy resulted in the stunning victory of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and her 14-party opposition coalition in the presidential election last Sunday.
''We have been drowning,'' said Xiomara Silva, a housewife and mother of five children who voted for Mrs. Chamorro, as she shopped in the sprawling Oriental Market in Managua on Thursday. ''Everything is so expensive and salaries have fallen through the floor. If you eat today, you don't eat tomorrow. But now maybe we will be able to work and know the sight of meat and medicine again.'' 
 
'Everything Will Be Better'
Advisers of the President-elect have contributed to such expectations, all but expropriating the Sandinista election campaign slogan, ''Everything will be better.'' They have promised that ''the first fruits'' of her victory will begin to appear within 100 days of her inauguration, scheduled for April 25, and will face a backlash should they fail to deliver to the satisfaction of voters.
''I don't want Dona Violeta so much as I want a change,'' said Guillermina Medina, a street vendor. ''I want an end to the military draft, jobs, food, less inflation, and if she can give me that, fine. If not, then I will go with someone else.''
Paul S. Reichler, a Washington lawyer who has long been an adviser to the Sandinistas, argues that Daniel Ortega Saavedra's defeat stemmed largely from a punishing ''one-two punch'': 35,000 percent inflation in 1988, followed by a wrenching and unpopular economic austerity program in 1989. Like voters elsewhere, Nicaraguans were thinking more of their pocketbooks than of foreign policy issues when they cast their ballots, diplomats and political analysts here said, Indeed, with many Nicaraguans convinced that Mrs. Chamorro's victory means the war is now effectively over, the economy promises to be the main battlefield on which Nicaraguan politics will be fought in the next six years. The Sandinista Front and Mrs. Chamorro's National Opposition Union, known as UNO, offer sharply different visions of how Nicaraguan society should be organized, and each believes its future success will be guaranteed by the failure of the other's program.
''The Sandinistas know the disastrous state of the economy is how they lost, and they want UNO to lose too,'' said Gilberto Cuadra, president of the Superior Council for Private Enterprise, the country's most influential business group, and an architect of the incoming government's economic program. ''They will do everything so there will not be confidence. It's going to be a mine field.''
Already the Sandinistas have painted Mrs. Chamorro, who has little knowledge of economic matters herself and relies heavily on a small group of academics and businessmen around her, as an elitist who intends to govern for the benefit of the few. They have attempted to stake out a position for themselves as guardians of the people's welfare.
The Sandinistas also appear to be encouraging workers to make large wage demands of the newly elected government, both to keep pace with inflation that totaled 1,700 percent last year and as a political weapon. ''We workers will demand salary readjustments, and if they do not respond, we will paralyze production,'' Berenicia Sanders, a Sandinista union leader, told Barricada, the official Sandinista newspaper.
 
New Currency Planned
On these and other questions, UNO's immediate economic strategy seems to focus on circumventing the Sandinistas and their program rather than defying them. The nationalized banks are to be supplemented by new private ''finance houses,'' the state monopoly on foreign trade weakened by granting licenses to qualified private companies, and state enterprises that cannot be unloaded made more efficient by introducing profit-sharing measures and allowing worker and opposition party representation in management councils.
The incoming government also hopes to make a fresh start by introducing a new currency, which will be freely convertible and will circulate at a value of one to the dollar. Existing cordobas, which now trade at 72,000 to the dollar, will continue to serve as legal tender, at least for a few months.
But in a country whose livelihood has depended on agricultural products like coffee, cotton, beef, rice and beans, it is not surprising that the strongest blows struck have been over the issue of ownership of land. In a statement on Thursday, the UNO coalition dismissed as ''lies and coarse distortions'' Sandinista accusations that Mrs. Chamorro intends to dismantle peasant cooperatives and strip farm families of holdings given them for cultivation after the fall of the Samoza dictatorship in July 1979.
The ability of the incoming government to win over peasant producers will depend to a large extent on its ability to finance the next planting cycle, which begins in May and continues through July. The Sandinistas were unable to do so last year and that failure led to a burst of inflation and strained food supplies just before the campaign got under way.
 
Foreign Aid Essential
With the country virtually bankrupt, a large and quick infusion of foreign aid is essential to the new government's recovery plan. ''We are going to be waiting for the international community to act in an especially generous manner, recognizing this is a prostrate economy, destroyed by 10 years of conflict and the bad management of the Sandinista Front,'' said Francisco Mayorga, the President-elect's chief economic adviser.
''They need external funds, and fast,'' the representative of an international agency here agreed. ''If not, the new government will not be able to do anything, things will collapse, and Washington will lose all credibility.''
On Monday, Mr. Mayorga will travel to Washington to meet with Bush Administration officials and representatives of international bodies like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Inter-American Development Bank. His immediate goal is to obtain at least $300 million from the United States, a large part of which will be destined for a ''social emergency fund'' to supply credit to small enterprises and to create jobs.
In the longer term, however, Nicaragua will need much more to restore its economy to health. The preliminary economic plan Mr. Mayorga will present to potential aid donors calls for an additional $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion in ''external resources'' over three years, after which he expects the economy to be on its feet once again.
 
'Defense Into Production'
Mrs. Chamorro's advisers hope that money will enable them to solve what looms as one of their thorniest political problems: what to do with nearly 100,000 men in arms, divided between the Sandinista Army and security apparatus and the contra rebel force in Honduras. The new government hopes, in the words of its economic plan, to ''transform defense into production'' by giving demobilized soldiers land and offering them job training programs and loans while organizing active duty units into to construction and reforestation brigades.
''I came down from fighting in the mountains to find my family dying of hunger and my brother in prison,'' said Ricky Mayorga, a 20-year-old demobilized Sandinista Army soldier who was wounded three times and who is now a day laborer. ''The Sandinistas betrayed us, destroyed the economy and persecuted the merchants. Dona Violeta has got to make things better for us, because I do not ever want to have to take up arms again.''
 

 
CARDINAL TO INVITE POPE
 VATICAN CITY, March 3 (AP) -The Roman Catholic primate of Nicaragua said in an interview broadcast today that he would invite Pope John Paul II to visit his country as soon as the political situation settled down.
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the Archbishop of Managua, also told Vatican Radio that Nicaragua's bishops wanted the Sandinistas to turn over all power to the new government. He was referring to the issue of relinquishing power over the security forces.
The Pope made a 10-hour visit to Nicaragua in 1983, during which Sandinista supporters disrupting his Mass by shouting political slogans.

HEADLINE: NICARAGUA EXPERT TURNS THE TABLES

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, March 3

 BODY:
When Francisco Mayorga Balladares boarded a plane for the United States on Friday to represent Nicaragua's government-elect in vital economic talks, he was well prepared. For make the trip.
''The Sandinistas will feel they're winning all the way to the end, and the polls will never tell the truth,'' the soft-spoken economist said weeks ago, predicting the opposition's victory over the Sandinistas in national elections on Feb. 25. ''When they discover they have lost, it will be too late.'' 
The election result stunned Sandinista leaders and embarrassed many international pollsters. But Mr. Mayorga, the chief economic adviser to President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, never wavered in his analysis. The same quiet calculation and self-confidence will now be brought to the Herculean labor of salvaging Nicaragua's economy.
Amid the turmoil and bloodshed of his country's decade-long political conflict, Mr. Mayorga has been a bystander, sidelined by his intellectual disagreement with Sandinista policy and his moral aversion to the violent alternative posed by the American-backed contra rebels.
 
A Consistent Counterpoint
But from his post as a professor at the Central American Institute for Business Administration, the 39-year-old economist has offered a consistent counterpoint to official descriptions of Nicaragua's economic crisis. His analyses of the country's problems have been a crucial resource for the opposition over years of political isolation.
''In this kind of environment, his work has been essential,'' said a diplomat who has lived in Managua throughout the years of economic decline. ''We depend on it, the opposition depends on it - the Government probably depends on it, too.''
Born in Leon, a city 45 miles northwest of Managua, Mr. Mayorga attended college in Nicaragua before leaving for graduate school at Yale University, where he studied economics and began his doctoral dissertation. He returned to Nicaragua to work in the central bank, but was forced to leave the country in 1977 after a conflict with the dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle.
Mr. Mayorga offered his services to the Sandinista National Liberation Front, then fighting Mr. Somoza. He became associated with the hard-line faction led by Tomas Borge Martinez, and served as his representative in discussions on shaping a post-revolutionary economy.
 
Falling Out With Sandinistas
But as an advocate of free-market policies, he quickly fell out with the Sandinista leaders after they reached power in July 1979. ''It took about 30 days,'' he said, describing his disillusionment. ''I think we were being used, because they had never changed their commitment to Marxism-Leninism.''
In what he described as a ''strategic retreat,'' Mr. Mayorga stayed on as a director of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration. In 1984 he went to Yale to finish his doctorate.
When he returned two years later, he says, he committed himself to ''creating a space in terms of criticizing economic policy and the system.'' His wife and two children remained behind in Miami, and he took up residence in a spartan apartment here.
In subsequent years, most economic information was kept secret by the Government. After two Nicaraguan economists were imprisoned for possession of basic statistical data, Mr. Mayorga began relying on projections from old statistics, along with information on prices and exchange rates gathered at markets and from black marketeers.
His information sufficed, Mr. Mayorga said, for shaping a detailed recovery plan. It is with this plan, and broad input from businessmen and political leaders, that he now hopes to overcome the structural ills of a shattered economy.
 
Months of Anticipation
After a regional agreement last year set Nicaragua's electoral process in motion, Mr. Mayorga said, he knew he would have the chance to put his plan into action.
Several weeks before the election last Sunday, Mr. Mayorga represented the opposition coalition in a campaign debate that was watched throughout the country.
Attacking Mr. Mayorga's plans as unrealistic, the Sandinista representative, Edmundo Jarquin Calderon, argued that the Government had done everything in its power to reverse the economic slide. He said the opposition was irresponsible in suggesting that it could accomplish anything more.
Where, he asked, did Mr. Mayorga expect to find the magic wand that would allow him to change things overnight?
''Every Nicaraguan has a magic wand,'' Mr. Mayorga replied without hesitation. ''It is called a vote.''
 
JAPAN PLEDGES SUPPORT
 PALM SPRINGS, Calif., March 3 (Special to The New York Times) -Ending a meeting here with President Bush, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan said today that he intended ''to promptly implement concrete measures in support of the democratic Government in Nicaragua.'' He said those steps would include ''economic assistance for the reconstruction of the region as the peace process in Central America progresses.'' He gave no details.

HEADLINE: The Talk of Belgrade;
White City More Gray And Sullen

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Feb. 28

 BODY:
The White City, as this ancient urban center has been named for most of its existence, looks a bit grayer to visitors returning after a few years, a result, residents say, of neglect and a decade of economic crisis.
There is also a measure of grimness and suspicion in the Beogradjani, as they call themselves. ''There are no jokes anymore,'' said Zlatko Sinobad, a retired Ambassador who used to tell the latest ones.
Mr. Sinobad, who spent his last working years as head of the Yugoslav Radio Corporation, said: ''Nowadays, acquaintances you meet on the street and talk to are not likely to tell you what they really think. But since I am retired, I am free to speak my mind. So I say what I think about someone and they throw up their arms, smile and say, 'That is what I think, too.' '' 
The ''someone'' many people fear and many like in this double capital - the seat of the Yugoslav federal Government as well as of the republic of Serbia - is Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia. In the last two years Mr. Milosevic has made his wrath known about suspected opponents by having them dismissed.
 
Enterprising Purges
 This week, the newspaper Borba disclosed that three victims of Mr. Milosevic were now engaged in private enterprise. Zivorad Kovacevic, who was Ambassador to the United States until last summer, has opened an international trading company here. Dragisa Pavlovic, former head of the Belgrade Communist Party organization, heads a car rental agency. Spiro Galovic, another longtime party official, has joined a law firm representing foreign companies.
Occasionally, the ebullience of the people of Belgrade bursts through the pessimism, which is fed by economic uncertainty and what appears to be a series of intractable stalemates in the politics of Yugoslavia.
It is displayed in their love of fountains. There are five fountains within a four-block area of the city center and there is now a popular demand to restore a sixth, which once stood in the middle of Terazije, the most frequented street of Belgrade. It was torn down in 1947 under the Government of Marshal Josip Broz Tito to make way for a military parade. Now a search is on for pieces of the fountain. One piece was found here and the large centerpiece was traced to the villa of the late Gen. Ivan Krajacic, a Croatian Communist.
 
Parliament's Fence
 A similar hunt is on for the handsome wrought-iron fence that once surrounded the federal Parliament and was taken down years ago by the Communist authorities to convey the idea that the legislature was open to the people it purported to represent.
The search for the fence began after irate Serbian demonstrators stormed the Parliament building last year. One section was found in a Belgrade junkyard and another in a city in Macedonia, the southern republic.
There is a streak of practicality in the people here. Printing of new currency to cope with runaway inflation last year caused the abolition of dinar coins, including the 5-dinar coin used for parking meters. The meters stand unused and municipal employees circulate along the streets to collect the parking fees. Citizens toss the unusable coins into the fountains.
 
Sense of Zaniness
 A sense of zaniness also seems to pervade Belgrade. There was a young man in tennis shoes standing on the edge of the old marble fountain in front of the Moskva Hotel on Tuesday afternoon, shouting in Romanian that there had been a nuclear explosion in Romania four years ago. A small crowd gathered until a young man yelled, ''Speak Serbian, so that the whole world will understand you.''
Sometimes the zaniness comes out at the most unexpected moments. Last December, after years of reconstruction, the National Theater reopened with a gala opera to which the high and mighty were invited. In the middle of the performance, the heavy front curtain came crashing down, not easily to be raised, causing some of the singers to protest that the show could not go on. It did.
This city of 1.5 million prides itself on its clean thoroughfares. Around midnight, municipal crews swarm out to wash down the streets and the broad downtown sidewalks with high-pressure hoses attached to fire plugs and, in the outlying districts, from tank trucks.
Although public transporation by bus and street car is swift and frequent, this remains a city of walkers whose numbers peak about 7 P.M., during the traditional Mediterranean hour of strollers known here as korso.
Mud, rain puddles, the huge cobblestones of the older streets - not even wet cement stops Belgrade walkers on their rounds. There is a patch of recently cemented sidewalk on the north side of Knez Mihajlova Boulevard that bears the deep imprints of at least 30 shoes, ranging in size from those of a child to about size 13.

HEADLINE: Japan Promises to Ease Trade Tensions

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PALM SPRINGS, Calif., March 3

 BODY:
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan and President Bush ended two days of talks today, and Mr. Kaifu said he had pledged to take serious action to ease trade tensions between the two countries. As part of that effort, Mr. Kaifu said he would try to improve the quality of life in Japan.
That approach would mean that Japan's economic growth would be based more on domestic demand for better health care, housing and other services, as well as for consumer goods, and less on exports. That would lower Japan's trade surplus with the United States and other nations. 
At a joint news conference late this afternoon, Mr. Bush said he was pleased with the talks. He said he hoped Japan and the United States could broaden the areas in which they cooperate internationally.
 
Seeking Freer Competition
But such a partnership, he said, would depend on Japan's opening its markets to allow American companies to compete more freely. That would presumably increase American exports and cut the nation's trade deficit.
''Make no mistake about it, I want to see the deficit come down,'' Mr. Bush said, noting that the United States trade deficit with Japan last year was $49 billion.
The President also said he was ''very aware of the mood and concern in this country about the continuing impediments to further growth of our trade relationship.''
Answering journalists' questions after Mr. Kaifu left, the President said, ''The Japanese side knows how important it is to move forward.''
At a briefing later in the day, Mitoji Yabunaka, a senior official at the Foreign Ministry, said Mr. Kaifu was returning ''with a sense of urgency.'' Asked how this would translate into action, he said, ''We have to wait and see what the developments will be in Tokyo. You will see them.'' No Details Disclosed Mr. Kaifu and his team did not disclose the details of any specific programs to make such changes. Mr. Bush also provided few details about what changes might be made.
In previous meetings, other Japanese officials have promised to try to make similar fundamental changes in their society. Those promises have been largely unfulfilled.
At one point during the talks, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d told Mr. Kaifu, ''A political decision from the very top is necessary'' to achieve breakthroughs in the trade talks, Mr. Yabunaka said. Mr. Kaifu did not respond to that comment. the Japanese official said.
Mr. Kaifu said at the news conference, ''I am determined to firmly tackle structural reforms of Japan as one of the top priorities of my new Cabinet, with a view to improving the quality of Japanese life, with further stress on the consumer-oriented economy.''
 
Leaves for Tokyo
Mr. Kaifu's approach will enable him to tell the Japanese that he is not bowing to American pressure but acting instead for the greater good of his nation's 120 million people. He left for Tokyo immediately after the news conference. On Monday he will answer questions in Parliament about his visit.
Mr. Bush, in turn, will be able to tell legislators who have asked him to put pressure on the Japanese that Mr. Kaifu has acknowledged the broad-based trade problems caused by the structure of Japanese society.
''We feel very good about the commitment we received today,'' the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, told reporters at a briefing after Mr. Kaifu left.
That optimism may enable the President to buy some time against legislatively imposed deadlines under the 1988 Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act that could require the President to retaliate against Japan with sanctions.
Asked if he might be able to avoid sanctions, Mr. Bush responded: ''I hope so, but I don't know.'' He added, ''I will do from the executive branch side what I can.''
Before the meeting, at a country club in Rancho Mirage, near Palm Springs, both sides made clear that the two leaders sought a broad understanding rather than a negotiation of specific issues.
 
High Savings Rate in Japan
The United States has complained that Japan is moving too slowly in changing its high savings and investment rates, which reduce the money available for purchasing goods and services from other countries. The United States has also complained that Japan's business practices are exclusionary, that consumer prices are too high and that distribution of consumer goods is inefficient.
Such complaints about what the United States calls structural impediments to trade have been the subject of talks between the two nations since July. Last week, after the structural talks reached an impasse in Tokyo, Mr. Bush invited Mr. Kaifu to Palm Springs.
In agreeing to the talks, Japan added its complaints about American society to the agenda. Those complaints include criticism that the savings rate is too low; that corporations focus on short-term profits rather than long-term competitiveness; that too little is spent on research, and that development and workers are not adequately trained.
At the news conference today, Mr. Bush struck a conciliatory tone on those issues.
''Let's face it, these talks are a two-way street.'' the President said. ''We Americans must increase our savings, reduce our budget deficit, provide more incentive for our investors, strengthen our educational system, focus on producing goods of the highest quality.'' He also mentioned that Mr. Kaifu supported President Bush's call for a lower tax rate on capital gains.
Thus, the President was able to find support from Mr. Kaifu for a number of proposals that fit neatly into his political agenda.
In a briefing for Japanese journalists on Friday night, Mr. Kaifu said he had addressed some American complaints about Japanese society. A translation of a transcript of that briefing was provided by a Japanese official.
 
Address to Parliament Cited
Mr. Kaifu said land in Japan must be used more efficiently, for example, and he called Mr. Bush's attention to remarks he made in Parliament just before flying to the United States.
In a major policy address, Mr. Kaifu told Parliament, ''Soaring land prices undermine the sense of social fairness and rob people of their dream of home ownership.''
He also told Mr. Bush that he would work to lower Japanese consumer prices by strengthening antitrust enforcement, streamlining distribution and promoting imports.
Japanese and American negotiators have been holding separate talks on specific trade disputes. Last week, both sides said they were pleased with their progress on changing the rules by which the Japanese Government buys supercomputers. No progress was reported on the American complaints that the Japanese markets for wood products and satellites were closed to American companies.
This was the second meeting between Mr. Kaifu, 59 years old, and Mr. Bush, who is 65. Mr. Kaifu came to Washington in September, shortly after being named Prime Minister. This weekend's meeting came two weeks after Mr. Kaifu led his Liberal Democratic Party to an election victory.
To underscore the gravity of the trade dispute, Mr. Bush brought with him four members of his Cabinet -Mr. Baker; Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady; Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, and the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills.
Mr. Kaifu brought Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, who met Mr. Baker.

HEADLINE: Hotel Workers in Hawaii Strike

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HONOLULU, March 3

 BODY:
About 7,500 hotel workers went on strike today after contract negotiations collapsed, threatening to disrupt the state's $6-billion-a-year tourism industry.
The strike, by Local 5 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, affected 11 hotels that account for one of every five hotel rooms in Hawaii and two of every five in Waikiki, the state's main tourist destination.
The hotels remained open using management employees. The affected hotels in Waikiki, on the island of Oahu, were Hilton Hawaiian Village, 2,523 rooms; Sheraton Waikiki, 1,900 rooms; Hyatt Regency Waikiki, 1,230 rooms; Princess Kalulani, 1,150 rooms; Ilikai Hotel, 800 rooms; Sheraton Moana Surfrider, 793 rooms; Royal Hawaiian Hotel, 526 rooms; and the Kahala Hilton, 369 rooms. 
Those affected on the other islands were the Kona Hilton on Hawaii Island, 445 rooms; Sheraton Kauai, 456 rooms; and Sheraton Maui, 495 rooms.
 
Disagreement on Proposals
Union and management leaders could not agree even on what the hotels' last contract offer contained.
Bill Crawford, the executive director of the Council of Hawaii Hotels, said the union rejected a four-year deal that called for annual wage increases of 5 percent plus increases in benefits that made the total increase of 7 percent a year.
Rod Rodriguez, a spokesman for the union, said the union calculated the management proposal to be around 4 percent, which he said was lower than the 5 percent package offered Friday.
''Management seems to be going backwards,'' he said. ''The offer is meager and measly and shows they could really care less about the hotel workers.''
Mr. Crawford called the union's calculations ''voodoo economics.'' He urged hotel workers to return to work. ''The union is making a grave mistake,'' he said. ''Nobody likes a strike, but the hotels had to stand firm against totally unrealistic union demands that ultimately could hurt the employees themselves.''
Guests were mixed in their views on whether the strike was disrupting hotel service.
''It's unfortunate, considering what I'm paying for a room,'' said Jennie Peters of Huntington Hills, Mich. ''We're not thinking of leaving, though.''
Gary Flintoff, a member of Painters Local 64 in Tacoma, Wash., said: ''I'm a union man, and I don't feel comfortable staying here. We've thought about going to another hotel.''

HEADLINE: Annenberg Gift a Point of Light, Bush Says

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif., March 3

 BODY:
President Bush, describinghimself as a longtime supporter of the United Negro College Fund, used his best-known term for private charity in praising the gift of $50 million by Walter H. Annenberg to the consortium of private black colleges.
''Our Administration has stepped up support for historically black colleges and universities, the endowment concept there,'' the President said, predicting that Mr. Annenberg's generosity would be a challenge ''that will bring on well-deserved support from others.'' 
''It's most generous, and one of the most brilliant thousand points of light I can think of,'' he said.
Mr. Annenberg, the 82-year-old former United States Ambassador to Britain and builder of a sprawling publishing empire, said today he hoped the donation would raise the educational aspirations of young black people.
In remarks to The Los Angeles Times, which, along with The New York Times, reported the plan in today's editions, Mr. Annenberg said, ''Unless young blacks are brought into the mainstream of economic life, they will continue to be on the curbstone. The key to this problem is education.'' ''Black colleges have got to be supported,'' Mr. Annenberg continued. ''The entire country has to get behind this. Foundations, corporations and private citizens. We can't just leave this for the Government to do.''
Mr. Annenberg was expected to announce the gift Sunday at his estate here, where President and Mrs. Bush are weekend guests. Mr. Bush is the honorary chairman of a three-year capital drive by the consortium.
The gift by Mr. Annenberg is the largest in the consortium's history and one of the largest made to higher education in this country.
The United Negro College Fund raised $45.8 million last year for distribution to its member institutions.

HEADLINE: ART VIEW;
Why Curators Are Turning to the Art of the Deal

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BRENSON

 BODY:
''It's impossible to be all things to all people,'' said Eric S. McCready, speaking of his 15 years as a museum director, first at the Elvehjem Museum of Art of the University of Wisconsin, then at the Archer M. Huntington Art Gallery of the University of Texas at Austin. ''The demands generally by boards are so complex that very few people are capable or willing to meet them - to be a scholar, a fund raiser, a diplomat, an entertainer, an after-dinner speaker, a budget officer and a personnel officer - and all of that for the glory, for being able to say that you run a museum. It is no longer worth the headache.''
''It's like being let out of jail,'' he said, describing his present job as director of the Charles Cowles Gallery in the SoHo section of Manhattan. 
Like Diane Upright (formerly of Harvard and the Fort Worth Art Museum, now with the Jan Krugier Gallery on 57th Street), Linda Cathcart (formerly of the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston and now of the Linda Cathcart Gallery, in Santa Monica, Calif.), Thomas Schulte (formerly of the Museum of Modern Art, now at the John Weber Gallery in SoHo) and Sean Kelly (formerly of the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, a museum in Wales, now at the Louver Gallery in SoHo), Mr. McCready is one of many museum curators who have become art dealers since 1985, and who feel liberated by the change.
They reflect a sea change in the art world - in the definition of art galleries, in the perception of art dealers, and in the relationship between galleries and museums. The boundaries between galleries and museums have been increasingly blurred, and this has worked almost entirely to the benefit of galleries and to the detriment of museums.
The 80's was not the first decade in which curators became dealers. In 1960, for example, John Weber resigned as associate curator of 20th-century art at the Dayton Art Institute and began working for the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York because he felt that as a dealer he could take more risks and have more of an effect on art. In 1971 he opened his own gallery.
In 1967 Stuart Feld resigned as head of the department of American paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and began working for New York's Hirschl & Adler Gallery, which he now owns. ''At that point,'' Mr. Feld said, ''there were extremely few galleries paying attention to research in general, and having researched as thoroughly as possible many works of art while at the Met, basically I continued to do the same thing here.''
It was only in the 80's, however, that the curatorial trickle into galleries became a stream. What matters is less the numbers - there are probably two or three dozen who have now made the switch - than the sense of release so many of them feel, the ease with which they have been able to move from one world to the other and the scholarly discipline they bring with them to galleries. Both those who may have gone as far as they could in museums and those who left promising curatorial careers speak of museums with the same level of frustration. They are glad to be done with them.
''In the museum world you can never do enough, you can never please everyone,'' said Linda Cathcart, one of the more outspoken and controversial curatorial voices before she was fired as director of the Houston museum in 1987. ''I have absolute freedom now. I don't have to conform to some image of an institution. I don't have to worry about the public. I don't think about whether something can have an education component or not. I could not have cared less how many members were in the museum. Every day I feel incredibly happy and lucky, and I never felt this before. It fits.''
''There is the scholarly side of me that is being satisfied,'' said Jeffrey Hoffeld, who has been associated with Krugier since 1988. He was a curator at the Metropolitan Museum and director of the Neuberger Museum in Purchase, N.Y., before joining the Pace Gallery in 1978. ''The whole of me is being satisfied. And when I sit down at the end of every month to pay my bills, unlike in the museum world, I don't feel despair.''
 
Dealers Have Money, Curators Don't
 In the boom years of the 80's - when museums combed social registers for possible contributors and dealers were overheard to say about a show, ''It's like printing money'' - money, and its effect on quality and power, became a powerful issue. Major dealers have money; major curators, unless they inherit it, don't.
Dealers in a top New York gallery can start with a salary of around $60,000 to $75,000 a year and move fairly rapidly to $150,000 and $200,000. Gallery owners working with highly productive blue-chip artists or with a modern master's estate, can make more than $1 million.
According to the Association of Art Museum Directors, the average salary for curatorial assistants in the Mid-Atlantic region, which includes New York and Washington, is $20,000, for associate curators $32,000, and for chief curators $47,000; the average salary for museum directors is $84,500, with the top being $167,500. During the last two years, around 40 directorships of the 150 American art museums belonging to the association have been filled. Fourteen are now open.
''One of the big problems in American museums is that curators are just not paid a decent salary,'' said Thomas Schulte, who studied art history in Dusseldorf and West Berlin. In West Germany, he said, someone in a position equivalent to a senior curator at the Modern ''would be paid the same salary as senior professors at the university, with the same status and benefits. At the Modern, you start with $19,000 to $22,000 and gradually move up to $30,000 after a while. Even if you become a senior curator, money is a real problem.''
For many former curators and even for many curators who remain committed to their profession, museums have become places in which it is hard to breathe. ''Museums are cannibalizing,'' said Michael Botwinick, who was the director of the Brooklyn Museum and then of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington before working with Old Master paintings at the Knoedler Gallery in New York. He now handles business investments in the art field for the Pritzker family of financiers in Chicago.
''Because museums survive by living off the flesh of their key staff members, they cannibalize themselves. An extraordinary number of museums are struggling economically, and their staffs are told to hang on. They give and they give and they give and they give and they give, and some people have to run out of gas.''
 
A Dealer Who Abandoned the Market
 Through the observations of former curators, and those of the handful of curators who used to be dealers, it is possible to underline the distinctions between museums and galleries and to appreciate the role that only museums can fill.
''Everything I love about working in a museum is not possible working in the market,'' said Marion True, the curator of antiquities at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., who previously sold ancient and Old Master art in New York. ''You cannot spend too much time on any one object; the objective is to sell it or place it in the right institution. You cannot spend months doing background research for publications. There is a transience, an impermanence. You cannot see the collection grow or study and reflect over it over a long period of time.''
But Ms. True is generous in acknowledging how a new breed of dealer, such as Michael Ward, of the Michael Ward Gallery on Manhattan's Upper East Side, has affected her field. ''Because a number of very well educated people have chosen to become dealers,'' she says, ''there is now a class of dealer in antiquities that can do the kind of scholarly exhibition museums can do, and I say, bravo!''
 
A Golden Age For Dealers
 While this is a troubled moment for curators, it may be the golden age of art dealers. In New York alone there are several hundred of them, and for every gallery that fails two or three seem to spring up to replace it. Some SoHo spaces, like those of the Salvatore Ala, Bess Cutler, Louver and Vrej Baghoomian Galleries, are as large as small museums. And a number of the best galleries periodically mount loan exhibitions of near museum quality.
''We borrow from museums and private collectors who not long ago would not have lent to galleries,'' said Diane Upright of Krugier. ''They lend because of the quality of the exhibition and the quality of the catalogue. Like other galleries, we commission major scholars; we treat catalogues as major publications.''
What is new is that galleries are now actually organizing or presenting museum shows. In 1986 the Pace Gallery organized an exhibition of Picasso's sketchbooks that traveled to American and European museums. In 1988 a Forrest Bess exhibition organized by New York's Hirschl & Adler Modern Gallery traveled to museums in Chicago and Cologne.
An exhibition of Lucian Freud drawings organized by the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford stopped off last year in New York at the Brooke Alexander Gallery. ''Dancers on a Plane: Cage. Cunningham. Johns,'' organized by the Anthony d'Offay Gallery in London, is at the Tate Gallery's branch in Liverpool through March 25.
In short, at a time when stretch limos are bumper to bumper outside hot galleries and the competition among top dealers has never been more heated - ''Each time you want something, you are in a cockfight,'' Mr. Hoffeld said - dealers have never seemed more independent and free. There seem to be no limits to what they can do. Even with the many stories of dealers not paying their artists or maneuvering behind the scenes to cut other dealers out of the action, respect for the best of them has never been greater.
No longer are curators who become dealers automatically looked down upon by scholars and curators. ''Something I like about America is that a lot of galleries and especially certain dealers are respected very, very well by museums, and working together is a very different thing than in Europe,'' Mr. Schulte said. ''If in America you are an art dealer there is not as much of a stigma as there is in West Germany. There you have this very old traditional image. Art historians and art professors have the same social value as doctors, but dealers are dealers, and they are merchants in a certain way, and in a way you cannot trust them. Here it is very different.''
 
They Went to School Together
 Said the dealer Michael Ward, who received a doctorate in medieval art from New York University's Institute of Fine Arts, ''There is another generation of curators, and they know we have all been together in graduate school, and many of us were as good students as they were, and they could be in our shoes and we could in theirs.''
So it is not surprising that art galleries are now capable of inspiring a sense of possibility and power in dealers that museums have traditionally inspired in curators.
''Dealers are working with artists on a continuing basis to shape the culture in which we live,'' said Sean Kelly of the Louver Gallery, who left Wales to become the director of art for the Bath International Festival. ''In the public sector, you cannot do it the same way. For instance, I would do a show on Jannis Kounellis, or Rebecca Horn, or Anne and Patrick Poirier, and because I was working in the public sector, it was a one-shot deal, and I would lose contact with the artists. Now I can have an ongoing relationship with the artists. As I grow, that growth is contiguous with their growth as artists.''
 
The Trouble With Museums
 While galleries now seem filled with promise, museums have never seemed less sure of what they are and what they need to do. There are fewer distinct curatorial voices than ever. Many museums seem to be spending more and more time thinking about every aspect of their operation - including bookstores, garages and restaurants - except the curator's condition.
Compared to galleries, which thrive on the speed and glamour of today's art world, museums are dinosaurs. ''A museum's every decision has to go through boards,'' Mr. Weber said. While a dealer can put together an exhibition in months, or even weeks, curators need years. Museums are run by boards of trustees who may be chosen more often for their social standing and financial resources than for their knowledge of art.
Many curators feel a sense of dissatisfaction and betrayal that is overwhelming. ''The reason most of us went into art history,'' Mr. McCready said, ''is because we love art, and in the museums that fades further and further away as you have to deal with administrative stuff. In museums you are often tied up in meetings all day and you do not even see art.''
What has happened to create a situation in which galleries seem so liberated and museums so shackled? The Overlapping of Church and State Part of the story is the relationship between art and money, which for dealers is natural. ''In many dealers,'' Mr. Hoffeld said, ''it is hard to separate the salivating quality related to love of the object and the question of what will I do with this, who will I sell it to and how much money will I make.''
The best dealers know not only how to make money but also how to recognize, promote and nurture artists. The relationship between scholarship and commerce can build public confidence in dealers and their work and, up to a point, is not a conflict.
In museums, the relationship between art and money can be thorny. The success of a museum depends upon its ability to keep art and money separate.
But as museums are more and more involved with acquiring the kind of money that will pay for art and keep themselves going, this separation becomes harder and harder to maintain. While museums court collectors -some of whom are very eager to have artists they collect shown - and woo corporate V.I.P.s for their boards, curators are expected to insure that in their evaluation of art and in the public's perception of art within their museum, money will play no role.
Yet almost everything curators do has financial implications. Every exhibition increases the value of the art in it. In addition, curators are expected to advise collectors in the hope that they will buy art and one day give it to the museums. The Metropolitan in New York and the National Gallery of Art in Washington now regularly mount exhibitions of private collections, like those of the Manoogian Collection and the Jacques and Natasha Gelman Collection (which remains at the Met until April 1).
The conflicts curators live with are not easy. ''I used to think being a curator was like being a village priest,'' said Mark Rosenthal, formerly a curator at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and now a curator at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. ''That's fine, except that you are constantly surrounded by lavish displays of money.''
For Ms. True of the Getty, curators are still thought of as a ''luxury profession.'' ''Museums tend to think curators are offered a chance to work with beautiful objects and travel and have this aura, and for that reason they don't have to be offered a great salary,'' she said. ''A lot of curators go on and take it and enjoy the luxury life in superficial ways, jetting around, having great fun at parties around a big auction, but there is suffering on the other end; there is a real contrast with the life they live. Ultimately there is a temptation to leave the scholarly side and think, 'I'm going to go where the money is.' ''
 
However Scholarly, Galleries Are for Selling
 However much the lines between them are blurred, galleries will never replace museums. They can never be driven by the same commitment to disinterested scholarship and public responsibility. However informative gallery catalogues may be, they are intended to sell art. A gallery cannot have the kind of independence that is imperative for a museum.
Patterson Sims worked as a dealer in the O.K. Harris Gallery from 1969 to 1976. He was a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art from 1976 to 1987. He is now associate director and chief curator at the Seattle Art Museum. He does not want to be a dealer again.
''I don't want to be in that atmosphere again where every work of art has an insurance value and a very hot value,'' Mr. Sims said. ''I like Joel Shapiro, and if this Shapiro is 1969 and it is bronze, then it is $79,000. I just don't want the price tag to always be central to my relationship to works of art. I'd like my relationships with art to be undiluted by whether someone is going to buy it.''
Mr. Rosenthal said: ''It's not as if a museum is a pure world any longer. If a museum wants to acquire art, it has to get money and convince people to give things. The beauty is when the museum acquires it, it loses the qualities it might exude as to what it is worth. You walk through the Museum of Modern Art and you don't wonder what the 'Demoiselles d'Avignon' would get at auction. You are thinking about it as art and art history.''
Just as important, a dealer's relationship with art is usually ephemeral. ''In a museum you have a long-term relationship with objects; in a gallery it is very short term,'' Mr. Sims said. ''They come and go. They flee before you. In a museum you know that you can see these objects over decades. You have the opportunity for a cultural continuity that is simply not offered in galleries.''
For Mr. Kelly, working in a gallery means that dealer and artist can grow together. For Mr. Sims, the emphasis is different: working in a museum means that ''the work and you grow together.''
A curator can be both uncompromising in placing art in the context of its time and imaginative in considering what enables art to endure or collapse outside its time, and no gallery can do that.

HEADLINE: In Hollywood, Black Is In

BYLINE: By JAMES GREENBERG: James Greenberg is the senior editor of American Film magazine.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
When Melvin Van Peebles first came to Hollywood 34 years ago to break into movies, he was offered work as an elevator operator. Last month he was honored at the Sundance United States Film Festival as a pioneering black film maker. When Wendell Harris Jr. first came to Hollywood with hopes of working as an actor in 1976, he couldn't get past ''the secretary to the secretary'' to see an agent. Earlier this year, his first feature, ''Chameleon Street,'' won the grand jury prize at the Sundance Festival.
Would the same thing happen in 1990 to a black film maker who came knocking on Hollywood's door? Not likely, for a number of reasons, most of them economic. Black film makers are being welcomed into the film industry as never before. Just about every studio in town has a project in development with a black director . . . or wants to.
Hollywood has long recognized the potency of the black film-going audience, and legend has it that it was that audience that rescued the industry from a bleak period in the early 70's with the success of a series of black exploitation pictures. The crucial difference now is that industry marketing mavens long resistant to the idea are beginning to recognize that a white audience will spend money to see black movies. 
It's not a realization that happened overnight, and the unprecedented success of Eddie Murphy and more recently the trend-setting popularity of Arsenio Hall have certainly been factors. But more directly responsible was Spike Lee's left field hit ''She's Gotta Have It'' in 1986, which opened the eyes of the industry to the potential of black films. Following ''She's Gotta Have It,'' Robert Townsend humorously exposed the stereotyping of blacks in the film industry in his satire ''Hollywood Shuffle.'' Keenen Ivory Wayans, who co-wrote ''Hollywood Shuffle'' and made his own contribution with ''I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,'' a parody of B action movies, can't deny or exaggerate the changes or how they came about. '' 'She's Gotta Have It' and 'Hollywood Shuffle' were made under extreme terms,'' says Mr. Wayans. ''They were films that were never meant to get made. Movies are not supposed to be made on credit cards and Government grants and loans from your grandmother'' says the soft-spoken Mr. Wayans, sitting in his production company office beside a poster for ''Cooley High,'' a favorite film from his youth.
But they did, and a movement of diverse film makers with varied goals was under way as barriers started falling. Each new film established a precedent and broadened the range of acceptable styles and subject matter. Mr. Lee upped the ante with his insistence on making serious and provocative entertainment; and with the success last summer of ''Do the Right Thing,'' he challenged the status quo of what a black film could say and get away with. ''Hollywood doesn't care what kind of films they are,'' says Mr. Lee, ''as long as they make money.''
 
Enter the Hudlin Brothers
 Reginald and Warrington Hudlin grew up in East St. Louis, Ill., a place they call ''the blackest city in America.'' Since graduating from Yale in 1974, Warrington has been paying his dues as an independent film maker. Last year, Reggie was approached by New Line Cinema. He sent them two scripts, and they decided to produce ''House Party,'' based on a 20-minute short Reginald had made as his senior thesis at Harvard. Screened before a white audience for the first time at Sundance, ''House Party,'' an all-American story of teen-age turmoil told through the black idiom of rap music and hip-hop culture, won the film makers' trophy as well as an award for cinematography.
The enthusiastic reception for ''House Party'' in Sundance demonstrated that a film can have crossover appeal without sacrificing its cultural authenticity. After the festival, the Hudlins went to Los Angeles, where, for two weeks, they were the target of intense courting by the Hollywood establishment, which smelled a hit. ''House Party'' opens nationally on Friday.
''This is the best time in history to be a black film maker'' says Reginald Hudlin, relishing the possibility. ''Spike has created a whole new recognition of the commercial viability of an audience that wasn't being served before. The studio said, 'Hmm, black film makers. That's a good idea.' ''
Thomas Pollock, chairman of M.C.A.'s motion picture group, the company that produced ''Do the Right Thing,'' says he doesn't think that way. ''It was a business decision. We believed in Spike as a film maker. It wasn't about black. We believed in the subject matter directed by him. I don't want to take credit for breaking ground for black film makers. It may be true, but all that really proves is Spike is a great film maker.''
 
Executives Say They're Color-Blind
 Indeed, most of the executives interviewed for this story insisted that Hollywood was color-blind. But since it is so overwhelmingly a white community, the films Hollywood turns out are inevitably products of a white imagination. The black population makes up 13 percent of the moviegoing public, but 30 percent are frequent moviegoers (as opposed to 24 percent of the white population). Still, only a handful of the more than 400 films produced by Hollywood last year were made by black film makers or dealt with black themes.
Barry Reardon, president of distribution for Warner Brothers, admits that it is slightly more difficult to market a film with a black theme, but he is quick to note that with the success of such films as ''The Color Purple,'' ''There are no minuses [in making black films]. Any time a genre becomes popular and makes money, it becomes accepted in the marketplace.''
Furthermore, in a high visibility arena like the entertainment industry, producing black films has an intangible public relations value and makes the studios look as if they are doing the right thing. ''Having a successful black film gives a studio a great social profile,'' says Mr Wayans. ''It makes the executives smell like roses.''
Nonetheless, it took four years, with the help of his mother, for Wendell Harris Jr., a Juilliard graduate, to raise the money from independent investors to make ''Chameleon Street,'' the true story of a black man (played by Mr. Harris) who assumes a variety of professional disguises. Now he is ''reeling'' from the offers pouring in. Aside from several of the major studios and independent companies interested in distributing his film, he has been approached by no fewer than 10 companies about other scripts he might have on the shelf. Representatives from the most powerful agencies in town, including Creative Artists and William Morris, have contacted him about signing with the company. Warner Brothers is even interested in purchasing the remake rights to ''Chameleon Street'' as a vehicle for Arsenio Hall.
''I wasn't born yesterday, and I'm not totally unprepared for the response,'' says Mr. Harris in a modulated actor's voice, measuring his excitement. ''But I thought it would come after the film was released, not before.''
 
How Deep Is the Interest?
 Because Hollywood is moved by historical precedent, no one particularly wants to be first. Everyone wants to be second. Consequently there is a competitive spirit driving the industry's new-found interest in black film makers. Stephen D. Barnes, an attorney for Bloom, Dekom and Hergott, one of Hollywood's leading entertainment law firms, acknowledges the openings but wonders how deep the motives are. ''There has not been a consistent effort on the part of any major film company to develop black film makers,'' argues Mr. Barnes. ''When someone gets hot, like a Spike Lee or a Keenen Wayans or a Reggie Hudlin, every studio will talk to them, every studio will do a deal with them. Whether they will commit to make the movie is another matter. And that takes a tremendous amount of heat. I don't get the sense that there is a consistent interest, aside from a Spike Lee movie or a Reggie Hudlin movie, something that has commercial value.
''I do see a tremendous number of talented people who are about to get their opportunities, and when they do, the quality of the films and commercial success will convince the studios that this is a gold mine they've tapped into.''
The studios may not yet be ready to put $20 million in the hands of a black film maker, but there are numerous small-scale projects in the works. Charles Lane, who wrote, directed, starred in and raised the money for the silent comedy ''Sidewalk Stories,'' has landed two deals since the release of his picture. At Touchstone, he will direct the English comic Lenny Henry in ''True Identity,'' and for Island Pictures he will direct his own script for ''Skins,'' an interracial romantic comedy.
The television director (''Raisin in the Sun'') and actor Bill Duke will break into feature film making with ''Rage in Harlem,'' an action picture starring Forest Whitaker, followed by a biography of Otis Redding for A & M Pictures, a project that has kicked around for years and, given the current climate of Hollywood, may finally be made. The director Euzhan Palcy (''A Dry White Season'') is in the early stages of developing another music-related feature, a biography of the blues belter Bessie Smith.
Another director, Rolando Hudson, moves from music videos to movies with ''Go Beverly,'' a black coming-of-age love story at Island Pictures written by his wife, Pam Gibson, and Nelson George. Mr. George, a long-time black-music writer for Billboard, is also writing a screenplay about the Apollo Theater for Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment.
Not every black project is being instantly gobbled up. After his project made the rounds of the studios and went into turnaround at Warner Brothers, Robert Townsend landed at 20th Century Fox with ''The Five Heartbeats,'' a script he co-wrote with Mr. Wayans.
 
Some Blacks Want Independence
 Many black film makers, like the MacArthur grant recipient Charles Burnett, have worked independently for years on personal projects and are skeptical about Hollywood's sudden interest and the artistic price of working within the system. Mr. Burnett, whose latest picture, ''To Sleep With Anger,'' won a special jury prize at Sundance, says, ''I need the money [to make movies], but I don't need it that bad.''
Perhaps the most exciting new project - one that challenges the expanding boundaries for black entertainment - is not a motion picture at all but a television show, ''In Living Color.'' Scheduled to make its debut on the Fox network in late spring, this show is an audacious black-themed ''Saturday Night Live,'' created by and featuring Mr. Wayans and a cast of mostly black comic actors. The humor is blunt and topical and aimed directly at the color line with such bits as a gay black parody of Siskel and Ebert and a child's-eye view of the white world. ''White people don't have a problem with black entertainment; it's only when they're told by marketing that it's not for them that they don't get into it,'' says Mr. Wayans.
What ''In Living Color'' and other films by black film makers offer an audience is a fresh way of seeing the world, says the show's producer, Tamara Rawitt. ''Hollywood is finally awakening to the idea that you can tell a familiar story from a new perspective and attract a large audience. In 'Living Color' we take an existing genre and tickle it with a scalpel,'' says Ms. Rawitt. ''It's for a hip and progressive audience with the same street energy Arsenio Hall has.''
Whether Hollywood knows it or not, ''When you talk about language, style, music or dance, the people who carry culture in America from Day One have been black,'' theorizes Warrington Hudlin. Somehow movies have been left behind. ''Motion pictures are the last frontier, and we're here to tame the West,'' says Reginald Hudlin, burning with the energy of his first success. ''Hollywood is now convinced that there is something special about a black perspective, but the financial value of that has been undervalued. Eddie Murphy is still regarded as an exception to the rule,'' says Mr. Hudlin incredulously.
Mr. Wayans believes that what holds down the potential of black films more than anything is marketing. His frustration is obvious when he rehashes miscues in the selling of ''I'm Gonna Git You Sucka.'' ''They say, 'No one will go see this.' Why? Because they wouldn't? It's a racist attitude. You can't sell a film as a black picture. You sell it as a comedy or whatever it is. You never see a film publicized as 'the whitest movie you've ever seen - all white people,' '' he says, launching into a mock pitch.
The solution? ''A film will have to come along and hit a home run, a grand slam, and make $60 million or $70 million and blow preconceptions out of the water,'' he says. ''Then Hollywood will take a whole other approach.''
And maybe then black film makers will get a chance to work on bigger-budget projects. What makes black films appealing now to both the major studios and the independents is that they can be made for a price, with little risk. ''Do the Right Thing'' was a good deal at $6 million; at $12 million, Universal wouldn't have made it. But for $2 million, you can't do an epic or anything really meaningful, says Mr. Wayans. ''Being in this position is a lot of responsibility, because people are looking for you to do everything at once. But to be a diverse film maker you need to command the budgets to make the kinds of films you want to make, and that will only happen when you make your mark in the mainstream and become part of everyone's audience.''
 
Spike Lee Speaks Out
 Sidney Ganis, president of Paramount Motion Pictures, the company that bankrolls Eddie Murphy, insists that the only criterion that he uses in selecting a director is: Who is the best person for the job? Since that is open to a world of interpretation, it's an attitude that doesn't necessarily make Spike Lee happy. One of the projects currently in development by Mr. Murphy's company and Paramount is the film version of August Wilson's play ''Fences,'' a dramatic tour de force about black family life in the 1950's. Mr. Wilson reportedly submitted to Paramount a list of suggested black directors that included Mr. Lee, Gordon Parks, Bill Duke and Lloyd Richards. Also under consideration by Paramount is Barry Levinson, a white director of such films as ''Rain Man'' and ''Tin Men.'' Mr. Lee says he is ''gravely disturbed'' at that possibility and labels it ''wrong with a capital 'W.' '' Mr. Wilson was not available for comment.
Spike Lee is a hard man to please, and, though he admits things are better than ever before, he is appalled by the dearth of black executives in the industry. On a recent visit to Creative Artists Agency, he says, he was disturbed to see only one black agent and a black receptionist. ''Mike Ovitz [the chairman of C.A.A.] is one of the most powerful men in Hollywood. If he were committed to aggressively going out and hiring black people and setting up a training program, there'd be more black agents,'' says Mr. Lee, working up a head of steam. ''If they were interested in change, it would have happened a long time ago. And it's not just C.A.A.; it's all over. It changes when people with clout demand it, and when I have more clout, I plan to talk to Universal about it.''
In his short time dealing with the studios, Mr. Harris has observed ''a weird dance . . . always elliptical and oblique. The studios are huge monsters with frail, tremulous souls. No one individual can make a decision. It's like a 12-headed beast.''
What's needed, according to Mr. Wayans, is greater self-reliance and financial independence from Hollywood. ''The destiny of black arts rests on black people and black corporate America. Every year it's another conference and more talk, but there's no evidence of anything happening right now. As long as Hollywood controls the mainstream, we need a sponsor within the industry. We have no voice without black executives in the business, and right now there is no black executive who can green-light a project.''
The Hudlin brothers don't intend to sit back passively and be the recipients of change. ''We want to effect change,'' says Warrington Hudlin. ''Film is a business founded on alliances and worthwhile investments. Hollywood is just one source to secure capital. We're not going to depend on people's good will; we will depend on people's good business sense.''
It is impossible for black film makers like the Hudlins, Mr. Lee and Mr. Wayans not to be aware of their precarious position in Hollywood. ''Black film makers may be hot today, but tomorrow it will be Hispanic films. What happens then?'' asks Mr. Lee.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Weighing the West German Markets

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
There is another country, aside from Japan, where the bond market has fallen sharply and sent interest rates to startingly high levels. But in that country - West Germany - the impact has not been nearly as devastating.
The Japanese stock market is down 12.48 percent for the year, with sharp one-day falls of 1,569.10 and 1,161.19 in the Nikkei 225 index in the last two weeks. In West Germany, the stock market is 7.13 percent below the high for the year it reached on Feb. 6. But it is still up 1.56 percent in 1990, while all the other major markets, including the United States, Britain and France, are down. 
Morgan Stanley & Company is arguing that the German decline is an opportunity for investors. And they do not see a major downside risk now, even with other markets still skittish over the sharp fall in Tokyo.
But Alistair Ross Goobey of James Capel Inc. in London said the German market still poses risks. He thinks that high interest rates could push the market down another 14 percent, to about 1,550 on the DAX index of 30 leading shares. The DAX closed on Friday at 1,818.23.
Barton M. Biggs, director of worldwide strategy at Morgan Stanley, finds Germany a haven in an otherwise dismal investing landscape that has led him to sit on the sidelines in every other market. Mr. Ross Goobey, on the other hand, thinks that markets outside of Japan and Germany may now be nearing their bottoms, enough so that he is ready to polish his ''buying boots,'' but not yet put them on. One of the key differences of view here involves the impact of interest rates. In both Japan and West Germany, rates have been rising this year and edged up further at the end of last week. The yield on the 10-year bond in Japan is 7.16 percent. In West Germany, it is 8.99 percent, just below its recent peak.
In assessing the impact of interest rates analysts calculate a ratio of returns from bonds compard with stocks. The higher the ratio, the more attractive the bond market is and the more likely that money will be drawn out of the stock market. A high ratio can thus be a signal of trouble for the stock market.
At the end of this week, the ratio in Japan was rising again at 3.58, not far from its recent high of 3.81, according to Mr. Ross Goobey. In West Germany, the ratio was 4.966, below its recent high of 5.268 but also rising again.
Mr. Ross Goobey is worried by the numbers for West Germany. ''This is the same sort of danger sign we saw in Japan before the stock market fall,'' he said.
But Madhav Dhar, global equity stratigist at Morgan Stanley, is less concerned, arguing that the impact of high rates is being offset by the long-term promise of much higher earnings as the two Germanys are reunited and Eastern Europe is developed.
''The psychological risk premium for Germany is going down,'' Mr. Dhar said. ''People are revising up their earnings estimates.''
Another reason West German stocks are holding up better despite the higher interest rates is that they are, at this time, a much better value than Japanese stocks. Japanese stocks, according to Mr. Dhar, are on average selling at prices 17 times the companies' cash flow while West German stocks are priced at 5 times cash flow. In addition, the Japanese economy, although it is still growing and fundamentally sound, is facing more problems, including rising oil prices and a weakening yen. Both the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve sold dollars last week in an effort to support the yen. But the currency still fell, reaching 150.25 to the dollar on Friday.
Mr. Ross Goobey worries that people ''are buying the dream'' of the German market and pushing their earnings estimates too high. It seems, he said, that ''people believe if investors are throwing money at the market, it can't go down.'' He is not pessimistic about Germany's future, and sees economic benefits from reunification. But he thinks the optimism has gone too far.
''It's a question of degree,'' Mr. Ross Goobey said. ''The Japanese have recognized their problems and have corrected for them. The German stock market has not recognized this. We really have not corrected for the excessive optimism.''

HEADLINE: GERMANY AND INTEREST RATES

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
The meshing of West and East Germany - one a sleek, postwar capitalist engine and the other a shattered, inefficient state-run rowboat with high unemployment - is expected to be a formidable task. While the two halves may some day become a seamless and vibrant economy, the transition is expected to be rough, and unsettling for interest rates around the globe. There are divergent schools of thought on the subject. One group of economists believes that there is a finite amount of capital in the world. As West Germany seeks to finance the redevelopment of East Germany, so the argument goes, borrowers there will bid up interest rates to attract capital, forcing borrowers in the United States and Japan to raise their rates in a global competition for funds.
But other economists say the matter is not that simple. German reunification, they say, may not affect interest rates elsewhere. And even if it does, the shifts will be subtle and indirect. Besides, some say, the German markets are so much smaller than those in the United States or Japan that their impact, while important, is inherently limited. 
 
Rate Rise, Isolated
 Neal Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, believes that higher German interest rates are inevitable. The most immediate upward pressure will come as East German citizens demand better housing and clothing, even before production in that country rises. This ''demand shock,'' as it is called by economists, represents an inflationary push on interest rates.
Once production in East Germany improves, there will be a second upward force on interest rates as the capital stock of the nation becomes more productive and businesses begin to borrow more money.
Then too, the so-called ''risk premium'' that German borrowers must offer to investors as compensation for investing in such an uncertain economic climate will also cause rates to climb.
Mr. Soss likens the events in Germany to the reunification of the United States following the Civil War - the problems of unifying the currency and organizing a decimated and largely unemployed labor force in the South.
''The restoration of the States was filled with discord and messiness,'' he said. ''And it will be the same in putting West and East Germany together. There will be a lot of new habits that have to be developed with regard to labor and money. That raises the sense of risk and that is the final influence on rising German interest rates.''
Despite this, Mr. Soss believes, there is ''no reason'' that interest rates should go up in the United States or Japan. He says that rates are influenced more by domestic than international issues. In his view, rates in Japan have been going up only because the unification of the Germanys threatens the belief that Japan is about to become the pre-eminent economic power. The 1990's, which have often been billed as the decade of the Pacific Rim, could instead be a time when economic power shifts to a more dynamic Europe, as the Germanys reunify and Eastern Europe re-emerges as an economic force.
To back up his theory that international rates do not march in lock step, Mr. Soss points to last summer, when the United States enjoyed lower interest rates than many of its trading partners. He felt that this came from the notion of the United States as a ''safe haven'' for capital following the death of the Ayatollah in Iran, the supression of the uprising at Tiananmen Square in China and the political scandals in Japan.
''Domestic economies tend to be the more important influence on interest rates,'' Mr. Soss said. He explains the current rise in rates in this country as a ''return to more normal circumstances'' after last summer's startling political developments. Right now, however, he predicts that rates here may fall slightly if the economy continues to weaken.
 
Rate Rise, International
 The opposite view is taken by C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, a research institute in Washington. Mr. Bergsten believes that events in East and West Germany will ''drag up interest rates around the world.'' He, too, sees higher German rates as inevitable. They will first come from the inflationary pressures of reunification as the purchasing power of East Germany is mobilzed. Once this happens, he anticipates that the West German central bank, fearful of inflation, will try to tighten monetary policy, which would push up rates.
But unlike Mr. Soss, he says the United States is particularly vulnerable to such events because it is so dependent on foreign capital to finance its large trade and budget deficits. ''We're depending on foreign capital inflows of about $10 billion a year to finance our trade balance,'' he said. ''That means we have to pay whatever price is necessary to attract that capital. If interest rates abroad are up, they have to be here.''
In Mr. Bergsten's view, ''The chickens have come home to roost. Our dependence on foreign capital has made us hostage to economic events abroad.''
Conversely, Japan is less vulnerable because it is an exporter of capital, he said. But he noted that a rapid German reunification would probably push up inflation and interest rates in Japan by several percentage points, while a slower pace would dampen inflation fears and keep rates more stable.
 
The Rate Floor
 Nicholas Sargan, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc., makes a distinction between different components of interest rates: inflation, real returns and the uncertainty premium. He believes that inflation in a given country directly affects rates within its own borders, but has little impact on global rates. To support this, he points to the decline in United States interest rates last summer as inflation dropped and the economy slowed here. This contrasts with Japan and West Germany, where rising inflation fears pushed up rates.
But he believes that real interest rates - the component that is set by the productive capacity of an economy - equalize across the globe and set an international floor for rates. The risk and inflation premiums are then built on this floor level.
Without the demand for capital in West Germany, rates of different nations moved in different directions last year, depending on internal inflation fears. But with this new element in play, Mr. Sargan says, rates all over the globe will inevitably rise.
''I still believe the primary factors calling the shots on U.S. interest rates are domestic considerations,'' Mr. Sargen said. ''But going into the 1990's, higher real interest rates abroad become the eventual floor for the U.S. That floor is now being raised. The most difficult question is by how much, and I don't think anyone knows the answer.''
 
An End to Euphoria
 Alan Reynolds, chief economist at Polyconomics Inc., an economic consulting firm in Morristown, N.J., believes that the current euphoria about investments in Germany may subside once the difficulties of reunification become clear. For instance, he anticipates that much of the foreign money that surged into West German stock funds could flow out when investors begin to realize that a unified German economic powerhouse will not emerge overnight and that these funds have become overpriced. The deutsche mark will weaken as investors sell and covert the marks used to buy the stocks back into dollars. Interest rates will rise in Germany as money flows back into the United States and Japan and as buyers of German bonds demand higher returns to protect them against a weakening mark.
But over time, he says, interest rates in other nations will react to inflationary pressues in their own borders rather than those abroad. ''To say that all our interest rates have to go in the same direction is to say we all have to raise interest rates to the level of Britain or Australia because they have higher rates,'' Mr. Reynolds said. ''But they have higher rates for a reason - because people there expect inflation.''
 
The Limited Markets
 Besides, noted Robert Brusca, an economist with Nikko Securities Company Ltd., West Germany's role in the world economy is limited by the size of its stock and bond markets relative to those in the United States and Japan. He noted that the German equities market is only one-tenth the size of the Tokyo market and that its bond market is one-third the size of the Japanese bond market, which in turn is half the size of the United States bond market.
This means that only a limited amount of funds can flow into West German securities without driving the deutsche mark, which is needed to buy these securities, to ridiculously high levels, thereby choking off any investment value. As a result, while Germany may indeed play a special role in the European economy because of its strength, that role is inherently limited, as is the upward pressure on its rates.
''Germany is still a small niche market and that means money flows can be deflected away from the U.S. and Japan,'' Mr. Brusca said. ''But if any sizable moves in funds occur, it will be so visible that it will push up rates and prices in Germany and become a self-limiting process.''
In fact, Mr. Brusca said, as oil prices rise, Arab investors may play a more important role than the reunification of Germany in international money flows and interest rates. ''One of the things missed in all this discussion,'' he said, ''is the rise of the Arab investor and the question of where all those dollars flow.''

A Three-Sided Battle Over the Exxon Oil Spill
 
United States of America v. Exxon Corporation is looking more like United States of America v. State of Alaska. True, a Federal grand jury indicted Exxon last Tuesday on five criminal charges involving the Alaskan oil spill. But Justice Department officials immediately began to leak word that they had a difficult case based on untested legal principles. Their apparent aim: Pressure Alaskan officials to drop their opposition to a bargain with Exxon. The Alaskans objected to a deal that, while potentially costing Exxon more than $500 million, would have avoided a criminal trial and shielded the company for four years from Federal Government suits to recover billions more for environmental damage. The Alaskans said they are willing to resume negotiations. 
 
 
Sanford Weill in the Wings?
 
Will Sanford I. Weill recapture Shearson? Or, is the brokerage firm that Mr. Weill built looking for other investors? Mr. Weill has been working on a deal to merge the brokerage unit of his Primerica Corporation into Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. Sandy Weill built Shearson acquisition by acquisition, sold it to the American Express Company in 1981 and then left in 1985. He returned to Wall Street by buying Primerica, parent of the Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company brokerage firm, in 1988. American Express said Thursday that talks with Mr. Weill had ended, though the door appeared to remain open. But even as Shearson contemplates becoming the nation's largest brokerage, it's becoming smaller. The firm plans 2,000 layoffs by April; more might follow.
 
 
Prince the Empire Builder
 
Prince Rogers Nelson - best known by his first name - has crowned his growing entertainment principality with a $10 million studio near Minneapolis. Madonna has come in to make recordings, producers have filmed commercials for Huggies diapers and Comet cleanser, and Prince himself is shooting his fourth feature film. Record companies are said to send artists to record there on the chance that Prince himself might join in.
 
 
Vindication for Eastern Unions
 
Members of the Eastern Airlines labor unions can say they told us so. A court-appointed examiner said Thursday that the Texas Air Corporation had shortchanged its Eastern subsidiary. The examiner, David I. Shapiro, cited an interest-free loan from Eastern to Texas Air, excessive fees and Texas Air's purchase of Eastern's computer reservations system for much less than the parent company received when it sold just half the system later. In a report Mr. Shapiro recovered, a Texas Air executive proposed to ''cherry pick'' the Eastern system to benefit the company's nonunion carrier, Continental. In compensation, Texas Air agreed to pay Eastern $280 million. Unsecured creditors can take heart that Eastern will be better able to fulfill an agreement to pay them 50 cents on the dollar. But the unions can take only scant comfort. About 12,500 of Eastern's unionized pilots, mechanics, baggage handlers and flight attendants no longer have their jobs.
 
 
'Red' Poling Must Spend
 
Harold A. ''Red'' Poling took over as chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company on Thursday, with the tough task of improving on the record of Donald E. Petersen. Mr. Petersen turned Ford into the nation's lowest-cost, most profitable auto producer. In an industry that loves to label its executives by their background, Mr. Poling is a financial man; Mr. Petersen was a product engineer. Mr. Poling picked up his nickname from his hair color, not his performance on the bottom line: he has been the company's champion cost-cutter. But analysts blame Ford's long product cycles and outdated engine designs on its parsimony. Now, they say, Mr. Poling has to invest billions in new products even as his industry slumps.

THE ECONOMY
 

A Weak Fourth Quarter
 
The nation's economy finished 1989 with its weakest quarter in more than three years. The gross national product grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of nine-tenths of 1 percent in the fourth quarter - four-tenths of 1 percent higher than the Commerce Department's original estimate, but still not a mark economists see as evidence of economic strength. A record 10.5 percent decline in January's durable goods orders, reported last week, added to the gloom. But Lacy Hunt, of Carroll McEntee & McGinley Inc., remains more optimistic than most economists. He said the quarter had ''a very decent showing'' considering Boeing and Nynex strikes, Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake.
 
 
More Indicators Augur Ill
 
The Government's most widely followed forecasting gauge also looks as if it's leading to slow growth. The index of leading economic indicators was flat in January, the Commerce Department reported Friday. Many economists had expected a small increase. Among the index's 11 components, building permits soared with January's warm weather, but plant, equipment and consumer orders fell. The Commerce Department also revised its December index down to six-tenths of 1 percent from eight-tenths. Results from the previous months also point to tough times ahead: the index had a one-tenth of 1 percent gain in November and a four-tenths drop in October.
 
 
Central Bankers: Peas in a Pod?
 
Sometimes all central bankers seem alike. The favored pose: cautious inflation-fighters restraining rash politicians. Last week, Karl Otto Pohl, president of the West German Bundesbank, said Chancellor Helmut Kohl's plans for monetary union would have to await ''radical change'' in the East German economy. Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, has favored higher interest rates, provoking a rare public dispute recently with the Ministry of Finance. And last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the nation was likely to avoid a recession - implying he would keep resisting Administration calls for lower interest rates.
 
 
In Brief
 
Senate leaders and President Bush compromised on a clean air bill on Thursday. Senators demanded stronger measures than the President had proposed, but he insisted on a less costly answer to pollution problems.

 Populism vs. Perestroika
 
Soviet politicians and planners spent the week wrestling with ideas like free enterprise and private property. Often, the reforms President Mikhail S. Gorbachev loudly announces in Moscow fail to reach the ears of distant local officials. So in southern Russia, small business owners mounted campaigns to unseat local authorities who spouted populist oratory and tried to stifle their enterprises. In Moscow, the Supreme Soviet voted on Wednesday to legalize private use of land without private ownership - by means of a law allowing land to be leased for farms and other businesses. Some legislators warned that local officials would make only their worst land available.

Road Ahead
 
New President or no, Nicaragua will need years to rebuild its economy. Washington will help; the Bush Administration said it would lift a trade embargo if President Daniel Ortega Saavedra fulfills his pledge to surrender power to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. But after a decade of war, Nicaragua faces unemployment and hyperinflation. From 1985 to the end of 1989, prices multiplied more than 600,000 times. And the Soviet Union is more likely to concentrate on its own problems than continue its support.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Investors Are Turning Bearish On Japan

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
As Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu headed for California to meet with President Bush last week, Japan-bashing was on the rise in the financial markets.
Japan was the leading economic success story of the past 15 years, but these days it gets no respect from the world's foreign-exchange, bond or stock traders.
The Government of Japan doesn't seem to get along with its central bank, and the Prime Minister's hold on power appears tenuous despite his election victory. In negotiations with leaders of his own party last week, Mr. Kaifu's chief victory was in keeping a convicted criminal - from the Lockheed bribery scandal of the 1970's - out of his Cabinet. 
Some complain that Japanese interest rates are too high to allow the stock market to maintain its exalted levels; others moan that rates are too low to support the yen. With rates rising, share prices fell last week, and so did the yen. The dollar closed above 150 yen for the first time in more than two years.
Perhaps the ultimate indignity for Japan is that the rest of the world seems quite unconcerned about its problems. On Monday, after the Tokyo stock market had its second-worst day ever, the Dow Jones industrial average rose, as it did each day of the week, ending with an overall gain of 96.17 points, or 3.8 percent, to 2,660.36, for its best week in more than four months.
''In Japan, interest rates and inflation are rising,'' said Linda S. Mezey, the research director at Philadelphia's Provident National Bank, adding that she saw no threat here from either, and is buying stocks.
At Prudential-Bache, technician Joseph Feshbach looked up from his charts to proclaim that a strong dollar ''will be one of the biggest stories of the year,'' with the German mark turning from star to stumbler. He thinks the dollar will rise in 1990 to 157 yen and 1.85 marks, from current levels of 150.25 yen and 1.72 marks. The mark, which had been strong, slipped despite central bank intervention to support it.
In this country, much of the economic data from early 1990 looks weak, with both consumer confidence and durable goods orders falling. But who knows what to believe? With the Commerce Department having taken its second stab at reporting the gross national product for the final three months of last year, that quarter looks much better than it had.
When it put out the first figures a month ago (the ''advance'' report), Commerce painted a picture of very weak trade numbers, soaring inventories and falling final sales to consumers. Now (in the ''preliminary'' report) it says forget all those trends. Non-farm inventories were 20 percent lower than reported; the trade figures were the best in six years and final sales were up. Share prices fell on the first report, and rose on the second. The ''final'' report will be out March 28.
If the Surgeon General had jurisdiction over the Commerce Department, he might require a warning on news releases: ''Caution: Believing these numbers may be hazardous to your wealth.''

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
The Caere Corporation, which two years ago created the first optical character-recognition system for personal computers, is preparing to introduce a $10,995 computer that is said to recognize printed words at a rate of 2,500 a minute and convert them to electronic form with a high level of accuracy. The Caere Parallel Page Reader, which is expected to be shown tomorrow at the ''Seybold Seminars 90'' electronic publishing conference in Boston, attaches to a computer network with relative ease and functions as a sort of laser printer in reverse. That is, the user feeds the printed documents into a scanner, and the Parallel Page Reader converts them into word-processing or data-base files.
The new machine is expected to appeal to government agencies, large law offices, insurance companies, aerospace companies and other computer-intensive businesses that must deal with a large volume of paper. Larry Miller, director of sales and marketing for Caere, said the Parallel Page Reader was developed as part of a special project for the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The commission receives about 40 million paper pages of official filings a year, he said, and it was looking for an inexpensive way to convert those pages into electronic form for speedy retrieval and efficient archiving. If Caere's performance claims are accurate - and analysts who have seen the device say they appear to be - it would take 25 tireless secretaries, each typing 100 words a minute, to match the output of a single Parallel Page Reader.
''It is going to change the ground rules'' of the optical character-recognition market, said Bill Clinton, director of the computer publishing systems division of the market research firm BIS/CAP International of Norwell, Mass. ''Compared to existing products,'' he added, ''it offers a significant increase in performance and a significant decrease in price, both by a factor of four.''
Not every analyst was as sanguine. ''I don't think it's going to give Caere a long-term advantage,'' said Jennifer J. Mitchell of Dataquest Inc., a market research firm. ''It's a pragmatic approach to volume character recognition, but it could be duplicated by someone else.''
Significantly, the Caere reader will be sold in retail computer stores, which could open up a new market for high-end recognition systems, Mr. Clinton noted. Until now, high-performance optical document processors cost $40,000 to $250,000 and were too complicated for the average retailer to sell and support. With a price in the same range as a high-end PC and configured to be added easily to a company's local area network, the Parallel Page Reader breaks new ground.
Yet the machine is not a mass-market product. It would be overkill to use it for documents that include only a few words; it needs vast, dense thickets of words to really show its stuff. And because the scanners used by the Caere machine are not known for sophisticated paper handling, odd-sized or ill-treated forms may jam that end of the system.
Not everyone needs to convert millions of pages of documentation into computer files each year, of course. That is why Caere also recently introduced versions of its $795 Apple Macintosh- and PC-based software, Omnipage, which can break down a scanned image of a printed page into electrons and herd the electrons into any of 25 popular word-processing formats at a rate of several hundred words a minute.
The Parallel Page Reader breaks ground in more ways than marketing. It is one of the first commercial desktop applications of parallel processing, a technique that has been the domain of advanced computer researchers and supercomputer companies.
In parallel processing, several individual microprocessors work in tandem on a single problem. If two heads are better than one, the reasoning goes, four heads are even better. Some parallel machines comprise 16, 64, 128 or even more processors, using PC-level chips to yield supercomputer performance at a fraction of the cost.
The Parallel Page Reader is essentially an enlarged eight-slot personal computer powered by the Intel 80386SX microprocessor and backed with one megabyte of RAM and a 40-megabyte hard disk. DOS, Windows and Caere's character-recognition software are already installed on the machine. Four slots contain Caere's special page recognition cards, each with its own 16-megahertz Motorola 68020 processor and two megabytes of memory, working in parallel. The remaining slots are given to a disk drive controller, a video card, a scanner card and, if needed, a network card.
To complete the system the user would have to buy a scanner, a video monitor, a mouse and a keyboard. The system works with only threeJU scanners, but they cover a full range of choices: the inexpensive Microtek MS-II ($1,495 list, including a sheet feeder), the reliable Hewlett-Packard Scanjet Plus ($2,195), and the high-speed Fujitsu M309X series ($5,650 to $6,720), which can capture a page in five seconds.
While current high-end page recognition systems also have multiple processors, Mr. Miller of Caere said those processors do not function in parallel. Each is assigned a separate task, he said: one might handle sentence parsing, another character identification, another context analysis and still another document formatting.
In such systems, a scanner captures an image of a page, and the image is then recognized, or read, by the character-recognition software. The software looks for patterns of light and dark that resemble letters or numbers, then assigns an alphanumeric character to that area of the image. When it is done reading the page and creating a text file, the scanner captures the next screen.
The process is scan, read, scan, read and so on, and recognition halts when the scanner is active. Because reading an image usually takes longer than scanning it, some users of high-end page readers scan all the documents at once, during the day, and then process the images at night or on weekends. With the Caere Parallel Page Reader, Mr. Miller said, each of the four Motorola chips can attack a full page at once; in the rival systems, he said, each chip attacks a different part of the same page.
As a result, the Parallel Page Reader's page recognition is as fast as, or faster than, the scanning. Subsequent pages can be scanned even as the first page is being read, and the total output of the system rises dramatically. With the Windows software, the user can be proofreading the output while subsequent pages are being scanned and recognized.
Caere, which is based in Los Gatos, Calif., claims that characters are recognized at a rate of 220 to 700 characters per second, or c.p.s., as against the high of 250 c.p.s. for the current leader in high-end systems, the Calera 9000 Compound Document Processor, made by Calera Recognition Systems Inc., of Santa Clara, Calif. The other leader in character recognition is Kurzweil Computer Products Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., a subsidiary of the Xerox Corporation. Mr. Clinton, the BIS/CAP analyst, said he expected Calera to mount the most effective challenge to Caere's new machine.

Bringing Diesel Up to Snuff Without Alternative Fuels

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
The soot-belching city bus is headed for extinction as a result of stringent Federal emissions standards due to go into effect next year. Buses in urban areas may now emit as much as 0.6 grams of black carbon particles per horsepower of the engine for each mile driven; that allowance will be cut to one-tenth of a gram next Jan. 1.
Such alternative fuels as methanol and compressed natural gas have been advanced as the solution to the clean-up problem, and test programs involving both are underway in New York and elsewhere. The Federal Environmental Protection Agency has imposed the standards on transit systems three years before the same rules are to apply to all heavy duty diesel engines to encourage large scale tests of alternative fuels. 
Since buses return to a central storage and fueling facility each day, only one alternate fuel tank and pumping facility would have to be installed to service them, as compared with a nationwide infrastructure needed to service over-the-road trucks. But alternative fuels will require costly modifications to bus engines and servicing facilities, deliver fewer miles per gallon and may cut into passenger carrying capacity.
As a result, many bus fleet managers will simply stop buying new buses after Jan. 1 until the advantages and drawbacks of alternative fuels become clearer, according to a survey last year by the American Public Transit Association. One association member, the Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District, based in San Francisco, estimated that converting to methanol would add an additional $31,260 a year to the $130,000 annual cost of operating each bus.
This quandary may provide an opportunity for a small, Radcliffe, Iowa-based entrepeneur who has developed a system that may be able to bring standard, diesel-fueled engines into compliance at a relatively modest cost.
The system, developed by a company called Midwest Power Concepts, injects low-proof ethyl alcohol, also known as ethanol, into the engine. At the same time, it reduces the amount of diesel fuel flowing to the engine's cylinders. Warren M. Dobbertin Jr., Midwest Power's president, said the partial substitution of ethanol for diesel fuel eliminates the overfueling that is responsible for the black cloudbursts from the exhaust pipe when a diesel engine is heavily accelerated.
The water and alcohol mix in 80 proof ethanol helps cool the burning fuel, reducing the formation of polluting nitrogen oxides. In general, the hotter the temperature in a cylinder, the more the usually inert nitrogen in air is converted into nitrogen oxides.
Although the system has not yet reached the required 0.1 gram level, tests on older engines have shown the ability to cut carbon particulate emissions by more than 50 percent. ''The engines we have been testing are 1980-81 vintage, and they meet 1989 standards,'' Mr. Dobbertin said. ''Engines being made today put out about 0.2 grams. Our system will bring it below 0.1.''
The tests on the older engines were conducted by Southwest Research Institute, an independent testing organization based in San Antonio. One engine averaged 0.91 grams of particles in the unmodified state; the emissions were reduced to 0.45 grams with the addition of the Midwest Power system.
A spokesman for Detroit Diesel Corporation, the leading producer of the two-cycle diesel engines for transit buses, said the tests indicate Midwest Power's system ''may have some validity in concept.'' Nevertheless, the company plans to rely on a methanol-fueled engine to meet the 1991 standards.
A bigger booster of the Midwest Power approach is Stephen Spade, general manager of the Metropolitan Transit Authority in Des Moines, which operated 17 modified buses for three months last year to monitor changes in fuel efficiency and durability. The result was an almost identical fuel cost per mile of 24.40 cents with the modified system, compared to 24.42 cents for straight diesel. Although the modified buses got 0.19 fewer miles per gallon, the lower price of ethanol - 58 cents a gallon compared to 88 cents a gallon for diesel - more than offset the milage loss.
''I think they are on to something,'' Mr. Spade said, referring to Mr. Dobbertin and Dwayne Fossen, the actual developer of the system. ''I'm normally a skeptic about this sort of thing, but it seems to work.'' Mr. Spade said a test of longer duration involving more modern engines and more vehicles is needed to refine the data on fuel economy and operating costs.
The system, which costs $7,000 installed, consists of a control box, a separate ethanol fuel tank and pump, a device to inject the alcohol into the engine's incoming airstream and related plumbing and exhaust treatment devices. The ethanol mixture is 45 percent pure ethyl alcohol, 55 percent water and 5 percent polyglycol oil, a lubricating agent.
According to Mr. Dobbertin, the added control box intercepts the signal from the accelerator pedal before it reaches the manufacturer's control and reduces the demand for diesel fuel by up to 30 percent. Then it activates the alcohol system to start pumping the other fuel to an injector mounted in the intake manifold between the turbocharger used on many diesel engines to improve acceleration and the cylinders.
The alcohol enters the cylinder with the incoming airstream, while the diesel fuel is injected by standard means. The only time the diesel fuel and ethanol mix is in the combustion chamber, so the approach is different from the gasahol experiments with cars, where the two fuels were premixed and pumped into the same tank.
Reducing the diesel fuel flow prevents flooding the cylinders with more fuel than can be burned completely. But just cutting back the diesel fuel flow would make the vehicles unacceptably sluggish in pickup. So the clean burning alcohol is substituted, adding energy and slowing the burning process to hold down the formation of nitrogen oxides. After the bus gets up to speed and the accelerator signal is reduced, the proportion of diesel-to-alcohol is increased.
Mr. Dobbertin said the size of the ethanol tank is about 30 percent of the size of the existing diesel tank, so the two containers should empty at about the same rate. But if the alcohol tank should empty first, a limp-home mode has been provided for diesel-only operation.
Since transit buses represent only about 2 percent of heavy-duty diesel engines in operation, the 1991 rules represent a large-scale test. In 1993 they are scheduled to cover all heavy-duty diesels, which power the trucks that deliver most of the nation's goods.
Because it will be many years, if ever, before a nationwide system for distributing alternate fuels is in place, many manufacturers are relying on particulate traps on diesel-fueled engines to meet the emission standards. The traps collect the carbon particles and periodically heat up to burn off the particles.
But Mr. Dobbertin is betting that alcohol injection can compete with traps. ''We are working with two large fleets to develop a test program,'' he said. ''If we can demonstrate real-world savings, the bureaucrats in Washington will have to take a look.''

Fissures in the Industrial Bedrock

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Machine tool makers are part of the nation's industrial bedrock. Manufacturers rely on them for equipment to forge, cut, grind, drill, bend, trim and stamp the blocks and sheets of metal that become cars, airplanes and appliances.
The 1980's revealed the industry's weaknesses, leaving it vulnerable to the slightest economic downturn. ''The next few months will be pins-and-needles time,'' said James L. Koontz, president and chief executive officer of the Kingsbury Machine Tool Corporation. in Keene, N.H. ''If orders don't pick up, a number of companies may be in trouble.''
Weakened by foreign competition and highly fragmented, the industry is struggling to overcome a legacy of poor management and a tradition of under-investment in research. Market trends, notably the substitution of plastics for metals, limit growth prospects. 
Machine tool companies say they have also been hurt by their lack of bargaining power with the huge auto and aerospace companies, which account for half of all tool sales. The American industry also loses sales due to Government restrictions on exports of their most sophisticated products.
The problems in this cyclical industry have been partially masked by a 69 percent surge of tool orders in 1988, to $3.6 billion, which led to a leap in shipments, to $3.2 billion, last year. Many of the 350 or so companies that are the heart of the industry, and the 1,000 or so small specialty shops that make customized tools, had large backlogs of orders.
But with economic growth slowing, new orders fell 22 percent last year to $2.81 billion. New orders during January were down another 15 percent from last year's monthly average, according to the National Association of Machine Tool Builders.
 
THE IMPORT FIGHT
 
Asia and Europe Take Over Markets
 International competitiveness remains the industry's greatest worry. Many of the companies that survived the industry's contraction in the 1970's have abandoned the market for smaller machines, leaving it to Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese companies. European companies, especially West German and Swiss, have driven smaller American competitors out of several niches for precision equipment. Industry leaders like Cincinnati Milacron and Cross & Trecker managed to cushion the financial damage by signing agreements to import and distribute equipment made by Asian firms.
The imports' share of the United States market rose from less than one-fourth to about one-half during the 1980's. The Japanese have led the onslaught, offering tools that match or surpass American quality at far lower prices. In recent years, many Japanese tool makers followed the lead of the Japanese auto makers and electronics companies that are their main customers - and sometimes part owners - in setting up factories in the United States.
Domestic companies have defended themselves by lobbying for import protection and overhauling their product lines. The industry's pressure on Washington resulted in agreements through 1991 for Japan and Taiwan to limit some tool exports to the United States to 1981 levels.
Their new products often link highly computerized machines in clusters. These manufacturing ''cells'' can feed materials to machine tools and automatically change tool heads so that one machine can perform several tasks, like boring a hole and threading it for a screw. To pursue new technology further, tool makers, their major customers and the Government joined to create the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences in Ann Arbor, Mich., in 1988.
 
THE EXPORT BLOCK
 
Battling Washington's Restrictions
 As competition at home intensifies, the larger machine tool companies are stepping up their efforts to export. Analysts say that companies with businesses in Europe already, like Cross & Trecker, may be among the early beneficiaries of Eastern Europe's need to modernize plants. To exploit that opportunity, though, American tool makers want fewer restrictions on exports to the East Bloc and China.
Tool makers claim that because their equipment has become far more sophisticated in the 15 years since the restrictions were drafted, the rules inhibit the export to these countries of virtually all today's machine tools - not just the ones that might be used by military forces. ''While our allies resolve doubtful cases in favor of exporting, we do not,'' said Jim Mack, the machine tool group's vice president in charge of Government affairs. The United States sold slightly more than $1 million in tools to the Soviet Union in 1988 while West Germans topped $500 million. So far, the Bush Administration has agreed to consider allowing more exports to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
Even with the restrictions, the export outlook is improving. Sales to the Soviet Union reached $13 million in the first nine months of last year, according to Patrick McGibbon, who follows machine tools for the International Trade Administration in Washington. He estimated that overall exports were up more than 30 percent for the year, compared with 20 percent growth in imports. Asian and European demand remains strong, he said. But American tool makers are still far from matching their foreign competitors. ''Imports are two and a half times as large as exports,'' Mr. McGibbon pointed out, ''so our trade balance continued to worsen.''
 
GIDDINGS & LEWIS
 
Poised for A Competitive Leap
 No machine tool company is riding higher these days than Giddings & Lewis Inc., based in Fond du Lac, Wisc. Giddings emerged from the industry's decade of turmoil reporting healthy profits, almost no debt, and a strong competitive position in its major product lines. But the journey was a rough one, demonstrating that even far-sightedness is imperfect protection in today's competitive environment.
Giddings, founded in 1859, entered the 1980's with plans to furnish machines for what industrial visionaries called ''the factory of the future.'' Figuring that few customers would build entirely new factories, Giddings became a leading proponent of versatile manufacturing cells that could readily handle parts of different sizes and quick tool changes. More flexible manufacturing methods could reduce the amount of inventory tied up in production and allow manufacturers to modernize in small steps.
Very few of these systems were sold at first, and Giddings itself was taken over in 1982 by the AMCA International Corporation. It lost money for four years in a row in the mid-1980's. But Giddings kept plugging away at the concept, building up the computer software and engineering expertise to make it attractive.
The complexity of the systems, which cost millions of dollars, kept Giddings close to major customers and fostered a sense of partnership. It also kept the company out of the markets most affected by imports. At the same time, the company clamped down on its own manufacturing costs. Everything began to fall into place in 1988. By the time AMCA decided to spin off the company last summer, there was plenty of good news to offer Wall Street.
Giddings recently reported that it earned $17.1 million on sales of $233.1 million in 1989, with new orders increasing despite last year's decline for the industry. And William J. Fife Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said that proposals the company had been invited to make for new orders were running 30 percent ahead of last year.

 
THE CHALLENGE OF NEW MATERIALS
During the 1980's, machine tool makers not only had to meet modern needs for precision and speed; they also had to design machines that could deal with new metal alloys, plastics and exotic composites. Some of these needs to handle new materials have been met by traditional machine tool companies. Cincinnati Milacron, for example, has become a leading supplier of plastic processing equipment.
Composites, which combine light weight and exceptional strength, are a special challenge. ''Composites have been a hot research topic for several decades but it is only in the last three years that there has been a strong scientific effort to characterize the tools and tooling needs,'' said Steven Rogers, an engineer at the Heath Tecna Aerospace Company. Most tooling for composites has developed from trial-and-error programs involving aerospace companies and small tool suppliers like Heath.
Composites, such as the blend of carbon fibers and epoxy widely used in aircraft, are molded from sheets, like plywood, not forged like traditional metals. The sheets are shaped under high pressures and temperatures that can reach 350 degrees. They are extremely tough to cut, drill or trim with traditional tools. The average steel drill bit would burn up before one hole could be made through a quarter-inch of carbon-fiber composite, according to Ken Luebbert, a cutting tools expert for McDonnell Douglas in St. Louis. As a result, users of composites have become leading customers for diamond-edge tools and high-pressure water jets.
Water jets are used in the auto industry for tasks like cutting carpeting. To cut composites, fine grains of garnet are injected into the stream. Water jets are easier to operate robotically, have less heat buildup and are less likely to produce hazardous dust than other cutting tools, according to David Ginburg, a senior engineer for Lockheed Aeronautical Systems in Marietta, Ga.
But the water jets cannot be used for drilling holes only part way through a piece of material. For delicate tasks, diamond-tipped tools have a clear advantage. Aerospace tool experts say that a diamond-coated drill bit can last for 1,500 holes, compared with just 40 for a standard bit.
With such new materials and technologies chipping away at the traditional markets, the National Machine Tool Builders Association is scrambling to broaden its base and project a new, with-it image. To its already long name, the group added a hyphen and ''The Association for Manufacturing Technology.''

The New Dawn Is Casting Some Things In a Bad Light

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: PALM SPRINGS, Calif.

 BODY:
GEORGE BERNARD SHAW once noted that there are two tragedies in life: One is to lose your heart's desire, the other is to gain it.
Democracy is winning. The arms race is over. Villains are friendly now, or impotent. Like a roulette wheel, the globe began spinning in a glorious blur and when it stopped, the jackpot so long desired was America's. So then why doesn't it feel better? Perhaps because while the world celebrates American values, America is home watching the party on TV. Poll-takers, among others, have detected an uneasy sense that, in contrast to the powerful images of democracy transforming the rest of the world, this country is going nowhere fast. 
''Our ideals are triumphing but American wealth, influence, prestige and power are all declining,'' said William Schneider, a Democratic analyst. ''We have lost our ability to control major events.''
Republicans, of course, have rejoinders - among others, that resources are limited. But across the political spectrum, officials and business leaders worry about American schoolchildren lagging behind Asian schoolchildren, about electronic markets ceded to the Japanese, about a self-indulgent corporate culture that has thrived on short-term profits, about an American political system that has grown cynical, slashing and corrupt.
America was always confident at the center of the military universe, or so it seemed. Now it must struggle to stay at the center of an economic universe.
''We don't have the same kind of confidence about ourselves economically that we did militarily,'' said Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington organization associated with conservative thought. ''The Japanese and the Germans seem more disciplined, with a greater work ethic and better technological capabilities. On a basic level of math and engineering, we're clearly behind.''
In California last week, President Bush talked about tackling the nettlesome problems at home: education, drugs, the environment. His speeches were full of good intentions. At the Santa Ana Bowl, with Chuck Norris, the movie tough guy, and Los Angeles Rams cheerleaders around him, Mr. Bush vowed that the days of the drug lords are numbered. But back in Washington, his Administration had conceded that the world drug crop soared last year, despite the President's high-profile drug war. In its annual report on drug production, the State Department said that South American coca production had increased 12 percent from 1988 to 1989.
Americans are measurably happy with their President. He talks about fixing what ails the country. He does not ask for money to do it, and that is fine with the electorate.
When President Bush first began to let the Western Europeans take the initiative at the Paris economic summit talks last summer, his deference was hailed at home and abroad as a refreshing change from the swaggering years of Ronald Reagan.
But now Mr. Bush has stepped back so often, keeping his White House and Washington in the wings of world events, that Americans are growing self-conscious about their secondary role, say pollsters who have conducted focus groups on the subject.
The statesmen catching the world's fancy are elsewhere: Vaclav Havel, Nelson Mandela, Lech Walesa, Mikhail Gorbachev.
Mr. Schneider echoes a view common among Democracts, but not necessily limited to them, that the country will soon start to chafe at the continuing sameness of Government, its lack of commitment to any large new undertaking.
In education, the President promises that American students will be the best in the world at math and science by the turn of the century. And the National Governors' Association, meeting in Washington last week, echoed that goal. But some educators merely shake their heads, arguing that that is unlikely. Even as the President praised the governors' interest in education, Congressional Democrats criticized the ''tepid'' 2 percent education spending increase proposed by the Administration, which holds that increased outlays are not necessarily the key to educational improvement.
But as Mr. Bush continues an advocation of limited government that has held sway in Washington for a decade, the implications of those limits are becoming clear.
To some, Washington now seems devoid of inspiration. But Peggy Noonan, a former Reagan speechwriter, says that Mr. Bush has no need of lofty rhetoric and prefers quietly chipping away at problems.
Tubby Harrison, a pollster who has been doing surveys for the Washington fund-raising group, Democrats for the '90s, said he has been surprised how often those polled expressed a yearning for an inspirational style of leadership.
The President is tetchy about complaints that he doesn't have a vision. ''The vision thing, if you will,'' he says sardonically, when he talks about it. His advisers say that by using the Presidency as a bully pulpit and eking out what money he can from the budget, he will make progress on domestic problems.
But Democrats who once thought Mr. Bush unbeatable in 1992 are begining to wonder if America will be willing to settle for incremental wishes and small-scale dreams.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
America's Position in the Economic Race: What the Numbers Show and Conceal

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
These are days of confirmation that the American economic system remains the model for those yearning to be rich. But to some, this is a moment of irony: Even as the world learns to stop worrying and love Big Macs, the American economy seems to be losing its productive edge. The nation is borrowing billions to cover expenses and to build high-tech toys like the stealth bomber, the theory goes, while everything from vocational education to computer-chip factories slides into obsolescence. At the same time, the United States is losing its self-declared economic war with the Japanese - Toshiba and Toyota have stolen consumers' hearts - and watching passively as the Latin democracies strangle on debts to American banks.
To economists, the truth is elusive. By every objective measure, America remains No. 1. But signs of decline are evident to those who care to see them. And many young Americans do not need a doctorate to understand that it is as hard to live as well on two incomes as their parents lived on one.
Here is a statistical sketch of where the economy is and some clues to where it is going. 
 
1. Strength in Numbers
The sheer size of an economy is one benchmark of a nation's capacity to assert its interests. And here, America is still doing very well. While the growth rate of American output lagged behind Japan's in the late 1960's and 1970's (and far behind rates in poor, newly industrializing economies like South Korea and Brazil), the gap in rates narrowed considerably in the 1980's.
As important, the American economy remains the lion among pussycats. In terms of purchasing power, it is almost three times as large as Japan's and twice as large as the combined economies of West Germany, France and Britain. The Soviet economy barely rates comparison, even when the Soviet output is translated into dollars at a very favorable exchange.
 
2. An Efficiency Gap
Another broad gauge of economic performance is efficiency, measured here as labor productivity or output per unit of labor. And this time around, the numbers are not so encouraging.
The rate of growth of United States productivity has lagged far behind Japan's for four decades and has declined by half since the 1960's. The average American worker still produces a third more than his Japanese counterpart, but these averages are skewed by Japan's wretched performance in services and agriculture. When Japan's mom-and-pop grocery stores and five-acre rice farms go the way of the vacuum tube, the productivity gap will inevitably narrow.
It cannot be assumed, though, that Japan will rocket ahead in the 1990's. William Baumol, an economist at Princeton University, believes that productivity levels tend to converge as easy efficiency fixes are used up and economies depend on service industries to grow. If Mr. Baumol is right, America's rate of productivity improvement is most worrisome because it has slowed down, not because it is slower than Japan's.
 
3. In the Idea Factories
One factor, perhaps the factor, driving productivity growth in the long run is technology. And in light of the apparently strong American commitment to research and development, that has to be good news. The percentage of national income invested in research and development is roughly the same in Europe, Japan and the United States. But the American economy is so much bigger than its competitors' that the absolute level of research and development effort, measured in purchasing power or in scientific personnel, is far greater.
The puzzle is why the nation seems to be getting less commercial bang for its research buck. In some areas, notably aircraft design and production, the United States remains the world leader as measured by the ratio of exports to imports. But in various high-technology industries, it is far behind Japan and West Germany.
It is possible that military spending is draining critical research efforts; atom bomb-powered X-ray lasers are little help in building better auto transmissions. It is possible that the American emphasis on basic research has freed Japanese scientists to skip the gritty groundwork and focus on commercial applications. The simplest explanation, though, is the most discouraging: American corporations may not be good at turning research and development into marketable products.
 
4. Debtor to the World
In the view of many economists, the smoking gun of American decline can be found at the nexus where trade, savings and international finance meet. In the 1960's and 70's United States imports rose rapidly along with exports. But in the 1980's, export growth slipped to nothing, while American consumers' appetite for Saabs to Sonys grew insatiable.
Foreign spending beyond our means was made possible by the sellers' willingness to lend us the difference. Hundreds of billions of foreign cash augmented the anemic level of domestic savings, permitting the economy to modernize factories and automate offices even as consumers and politicians burned the candle at both ends. But in the process America became the world's largest debtor.
This case for decline can be turned on its head. It is just as logical to say that the trade deficit permitted the foreign capital inflow as vice versa. The real cause of the deficit, supply-side economists claim, was the worldwide rush to buy into America's future. And the legacy of foreign debt is thus evidence of its strength, not its weakness.
This much seems certain: Low savings and high economic growth rates cannot go hand in hand indefinitely. To pay back creditors when they ask and still remain a player in the big leagues of the world economy, the United States will have to shed its profligate ways.
 
5. Where to Find Cash
If America is in decline, why is it that the average American has never had more to spend? One possibility, of course, is that America is not in decline. Another is that the averages mask a plenitude of sins, themselves a symptom of decline.
Many American families take home more only because they work more. Adjusted for inflation, disposable personal income per person is indeed up 20 percent since 1980. But average wage rates have slipped 2 percent. An increase in the number of second breadwinners, mostly women, has made up part of the income gain. Increased Social Security and private pension payments have made a difference, too. But more -fully half the gain - comes from higher average interest and dividend payments.
Higher living standards, then, have been heavily dependent on higher corporate profits and higher interest returns to those with savings. It is thus not surprising that many people without a spouse to bring in paychecks or coupons to clip have been left out of the prosperity of the 1980's.
 
6. The Poorer Poor
Compared with the third world, America is generous to its poor. But compared with the welfare state in West Germany or the full employment state in Japan, it is a piker.
In 1980 the poorest fifth of American families received just 5.3 percent of national income. Seven years later the economy had provided a lot of poor people with jobs. But as the statistics suggest, the jobs did not pay well. And government benefits did not pull many out of poverty.
Living standards for the bottom fifth of families fell substantially, explaining, perhaps, why at least some Americans believe that the economy is in decline. Living standards for the young and those with children fell even more. Indeed, among the economically vulnerable the only winners were the elderly: Largely shielded from rising medical costs, they enjoyed substantial real gains from rising Social Security payments.
 
A SATISFIED LOT
 
How the People Are Taking the News
They may sense that the trends in productivity and international trade are ominous, but Americans do not seem to be taking it personally. And even if they are having to work more to stay in the same place, they see their own fortunes as better than the nation's are.
In one attempt to get at the American state of mind, the Gallup Poll asks two questions: ''In general, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in the U.S. at this time?'' and ''In general, are you satisfied or dissatisfied with the way things are going in your personal life?''
To question No. 1, the trend over 10 years is indisputably up: In 1979, three rounds of polling found 26 percent, 12 percent and 19 percent of those questioned satisfied with the way things were going with the nation. In the most recent readings, between August 1987 and last month, 45 percent, 56 percent and 55 percent were satisfied with the nation's course.
But as for their own lives, Americans are still more satisfied - 83 percent last month, which was down just a bit from 1988. And satisfied or not, 49 percent said last month that they were financially better off than they had been a year earlier, while 24 percent said they were worse off.
 
Hope Over Experience
As to the future, Americans are even more sanguine; 65 percent said they expected they would be financially better off next year, while 16 percent said they would be worse off.
This was the trend through most of the 1980's as hope triumphed over experience. Even while the average wage was declining, after adjusting for inflation, those who expected to be better off the following year outnumbered those who expected to be worse off by ratios of 2 and 3 to 1. People did register a real decline in their circumstances, though. In looking back, even many of the ones who expected things to improve said they were worse off than they had been a year before. And during the recession of the early 80's, sizable pluralities said they were worse off.
Again, it appears, uneasiness is rising. A New York Times/CBS News Poll in January found only 8 percent of those questioned saying they thought the economy was getting better, while 36 percent said it was getting worse and 53 percent said it was staying about the same. While the answers to the same question have reflected more pessimism than optimism for 15 years, the January numbers did represent a dip.
On the other hand, it was only a month later that the Gallup Poll asked people about their personal lives, and more than 4 in 5 said they were satisfied ''with the way things are going.''

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
Now Albany Gets Its Opportunity For Fiscal Delusions

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
AFTER the bad old days of the 1970's, when bankruptcy seemed near and boom unimaginable, New York City was ordered to untangle its books and submit them to newly appointed fiscal monitors. The city was also forced to draw up budgets for four years at a clip and to update its spending plans four times a year, so it could not, as one official put it last week, hide its head in the sand for more than three months at a time.
It was a regimen that Paul Dickstein, the former city budget director, said ''tended to make you conservative.'' ''The penalty for being overly optimistic,'' he noted, ''was very substantial.'' 
Now New York State is in a fiscal morass that seems ever more serious, and there are those who believe it could have lessened the trauma by more closely following the city's example.
''I give speeches about it, tell the Governor about it,'' said Edward V. Regan, the State Comptroller. ''The state imposed upon the city controls that it refuses to impose upon itself. It's as simple as that.''
As a result, Mr. Regan said, the state has recourse to maneuvers not permitted the city, such as shifting expenses into the next fiscal year and revenues into the current one to cover shortfalls. Its fiscal forecasts are less comprehensive, and it is less accountable to monitors.
In its outlook, too, Albany has seemed more sanguine than the city, said Mr. Regan, a Republican, who has often been at odds with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat.
When the stock market collapsed in 1987, the jarring end of a heady era on Wall Street, the city responded within days with a partial hiring freeze (and was criticized by some politicians for overreacting).
The state, in contrast, was cutting taxes, an example of what the Comptroller characterized as ''a different budgeting style - almost a different culture.''
Dall W. Forsythe, the state budget director, said the state did not need all the tight fiscal controls imposed on New York City because the city ''had gone through a spectacular financial debacle'' in the 1970's and the state had not.
Mr. Forsythe also defended the state's revenue estimates, saying that he had lowered them often enough to get ''teased regularly for the frequency of the changes.'' Nor was it optimism that caused the revenue projections to be too high, he went on, but rather an upstate economy that was stronger than the one downstate.
Anyway, Mr. Forsythe said, budget directors in other states were wrong, too, in trying to cope with slower economic growth. ''All forecasters have trouble when they reach an economic turn,'' he said. ''We have all tended to miss our estimates in roughly the same direction.''
And so a state budget that was supposed to be balanced last spring - and was certified as balanced by Mr. Regan - had a $277 million deficit in October that had grown to a $700 million deficit by January and a $1.1 billion deficit last month. The gap in the city's budget for the current fiscal year has grown as well, and both the state and the city are braced for even bigger deficits next year that, in the state's case, could well include $600 million of debt incurred this year but pushed forward through the use of short-term borrowing.
 
A Worrisome Twist
If all this seems reminiscent of those bleak days nearly two decades ago, there is a worrisome twist. In the 1970's the state was in a position to help the city and did so by assuming the costs of the City University system and the courts and establishing institutions such as the Municipal Assistance Corporation and the Financial Control Board to watch over the city finances, among other measures.
Then again, New York is one of the few states that require local governments such as New York City to pay a portion of the costs of Medicaid and aid for families with dependent children. And although the city's budget director, Philip R. Michael, said the city had made some headway in getting more education aid, Albany seems unlikely to be much more of a benefactor anytime soon.
''The impact could flow down the Hudson, rather than in the 70's, when it flowed up the Hudson,'' Mr. Regan said of the current fiscal woes in both Albany and New York City.
But if Mel Miller, the Assembly Speaker, has already declared that ''this is as big a crisis as the fiscal crisis of the 1970's,'' others are not so gloomy, at least not yet.
''We do not equate this circumstance to the fiscal crisis,'' said Mr. Michael. ''We do have access to the financial markets. We do know what our bottom line is. The solution is not pretty, but it certainly is a solution.''
There seems some disagreement as well about which is worse off, the city or the state. Standard & Poor's was sufficiently concerned about the state's prospects to issue a ''credit watch,'' a warning that the state's credit rating might fall.
But Daniel Heimowitz, vice president and managing director of public finance ratings at Moody's Investors Services, said his firm was ''a little more comfortable'' with the state's prospects. The state, he noted, could raise taxes on its own, while the city needs the approval of the Legislature to raise virtually anything other than the property tax.
 
A Slowing Economy
''Both have the same problem, which is slower economic performance leading to revenue below expectations,'' Mr. Heimowitz said. But he also said: ''Slowing growth is a lot different from seeing a real deterioration. It's not the same as the aftermath of losing the entire manufacturing sector in the city, back 15 years ago.''
Still, there are already indications that this year's budget negotiations both upstate and down will hardly be business as usual.
Although he said he favored the hiring of more city police officers in his successful campaign for Mayor last fall, David N. Dinkins has already put it off, winning praise for fiscal prudence.
Then again, his administration included in its first budget proposal $150 million in proceeds from a sale of bonds by the Battery Park City Authority for use in this year's operating budget, an item that struck some financial analysts as the kind of deal the city might have resorted to back in the 70's.
In Albany, Mr. Regan, who had hardly been on the best of terms with Mr. Cuomo, has been conferring with the Governor with some regularity.
And there is talk of still more tax increases, in addition to the $800 million the Governor has proposed and his call for deferring the next round of cuts in the state income tax, all of which is unusual talk indeed in an election year.

HEADLINE: Debt Keeps Gaining On National Product

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Protests about the deficit lead most eyes to glaze over, but the 1991 budget seeks to offer a solution: run the deficit through a distillation process to show it is really no cause for concern, a mere $123.8 billion for 1990, a trivial $63.1 billion for 1991. The process is not mysterious, being mostly the subtraction of Social Security Trust Fund surpluses from our actual deficits, shown elsewhere in the budget at the higher figures of $183 billion for 1990 and $142 billion for 1991. 
While aiming to reassure us, the Government is also distracting attention from the deficit's cumulative effect of adding to our public debt and thus to the interest we must pay on it. For 1990, the budget puts debt interest at $254.9 billion, or 21.3 percent of all Federal outlays - more than $1,000 for every man, woman and child.
After World War II our debt was, understandably, well above 100 percent of the gross national product, but we managed to reduce its relative size despite the cold war to a low of 33.3 percent of G.N.P. in 1981. Now the debt is back up to 56.7 percent of G.N.P. With the interest requiring such a large percentage of Government resources, how does this limit our flexibility and capacity to address the problems facing our society and our planet?
In the absence of serious public discussion of these matters by the President or by Congressional leaders, I wonder just how far these trends will continue.

HEADLINE: Switch in Latin Crops Won't Help Peasants

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Coffee, Chrysanthemums and Cocaine''(editorial, Feb. 20) implies that an economic policy allowing for the increase in the price of ''Andean'' coffee and cut flowers will trickle down sufficiently to make the growth of coca (and I assume marijuana and heroin) less rewarding. That misstates the problem. 
Who profits from the sale of coffee or flowers? How much does a person working in the fields earn? Where do the profits go? Historically, agricultural profits from Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean end up in out-of-country banks and real estate. These bank accounts and investments are not made on behalf of the people who labor, but for the very few, rich patrons.
Coca, chrysanthemums - what's the difference? The effect on the user, of course, but the greater evil is the effect on the people of the producer nations.
If we in the United States want to help the people of these countries (as well as our own user population) then we must address the real problems of development and equitable distribution of property. The bankers and entrepreneurs must become responsible to more than the profit motive. Drugs are only the symptom - greed is the disease.

HEADLINE: Not Even an Apple for Poland

BYLINE: By John Heinz; John Heinz, Republican of Pennsylvania, is a member of the Senate Finance Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Solidarity wants an Apple computer so it can do a better job of typesetting its newspaper. The Polish telecommunications authority wants to buy outdated Western equipment so that local callers will be able to dial direct. For now, the Administration says Poland can't have either.
Meanwhile, China, which savagely suppresses democracy, can buy mainframe computers 10 times more powerful than the computer Solidarity's newspaper can't have. Thanks to purchases of U.S. equipment and satellites, China soon will have one of the world's most modern telecommunications systems. 
The difference lies in liberalized export regulations agreed to in 1985 to encourage China to ''grow out'' of traditional Marxism-Leninism. Despite impressive attempts by Poland and Hungary to win U.S. confidence, the Administration refuses to grant these struggling democracies the same access to Western technology we allow China. That defies common sense.
Poland and Hungary should be granted a comparable arrangement immediately - contingent, of course, on President Bush's having assurances that Soviet intelligence operatives in those countries have been evicted or contained. The same should hold for any Eastern European nation that adopts a democratic system and takes concrete steps to reduce its military, intelligence and economic ties to the Soviet Union.
Helping Poland and Hungary match their political successes with modernized, successful economies is the only way to insure the permanence of reforms. Modern technology is the key. As Peter Varkonyi, Hungary's Ambassador to the U.S., put it, ''We cannot have a first-rate economy with third-rate technology, and we cannot earn the currency required to transform our backward economies into modern ones if we cannot compete in the world marketplace.''
Recent reports indicate some Administration members are thinking about relaxing controls affecting exports to Poland and Hungary in perhaps a year. New technology can make a difference today; a year could be too long, if democracy begins to weaken. In explaining the delay, the Administration cites old worries: Both countries belonged to the Warsaw Pact; both were members of Comecon, the Soviet-dominated economic alliance, and both were heavily infiltrated by the K.G.B.
Today Comecon is dead in all but name. Its 10 member nations recently voted to move toward a market-based system of trade. Hungary and Czechoslovakia proposed to gut the system and get on with integrating their economies into the West. The Warsaw Pact, too, is all but dead. Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have announced military spending cuts of up to 25 percent in the coming year. Moscow began withdrawing troops from Czechoslovakia a few days ago, and plans to begin pulling out of Poland and Hungary in coming months. According to impeccable sources, some Eastern European nations are expelling K.G.B. agents.
None of these changes guarantees that an Apple computer won't end up in Soviet hands if Solidarity is allowed to buy one. But Poland and Hungary have gone a step further: volunteering to accept extremely intrusive safeguards, which include on-site inspections. Just a few days ago, after months of delay, the Administration responded with a statement of export-control principles so vague as to have no practical value for negotiating a new arrangement.
The U.S. has long taken the lead on export-control issues, but the Administration's hesitation threatens to change that.
Soviet and Eastern Europe access to advanced Western technology is governing by the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, made up of 14 Western European countries, Japan, Australia and the U.S. The unity of this watchdog, known as Cocom, is one of the West's best sources of leverage for democratic change in Eastern Europe.
In the past two years, France, Britain and Italy have allowed companies to circumvent Cocom's control and sell advanced technology directly to the Soviet Union. This deterioration in unity will continue to accelerate the longer we resist adjusting to the changes in Eastern Europe. This message was conveyed to the Administration at a recent Cocom meeting; our partners called for a trade agreement with Eastern Europe that would match the China arrangement in every respect. The Administration agreed to liberalize controls in only 3 of 39 technology categories.
The costs of the Administration's delay will not be limited to a loss of international influence. We also will end up cutting U.S. companies out of lucrative markets, while their Japanese and European counterparts cut deals.

Fighting The War On Cigs

BYLINE: By Anna Quindlen

 BODY:
The ad looks like this. There is a woman. She has great clothes, important earrings, big hair, some attitude. There is a white box beneath the woman. The box says, ''Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema, And May Complicate Pregnancy.'' The ad appears to be selling two things: sex and death. Of course, it is really selling cigarettes.
Cigarettes make your drapes smell and your teeth yellow. Oh, and there's the death thing. Americans are now divided into four groups: those who know cigarettes kill you and don't smoke, those who know cigarettes kill you and don't care, those who know cigarettes kill you and can't stop, and young people, who have a deep and abiding belief in their own immortality. There are cigarette manufacturers, too, the only people still willing to defend smoking as though it were freedom of religion. Dr. Louis W. Sullivan has decided to go after them, to go supply-side on cigarettes. 
Dr. Sullivan is the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and although he gets his paycheck from those same folks who bring you tobacco subsidies, he has gone on a tear against cigarette manufacturers. First he got angry at them for targeting black smokers with a brand called Uptown. Then he got angry at them for targeting young working-class women - virile females, one overheated marketing plan called them - with a brand called Dakota. Then he got angry at them for sponsoring tennis tournaments.
In sum, Dr. Sullivan does not think cigarette manufacturers should try to sell their product, and especially should not try to sell it to those people most likely to buy it. ''Cigarettes,'' he said, ''are the only legal product that, when used as intended, cause death.''
Can there be any possible rationale for the manufacture and sale of a product that can be (correctly) described that way? Well, yes, but it's a historical, economic and political rationale. Tobacco has been a cash crop in the United States since before it was the United States, which can only make you wonder what life would be like if the first settlers had planted coca. The tobacco industry is one of the most profitable in the world.
And as long as there are senators, lobbyists and electoral votes from the Carolinas, cigarettes are certain to remain legal. We know from experience that if tobacco were against the law, an enforcement effort would be expensive and inept. It would be called the War on Cigs.
Dr. Sullivan is waging his war in a way that we've come to expect from government: long on talk, short on action. Taken to their rightful conclusions, his arguments lead either to a ban on most cigarette advertising or a call for more socially responsible behavior by those who produce the ads. Since the words ''socially responsible'' and ''cigarette advertising'' rarely appear together outside of a Scrabble board, the latter seems unlikely.
Even an outright advertising ban might not devastate the industry. There would certainly be a drop in use, since cigarette consumers so often die and ads recruit new ones. But there is a theory that advertising and promotion costs are so staggering - more than $2 billion a year, if you want a number to make your eyes pop - that ending cigarette advertising could even benefit some tobacco companies financially. Hurt would be newspapers and magazines, which take in enormous revenues from cigarette ads. This is a quandary. I'm in favor of newspapers and magazines.
I'd be in favor of a War on Cigs, but a real one, with teeth. I don't believe we need to make cigarettes illegal; we should simply act as if they were. Take educational films to high schools showing people in the last stages of lung cancer. Offer free programs to help people quit. Run commercials like the ones now produced by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, the ones with the egg frying and the words: ''This is your brain. This is drugs. This is your brain on drugs. Any questions?'' Make it real.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy has proposed anti-smoking legislation that would provide $50 million for paid advertising and public-service announcements, and add tobacco to school drug-education curriculums. Smokers say such campaigns, as well as smoking bans in public places, make them feel like criminals. Better censure than chemotherapy, I always say.
We need to apply what we've learned from battling crack to battling cigarettes. The Cartagena statement released at the end of the drug summit meeting took due note of the fact that demand is the twin of supply. Dr. Sullivan shouldn't be wasting his passion focusing on the cigarette companies. He should be persuading the President and the Congress to take real action to cut demand for cigarettes. Supply will follow. Money talks. So does the Secretary. He must do more if there is any hope of waging a war against cigarettes, and of winning it.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN: Rio de Janeiro

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE; JAMES BROOKE is chief of the Rio de Janeiro bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
Austrian TV viewers recently saw a cigarette commercial featuring a European tourist sitting naked on Copacabana Beach. Thieves had picked him clean, but they left him his pack of Dames. Rio de Janeiro's pickpockets have become the latest international stereotype, and since 1988 tourism has been declining at the rate of 100,000 visitors a year, down to 610,000 in 1989. With tourism off, visitors can enjoy this lovely city, experiencing a sense of discovery.
Just make it a point not to take anything you would regret losing; leave watches, credit cards and other valuables in the hotel safe. Street clocks offer the time, and most shops have stopped accepting credit cards because of the inflation rate, running about 75 percent a month. 
Despite crime and the economic situation, most visitors find Rio a beguiling place: a heart-stopping tableau of curving beaches, white skyscrapers, gray granite mountains, lush rain forest. On summer weekends half the population of Afro-Latin cariocas, as residents are called, slides down the hills and out of high-rises to head for the South Atlantic beaches. Carnival ended last Tuesday, but the beach plays year round, with the high season running from December through March. To take the city's pulse, stroll Rio's wavy mosaic sidewalks in the beachfront neighborhoods of Copacabana, Ipanema and Leblon. Copacabana Beach, the ''Little Princess of the Sea'' of the 1950's, is a bit down at the heel, but sidewalk vendors and all-night illumination create the atmposphere of a street festival. After draining a cold beer (chopp) or a glass of freshly squeezed fruit juice (suco), serious sociological observers progress to Ipanema and Leblon, two beaches that offer less clutter and more preening of beautiful bodies.
Visitors who want something different have a choice of new ''Rio Like a Native'' tours. In addition to the standard daytime tourist attractions, there is an evening dance hall crawl ($46 to $120 a person, depending on the number of people in the group) through places where Brazilians dance the samba and the lambada and listen to jazz. For more information call Brazil Nuts in Fairfield, Conn.: 203-259-7900 or 800-553-9959. (To call Rio from the United States, put 011-55-21 before the seven-digit numbers given in this article.)
 
Money Matters
Major hotels and jewelers do accept credit cards, and, thanks to new foreign exchange laws, bills are charged at the floating rate, so Rio has become surprisingly inexpensive. Although the inauguration on March 15 of Brazil's new president, Fernando Collor de Mello, may bring order to the economy, the floating rate now gives tourists about twice as many cruzados for $1 than the official rate.
Visitors carrying dollars, cash or traveler's checks are shielded by the constant devaluation of the cruzado. Business pages of Rio's newspapers publish the parallel rate, which tourists have access to at exchange shops.
All cariocas acknowledge the parallel rate, except drivers of yellow taxis who cruise around hotels. Because of inflation, they use a printed table to translate the figure on the meter into the current fare; it is easier to issue new cards than reset the meters. For an outing of more than an hour, settle on a price before getting in the cab.
Given inflation, it is best for visitors to change only enough dollars to cover two or three days' expenses.
 
Outings
Only a bird can sort out all of Rio's beaches, tunnels and mountains, so on a clear day climb to the city's landmark statue, ''Christ the Redeemer,'' at the top of 2,300-foot Corcovado Mountain. Access is by taxi or funicular, which leaves every hour from 513 Rua Cosme Velho and costs $2. The highest platforms will be closed till September as the 59-year-old statue undergoes an overhaul. Another panorama is offered from Sugar Loaf Mountain, reached by a cable car from Praia Vermelha in Urca. If you complete the trip to Corcovado with a driving tour of Tijuca National Park, you will encounter the rain forest, almost empty except for park guards. On weekends the road from Corcovado is closed to cars and opened to joggers, who run down the road, then shower under a waterfall.
A taxi driver should charge $40 for the day to take you through the mountain forest, stopping to see butterflies, Cascatinha (a 100-foot waterfall) and two views, the Emperor's Table and the Chinese View. Standing under the ersatz Chinese Pagoda, a visitor will see Rio's beaches thick with people.
A pleasant way to end the morning is to lunch at one of the two restaurants in the forest: Os Esquilos or its cheaper companion, A Floresta. For $15, a couple can have steak or chicken washed down with a caipirinha, a cocktail of rum and lime juice, at Floresta. At Esquilos, the menu is international, the setting more elegant, the check for two about $30.
Closer to the beaches, another refuge from the hubbub of this city of close to six million is the Botanical Garden, which offers long walks in the shade of elegant palms. Founded in 1808, the garden offers more than 5,000 species planted in 340 walled acres across the street from the Jockey Club racecourse. Admission is 25 cents; hours are 8:30 A.M. to 5 P.M.
 
Shopping
Every weekend, Rio has two outdoor fairs. From 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. on Saturdays, dozens of antiques dealers spread their wares over Praca Marechal Ancora downtown. Nearby, the Albamar restaurant in a green hexagonal tower offers lunch featuring seafood for about $25 a person and a sweeping view of Guanabara Bay.
On Sundays, the Hippie Fair takes over Praca Gen. Osorio in Ipanema. It runs from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. Ideal for stocking up on presents for nieces and nephews, this bazaar offers a wide range of Indian crafts, leather handbags, T-shirts, kites and hammocks. The mass-produced primitive art (about $20) travels well and seems to appreciate rapidly in value. I once saw one of the paintings offered for $200 in a gallery in Southampton, L.I.
Brazil is known throughout the world for its semi-precious gemstones. Amsterdam Sauer (484 Visconde de Piraja; telephone 239-8999) and H. Stern (490 Visconde de Piraja in Ipanema; 259-7442) offer a variety of aquamarines, tourmalines, topazes, emeralds and amethysts for about 20 to 25 percent below what they would cost in the United States.
From 8:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. Monday to Friday and from 8:30 A.M. to noon on Saturday, H. Stern offers a taped tour, in a choice of nine languages, of artisans at work.
 
Where to Stay
Rio's top hotels offer the kind of polished international service that varies little from Brazzaville to Bogota. What is different are spectacular views.
The major beach hotels are Caesar Park in Ipanema (460 Avenida Vieira Souto; 287-3122; $240 for two), Meridien in Copacabana (1020 Avenida Atlantica; 275-9922; $220 for two), Rio Palace in Copacabana (4240 Avenida Atlantica; 521-3232; $190 for two), the Sheraton beyond Leblon (121 Avenida Niemeyer; 274-1122; $185 for two) and the Inter-Continental in Sao Conrado (222 Prefeito Mendes de Morais; 322-2200; $190 for two).
Two stately standbys of Copacabana Beach are the Copacabana Palace, a creamy, Riviera-style hotel built in 1923, which last December was bought by James Sherwood, the American investor who revived the Venice Simplon Orient-Express (1702 Avenida Atlantica; 255-7070; $110 for two) and its neighbor, the small Ouro Verde (1456 Avenida Atlantica; 542-1887; $125 for two).
Budget choice: The Carlton (259-1932) at 68 Joao Lira in Leblon, which charges $60 for two.
To get away from the hotel scene, about 30 apart-hotels offer small apartments by day or week. Claridge in Leblon (156 Rainha Guilhermina; 266-1919) is clean and convenient. Others are Ipanema Flat (137 Gomes Carneiro; 287-9292) and the new Tiffany in Ipanema (302 Prudente de Morais; 266-1965). Each charges about $100 a day for a small apartment with kitchen.
 
Where to Eat
Rio offers a wide variety of restaurants. The best English-language guide is Christopher Pickard's encyclopedic ''1990/91 Insider's Guide to Rio de Janeiro'' ($10 at most large bookstores and hotels or $15 plus $1.40 for shipping from Boerum Hill Books, Post Office Box 170286, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11217; 718-624-4000).
When choosing a restaurant, play to Rio's strengths: seafood and the Afro-Brazilian cuisine of Bahia. A fish dinner for two, with a bottle of Brazilian white wine, is $30 to $40 at these fine restaurants: Grottamare (132 Gomes Carneiro, Ipanema; 227-3186) and Satiricon (192 Barao da Torre, Ipanema; 521-0627).
Downtown, for lunch only, there is Cabaca Grande, (12 Ouvidor; 231-2301). An hour out of town, try the small, American-run Quatro Sete Meia (476 Barros de Alarcao; 395-2716). It is open only for lunch during the week, lunch and dinner Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
For Bahian cooking, waiters in colonial dress offer filling muqueca de camarao (shrimp stew) and feijoada (black bean stew) at two restaurants: Moenda in the Hotel Trocadero, which has a wonderful nighttime view of Copacabana Beach (2064 Avenida Atlantica; 257-1834) and Chale Brasileiro, a town house that is furnished with antiques from the coffee era (54 Matriz, Botafogo; 286-0897).
Budget choice: the $30-for-two, eat-until-you-explode barbecues at churrascarias. Waiters come by with meat on swords - chicken, pork, lamb, beef. Experienced diners wait until the finer, more expensive cuts come by. Try Mariu's (290 Avenida Atlantica in Leme; 542-2393) and Jardim (225 Republica do Peru, Copacabana; 235-3263).
 
Night Life
For the sedentary, Oba-Oba (110 Humaita; 286-9848), Plataforma (32 Adalberto Ferreira; 274-4022) and Scala (292 Afranio de Mello Franco; 239-4446) offer beautiful women dancing the samba clad largely in feathers.
Lambada, the sensual dance of the Brazilian poor, has swept back to Rio after its success in Paris and New York. Lambada frenzy is liable to break out without warning on any of the following dance floors: People, a multi-floor disco in Leblon (370 Barolomeu Mitre); Hippopotamus, a private club (hotels can make reservations for their guests; the minimum charge at the disco is $20 a person) in Ipanema (354 Barao da Torre) and Estudantina, a student and working-class dance hall downtown (79 Praca Tiradentes).
It's best to go to Estudantina in a group and not take large amounts of money.
Next door to Hippopotamus is the Banana Cafe, today's place for Rio's beautiful people to be photographed nibbling pizza.
For live music, Brazil's best singers fight for a booking at Canecao, a cavernous nightclub, at 215 Vencesalu Braz in Botafogo.
Brazilian jazz can be heard at People, at Jazzmania (769 Rainha Elisabeth in Copacabana) and at Mistura Fina (15 Garcia d'Avila in Ipanema).
Nightclubs that offer live music usually have a cover charge of between $5 and $10, which ordinarilly includes one drink.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
You Can't Be Too Thin in Economy Class

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
IN economy class, the squeeze is on. If you feel you are having a tougher time getting into your airplane seat than you used to, and if you find sitting there for a long time more trying, it is not your age or your bulk. You are being packed in more snugly. Instead of a seat that occupied 34 inches or even 36 along the aisle four years ago, you will probably now get a seat that takes up only 31 inches. In a can of sardines, that is a considerable loss.
Fuzzy as airline people are in discussions of passenger space, certain facts are apparent about seat spacing; in the industry it is called pitch, meaning the distance between a certain point on a seat and the same point on the seat behind it.
First, on overseas flights, the profit is in business class, and economy class gets squeezed to provide more of these higher-priced seats. If an airline takes one inch away from the space allotted to each of 36 rows, it can add a row to business class. 
Second, as several experts said, although all of the big airlines would probably be forced to follow suit if one suddenly began to tout more space for each seat in economy class, the trend is going the other way: If one airline can get away with a 31-inch pitch, they will all try it. And they all are. United has rearranged business class in its new 747-400's to provide 40-inch pitch instead of 37 or 38 inches and to seat the business-class customers seven across instead of eight, but the economy class seats, which arrive from Boeing at 34-inch pitch, are reconfigured to 31 inches.
Right now, according to Consumer Reports Travel Letter's invaluable survey of seat comfort, only two small airlines are using roomy economy-class seats as a selling point: Midwest Express, which provides first-class seating - extra width as well as length - on economy class on flights out of Milwaukee, and Ladeco, a Chilean line, which has 38-inch pitch for an economy class seat in its 707's and 727's although the seats are still arranged in the usual six across.
British Airways began to promote added space in economy class on Feb. 1, but with a couple of twists. The line announced an eight-month experiment called Economy Select on its DC-10 flights from Dallas-Fort Worth to Gatwick Airport in London. Passengers who pay full economy-class fare, which this month would be $1,102, taxes not included, for a 30-day round trip with a midweek departure, British Airways said, would get a number of privileges, including seats with 34-inch pitch in a special economy-class section. Most of these are arranged in the regular rows of nine: two-five-two, but the pitch is 3 inches more than the 31 inches used elsewhere in economy class. The rest of this month on this route, the 31-inch seats cost $548 for a 30-day round trip with midweek departure - half the price of Economy Select.
But British Airways did not rearrange the seats; it does not say it did. Carlson's Airline Seating Guide, a periodical that prints diagrams of airline seating but not seat dimensions, last fall published the British Airways DC-10 layout. It showed the same arrangement as the airline now uses, with the 31 seats that now constitute Economy Select in the same island behind business class and ahead of the overwing exit. But Carlson simply designates them economy seats. People paying discounted economy fares were evidently requesting these particular seats, rows 15, 16, 17 and 18, to get the extra room. In its new program, British Airways decided to declare these seats non-smoking seats and to advertise them, but at a doubled fare, to people who had not caught on to the extra value. A Fourth Class If British Airways extends the experiment to other routes, it will create a fourth class of service in addition to economy, business and first class. There are some other goodies - a special check-in desk, special ticket wallets and baggage checks - but the space is the deal, and a price tag has been put on those three inches. For price comparison, the year-round first-class round-trip fare on the Dallas-London route is $5,254, and business (club) class is $3,104.
When Consumer Reports Travel Letter printed its latest survey on seat size, in October 1989, it listed British Airways as offering 33-inch pitch in economy class on both its 1011's and its 747's. However, Margie Vodopia, a B.A. spokeswoman, says that 31 inches is correct now and was probably correct then, although the line uses some planes it got in a merger with British Caledonian and there can be variations. ''We're the airline for short, thin people,'' Ms. Vodopia said.
In economy class, all airlines are for short, thin people, in the view of Ed Perkins, the editor of the Consumer Reports Travel Letter, who every two years pulls together statistics, in addition to pitch, for the world's airlines to develop his ''comfort score.'' The computer-created scores show that newer 727 models and the 737's and 757's, which all seat six abreast - three and three - are generally the least comfortable, with narrow seats, poor configuration and tight pitch. ''The situation is getting worse,'' Mr. Perkins said, ''primarily because of the shift of airline fleets toward 737's with tight pitches. The big wave of reconfiguring went on three years ago when a lot of airlines made cutbacks in pitch. The situation is as tight as it can get.''
Mr. Perkins's research shows that the best comfort ratings show up on the new MD-80's and the 767's, the DC-10's and L-1011's. The big 747's fall in the middle range, as do the older 727's.
Travel agents and airlines will tell you what sort of plane is scheduled on the trip you want to take on various flights, and you can see if you have any choice of equipment. The August 1989 Consumer Report Travel Letter, with the chart on 76 major airlines' seating, costs $5; write the newsletter's circulation director, 256 Washington Street, Mount Vernon, N.Y. 10553. A year's subscription of 12 issues is $37; 800-999-7959.
Carlson's Airline Seating Guides appear four times a year in both an overseas airline edition ($44.95 a year) and a United States edition ($39.95 a year). Carlson Publishing, Box 888, Los Alamitos, Calif. 90720. Something else is happening with airline seating that affects comfort indirectly - new regulations to promote cabin safety. A Department of Transportation rule in 1988 said that all new types of big passenger airplanes, principally the MD-80 and the MD-11 on the way, must use passenger seats that can withstand an impact 16 times stronger than the force of gravity, rather than 9 times the force of gravity, the previous requirement. For airplanes certified for passenger use before 1988, meaning almost everything you ride, the rule takes effect in 1995.
However, perhaps because a requirement on fire resistance of cabin materials takes effect in August 1990 for all new planes, regardless of design, and for all major refurbishments, the seats coming off the assembly lines these days, five years before the requirement, are 16-gravity seats. At the PTC Aerospace factory in Bantam, Conn., they had a hard time finding any 9G seats for comparison with its model XL-940, the fireblocked 16G seat that is being turned out for Northwest, American, Pan American, United and others. X-Shaped Legs The 16G seats are lighter in weight and an inch higher off the ground, and an inch or so thinner in the back. The main thing you notice is the X-shaped legs, which are designed to absorb impact better than straight legs. Frank Keller, a marketing official at PTC Aerospace, said his company's customers, which include most of the major United States airlines, were sending in specifications for seats installed at a 31-inch pitch. But, Mr. Keller said, the design of the new seats gains some space for the passenger over the 9G seat at the same pitch. There is an extra inch for legs or luggage under the seat in front; it measured 12 inches as against the 11 inches on the 9G model. The armrest is more tapered, and you can slide your thigh partly under it. The X-shaped legs allow you to slide your feet part of the way under in the leg area. The back of the seat is thinner, which allows you to sit back further.
It turns the world on its head, but if you want spacious seating, take a flight to Asia. The 747's and DC-10's that fly the Pacific almost all offer seat pitch of 34 inches for comfort on longer flights. Craig Martin of Boeing said that the 747-400's, the newest version of this plane, were being prepared for seats to be installed with a pitch of 34 inches, but not all of them stay that way, as United demonstrates.

HEADLINE: In the Cocaine War ... The Jungle Is Winning

BYLINE: By Michael Massing; Michael Massing, a 1989 Alicia Patterson Fellow, has written extensively on the United States' drug policies.

 BODY:
NEAR THE TINY VILLAGE OF Santa Lucia, deep in the Peruvian jungle - a vast, untamed land of luxuriant vegetation, steeply rising hills and swollen rivers, where gun-toting narcos and murderous thieves mix with peasant activists and Maoist guerrillas - United States officials are putting the finishing touches on a new military base meant to serve as America's forward outpost in the war on cocaine.
The runway, 5,200 feet of compacted gravel, cuts like a broad alabaster band through the dense emerald brush. Daily, C-123 supply planes fly in from Lima, 250 miles away, carrying everything from boots and bottled water to dynamite and machine guns. Dark-green Huey helicopters, pressed back into service after their time in Vietnam, slice gracefully through the sky, filling the heavy tropical air with a deep, resounding buzz. Thatched sheds, green tents, piles of black sandbags, and dark, brooding skies all contribute to the wartime atmosphere. 
This time, though, it's not the Marines or the infantry that's doing the fighting, but the Drug Enforcement Administration. About a dozen D.E.A. agents are stationed here, trim, clean-cut types wearing camouflage pants and black army boots. A few months ago, these men were busy arresting drug dealers on the streets of Chicago and Seattle. Now they're in the middle of the Peruvian jungle, living in tents and conducting paramilitary raids. Backing them up is a crew of American pilots, mechanics, aviation experts and ex-Special Forces operatives with experience in Vietnam and El Salvador. In all, 30 or so Americans are serving alongside 120 Peruvian policemen in what is surely the most dangerous anti-narcotics post in the world.
The Upper Huallaga Valley, which extends for 200 miles along the Huallaga River, is home to the world's finest coca. An estimated 250,000 acres are covered with the crop, and conditions are ideal for growing more. There's abundant rainfall, year-round warm temperatures and steep tree-covered slopes well beyond the reach of the law.
The jungle canopy offers excellent cover for primitive laboratories, where amateur chemists work day and night to turn the coca leaves into a gooey paste, called pasta basica. Small airplanes from Colombia - home of the giant cocaine cartels, which process and distribute the drug - come to pick up the paste and transport it to the Peruvian-Colombian border, where it's refined into cocaine hydrochloride, or cocaine powder. From there it is smuggled into the United States, feeding the nation's immense, insatiable habit.
Today, coca is Peru's largest export, earning more than $1 billion a year. As many as one million of the country's 21 million people are involved in the trade. Peruvian coca accounts for perhaps 65 percent of the cocaine entering the United States, and more than half of it is grown in the Upper Huallaga Valley.
It's here, then, that the United States has chosen to make its strongest stand. The goal: stopping the flow of cocaine at its source.
The program is already well under way. Active-duty Special Forces advisers are training Peruvian anti-narcotics police (Continued on Page 88) in jungle warfare, and Peruvian pilots have been sent to Fort Rucker, Ala., to learn to fly helicopters. The United States is expanding its intelligence presence in Peru and plans to build a new, highly secure embassy in Lima. And, even as construction continues at the base in Santa Lucia, the United States is planning to build several more just like it.
''The Upper Huallaga Valley is going to be the model for the world,'' says an American official helping to implement the program. ''We're slowly developing a package that can be used anywhere, whether it's opium, poppy or coca fields we're trying to get rid of.''
The United States is embarked on a five-year, $2.2 billion aid program for the Andean region, which may include more than $600 million for Peru alone. President Bush's visit last month to Cartagena, Colombia, to meet with Andean leaders was a sign of just how much importance the Administration attaches to the region. Coming not quite two months after the invasion of Panama, the Cartagena meeting marks the start of an era of heightened United States involvement in Latin America to fight drugs. United States efforts in the Upper Huallaga Valley provide an indication of what - if anything - the country can hope to achieve in halting the flow of cocaine at its source.
FOR JOURNALISTS INTENT on visiting the base in Santa Lucia, there's only one way to go - the United States Embassy's one-day, no-nights group tour. The package includes transportation from Lima (a C-130 cargo plane), guest lectures (featuring the head of the embassy's narcotics assistance unit), and plenty of good photo opportunities. A tireless tour guide, supplied by the United States Information Service, helpfully corrects any misapprehensions a visitor might form.
As we step off the C-130, ominous, low-lying clouds are rolling in, darkening the surrounding vegetation and lending the base itself an eerie, spectral cast. Clumps of Peruvian anti-narcotics policemen emerge from the mist, their AK-47 rifles perched on their shoulders.
We're packed into trucks and whisked to the end of the runway, where we suddenly find ourselves on the banks of the sluggish, muddy Huallaga. In a big hollowed-out pit stands a pick-up truck, loading up with earth. The Huallaga, we're told, has been diverted in order to create a source of gravel for the runway. In waging the drug war, the United States has altered the river's very course.
We climb back into the trucks and are driven to a small patch of coca - all that remains of the coca farms that flourished here before 1987, when the Government began operation of the base. Today, the grove serves as a ''demonstration plot.'' We are encouraged to wade in and break off a souvenir. Seen up close, the infamous plant - about four feet tall, with bright green leaves and red berries - appears rather innocuous, a plain, untrimmed woodland bush.
A Peruvian worker appears, clutching a whirring, long-stemmed instrument. It's a John Deere gas-powered, heavy-duty weed-cutter. The man moves briskly into the thicket, and, like a suburbanite trimming the hedges, effortlessly slices through the rows of sturdy shrubs.
The gardener is a member of the Special Project for Control and Eradication of Coca in the Upper Huallaga - Corah, for short. Corah was created by the State Department, which provides its annual budget. American officials maintain that, with John Deere's assistance, Corah's 400 workers can raze more than 2,500 acres a month. ''Spread out over 12 months, that could take out a big chunk of the crop,'' one official says.
But the program has encountered problems. Eradication is not popular with the area's farmers. Since 1982, when Corah was set up, nearly 40 of its workers have been killed in the line of duty. Most have fallen victim to the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), the fanatically Maoist guerrilla group that seeks to inflict on Peru a Chinese-style Cultural Revolution. The Upper Huallaga Valley has become Sendero's chief stronghold, and coca its primary means of support.
A year ago, the attacks on the coca cutters became so intense that the United States had to suspend the program, and Corah members were put to work building the runway at Santa Lucia. Today, they are virtual prisoners of the base, reduced to waiting for tour groups like ours to come by so that they can practice their coca-cutting craft. No date has been set for resuming the program.
It's lunchtime. We're led to the officers' mess, a small, functional building with screened windows and long wooden tables, where we find a handful of D.E.A. agents, pilots, and ex-Special Forces members. Over beef stew, cornmeal gruel and salad, we ask the Americans what it's like to live in this remote outpost, with guerrillas and traffickers just beyond the barbed wire. They're not saying, though; presumably, they've been instructed not to talk to us about anything substantive. We end up discussing sports and the weather. ''When's Connie Chung coming down here?'' asks one laconic pilot.
After lunch, we board helicopters for a visit to a laboratory recently raided by the D.E.A. Destroying labs is the D.E.A.'s chief mission in the Upper Huallaga. If enough labs are destroyed - so the theory goes - the price of coca will fall and farmers, already worried about the threat of eradication, will give up growing the plant and cultivate something else.
The Hueys are very roomy, easily accommodating eight journalists, two pilots and a D.E.A. agent armed with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, a jungle knife and 400 rounds of ammunition. Only a few minutes from the base we see the first rectangle of coca, its light-green leaves standing out clearly from the surrounding palms, cornfields and forest. Soon the plant is everywhere, climbing like a weed up the steep hillsides.
Twenty minutes out of Santa Lucia, we reach the lab. The jungle canopy is so thick that we have to make four passes over the site before we can make out the shiny metallic structure. Unfortunately, we can't touch down - too dangerous.
Even from several hundred feet, though, one can see what the D.E.A. agents are up against. Though this had been a big lab - complete with filter racks, drying tables, generators, even a kitchen -it was well hidden from view. When the agents stormed off their helicopters, they found a lot of chemicals but no coca paste, and no traffickers. The noise of the helicopters had given those working there plenty of time to flee.
During 1988, the D.E.A. destroyed 75 labs and seized 5,900 kilos of base - impressive, until measured against the valley's output, believed to be one million kilos of base every year. ''The Huallaga Valley is three times the size of El Salvador,'' notes an American military officer in Peru, ''and the United States has only eight helicopters to patrol it.''
Most officials at the United States Embassy recognize that, short of sending in the 82d Airborne - something Peru would never tolerate - there's a limit to what the United States can accomplish in the Huallaga. As this reality has sunk in, American officials have increasingly pinned their hopes on the one institution they think could make a difference in the drug war: the Peruvian military.
In Washington's view, the military could help in a variety of ways. Peruvian soldiers could inspect the traffic on the Huallaga's main highway, currently a caravan of coca paste. They could track the cartel's airplanes as they fly in from Colombia, then seize them while they're on the ground. And they could help protect D.E.A. agents and Corah workers as they attack the local drug trade.
Peru's generals, however, have long resisted getting involved in the war on drugs. For them, the real war is the one against the Sendero Luminoso - a conflict that has claimed 15,000 lives over the last 10 years. Anything that might divert men and materiel from that conflict is stoutly opposed. In Peru (as in the United States) drug trafficking has always been viewed as a law-enforcement matter and, thus, better left to the police. Unfortunately, Peru's police have proved hopelessly corrupt and inept, frequently joining with the traffickers to plunder coca growers.
So, in recent months, the United States Embassy has been trying to persuade the Peruvian military to get involved in the anti-drug effort, says a senior United States official in Peru, adding, ''Much of the leadership of the Peruvian armed forces agrees with this.''
In fact, it's not quite that simple, as I learned when I visited Tarapoto, a town 70 miles north of Santa Lucia.
ONE WARM AFTERNOON, about 75 rice and corn growers have gathered in the Casa Campesina, an airy warehouselike building on an unpaved street in Tarapoto. For four months they have been waiting for the state's marketing agencies to pay them for their crops, but still the money has not come. Things were getting desperate, and a regional farmers' union had proposed a 20-day strike in which farmers would block all traffic on the main highway. It would be a provocative act, sure to spark violence, and the farmers were now meeting to decide whether to proceed.
As they milled about in front of the hall, a green army jeep pulled up. Out stepped Gen. Alberto Arciniega, the commander of Peru's Security Subzone No. 8. At the age of 48, the general has a smooth, unlined face, a neatly trimmed mustache and thinning dark hair; although of medium height, he gains added presence from his erect military carriage and a gold-plated walking stick that he grasps in his left hand. Having heard about the proposed strike, Arciniega had come to offer his views. Moving toward the entrance, he stopped to banter with a few peasants, then strode inside and took a seat at the raised table in front.
Until December, General Arciniega was the top commander in the Upper Huallaga Valley. His headquarters was about 10 miles from Santa Lucia, in the town of Uchiza - which also happens to be the hub of Peru's drug trade. For months, United States officials had implored Arciniega to move against the traffickers. In October, Gen. Maxwell Thurman, commander of the United States Southern Command in Panama, met with Arciniega at Santa Lucia and urged him to get involved. But the general declined.
Incensed, United States Embassy officials, with the D.E.A. in the forefront, tried to get Arciniega removed from his post. In Washington, Melvyn Levitsky, the assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters, appeared before a Senate subcommittee and criticized the general for failing to protect Corah eradication teams and for preventing the Peruvian police from entering areas under his control. Levitsky went on to mention ''reports'' that Arciniega was ''taking payoffs from traffickers.''
At the Casa Campesina, Arciniega sat impassively as Segundo Centurion, a leading peasant organizer, made an impassioned plea for the strike. ''Ninety percent of the peasants in the region are growing coca,'' said Centurion, his voice tight with anger. ''This may be a 'crime,' but the Government's agrarian policy has forced them into it.'' It was now time for action, he said, adding, ''Nothing is going to keep us quiet in the search for social justice.'' The peasants applauded loudly.
Rising to his feet, Arciniega fixed the peasants with a stern look. ''I'm the son of a campesino,'' he declared in a booming voice. ''I know what it means to work in the countryside.'' Nonetheless, the general went on, he would not permit a strike. Local elections were coming up, and the guerrillas were trying to disrupt them. A strike would only help their cause. ''We must remain united to prevent this destruction of the country,'' Arciniega asserted.
Arciniega spoke in quick, excitable bursts, managing to sound both populist and imperious. By the time he turned to the subject of coca, he was shouting. ''Officials of the United States Government call the coca growers drug traffickers,'' he bellowed. ''They even say that I, General Arciniega, am a drug trafficker. They say this because I think of the real needs of my people - because I support the campesino.''
The general spoke with pride about his efforts to encourage farmers to shift from coca to yucca, cocoa and other food crops. Such a strategy, he said, was much more effective than simply treating coca growers like criminals and eradicating their fields. ''To be a drug trafficker and a coca grower are two different things,'' Arciniega declared. ''I want to attack the coca problem - but not by attacking the campesino.''
As the general walked briskly to his jeep, he invited me, along with two Peruvian journalists, to come along with him. We drove to the army barracks on the edge of town and entered the general's quarters, a spare-looking bungalow with a worn vinyl floor and naked overhead bulb. Changing his uniform shirt for an army-green T-shirt, Arciniega sat down in a plastic rocking chair and poured a round of beers, the first of many.
''These U.S. officials fly up to Santa Lucia for a four-hour tour and think they know everything about Peru,'' he said, making no effort to hide his contempt. ''The coca problem is so great, the Americans need someone like me to serve as a scapegoat. It's easier to destroy General Arciniega than to change the situation.''
It was around midnight when Arciniega, still going strong, took out a fifth of 12-year-old Ballantine's Scotch. Several of his officers joined us around the table, and the general kept refilling our glasses while continuing his monologue, punctuating each point with a ''Salud'' and a sip.
A bottle of Ballantine's goes for $30 in Tarapoto, and its sudden appearance at the general's table inevitably brought to mind the State Department's corruption charges. It is well known in the valley that small planes regularly touch down at the municipal airport in Uchiza - seat of the general's headquarters - take on coca paste and fly out again, all under the watchful gaze of military officers. According to some townspeople, the ''fee'' for the airport's services ranges up to $15,000 a flight, and is divided between the officers and the local town council. Though it has not been shown that the general himself has profited, it seems clear that the men under his command have reached some sort of accommodation with the traffickers.
As soon as the issue is raised, Arciniega grows indignant. ''Madness,'' he calls the charges, demanding that the State Department produce evidence. Until it does, Arciniega has little time for the matter. ''The Americans think that all I have to worry about is fighting the drug traffickers,'' he told me. ''In fact, as political-military commander of the zone, I have 20,000 different problems, only one of which is drug trafficking.''
By far the greatest of those problems, he said, is the Sendero Luminoso. Coca is Sendero's lifeblood. The guerrillas have protected the growers and make sure they receive a good price for their crop; in return, Sendero has levied a 5 to 15 percent ''tax'' on the earnings. They also charge the traffickers up to $15,000 for each flight into the region. All told, the insurgents have been earning perhaps $30 million a year from coca, enabling them to spread their operations throughout Peru.
Eliminating coca, then, could help eliminate Sendero. But in Arciniega's view, eradication is not the answer. ''There are 150,000 campesinos cocaleros'' - coca-growing peasants - ''in the zone,'' he said. ''Each of them is a potential subversivo. Eradicate his field and the next day he'll be one.'' The Corah units ''come with 200 workers, uproot the campesino's plant - and leave him nothing! He becomes a criminal. And who protects him? Sendero!'' The key to beating the guerrillas, the general said, was to win over the peasant, thereby depriving Sendero of its base. Eradication could help convince growers to get off coca - but only if it was tied to a crop-substitution program.
Earlier this year, Arciniega raised the idea with United States officials of setting aside 10,000 acres of land near Santa Lucia and putting farmers to work on it growing oil-bearing palm trees; Corah would have provided the necessary technical expertise. But, he says, the Americans weren't interested. ''It's a myth,'' says one United States official, ''that all of these coca growers are traditional peasants whose land is being despoiled by eradication, and that this will drive them into the arms of the insurgents.''
In that official's view, the growers are mostly unemployed people from big cities who've migrated to the Upper Huallaga to make some money. If their farms are destroyed, he says, ''We're not at all certain they'll go into the hands of Sendero Luminoso. More likely, they'll go to Cuzco,'' a city in the mountains hundreds of miles to the south. General Arciniega sees the growers as humble peasants struggling to scratch out a living; at the United States Embassy in Lima, officials have coined their own term for them - ''gold rushers.''
IN THE RUGGED COUNTRYSIDE around Tarapoto, hundreds of columns of smoke rise into the air, each marking a new field being burnt into the forest. Tarapoto was until recently a sleepy farm town, its residents dependent mostly on rice and corn.
Today, the area is in full bloom. Almost everyone is growing at least some coca. Dollars, once scarce in Tarapoto, now circulate widely, and the town is experiencing a modest building boom, with several hotels under construction. Prices are rising steadily, and so is the crime rate.
Why the rush into coca? In many respects, it is a ''miracle'' crop. It will grow almost anywhere with a minimum of attention. Highly resistant to disease, it requires no insecticides and little fertilizer. And it produces three or four harvests a year, compared to only two for rice and corn. Finally, and most important, a peasant can earn up to $1,000 an acre of coca - several times the return on other crops.
Yet many of Tarapoto's growers have turned to coca only reluctantly. ''Coca brings a lot of money, but it also brings a lot of danger and suffering,'' explains Julio Garcia Pineda, a soft-spoken 68-year-old peasant leader. Coca growers, he says, ''live in constant terror and fear'' - fear of the police, who steal money, farm animals and coca paste; fear of the traffickers, who force the peasants into debt and kill those who can't repay. Most campesinos, says Garcia, turn to coca ''only because they are hungry.''
Garcia was speaking on the main floor of the Banco Agrario, the state-controlled institution where most of Tarapoto's campesinos do business. The place was mobbed with concerned rice and corn growers seeking to postpone the deadlines for repaying their loans. For four months the Government had failed to pay the farmers for their crops, yet now their loans were coming due - at an annual interest rate of 1,350 percent.
The mood in Tarapoto had grown militant. About 100 farmers had taken over the offices of the Government's rice-marketing board, vowing not to leave until they were paid for their crops. On walls around town graffiti were springing up - ''Che Lives'' and ''Justice Begins for the Rich'' - presumably put there by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, another Peruvian guerrilla group that is rapidly gaining recruits in the northern part of the valley.
''If campesinos get involved with coca, it's because the Government has abandoned them,'' said a farmer standing outside the Casa Campesina. ''I don't want to grow coca, but I have no alternative,'' said another man. ''I can't survive any other way.''
Neither farmer had been paid by the Government in four months. By contrast, at coca harvest time, the traffickers show up like clockwork to buy the leaves - and they pay in cash.
''A REALLY INTELLIGENT anti-narcotics program for the United States would be to buy the rice and corn of our farmers, and to pay a price competitive with coca,'' General Arciniega told me during our conversation. ''If the United States had a sincere interest in solving Peru's coca problem, it would invest in the Upper Huallaga Valley and help develop it.'' How much money would be needed? ''About $3 billion,'' the general said.
This year, Washington is sending Peru $110 million in aid. That's more than twice as much as last year, but most of it will go for security-related items - fuel for helicopters, weapons for drug fighters, reinforcements for Santa Lucia, supplies for the Peruvian military. The Administration has allotted only $3.1 million for economic assistance. That sum is expected to rise considerably next year, but many remain skeptical that this will make much difference.
''Even if we spend $500 million, we're not going to get Peruvians to stop growing coca,'' says one United States official. ''With that sum, I could pave the Upper Huallaga over, but they'd simply move over to the next valley.''
The reason, he says, is the desperate state of Peru's economy. Guerrilla sabotage, together with gross Government mismanagement, has devastated the country, shrinking the country's gross national product by 20 percent in a year, causing unemployment to soar and pushing inflation to near 3,000 percent. Given this, the Americans argue, any development aid would simply be wasted. The only hope, they maintain, is to drive down the price farmers receive for their crops - and that means destroying more labs.
IN DECEMBER, AMERICAN OFFICIALS were buoyed by the reassignment of General Arciniega, who was transferred - in a scheduled rotation - to a high-level position at the Ministry of Defense. United States Embassy officials are hoping that his successor, Gen. Luis Chacon, will prove more helpful. ''We will see greater cooperation in narcotics control as a result of our negotiations with the Peruvian Government,'' says a senior official in Peru.
He may be disappointed. ''The problem is not Arciniega,'' concedes another United States official. ''President Garcia knew what he was doing. His Government approved of it.''
Indeed, Arciniega has become something of a celebrity in Peru. The Peruvian press has portrayed him as a fervent nationalist, and in the Upper Huallaga itself he is seen as a sort of Robin Hood, putting his career on the line to help the lowly campesino.
This has left United States officials shaking their heads. How could a general accused of corruption be admired, applauded, and patted on the back by his own Government? The answer became apparent to me while accompanying Arciniega on one of his tours of the valley. The destination was Rioja, about 60 miles from Tarapoto. Though he hadn't notified the town of his visit, Arciniega had his Bell 212 helicopter circle it three times - a calling card of sorts.
By the time we finally touched down, the Mayor and a half-dozen town elders had appeared on the tarmac. We repaired to a thatched restaurant, where, over endless rounds of beer and some cold salted fish, the general listened to a lengthy recitation of local woes. The town's electric generator was near collapse. The roads were in appalling condition. And, on top of it all, the Tupac Amaru guerrillas had just made their first appearance in town.
After listening to this, a distracted Arciniega said feebly that there was little he could do to help. Finally, he mentioned what was bothering him: the State Department's corruption charges. Immediately, the Mayor, a rotund, self-assured man named Alfonso Alva Gonzales, stood up and, glass raised, offered a toast.
''If someone has smeared the image of the general,'' he said, ''it is my responsibility as the Mayor of Rioja to affirm the friendship that our citizens feel for you. We all are happy because of the concern you, as military commander, have shown for us.''
The Mayor went on in this vein for several minutes, laying it on a bit thick - Rioja did need help with its generator - but his remarks seemed heartfelt, and, after everyone had applauded, the general was back to his normal cocky self. Clearly, the citizens of Rioja had far too much on their minds to worry about whether a brigadier general was on the take.
Much the same could be said for Peru as a whole. In Lima these days there are lines for sugar, rice, cooking oil - even bread. One week, the Government did not have enough funds to pay its employees.
In such times, the war on cocaine seems a low priority. As Peru's presidential campaign heats up before the April elections, the candidates have clashed furiously on virtually every subject - except drugs. At a time when American officials seem to be embracing the drug war in place of the cold war as the axis of American policy in the region, in Peru itself drugs are hardly an issue.
This is not surprising. Economically, coca is one of the country's few bright spots. The dollars earned from coca flow from the Huallaga directly onto the streets of Lima, where hundreds of informal money changers waving stacks of bills offer to change dollars for Peruvian intis. The changers are condoned by the Government, and everyone from businessmen to tourists uses them. This is Peru's real banking system, sustained almost entirely by coca dollars.
People like General Arciniega, then, may be living off the drug trade, but so is the rest of the country. ''Fighting the drug trade is suicide for us.'' says one Peruvian journalist.
It's hard to find a Peruvian with a kind word to say for the Bush Administration's approach to the drug problem. ''It seems that the U.S. plan does not plan for development,'' says Augustin Mantilla, the Minister of the Interior. As Peru's top cop, Mantilla is the closest thing the country has to a drug czar. And he is not happy with United States policy. Until the United States provides more economic aid, says Mantilla, all the money it spends on controlling drugs will be for naught. He cites the base at Santa Lucia as an example. Though not a bad idea in itself, says Mantilla, ''it will be more useful when there are development projects around it to defend.''
Already, though, the United States is looking beyond Santa Lucia. Peru's coca fields are expanding at a rate of 10 to 20 percent a year, much of it in areas previously untouched by the crop. Coca is being grown in eight different Peruvian river valleys. In one, the Urubamba, in eastern Peru, the coca crop may one day rival the Huallaga's.
The United States has planned its response. In 12 to 18 months, construction of a second base is to begin, near the Colombian border. As coca spreads, so will the rationale for other Santa Lucias. On this point a State Department official was quite clear. ''The bottom line,'' he said, ''is we're going to have to escalate.''

HEADLINE: REAL FOOD IN L.A.

BYLINE: By MACDONALD HARRIS; MacDonald Harris's novel ''Hemingway's Suitcase'' is forthcoming from Simon & Schuster.

 BODY:
The average person's notion of food in Los Angeles is that it's supermodern, trendy and eclectic. Like all cliches, this is largely true. There's a place on Melrose that serves Tex-Mex dim sum, and a favorite kind of sushi, with avocado, is called California maki. L.A., with its vista west to the Orient, its rich stew of immigrants, its diverse cultures, encourages strange mixtures and makes everything its own, while at the same time preserving individual flavors. Hawaiian papaya and New Zealand mussels rest together nicely in a Los Angeles salad.
Yet, often invisible to the visitor, there remain a handful of more traditional eating places, also typically L.A., that have been around since the 20's and before, and that still have a loyal following among residents who knew the town before the advent of nouvelle cuisine, carpaccio, goat cheese and the ''Califoriental'' style. 
I used to go to the Taix French Restaurant so long ago that I won't tell you when it was, but it was before World War II. In those days my parents often took me there for a Sunday dinner. Through imperfect memory, I see a glass door with lace curtains on Commercial Street, in downtown Los Angeles near the old Plaza, in a neighborhood of warehouses. Inside the door was a lady cashier dressed in black, just as in a provincial French restaurant, then the long room with two rows of tables for eight and a corridor down the middle. A ceiling of pressed tin, hanging lamps, a dark polished floor.
Taix was founded in the 20's by a family of French immigrants who had been sheepherders and bakers in the Hautes Alpes. Originally the property at 321 Commercial Street was a hotel. Marius Taix, who took over the management of the restaurant in 1927, was also a pharmacist, and he had an arrangement with a wine dealer in Oregon to supply ''medicinal wines'' to his business. This was handy for the restaurant; during Prohibition it was common to find city officials and even G-men enjoying a lunch with wine in the back room of the establishment. The food was plain French country cooking, plentiful and skillfully prepared; a full table d'hote meal of soup, salad, main course and fruit, with plenty of French bread, cost 50 cents in the mid-30's. By that time the place on Commercial Street had become a Los Angeles institution, popular with businessmen and salesmen at noon and with families at dinner. It lasted until the property was condemned in 1964 to make room for an office building.
But there still is a Taix. In 1962 the family opened another restaurant on Sunset Boulevard, and this is still operating, under the name Les Freres Taix. It's a little pocket of nostalgia for those old enough to have known the original Taix, and it's still a good place to get a moderately priced French dinner.
Les Freres Taix is not on the fashionable part of Sunset; it's in the Echo Park district, in a neighborhood ranging from faded elegance to the dingy. The large, rambling building is in a style that might be described as Los Angeles Chalet; inside it seems a perfectly ordinary old-fashioned restaurant, with a shadowy interior lighted by lamps even in the daytime, carpeted floors, imitation-leather booths and stained-glass windows. But the ghost of the old place still lingers. The food is prepared with care and served with a certain elan. The meal starts with a large tureen of soup, as it did in the old place back in the 30's. The menu is anything but trendy - it features such hardy staples of French cookery as grilled chicken diable and duck a l'orange. The place is a memory machine for anyone who has ever eaten in a country restaurant in France. The Taix family is still in charge, and a good many of the customers, to judge from their white heads, come there because they still remember the former establishment.
Although Philippe, the Home of the Original French Dip Sandwich, has moved several times since its founding, it still offers one of the best food bargains in town, and a lot of atmosphere. Its founder, Philippe Mathieu, came to California from Southern France at the turn of the century. When he opened his first restaurant in 1908, he served all you could eat plus ''a pint of good claret wine'' for a quarter. In 1927, Philippe's was bought by Harry, Frank and Dave Martin, and it remains in their family today. In 1978, they decided to raise the price of coffee from a nickel to a dime, and that's still what it costs.
The present Philippe's is on Alameda Street, near the Union Station and Chinatown. It's a commercial district; Alameda is the kind of street that has railroad tracks running down it. The restaurant is a big nondescript masonry building painted tan and brown. Inside there is sawdust on the floor, and people sitting on stools are eating at long tables that will hold 12 or more. There are several dining rooms full of these tables, and a few booths, which are not used very much. As at the old Taix, you share your table with anybody who happens to sit down next to you. There is an air of camaraderie among the customers, a kind of unspoken friendliness and consideration that's rare in a big city; at our last visit a middle-aged Asian man moved with a smile when he suspected that his cigar was bothering us. The customers are people of all kinds: shoppers, residents of nearby Chinatown, businessmen, Amtrak workers from the station, people who have been coming here for years and are now bringing their children. More than any other place I can think of, Philippe's typifies the democratic spirit of Los Angeles, its lack of any true caste system, and the tendency of the rich not to want to lose touch with what the poor do.
The way the service works is unique. There is a long counter with 12 servers, each of them with everything she needs to prepare a meal. You get into one of the 12 lines, and when you reach your server she can take care of your whole lunch: make your sandwich or fix your hot dish, serve salads or soup, give you coffee or a glass of wine, add it all up and take your money. Except for the money, it's like Mother making you a lunch. The plates are paper, the other service is crockery. There are ceiling fans, a collection of neon beer signs and a history of the restaurant in faded press clippings framed on the wall. You can make yourself at home. If you want, you can just get a beer and sit drinking it and talking to a friend at one of the long tables.
Philippe's invented the French Dip Sandwich, and whether or not this was a great contribution to international cuisine, it's the feature of the place and many people are fond of it, perhaps out of nostalgia. The recipe: slice a French roll lengthwise, pile a generous portion of meat on the lower half and, with a fork, submerge the upper half in the sauce, the drippings from roast beef. That's all there is to it. Beef is the meat that works best, although at Philippe's you can also get ham, turkey, pork and lamb. In 1935, in the middle of the Depression, the French Dip Sandwich cost a dime; a few years later they raised it to a quarter. Now it costs $3.10. Philippe's claims to deal with 3,000 customers a day, and you can see why. I was introduced to the place by my father, who used to go there in the 30's when he was a salesman for a steel company. Most older L.A. residents have a similar story to tell.
Another restaurant that was bequeathed to me by my parents is Clifton's Cafeteria, on Broadway near Seventh. It was founded in 1935, and it's still there in the same place, exactly as it has always been. In the 30's, Broadway was the center of the L.A. shopping district and the home of the fashionable department stores, Bullock's, the May Company and the Broadway. Today it's simply a big stirring-pot of all the ethnic populations of Los Angeles. The people on the street are just about in the proportions of the whole population of the city: Anglo, Hispanic, black and others. It's a garish, colorful, popular thoroughfare, a combination of a Mexican paseo, Times Square and Main Street, U.S.A.
The sidewalk in front of the cafeteria is packed with people and the street is full of buses nose to nose; many patrons of Clifton's don't own cars. Inside, the main dining room is a simulated Alpine valley; there are murals of redwoods and other forest scenes, artificial boulders, granite cliffs and redwood trunks, an alpine chapel and a real running brook with a waterfall. The tables are installed on terraces running almost to the top of this forest. (There is also seating at floor level, but a sign suggests that you leave it to those who can't climb stairs.) Above the Alpine valley there are two more floors of dining rooms. The top floor is decorated with a kind of naive bordello elegance, with red carpets, white classic columns and red-and-gold brocade on the walls. Clifton's offers a feast for the eyes as well as for the stomach.
At the rear of the main floor is the serving area. There are three identical lanes for cafeteria service. The popular items are meat and gravy, chicken-fried steaks, Southern fried chicken, turkey with dressing, short ribs and fried fish. And the trimmings: mashed potatoes, roast potatoes, rice, all kinds of vegetables, old-fashioned biscuits and the usual pies and cakes. If Philippe's is what Mother gave you for lunch, Clifton's is what you got when you visited Grandmother at the farm. The prices are reasonable, not to say cheap. The weekday special, ''chopped beef patty'' with mashed potatoes and vegetable, is $2.39. Tradition has it that Clifton's has never turned away anyone who was hungry and didn't have the money for a meal. I don't know anybody who has tested this policy, but it's still officially in effect.
You can't get a free meal at Musso & Frank, no matter how hungry you are, but it's still a nostalgic, modest and very popular place. Its Hollywood Boulevard setting, like downtown Broadway, has declined with the years. Once it was the center and showpiece of the international film world, hinged on the pivot of Graumann's Chinese Theater, where every important movie was premiered. The Chinese Theater is still there, now called Mann's, but the rest of Hollywood Boulevard is a tacky collection of record stores, souvenir stands, sex shops and stores offering far-out clothing. The Musso & Frank Grill was founded in 1919; it's the oldest restaurant in Hollywood. It's also the last restaurant in L.A., probably in the world, to serve chicken a la king.
While Hollywood Boulevard has changed, Musso's has stayed the same. The interior is dark and soothing after the garish hubbub of the street outside. There is an air of faded gentility about the place, insofar as Hollywood understands this quality. Each dark wood booth has its hatrack, even though nobody in Los Angeles has worn a hat for years. The waiters are in red jackets and bow ties, and the busboys are in green jackets. Musso's claims that its chef, Michel Bourger, is ''from Paris, France,'' and he probably is. People have been making deals here, trying to persuade producers of their talents and discussing ideas for scripts, since the 20's.
Today the clientele is varied; there are a few movie types, or people who wish to be taken for such, but the others are families, young West L.A. marrieds, tourists and oldsters (you can't call them seniors because they look too affluent for that). In the booth next to us was a Russian-American would-be actress and her grandmother visiting from the Soviet Union. This became apparent from the loud comments and compliments of the waiter, who was perhaps Russian himself. It's a good place for young women to take their grandmothers; there were several others.
The menu is pre-war, and the prices are just adjusted a little for inflation. On our recent visit, one of us had squab with bacon, and the other Welsh rarebit, a specialty of Musso's, one of the cheapest things on the menu, and one of the best - tangy and rich, and there's a dish with more sauce on the side. There are other gustatory fossils: shrimp Louie, crab Louie and stuffed tomato with crab. If you want anything green at Musso's, you'd better order it separately; the squab comes with nothing but french fries and a sprig of parsley. There is nothing whatsoever in this menu that could not be 1937, except the wine list; we got a nice California chablis for $10. If you want to find Musso's, it's opposite the star for John Barrymore in the sidewalk.
Will Rogers never heard of goat cheese, carpaccio or sushi, and if he had he wouldn't have touched them. He is one of the patron saints of the Polo Lounge, in the Beverly Hills Hotel on Sunset Boulevard. This is the expensive part of Sunset, not the Echo Park stretch where Taix ended up after it moved from downtown. Back in the 20's, the hotel had a cafe called El Jardin. Will Rogers used to have lunch there with Darryl F. Zanuck and Tommy Hitchcock; since all three were avid polo players, they persuaded the hotel to change the name of the place to the Polo Lounge. There are no polo accoutrements in it today, but it does look like the Mexican garden of its original name. It consists of a meandering set of rooms around a patio, with an ancient and gnarled Brazilian pepper tree as its centerpiece, as contorted as something in the Walt Disney movie ''Fantasia.''
Sunday brunch is a nice time to visit the Polo Lounge. The price is $27 - not Clifton's, but not outrageous. There is live mariachi music, and a trendy crowd, all talking fast. Young affluent families, the men in French jeans and leather jackets, the women in leisure high fashion, the children in designer children's clothes; undoubtedly they go to the best private schools. Magnate types, chic women, Jaguar bohemians, women of a certain age who look astonished because they have had too many face lifts. The rooms around the patio are green and white, with pink tablecloths. Outside, the patio furniture is partly green and partly pink. Both the patio and the inside rooms are crowded; the servers and the mariachis can hardly get around and past one another to do their respective jobs.
The service is a little slow. There was no soup spoon with the vichyssoise and we had to ask for it. The brunch courses are: a champagne cocktail, an hors d'oeuvre, an entree, a selection from the pastry tray and coffee. The food is now ''California French'' - decorative vegetable garnishes in Kandinsky-like patterns, coulis in geometric swirls, Norwegian salmon substituted for the ham in the eggs benedict. There is also an a la carte menu; at the table next to us a girl in a Stanford sweat shirt, with her parents, was having a hamburger ($12) with fries and ketchup. (If you want a cheeseburger, it comes with roquefort and costs $13.) The coffee is not 10 cents. There are no Chinatown residents or Amtrak workers. These people lack the bonhomie of the customers of Philippe's, but they have something else: they radiate power. Yet I suspect that some of them occasionally have a weekday lunch at Philippe's. That would be consistent with Los Angeles as I know it. The regular customers at Philippe's, however, do not occasionally have brunch at the Polo Lounge.

PARTING WITH ILLUSIONS
By Vladimir Pozner.
324 pp. New York:
The Atlantic Monthly Press.
$19.95.
Maybe you have seen Vladimir Pozner on ''Nightline'' or ''Donahue.'' Born in France and raised in the United States, he made his career in the Soviet Union as an unaccented American voice on Radio Moscow's North American service and lately has been gracing American television, expounding on this and that. 
''Parting With Illusions'' purports to be an account of his life. He spent the World War II years in New York, where he attended Stuyvesant High School. In 1952, when he was 18, he was taken to what would become his motherland by his Russian-born father, ''a staunch supporter of socialism and of the Soviet Union'' who wanted to get away from the anti-Communism of the 1950's.
As autobiography, ''Parting With Illusions'' is not compelling; the self-revelation is entirely inadvertent. There is some sharp gossip about the way midlevel apparatchiks in Soviet journalism get ahead or get left behind, but Mr. Pozner is more interested in his own role as a liberally inclined party man who knows the best and the worst of both the Soviet Union and the United States from personal experience, and wants nothing more than to share his insights with an American audience.
Although Mr. Pozner speaks New York English, his writing has a strong accent of the Popular Front circa 1936, when Communist Party members in the United States were intent on proving that they were 200 percent American. Here he is on ''the America that means so much to me'': ''Tom Paine and Thomas Jefferson and Abe Lincoln. And the great songs of America that celebrated John Henry, Joe Hill, Jesse James, Frankie and Johnnie, and hundreds of nameless others. And the people who sang them - Woody Guthrie, Leadbelly, Pete Seeger, Billy Holiday, Bessie Smith. And the Declaration of Independence and the Boston Tea Party.'' And Irish cops and a black maid and baseball. Fans of the letters of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg will enjoy this book.
Homage to the Popular Front also takes the form of adjusting facts to suit desires. He writes of the execution in 1927 of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, the case that brought a decade of liberals and radicals into the streets: ''Today we know they were framed; the state of Massachusetts has acknowledged their innocence.'' Although the admirable proclamation by Gov. Michael A. Dukakis in 1977 apologized for some aspects of the Sacco-Vanzetti trial, it made no acknowledgment of their innocence. Mr. Pozner also is taken with the idea that the murders of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. were part of conspiracies.
The big difference between Mr. Pozner today and the Popular Frontniks of yesterday is that he criticizes Joseph Stalin. If he had done that within the hearing of the people who ran the progressive Greenwich Village school he attended as a boy, he would have been blackballed as a redbaiter. Times have changed, and Mr. Pozner has changed with them. He apologizes now for having supported the arrest and exiling of Andrei D. Sakharov in 1980. He has no kind words now for Leonid I. Brezhnev, under whose regime he built his career. However, he has nothing bad to say about Mikhail S. Gorbachev, now presiding.
Mr. Pozner does not claim to have been a premature anti-Stalinist, only a loyal citizen who (while not uttering anything that might get him into trouble) refused to speak what he did not believe. He is critical of those who left their motherland when he was trying to improve it from within. Defectors, he writes, ''became pawns in a political game and, as such, did far more harm to their country than good.'' Take that, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Andrei Sinyavsky, Joseph Brodsky, Vladimir Voinovich.
The persistent theme of ''Parting With Illusions'' and the line that Mr. Pozner purveys on ''Nightline'' is how much the United States and the Soviet Union have in common: ''When people ask me, 'How do you know, how can you guarantee, that you won't have another Stalin?' I ask, in turn, 'How do you know, how can you guarantee, there won't be another Joe McCarthy in America? Or even a fascist dictatorship?' ''
Readers bowled over by that reasoning will also be impressed by the even-handed treatment of the K.G.B. and the C.I.A., the news that artists face similar problems under Communism and under capitalism and the analysis of the Berlin Wall: ''It solved the problem of economic drain, but it created a far greater and much more difficult problem, both in terms of how it affected Germans on the inside of that wall and the kind of ammunition it provided for anticommunist ideologues all over the world. Extremism at its worst.''
Mr. Pozner is annoyed that some in the West ''have branded me a propagandist.'' He attributes that slander to malicious or mindless anti-Communism and hopes that when Americans come to see him ''as a normal, authentic, honest person, an honest Soviet,'' they will begin to question America's military spending, the cold war and anti-Communism. He asks: ''How many Americans have ever met - let alone know well - a single communist?'' Tell it to the Romanians, Comrade.

COSMOPOLIS
The Hidden Agenda of Modernity.
By Stephen Toulmin.
228 pp. New York: The Free Press. $22.95.
 
THE LYOTARD READER
By Jean-Fran,cois Lyotard.

It is hard to imagine two more different manifestations of post-modernism than Stephen Toulmin's ''Cosmopolis'' and the Jean-Francois Lyotard ''Reader.'' The analytic philosopher turned historian of ideas and the nouveau philosophe both examine the shift away from modernism. But whereas Mr. Lyotard explores ''the great narrative of the decline of great narratives'' through eloquent delvings and sightings, Mr. Toulmin, like a professorial Cecil B. De Mille, telescopes the past 400 years of intellectual history into a whopper of a story. 
''Cosmopolis'' is a popularization. Without proper footnotes, quotations or detailed research, it risks everything on its argument, and that argument, coming from such a respected scholar, is surprisingly naive. Mr. Toulmin, the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities at Northwestern University, tilts at what he terms the ''standard account,'' which fixes the origin of modernity in the 17th century with Descartes and Galileo. His radical counterclaim is that modernity begins with the Renaissance. Those of us who have always assumed that the Renaissance and the advent of modernity were synonymous - that is, most humanists above the freshman level - will be surprised to find that it is not the triumph of the European vernaculars, the revival of classical learning, the rise of centralized monarchies or the instituting of such devices of realism as the perspective established by Leon Battista Alberti that characterizes Renaissance modernism. Mr. Toulmin instead finds in the Renaissance a political moderation and a relaxed acceptance of diversity, indeterminacy and difference of opinion. His chief exhibits are Montaigne, who wrote with equal passion about digestive noises, sex and God, and Henry of Navarre (King Henry IV of France), who advocated religious tolerance and was assassinated by an extremist for his trouble.
Though the persecution of Roman Catholics and Protestants in England during the supposedly tolerant 16th century escapes Mr. Toulmin's contextualist scrutiny, he is at pains to describe the importance of Henry's murder. He compares this symbolic defeat of moderation to John F. Kennedy's assassination. The young Descartes - who may have written a sonnet celebrating the deposit of Henry's heart in the college of La Fleche, but then again may not have done - must have been haunted by disorder, Mr. Toulmin opines, for he set out to eradicate skepticism and discover a secure foundation for knowledge. He and his contemporaries responded to economic and political insecurity by elaborating a universally valid, unchanging, logically based system for the human and natural worlds - a cosmopolis - whose secret agenda was the legitimizing of an aristocratic, paternalistic political system. In this way, true modernity was suppressed for over 300 years.
By 1910, the Enlightenment, the novel, Darwin, Freud and Einstein had prepared the way for a return to tolerance and indeterminacy. But the stubborn nation-states had one last hurrah. Pitching the world into war, they reactivated the rationalist terror of disorder. Philosophy and the arts responded with a formalism that outdid even the 17th century, Mr. Toulmin claims, and it was not until the 1960's that the relativism of the Renaissance returned. This constitutes what people now call post-modernity. We are thus living out the original meaning of modernity as nationalism, sexism, formalism and environmental insensitivity fade into the rationalist past.
There is a certain loony eclat in claiming that 20th-century modernism is a conservative regression. But the degree of counterintuitive thinking required to sustain Mr. Toulmin's story finally sinks it. To see the esthetic experiments of Surrealism, Constructivism, Abstractionism, Joycean syncretism, minimalism and so on as attempts to prop up a Cartesian quest for order and stability is perverse. The aim of this art was just the opposite: to create a cognitive vertigo, to overturn the time-honored hierarchies and orthodoxies of religion, convention and nationalism. The popular outrage at the avant-garde indicates just how disruptive it was seen to be. Though the shift from formalism to multiplicity and amplitude is a fair (if overly general) characterization of the passage from modernism to post-modernism, both periods have affinities with 16th-century humanism and 17th-century rationalism.
Finally, ''Cosmopolis'' is simply (or complexly) wrong. Its ''standard account'' of modernity is a straw man, and the claim that the 16th century comfortably tolerated diversity whereas the 17th century did not is unfounded. If Mr. Toulmin can cite John Donne's ''No man is an island'' to prove the 17th century's dismay at the breakdown of social cohesion, one can quite as easily point to the Renaissance horror at Richard III's ''I am I,'' an atomistic view echoed by most of Shakespeare's villains. And when Mr. Toulmin says that ''gender-discrimination (or sexism) became constitutive of the new [17th-century] state,'' he loses our confidence entirely, since sexism, like so many of the conservative ''developments'' he locates in the Cartesian moment, is characteristic of the Renaissance, and of the medieval and ancient worlds before it. Instead of a fairy-tale modernity imprisoned in a tower of reason for 350 years, we might accept the less dramatic view that a gradual dismantling of the medieval religious cosmopolis has been going on since the Renaissance and that its 20th-century state of decay has occasioned both disorientation and heady release.
Mr. Lyotard, a French philosopher who is now teaching at the University of California, Irvine, tells a more complicated and fragmented story. His essays range over Kant and Hegel, Freud, modern painting, cinema, feminism and the concept of the outsider. He writes at times like a Surrealist fantasist or a Heideggerian hairsplitter, a Derridean jokester or a Platonic dialogist. Reading his essays is like leaping into a mental maelstrom. And yet, with enough of these immersions, the vortex reveals wonderful currents of connection.
In ''The Tensor'' (1974), Mr. Lyotard distances himself from what Mr. Toulmin would consider a revival of 17th-century foundationalism, telling semioticians: ''You've remained rationalists . . . Westerners.'' But what would a nonrationalist philosophy be? Mr. Lyotard looks to the Freudian ''dream-work,'' which he describes as the interference of the figural, the visual, in language. The Jewish prohibition against graven images signals the unlawfulness of vision and desire. In this merging of philosophy, painting and Judaism, Mr. Lyotard provides a stirring glimpse of what a new philosophy might be.
These associations resurface in an excerpt from ''Le Mur du Pacifique'' (1979). There Mr. Lyotard begins with a painting, a nightmare of America as a castrater of blacks and a controller of women. This image is teased out to explore the meaning of the meteque - the outsider, in particular the Frenchman Jean-Francois Lyotard visiting at the University of California, San Diego. ''Associate Professor, don't think you come to facilitate criticism. . . . All your authors, all your assemblages of words, only reinforce this boundary, this frontier zone. . . . Come, rather, to lose your culture, to de-culture yourselves. . . . But now consider this: the centre itself is the true nomad.'' Full of intensity, wryness and paradox, ''Le Mur du Pacifique'' raises travel writing to a primary post-modern mode.
The outsider-scholar learns much from women. He says that the women's movement ''solicits and destroys the (masculine) belief in meta-statements independent of ordinary statements,'' and this derision is crucial in developing a philosophy of judgment rather than truth. In order to escape from the indeterminacy of the classical paradoxes (''I am lying'' is true if it is false and false if it is true), the philosopher of positive knowledge has been forced to distinguish between language about language and words in a speaker's concrete situation. The sphere of meta-statement is disembodied, formal, untouched by ethics. Mr. Lyotard wants to entail the speaker and the audience in the utterance, and so looks not to philosophical discourse but narration. ''We want a politics based upon narratives, which are social elements,'' he writes in ''Lessons in Paganism,'' ''and not upon knowledge, where the viri [males] are in their element.'' In an elegant exposition of the logic of the French philosopher Emmanuel Levinas, he concludes that ''the simplest prescription, instructively empty but pragmatically affirmative, at one stroke situates the one to whom it is addressed outside the universe of knowledge.'' It is this outsider sphere, beyond logical certainty but rooted in the concrete immediacy of speech, that Mr. Lyotard wishes philosophy to inhabit.
But this is art's habitat as well. Indeed, he contrasts the modernist Duchamp (with his ''Large Glass'' pointing to the future and his ''Etant Donnes'' to the past) with the post-modern Barnett Newman, painter of ''The Sublime Is Now.'' For Mr. Lyotard, the now ''is what dismantles consciousness, what deposes consciousness, it is what consciousness cannot formulate, and even what consciousness forgets in order to constitute itself. What we do not manage to formulate is that something happens.'' This fact is the basis for the theories of the sublime of Edmund Burke and Kant, for ''the sublime is kindled by the threat of nothing further happening.'' The avant-garde, which Mr. Lyotard traces from the sublime, tries to express the now of happening, ''to present the fact that there is an unpresentable.''
If Mr. Lyotard is sometimes too eager to equate post-modernism with the avant-garde - Gertrude Stein is his touchstone rather than the likes of Toni Morrison - he is unfailingly provocative. With his Poe-like titles (''Anamnesis of the Visible, or Candour'') and his deeply ethical sensibility, he creates a common ground between Gothic passion and intellectual responsibility. Dauntingly learned and intelligent, he turns philosophy toward the acts of address and obligation. And if our understanding sometimes threatens to sink into his maelstrom, this danger is itself sublime.

 BODY:

THE SURPRISE OF BURNING, by Michael Doane. (Ballantine, $4.95.) A war photographer and his mother, an aspiring singer with a heroin problem, find that both are instinctively drawn to history's great disasters. Michael Doane ''throws together pivotal events and archetypal characters from our nation's history to create a dazzling Jasper Johns-like construction,'' Michiko Kakutani said in The Times in 1988. ''This is a fine and powerful novel, a testament to this young writer's rich and maturing talents.''
 
SECOND CHANCES: Men, Women, and Children a Decade After Divorce, by Judith S. Wallerstein and Sandra Blakeslee. (Ticknor & Fields, $9.95.) After spending 15 years observing the remnants of 60 families split by divorce, the psychologist Judith S. Wallerstein found that feelings of trauma and betrayal were far more persistent than many people like to imagine. For want of a control group the study is ''merely adequate'' as social science, Carol Tavris said here last year. ''But as a work of clinical observation, the book is a beautiful piece of writing, full of insights that will prove indispensable to people contemplating divorce as a necessary evil, idealizing divorce as a cure-all for their woes, or living in its muddy aftermath.'' 
 
LOVE LIFE: Stories, by Bobbie Ann Mason. (Perennial/Harper & Row, $8.95.) Bobbie Ann Mason writes about modern country people who like to shop at K Mart and get their wisdom from the Phil Donahue show. ''Ms. Mason dips her pen in the same ink, over and over, because her knowledge of the landlocked Middle America she writes about - most of it centered in Kentucky and Tennessee - is endless and huge,'' Lorrie Moore said here last year. ''Each small story adds to the reader's apprehension of that hugeness.''
 
IN MY OWN FASHION, by Oleg Cassini. (Pocket Books, $5.95.) The playboy fashion designer who created the ''Jackie look'' recalls his romantic life. ''Lovers, conventional and otherwise, adorn the pages of his elegant and gossipy memoir,'' Molly Haskell said here in 1987. ''If his 370 pages of delicate indiscretions are not up to Casanova's morbidly fascinating 12 volumes, it may be the closest we'll ever get in an era short on stylish lovers.''
 
THE CAGE KEEPER AND OTHER STORIES, by Andre Dubus 3d. (Plume/New American Library, $7.95.) In one of these stories a father takes his stepchildren on a camping trip, then spends the whole time drunk. While the effects are sometimes strained, the author ''shares with his writer father a talent for delineating the everyday pathos of obscure, unglamorous lives,'' Deborah Solomon said here last year.
 
JOHN CHEEVER: A Biography, by Scott Donaldson. (Delta, $14.95.) When this biography was published in 1988, our reviewer, Lorrie Moore, said Scott Donaldson had gathered John Cheever's life ''into a kind of mad English garden of data through which lovers of Cheever's fiction may not be able to resist a stroll.''
 
LEILA: Further in the Life and Destinies of Darcy Dancer, Gentleman, by J. P. Donleavy. (Atlantic Monthly, $9.95.) In a series of sordid misadventures, J. P. Donleavy's seedy squire, Darcy Dancer, consorts with the lower classes, including the beautiful Leila, a housemaid at his crumbling Irish manor. ''Randiness is everywhere,'' Julian Moynahan said here in 1983. ''Not only does the quality make improper advances to the help and the help to each other but even animals get into the act or come close.'' The novel is a sequel to THE DESTINIES OF DARCY DANCER, GENTLEMAN ($9.95), also reissued by Atlantic Monthly.
 
SPARROWS POINT: Making Steel - The Rise and Ruin of American Industrial Might, by Mark Reutter. (Summit, $14.95.) A former reporter for The Baltimore Sun tells how the largest steel works in the world was set on the path to ruin when Bethlehem Steel decided to forgo modernization in favor of more familiar, obsolete technology. '' 'Sparrows Point' is an important reminder that adolescent experiences and bureaucratic careers can play as important a role in great business decisions as meticulous comparison of returns on investment,'' Charles F. Sabel said here last year.
 
THE ECONOMICS OF CHAOS: On Revitalizing the American Economy, by Eliot Janeway. (Truman Talley/Dutton, $12.95.) Among this economist's more offbeat recommendations is that the Treasury Department invest Social Security and other Government trust funds so aggressively that people in the underground economy will line up to pay their taxes and get a piece of the action. Last year our reviewer, Jeffrey E. Garten, said he found most of the suggestions unworkable but called the book ''a colorfully irreverent and passionate essay.''
 
REDWALL, by Brian Jacques. (Avon, $4.50.) In the abbey of Redwall, an ancient order of peace-loving mice is threatened by an army led by a one-eyed rat. This tale is ''artfully structured to rivet the attention of young readers and listeners,'' Selma Lanes said here in 1987. ''Mr. Jacques has woven an energetic, if somewhat simple-minded, fantasy on a refreshingly old-fashioned subject: the struggle between good and evil.''
 
MOSCOW STATION: How the KGB Penetrated the American Embassy, by Ronald Kessler. (Pocket Books, $4.95.) A journalist argues that the 1987 spy scandal at the American Embassy in Moscow was a more serious matter than the public has been led to believe. Last year our reviewer, David Wise, said Ronald Kessler sometimes stretches his evidence to accommodate his theories, but ''when he sticks to unearthing facts that the Government would rather suppress, Mr. Kessler is a first-rate ferret and an industrious interviewer.''

A MIDWIFE'S TALE
The Life of Martha Ballard,
Based on Her Diary, 1785-1812.
By Laurel Thatcher Ulrich.
Illustrated. 444 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $24.95.
The historian Charles A. Beard liked to distinguish between history and written history - the latter being that which appeared in history books, the former that which had actually happened. Martha Ballard's life will never enter the histories that tell the story of the United States or even those of Maine, where she spent most of her life. But her life, as Laurel Ulrich, a professor of history at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, has reconstructed it, opens an enlightening window onto those ''Hidden Ones,'' as Cotton Mather once called the pious women of New England. 
Martha Ballard spent most of her life in Hallowell, a town just below Augusta on the Kennebec River. For 27 of those years she kept a diary, the entries of which were so elliptical, even incoherent, that until Mrs. Ulrich came along, no one had found much use for the document. Each chapter begins with excerpts from the original diary, and what, after all, can one make out of entries like: ''At My Sons to see John who we were aprehensive was near the Close of life?'' Then the next day: ''At my sons. Tarried again this night.'' To decipher the entry it helps to know that Martha Ballard was not only a mother but a midwife, indeed the deliverer of two-thirds of the babies in the region, despite the presence of other midwives and two male physicians. Only with the additional and careful collating of entries in the diary and scores of other contemporary documents does the story come out - that John was an illegitimate child, fathered, fully acknowledged and financially supported by a leading judge of the town, who was already married, and that John's mother was closely related to Martha's son. That revelation gives Mrs. Ulrich the opportunity to place the event in the broader history of seductions, illegitimate births and the fates of unmarried mothers.
The hard life the midwife led, traveling through storm, snow and freezing cold, clambering up icy river banks to oversee as many as 50 births a year, was hardly typical for women of the time. Yet, thanks to Mrs. Ulrich's imaginative talent, Martha Ballard's diary becomes a major source through which we can vicariously experience the rural life of early New England and reimagine the character of men's and women's economic and family existence. We can also gain fresh and valuable information about the practice of midwifery, infant and maternal mortality, the life cycle of family work and folk medicine. The book even contains an appendix listing every plant medicine mentioned in the diary.
Typical of the hidden quality of women's lives in written history is that nowhere during her lifetime does Martha's name appear in town records except as Mrs. Ballard; even her minister misremembered her name as Dorothy. Only her obituary contained her true Christian name. And as Mrs. Ulrich suggests, that personal oblivion may be why Martha felt compelled to keep her careful record, on the front of which appears in bold print: ''Martha Ballard Her Diary.'' Yet this woman, unsung until now, oversaw the births of the babies of the ruling families as well as those of lowly lumbermen; even the baby of the local male doctor's sister was brought into the world by her hands. And for good reason: Martha's skill was such that the rate of maternal deaths during her career was considerably lower than that achieved in the United States as a whole as late as 1930.
The energy expended by this strong yet supportive woman can be gauged by her frequent travels and endless work. She went from house to house, sometimes delivering two or more babies within a 24-hour period in the dead of winter at homes miles apart with no sleep in between. She also toiled endlessly, what with combing flax, which she also grew herself; ceaseless weaving, cooking, gardening, visiting with other women; and providing meals and beds for visitors connected with her husband's surveying business. In a single year she housed 69 overnight guests and provided 95 meals to people not of her own family. Significantly, only six of the overnight visitors were women.
Fatiguing as Martha Ballard's activities sound - and the above list is abbreviated - they are not the heart of Mrs. Ulrich's book. That is in the picture of a community in action over time that Mrs. Ulrich creatively teases out of those elliptical entries. The women, as one might expect, led a life separate from that of the men, but they did not stay at home as Victorian women did. Late 18th-century women were ''gadders,'' as Mrs. Ulrich calls them, working in other women's houses, visiting much and comforting much.
As a working wife Martha Ballard traveled greater distances from home than most good wives, and she collected fees (and usually promptly) as they did not. But like other women, she also moved about, trading and bartering to vary her household larder, to obtain materials for her weaving and seeds and plants for her garden. Doing their work together in their homes made it possible for women to help each other and also to socialize. Husbands and wives, on the other hand, rarely went out together, though both, along with their children, were close partners in the family economy.
The home really began not with marriage, which was almost a non-event, but when the couple ''went to housekeeping,'' which might not be for a month or more after the prescribed and modest civil ceremony. Romance seemed to play less of a part in marriage than sex, inasmuch as 38 percent of the 814 birthings Martha Ballard attended were the result of extramarital conception. At one birth, the unmarried mother ''declard my Son Jonathan was the father of the child,'' Martha duly wrote in her diary. The law, after all, required that midwives obtain that information from an unmarried woman in labor, since the court needed it to save the town from having to support the bastard. (Son Jonathan did not marry the mother of his child until four months later.) Thus men too appear in the story, and in a variety of ways, for Mrs. Ulrich draws upon documents produced by men as well as women. And men's lives could be as demanding as Martha's. Ephraim, Martha's husband, at the age of 70 spent 59 days of a single year living in the woods while surveying. Yet what men wrote about often left a quite different picture of town affairs, politics and the economy than appear in Martha Ballard's often misspelled and oblique entries. Only a grandson named DeLafayette suggests that the country's recently achieved independence affected her family's consciousness, though politics and the new Constitution figure prominently in the contemporary writings of a fellow townsman, Henry Sewall. When a local court dismissed a charge of rape against a fellow member of the gentry, Sewall accepted it casually. Martha Ballard's diary notes a rare expression of shock.
Violence was also generally masculine, as when Martha's husband was set upon while working in the woods and robbed of his surveying instruments by squatters disguised as Indians, desperate to keep the landowners away. Among the men, class was sharply defined around property or social status, but the women among themselves slipped around such barriers. Male violence usually hurt women, directly or indirectly, as when a well-off farmer, James Purrington, killed his wife and six children by slitting their throats and then his own, or when Charles Gill killed himself, leaving behind nine children and a wife without any property. ''Mrs Gills Tryal is all most insupportable,'' Martha wrote. Henry Sewall, looking at Gill not yet dead, ''was astonished at his composure - or rather stupidity - which continued to the last. He died about 1 o'clock, without manifesting any signs of repentence.''
Historians will, of course, read this story with a deep appreciation of the professional skills that have made an obscure source accessible, engaging and valuable; nonprofessional readers will be even more appreciative in watching with delight and not a little wonder as a truly talented historian, before their eyes, unravels out of those hard knots of recorded fact the fascinating life of a community that in its complexity is at once so foreign, and yet so similar, to our own. Laurel Thatcher Ulrich wears her learning lightly and her prose sings.

FIRE & ICE
The Greenhouse Effect,
Ozone Depletion, and Nuclear Winter.
By David E. Fisher.

THE NEXT ONE HUNDRED YEARS
Shaping the Fate of Our Living Earth.
By Jonathan Weiner.
312 pp. New York:
Bantam Books. $19.95. 
In 1981, a team of British researchers at a frigid, wind-swept base in the Antarctic noticed a drop in stratospheric concentrations of ozone, a variant of ordinary oxygen that helps shield our planet from harmful ultraviolet rays. This was no slight, subtle falloff but a plunge. Couldn't be, the British at first thought. Maybe their instruments were off. After all, their findings flatly contradicted those reported by an American Nimbus satellite in orbit since 1978.
The British, it turned out, were right, Nimbus wrong. By 1984, the concentration of ozone had dropped by 30 percent. There was an enormous, steadily growing ozone hole at the South Pole.
Since the Nimbus scientists were looking for only a small slip in the standard ozone readings, they had programmed their computers to disregard as spurious departures from the norm of more than a few percent. In effect, they blinded themselves to the ozone hole, leaving to the British, down on the ground, the dubious pleasure of discovering it.
This story can be read as a lesson in scientific fallibility: when it comes to the complex scientific issues besetting the planet, you'd best believe no one. Yet within the large context offered by David E. Fisher in ''Fire & Ice'' and Jonathan Weiner in ''The Next One Hundred Years,'' the story can be seen to argue for quite a different conclusion. If, as both authors abundantly show, planetary science is so tricky, so excruciatingly dependent on the assumptions made in fashioning computer models, so riven with controversy, what does it mean when the scientific community does reach something like consensus?
Such consensus, Mr. Fisher and Mr. Weiner assure us, exists: the greenhouse effect is real. The globe is warming. Humanity's hold upon the planet is threatened.
In the greenhouse effect, methane, water vapor and particularly carbon dioxide collect in the atmosphere, forming a layer of insulation around the earth. If that layer thickens on account of the burning of fossil fuels and other factors, the earth holds on to more of the sun's heat. Result? A global warming.
How much warming can we expect? Here consensus breaks down. With decisive political action and good luck, the temperature rise may be limited to, say, three degrees Fahrenheit - triple that of the heat waves of the 1980's - bringing with it mild climatic changes to which we could adjust without too much bother. But it's just as likely, many scientists feel, that there will be a rise of 10, 15 or 20 degrees - enough to melt the polar ice caps, raise sea levels, inundate low-lying lands from Bangladesh to New York, appreciably alter climate and cause economic and political chaos as the hungry and thirsty billions struggle to survive the disruption.
Mr. Weiner and Mr. Fisher cover remarkably similar ground in their books. Both tell us how the greenhouse effect comes about; how it was first revealed through one scientist's methodical tracking of carbon dioxide levels; how clearing the Amazon rain forests contributes to it; why it is so difficult to predict accurately how much warming there will be, when it will begin and how fast it will happen; and how chlorofluorocarbons - like spray-can propellants and the Freon used in air conditioners - chew up the ozone layer.
Mr. Fisher, a professor at the University of Miami and the author of ''Race on the Edge of Time'' and ''The Birth of the Earth,'' widens his focus enough to include the worldwide nuclear winter, which would likely follow any large-scale exchange of nuclear warheads. In this scenario, soot and smoke from a hundred ravaged cities would form an atmospheric blanket over the earth, chilling it and possibly extinguishing much of its life.
Mr. Weiner, the author of ''Planet Earth,'' is the more leisurely of the two authors, more confident he's got your attention, more overtly literary. Some of his metaphors are unforgettable. As a way of showing that the stratosphere, unlike the lower atmosphere, doesn't easily rid itself of pollutants, he writes, ''It is like an eye without tears.''
To illustrate how the greenhouse effect implies not just a warming of the atmosphere but a chilling higher up, he explains that if you wear a flimsy shirt in a snowstorm, snowflakes landing on it melt. But if you wear several heavy sweaters, snowflakes alighting on the outermost one, now insulated from the heat of your body, stay frozen. ''Earth,'' writes Mr. Weiner, ''is swinging through the chill of outer space, and the atmosphere is its only clothing. Adding greenhouse gases to the air is like pulling on more and more layers of wool.''
Mr. Fisher's talent is noisier, but no less effective in capturing the reader. Conversational, gently rambling, he is not above taking off on a startling digression to flesh out an idea. ''Living in this world,'' he writes, ''is something like watching an Alfred Hitchcock film: just when you think you've got the ending figured out, he - and nature - hit you with another shock. Remember Psycho?'' But ''in this case, the knife-wielding nut turns out to be a bacterium hiding from the air,'' which dwells in some termites, feasts on felled trees from the Amazon rain forest and churns out methane, a greenhouse gas.
At another point, Mr. Fisher, borrowing a metaphor from the physicist Richard Feynman, compares the difficulty of understanding the planet to discovering the rules of chess by observing moves made in some small corner of the board.
Mercifully, neither author succumbs to despair in writing about such a bleak subject. Both believe that humans can act sensibly and creatively to forestall their doom. Amsterdam, after all, lives under water, the North Sea held back by dikes. The oil shock of the early 1970's galvanized America into producing, and buying, fuel-efficient cars that have slowed the buildup of carbon dioxide. And in 1988, most nations of the world agreed to cut the use of ozone-eating chlorofluorocarbons by half within the next decade. The authors believe that similar actions, accelerated by the urgency of the crisis, could moderate the warming to come, and they offer their own laundry list of environmental prescriptions.
Little of this is new; we have been living with global warming, the ozone hole and the prospect of a nuclear winter for some time now. They have become part of our public vocabulary. Indeed, that is just the problem both writers confront: their readers have been subject to so much in the way of journalistic pyrotechnics surrounding these issues, to such a tide of seemingly contradictory headlines, that no one knows what to believe anymore. Both authors struggle against the numbing effect of such confusion.
And both succeed, with passion and credibility. You cannot read either of them and conclude anything but that, if the nations of the world fail to act, or fail to act soon enough, it will be not just our distant progeny who take the heat but our own children.

THE POWER OF THE FINANCIAL PRESS
Journalism and Economic Opinion in Britain and America.
By Wayne Parsons.
266 pp. New Brunswick, N.J.:
Rutgers University Press. $24.95.
Take any potentially significant piece of economic policy, like President Bush's proposal to reduce the rate at which capital gains are taxed. What questions would a reasonable citizen or a reasonable senator want to ask before deciding whether to favor or oppose the legislation? And where could they hope to find the answers? 
A rational decision would have to rest on (a) an estimate of the pattern of losses and gains to the Treasury in the years after the tax reduction takes effect and (b) some notion of the characteristics (young, old, married, single, rich, poor) of those who would gain a lot or lose a lot from the change. In addition, since the stated purpose of the tax reduction is to stimulate investment in plant and equipment as well as research and development, and to encourage the start-up of innovative new firms, one would want to know (c) how effective the proposal would be in achieving these goals.
Providing answers to such questions is exactly the stuff of academic research papers and Ph.D. theses. I do not mean the word ''academic'' literally. The staff of the Brookings Institution, say, does exactly the same sort of work. So do many economists employed by the Federal Reserve Board, the Congressional Budget Office and some other Government agencies. I mean to emphasize that this sort of work is done by, and read by, professional economists.
Since they are communicating almost entirely with one another, it is efficient for research workers to use the shorthand jargon of technical economics and statistics. It also has to be said that different researchers, using different methods and different bodies of data, will sometimes come up with contradictory results, especially if the effects being measured are fairly small. That is hardly surprising: the same is true of research aimed at measuring the health effects of diets containing various amounts of oat bran.
This professional writing is not much use to the reasonable citizen or the reasonable senator, who will find the jargon impenetrable and will have no basis for judging the relevance or utility of alternative approaches. One might expect that a body of interpretive economic journalism would fill the gap and mediate between policy-oriented research and policy-interested citizens. There is indeed some of that. Given the importance of the issues, however, the inescapable conclusion is that there is not nearly enough serious economic journalism, and the average quality is pretty poor.
The senator can sometimes hold hearings and listen to the testimony of academic economists who may, repeat may, try to communicate the results of their research. I have to record the impression that even these exercises are usually unsatisfactory, though there have been exceptions.
''The Power of the Financial Press'' by Wayne Parsons, who teaches -government, not economics - at the University of London, is about the evolution of economic and financial journalism in Britain and America, but it does not offer any cogent explanation of the unsatisfactory state of affairs I have been describing. He does not even focus on the problem of the translation of academic research into civil discourse, perhaps because he does not even see that there is such a problem. When he mentions the body of academic research, it is usually to dismiss it for having retreated into self-indulgent and irrelevant mathematical technicality. I think there is some justice in that charge. But Mr. Parsons does not seem to realize either that there remains a body of academic research aimed at exactly the questions that must be answered if economic policy is to have a rational basis, or that without some analytical complexity it may be impossible to avoid destructive oversimplification.
Some of the issues treated, even superficially, by the author may provide clues to the failure of communication I think I see. He points out, for example, that serious but nonacademic discussion of economics in England has been dominated by a group of important journalists - Andrew Shonfield, Samuel Brittan, Michael Shanks, Barbara Ward, Peter Jay, among others - who have no real counterparts in the United States, at least none who have been able to write at such length. In contrast, popular discussion of economics in America has been dominated by a handful of leading academics, of whom Milton Friedman, John Kenneth Galbraith and Paul Samuelson have been the most prominent. (I think this observation is essentially right, though Mr. Parsons overlooks the role of Thomas Balogh and Nicholas Kaldor in Britain.) My own guess is that the explanation for this difference has something to do with the capacities of the respective audiences. It is noteworthy that the vehicle for the American academic is usually the newspaper Op-Ed piece or Newsweek column of 900 words or less, whereas the British journalists, even when they are writing in the Sunday papers, are able to go on for much longer. The American unwillingness to attend to more than a sound bite is destructive of both economic intelligence and political discourse.
Mr. Parsons notes, correctly, that economic and financial journalism has been connected historically with the dissemination of price and market information. Those who are interested enough to read one will generally want to read the other. I am not sure that anything follows from this connection. Mr. Parsons seems to think that the expansion of electronic media has some deep responsibility for the fact that the 10-second commentary on the television news on today's economic events is more likely to come from a brokerage house employee than from either a serious journalist or an academic. But it is probably no more than a matter of convenient availability. Anyway, since the content of what is said is negligible, it hardly matters who says it.
Good interpretive economic journalism has to be able to distinguish between serious research and pseudo-economics. Serious economics needs a bridge to the world of policy discussion because the people who do the research either cannot or will not build the bridge themselves. Schlock economics is all bridge. It is not certain that Mr. Parsons is clear about the distinction himself. His chapter on the selling of Reaganomics takes too seriously writers who are neither doers nor purveyors of hard research. The editorial page of The Wall Street Journal is as much part of the problem as it is part of the solution. Maybe we get the economic journalism we deserve.

HEADLINE: Battling for Tenants in a Slow Market

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
A TWO-YEAR building surge in West Midtown has demonstrated the power of public incentives to direct the path of commercial development. The big question now is how to market a spate of new offices when the New York City economy has sunk into the doldrums.
Nearly 9 million square feet of new office space, roughly the equivalent of the twin towers of the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, have been brought to the West Midtown market in a building boom that began early in 1988. Less than half the space has been leased.
Now, with construction nearly complete, developers are under intense financial pressure because of the high costs of carrying huge blocks of vacant space. As months pass without tenants, say real estate experts, financing charges, advertising fees, security and other expenses are mounting into millions of dollars on the buildings that are slow to rent. 
As a result, developers, leasing agents and brokers are battling it out in the toughest competition for corporate office users in recent New York City history.
The construction has taken place around Times Square, north into the theater district and elsewhere in what was traditionally considered a declining, low- rent neighbor to East Midtown, the nation's busiest and most expensive office district. A dozen new office buildings were either completed over the last year or are scheduled to be complete by mid-1990.
In each case, developers received property tax exemptions and were allowed to put up larger buildings than would normally be approved in a program conceived by City Hall to shift midtown development from east to west.
Neither the city nor the developers anticipated the rapid erosion of the city's economy that began when the stock market collapsed in October 1987, just as the foundations were being laid for most of the new office towers. Corporate expansion has slowed to a standstill, tenants have vacated several older midtown buildings and the competition for new tenants is growing more intense by the day.
BUT while no one could have predicted the full extent of the economic downturn, some real estate experts say the developers, contending with two- to three-year construction schedules, should have employed more sophisticated market research to gauge what type of tenants would be in need of space, and what kind of space they would want, even in tough economic times.
''If we were talking about Colgate making a new toothpaste, they would have been to four Midwestern cities to see if it sells,'' said Maurice Solomon, manager of the midtown office of Julien J. Studley, one of the commercial brokerage firms scouring the city to find corporate tenants for the new space. The firms themselves are being aggressively courted by nervous developers.
''New York City developers don't want market research,'' he added. ''Their job is to create product, and they build.'' Among those immersed in the West Midtown office market are the following:
* Larry Feldman, a developer and partner in Feldman Equities, who has leased out more than half the space at Tower 45, a 40-story steel-and-glass tower on 45th Street between Seventh Avenue and Avenue of the Americas but still has over 150,000 square feet uncommitted. To find tenants, he has promoted the building by hosting cocktail receptions at brokers' offices, producing marketing videotapes and sending out over 1,000 miniature trees - symbolizing the rows of mature red cedars that have been set into a wall above the building's atrium -to brokers across the city.
* William Butler, a senior vice president in the midtown office of Cushman & Wakefield, one of a dozen large concerns that dominate the New York City commercial brokerage industry, who is looking for tenants ready to relocate thousands of employees to huge blocks of new space. ''There are at least a half dozen big prospects looming,'' he said. Rumors, so far unfounded, have been circulating for a year that several large-scale corporate moves are imminent.
* Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm, spent two years combing the West Midtown market. It announced in January that it would bypass the new crop of buildings and move 2,000 employees into 10 floors of 1301 Avenue of the Americas, the former J. C. Penney Building between 52d and 53d Streets. ''We got a better deal,'' said Frank Scalia, the firm's chief financial officer.
* The Integrity Life Insurance Company looked at 15 buildings, including most of the new office towers in West Midtown, before signing a 20-year lease in January at one of them, the 35-story 1325 Avenue of the Americas. Despite its address, the building has no direct access to Avenue of the Americas, but sits west of the Hilton Hotel, with entrances on 53d and 54th Street.
Integrity, which will move 115 employees to its new offices by June, said it was disappointed by the uniform design of the other new buildings it inspected. ''These things came off a Xerox machine,'' said Franklin Maisano, the company's chief executive officer. ''It seems as though everybody sat down at the same time and said, 'Let's go build a Lego office building.' ''
To be sure, experts say, even if economic conditions were robust, a wave of newly constructed offices as large as the one coming on the market in West Midtown would take many months - perhaps as much as two years - to fully lease out. And some of the buildings have quickly attracted tenants.
One of these is 1675 Broadway, a 35-story tower at 52nd Street, which was completed by Rudin Management in September and is more than 85 percent leased. ''I'm not saying we know all the answers, but when you are constantly in the market, you develop a sense of where it is going,'' said William Rudin, vice president of the company, a family-owned development concern that has built 14 Manhattan office buildings.
The building's largest tenants are Lord Day & Lord Barrett Smith, a law firm; D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, an advertising company, and Entertainment Weekly, the new Time Warner magazine.
AMONG other buildings in which office space has leased swiftly is Worldwide Plaza, a huge complex of offices, condominiums and shops that takes up a full block bounded by Eighth and Ninth Avenues and 49th and 50th Streets. The office building in the complex, completed in December 1988 by the Zeckendorf Organization, is more than 90 percent leased.
At Cityspire, a slim, 73-story tower of rental offices and apartment condominiums at 156 West 56th Street between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue, over 80 percent of the commercial space has leased since the building opened late in 1987.
And 114 West 47th Street, a 26-story building completed in July by the Durst Organization, is over 70 percent leased, with the U.S. Trust Company taking all of its lower 16 floors.
But for now, several other buildings in the current wave of West Midtown construction are begging for tenants in a sluggish economy that is attracting few new companies to New York, inspiring little expansion among companies that are already in the city and leaving a huge amounts of office space vacant, even at older, less costly buildings.
''We have moved through three or four very different economic climates since these new buildings were planned,'' said John Halpern, a New York City developer and former president of Hartz Mountain Industries, a large development firm in New York and New Jersey. ''The ship was launched and there is no turning back'' he added. In one analysis of the West Midtown market, Cushman & Wakefield put the vacancy rate for office space at 15.9 percent in January and 16 percent in December. The rates are unusually high for Manhattan, where overall vacancies, although climbing steadily since late 1987, had been running below 10 percent during most of the 80's.
Experts say some increase in vacancy levels was all but inevitable, even if the city's economy had not faltered, because public incentives prompted so much new construction in West Midtown. The main incentive, a zoning bonus that allowed developers to put up buildings with 20 percent greater height or density that would otherwise be allowed, was first offered in 1982 and expired in May 1988, creating a deadline for foundations to be laid and a construction surge over the last two years.
Another incentive, still available in West Midtown, is a seven year property-tax exemption that enables developers to offer lower initial rents. Both city initiatives are targeted for buildings in a area extending north from 34th Street to 58th Street, and west from a jagged boundary the bisects the blocks between Seventh Avenue and Avenue of the Americas.
Because of the incentives offered, and because the developers who took advantage of them did so at time when the city economy was flourishing, some experts say 20-20 hindsight is now a luxury that serves little purpose.
''If there was more market research, would behavior have been different?'' asked Hugh Kelly, a consultant with Landauer Associates, which does financial analysis for developers. ''I suspect not,'' he said. ''Each developer would have convinced himself that he had some advantage in location, building design or other amenities.''
Nor do many economists or real estate experts expect the West Midtown offices to remain a hard sell indefinitely. Mr. Kelly's firm, in a forecast it has distributed to clients, is predicting that demand for Manhattan offices will remain sluggish for more than another year and then pick up sharply between 1992 and 1994.
It said several factors would contribute to the turnaround, including the relaxation of economic barriers in Europe, which should bring more international business to New York City, and an upturn in both the national economy and business on Wall Street if economic cycles that have traditionally been charted for both remain consistent in the 1990's.
For now, however, developers and their agents in West Midtown are in a bruising competition.
Several are concentrating their efforts on attracting large anchor tenants from a list of candidates that have either publicly acknowledged or been widely rumored to be in the market for new headquarters or large divisional office.
One is Chemical Bank, which has said it would either negotiate a new lease at its current headquarters, 277 Park Avenue, between 47th and 48th Streets, or seek a new Manhattan address.
Among its options, the bank said, was splitting up its offices between a headquarters that would employ up to 700 people, and a back-office and computer center that might be moved outside Manhattan, and would employ up to 3,000 workers.
A BANK spokesman, Ken Herz, said Chemical has been considering some of the new West Midtown buildings, but declined to elaborate on the status of negotiations.
Others believed to be in the West Midtown market are the News America Corporation, the publishing concern owned by Rupert Murdoch, and the Sony Corporation, which is reported to be looking for a new North American headquarters. Brokers say privately that both have been inspecting some of the new crop of buildings, but have yet to make their intentions known.
At Worldwide Plaza, the large mixed-use project facing Eighth Avenue, large blocks of space were taken by Cravath, Swaine & Moore, the law firm, and Ogilvy & Mather and NW Ayer, advertising agencies. In an unusual approach, the Zeckendorf Organization, developer of the complex, negotiated deals with the tenants in which they are taking partial equity in the building, and persuaded them to sign their leases before the office space was completed.
Indeed, some experts say that one of the lessons being reinforced by the current office surplus in West Midtown is that more tenant commitments should be secured before construction begins.
''It is always more comfortable to have a preleased tenant,'' said David Lawrence, senior vice president of Gerald Hines Interests, a development firm that has only begun work on a 40-story office tower that is scheduled for completion in 1992 over the post office at Lexington Avenue and 45th Street, just north of Grand Central Terminal.
The developer has already signed on an anchor tenant, Davis Polk & Wardwell, one of the city's biggest law firms, which will take half the 900,000 square feet of offices in the building.
Among those without pre-arranged leases, many strategies are being employed. Mr. Butler at Cushman & Wakefield said many of the developers are giving generous incentives to prospective tenants by offering to pay for the design and finishing of their offices. These work-letters - industry parlance for a developer's commitment to create interior office spaces at his own expense - are typically now costing the developers $50 per square foot of office space, much more than in the past.
Rental rates in the new buildings are also creating an incentive to some tenants whose alternatives would be buildings east of Grand Central Terminal, along Park Avenue or in the East 50's, areas that have traditionally carried the most cachet for those seeking midtown offices.
The asking rents vary, but brokers said a typical rate in the new West Midtown offices is slightly under $35 a square foot. They said developers have not reduced their asking rents, but tried to attract tenants by offering other temporary incentives that include the generous work letters and months of free rent during the initial phase of a new lease.
In contrast, most modern, well-located buildings in East Midtown have been fetching $37 to $45 per square foot of office space.
But even with the incentives offered to West Midtown tenants, the developers and their brokers are finding themselves engaged in a campaign of telephone canvassing, knocking on corporate doors and street-level promotion rarely seen before in the Manhattan office market.
''This is a very strange market to be trying to sell into,'' said Arthur H. Lerner, senior vice president of Helmsley Spear, a large brokerage that is in charge of the marketing at 1325 Avenue of Americas, the building between 53d and 54th Streets that signed on Integrity Life Insurance as one of its first tenants.
The building, developed by a partnership of Edward J. Minskoff, a Manhattan developer, and the Taubman Company, a large builder of shopping centers, offices and other properties, is in the final stages of construction. Although more than two-thirds of its space remains to be leased, it has so far been more successful in attracting tenants than some of the other new buildings.
MR. MINSKOFF said he had designed the building, which has an interior lobby covered in marble and floors designed to accommodate large conference rooms and corner offices, for high-level corporate operations, and did not intend it to be used for computerized back offices. His marketing approach, he said, was therefore intended to be conservative and dignified.
Unlike the approaches used by some other developers, he said he designed slick videotapes, had cocktail receptions and used other aggressive marketing strategies. Last summer, when the building was still far from complete, a hard-bound marketing brochure, containing photographs of what some interior spaces would look like, was produced from architects' renderings and scale-model simulation, and distributed among brokers and potential tenants.
Few potential tentants were invited to visit the building until recent months, as its elevator banks began operating and its floors, still raw and unfurnished, neared completion.
''PEOPLE can look at videos and brochures all day, but what they really want to see is the building itself,'' said Mr. Lerner. Mr. Minskoff, meanwhile, said he would be ''just fine'' if it took two years to fully lease the building, but he added, while declining to elaborate, that a large tenant was in the final phases of negotiations for a lease that would almost fill the building within months.
At Tower 45, Mr. Feldman has been taken an even more aggressive marketing posture. ''We have sent out the dog-and-pony show,'' he said. ''We want to plant the seeds of good will and interest in this building.''
The approach, he said, has largely been focused on persuading Manhattan's huge brokerage industry to turn its attention to selling the building. Beginning at the end of 1987, while it was little more than a hole in the ground, videotapes were made of elevator banks and other interior details that were similar to those planned in Tower 45.
Mr. Feldman said he compiled a list of over 2,000 brokers in New York City, and sent them all copies of the tape. A print advertising campaign was launched in publications read by brokers, including Real Estate Weekly and Crain's New York Business.
Then came the cocktail receptions, in which Mr. Feldman said he hired a bartender and visited several brokerage offices. His miniature trees went out to the brokers in early 1988.
The campaign has produced several successes. The building signed its biggest tenant, the Equitable Life Assurance Society, which took the four lowest floors nine months before it was completed in April 1989. Among the other tenants, with smaller blocks of space, are the Kelwood Company, a textile manufacturer, NEC, the Japanese electronics firm, and several small law firms.
''Up to this moment, the strategy has been to market to the industry as intensively as we can, and it seems to be working,'' Mr. Feldman said.
 
THE COURTING OF CHEMICAL BANK
AMONG large corporate tenants, none is being purused more aggressively than Chemical Bank, which for more than a year has been in the market for a million square feet of office space, enough for nearly 4,000 workers it now has in three Manhattan buildings.
Developers in West Midtown, elsewhere in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and New Jersey are in the competition. So, too, is City Hall, where Mayor David N. Dinkins has met privately on the matter with Walter V. Shipley, Chemical's chairman, according to sources at the Mayor's office and in the bank.
The high-level arm twisting may have set the stage for something similar to the 1988 campaign to persuade Chase Manhattan to move its back-office operations and 5,000 workers to the Metrotech office complex in downtown Brooklyn. Chase received many city incentives, including tax abatements and energy subsidies estimated to be worth $235 million.
Chemical declined to disclose details of its negotiations, but said it plans either to renegotiate a lease at its current headquarters, 277 Park Avenue, between 47th and 48th Streets, or move. Its lease in the Park Avenue building, where it occupies 750,000 square feet of space, will expire in July 1994.
Ken Herz, a Chemical spokesman, said the bank will keep its top headquarters staff in Manhattan. Although that might mean also keeping all the headquarters personnel in Manhattan, he added that one option is to retain as few as 600 senior executives in a smaller amount of Manhattan space than the bank now occupies, and move up to 3,000 computer operators and other support workers to one of the other New York City boroughs or New Jersey.
Indeed, the bank said it has a nonbinding option for an undeveloped building site in the Meadowlands area of New Jersey that would accommodate a major back-office installation, as well as similar nonbinding options on other undeveloped parcels at sites it declined to identify in New York City.
Mr. Herz said the bank would consider all options and announce its decision by the end of the year.
Chemical had planned to be the anchor tenant in one of the huge new office buildings at the corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue that are planned by New York State, George Klein, a developer, and the Prudential Insurance Company of America as part of the mammoth Times Square redevelopment project. But a year ago, with the long-delayed project mired in a fresh round of litigation, the bank withdrew, saying it could not be sure the office tower would be built in time to meet its needs.
Since then, real estate executives say the bank has been pursued by developers and has looked at more than a dozen buildings that are under construction or recently completed, including some of the new crop in West Midtown.
ONE site the bank is known to have considered is the northwest corner of 42d Street and Avenue of the Americas, now blighted by derelict buildings, where Douglas Durst, a principal in the Durst Organization,, has been trying to assemble a major building site.
Mr. Durst has been negotiating to acquire the last piece of land necessary to complete the site from the New York Land Company, another development concern. He said last week that negotiations with New York Land were continuing, but declined comment on whether Chemical was on his list of prospective tenants if he is able to build on the site.
At City Hall, meanwhile, Sally Hernandez-Pinero, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, has met several times with senior Chemical executives to promote New York City sites.
One option being pressed by the city is for Chemical to keep a small headquarters operation in Manhattan, and move the bulk of its back-office personnel to downtown Brooklyn or Queens. - THOMAS J. LUECK

HEADLINE: 'Disappointing' Inauguration For Condo Plan

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
STATE officials in Hartford last week began sifting through the responses to an innovative program intended to increase the supply of housing for low- and moderate-income families in Connecticut through the purchase of condominiums. And across Fairfield and Litchfield Counties, housing officials began assessing why so many of their towns were being left out.
Calling the response to the program of grants and mortgages to help nonprofit groups exploit a glut of condominiums ''very disappointing,'' State Housing Commissioner John F. Papandrea announced an internal review to see what had gone wrong with his project, especially in Fairfield County.
''It just happened,'' said John Madeo, the executive director of Fairfield 2,000 Homes Corporation, a countywide nonprofit housing group that negotiated unsuccessfully with condominium developers in several suburban communities in Fairfield County, trying to get them to sell to the state. 
The program's start in December drew nationwide attention to Connecticut's Department of Housing. With a glutted condominium market that had pushed prices down and driven more than a few developers into bankruptcy, housing officials reasoned that lots of homes could be purchased with state bond money for less than the cost of construction.
Bids were solicited, with a goal of spreading the purchases around the state. Officials said they hoped the program would introduce some integration of income levels into areas that have become increasing composed of the rich and the elderly.
But when the Feb. 23 deadline passed for nonprofit groups and developers to apply, officials found that the program had bypassed a wide band of towns where even a solid middle-class wage cannot cover housing costs.
Although 50 applications had been filed for a total of 929 apartments, they were heavily concentrated in a few large cities, with a sprinkling in smaller towns and hardly anything in the high-priced towns of Fairfield and Litchfield. Mr. Madeo's group ended up filing only one application - for a 21-unit complex in Bridgeport. In Fairfield County, only Bridgeport and Danbury produced any large numbers, with a total between them of 141 apartments offered to the state for purchase. The rest of the county drew applications for 18 units. Only 17 apartments were offered for all of Litchfield County.
Developers and state and local officials said some of the reasons behind the disparity are already clear. Because the program allowed only seven weeks between the first announcement and the application deadline, a developer who wanted to participate had to act quickly to find a nonprofit group to co-sponsor the application and comply with other rules.
Those rules discouraged many owners, officials said, particularly the requirements that every apartment have a certificate of occupancy proving that the property is ready to live in, and that any apartment offered to the state would have to be removed from the market for 12 weeks or more while the state considered the purchase.
The officials said that Connecticut's wealthy suburban towns - unlike their larger neighbors like as Bridgeport and Waterbury, where the condominium glut is far worse - have just not suffered enough in the economic downturn to make the state's offer attractive.
''There wasn't enough pain,'' said Larry Zeigler, project manager for the Connecticut Housing Investment Fund, a nonprofit housing group that negotiatiated unsuccessfully with several Fairfield County owners.
Mr. Zeigler, whose group ended up filing three applications for a total of 15 apartments in Hartford, Windsor and Jewett City in the state's southeast corner, said he believed the state ''did a good job at trying to put together a very innovative program.''
But many developers he contacted said that even in a weak real estate market, three months of waiting for the gears of government to turn was simply too long, Mr. Zeigler said. Things might still turn up, and apartments might still be sold when spring marketing resumes, he said.
Local housing officials said that although higher prices in Fairfield and Litchfield were factors in keeping the number of applications down - especially since the state had said it would pay, on average, only about $100,000 for an apartment - the problem was not insurmountable.
 
Preliminary Agreements
In Greenwich, for example, the Housing Authority had reached preliminary agreements that would have brought 15 apartments into the program at prices ranging from $215,000 to $225,000 each, said the authority's acting executive director, Tom Crawford.
Of that price, Mr. Crawford said, $100,000 was to have been paid by the state, leaving the final occupant of the apartment responsible for a mortgage of $115,000 to $125,000, well within the limits set by another state agency, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority, which provides mortgage assistance to middle-income first-time homeowners.
What killed both deals, Mr. Crawford said, was that the banks holding the properties, both of which were seized in loan foreclosures, were just not ready.
In Litchfield County, housing officials in Washington were able to overcome high land prices with a proposal that asks the state to spend about $60,000 in aid for for each of seven condominiums in a development called Quarry Ridge.
 
Look at the Process
The $60,000 would pay for the land under each apartment, said John Boyer, president of the Washington Community Housing Trust. The apartments would then be sold as ''improvements'' to the land, while the land itself would be placed in a land trust. The maneuver would lower the cost of the apartments to the final occupants to $135,000 to $155,000 each, Mr. Boyer said, compared to the units' original asking price of $280,000 each.
At the State Housing Department, Mr. Papandrea said that the whole application process would be re-evaluated over the next few weeks, to look for the points on which housing authorities in Fairfield and elsewhere may have stumbled. In particular, he said, the requirements for certificates of occupancy would be reconsidered, as well as the 12-week lag for a decision by the state. He said he hoped to see the pilot program expand to an ''ongoing effort.''
''We're learning,'' Mr. Papandrea said. ''We'll rewrite those areas that presented the problems.''
But some of those who came close to finding the right package but ultimately failed said they were not sure that things would get any easier.
If the condominiums' owners ''aren't able to move those units this spring, then there's certainly a potential opportunity,'' said Mr. Crawford in Greenwich. ''But right now, we just don't know where things will go.''

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND OPINION;
Glasnost On the Island

BYLINE: By Arthur J. Kremer; Arthur J. Kremer, a former State Assemblyman, is a member of the executive board of the Association for a Better Long Island.

 BODY:
PEERING over the border for decades, each side has never hidden its mistrust of its neighbor. It is a relationship forged from years of suspicion and ruthless political competition.
Far from the Berlin wall, these neighbors straddle the Nassau-Suffolk line. It almost seems that the crumbling of the wall 10,000 miles away is the force that has compelled Nassau's Republican leadership and Suffolk's Democratic leadership to find common political ground. 
The announcement by Nassau County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta and Suffolk County Executive Patrick G. Halpin that they seek to create the Bicounty Peacetime Economic Adjustment Council is the first substantive indication that Long Island political leaders are maturing in their recognition that regional problems can only be addressed in a joint manner. Perhaps it took the historic events surrounding the collapse of the Soviet empire to put our own border disputes into perspective. Perhaps it was the recognition that the key economic component, our defense industry, may become obsolete due to the forces of perestroika and glasnost.
In addition to its mandate of keeping our best and brightest engineering talent on the Island, an equally important role would be the two-county council's efforts to shape our industrial policy in the 1990's. Today there is no one political body that can hope to confront the Island's economic shocks, which range from defense reductions to a hodgepodge of zoning policies. There needs to be an umbrella organization, free from the parochial political forces that have crippled our ability to find solutions.
To be effective, the council must force the two counties to cease their separate search for new companies, often robbing Peter to pay Paul. Instead, Nassau and Suffolk must join in a unified program of economic incentives that will make Long Island the best place to do business, as opposed to a particular county.
As New York City suffers under the pains of enormous municipal budget cuts and a deepening recession, we must be particularly sensitive to their aggressive economic incentives designed to bring business back into the neighboring boroughs. In addition, the new council should take a good hard look at the programs offered by neighboring New Jersey and Connecticut and see how we can make Long Island a more attractive place to open a new company or allow for the expansion of existing business.
If necessary, the two counties should jointly seek state legislation in Albany to expand local job producing programs. In 1978, as chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, I introduced legislation that would provide funds for precisely this purpose through the creation of the Long Island Job Development Authority, yet, to date, that resource has been untapped by Long Island.
However, an enormously exciting aspect of the council proposal is that the two county executives now recognize the critical importance of creating a working partnership of government and business to protect our regional economy. They are proposing a series of cooperative programs whereby government and business leaders hammer out plans to deal with defense layoffs, property and sales tax affects and lobbying in Washington in coordination with our Congressional delegation and the promotion of Long Island abroad.
These newly proposed actions are a far cry from the past history of using Long Island business community as convenient targets in election years or to play up to the not-in-my-backyard groups. It may also be a recognize that a hemorrhaging economy could irreparably fracture the political futures of some of the promising men and women in Nassau and Suffolk.
The new Realpolitik of Europe, Washington and New York will force Long Island to find new, innovative programs that balance the needs of our economy with the needs of our environment. The Berlin wall is a relic. The Communist Party is in tatters. McDonald's overlooks Gorky Park. And Tom Gulotta and Patrick Halpin now understand that deeds, not words, will rescue our economy, our tax base and our future.
Walls do crumble. Governments do collapse. And that immovable force of Long Island politics is beginning to respond to the reality of change. Could it be merely a coincidence that the new entity being proposed by the County Executives from opposing political parties in our bi-county region has the acronym Bipeace?

HEADLINE: Plan to Reduce Swordfish Catch Assailed

BYLINE: By States News Service

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NEW JERSEY fishermen are normally a quiet bunch, but a plan to drastically reduce commercial swordfishing has made them enter the political fray.
The plan to reduce the United States swordfish catch by about 78 percent, proposed by the South Atlantic Marine Fishery Management Council, could put the state's long-line fishermen virtually out of business, they say. The long-liners pull in $10 million to $15 million worth of swordfish a year, up to 25 percent of the New Jersey fishing industry's $60 million annual profit.
''I don't think we're going to stay in our waters and survive - make the boat payments, the insurance payments, the gear payments,'' said James Welch, a New Jersey fish wholesaler who owns two long-line boats docked at Barnegat Light.
Unlike net fishermen, the long-liners cast out bundles of up to 1,000 fishing lines, each attached with hooks and bait, to catch swordfish, tuna, sharks and other billfish. 
Mr. Welch is one of more than 200 swordfishermen in New Jersey who have banded together to fight the swordfish restrictions, which could take effect as early as June.
Supporters of the reduction in the swordfish catch say a conservation measure is needed to save the species. They say there has been a decline in the population and average size of swordfish, evidence that the species is being overfished.
The fishermen have jammed public hearings (200 of them showed up at a meeting in Wall Township on Jan. 24), begun a membership drive for the New Jersey Commercial Fishermen's Association, lobbied members of Congress and formed an organization of their own, the Bluewater Fishermen's Association. Bluewater, which is the brainchild of Nelson Beideman, a Barnegat Light swordfisherman, and his wife, Terri, signed up 250 members nationwide during three weeks in December. About a third of the members are from New Jersey.
''They've been woken up,'' said John Hoey, government relations representative for the National Fisheries Institute in Washington, which helped Bluewater get off the ground.
Mr. Hoey said fishermen from the swordfish and tuna industry, which has grown tremendously in the last 10 years, have realized that they must speak out to survive. The New Jersey fishermen, most of whom are docked at Barnegat Light, have been particularly vocal, he said, since Barnegat is one of the top four swordfish and tuna ports in the country.
''I think it definitely represents an awakening, and a realization that they can no longer sit back and sort of ignore the management system,'' Mr. Hoey said. ''It's a frustrating thing to participate in, and certainly one of the reasons many fishermen are at sea is because they don't like to stay home and attend meetings.''
The shock that moved the fishermen into action, Mr. Hoey and other industry representatives said, was the announcement by the National Marine Fisheries Service last fall that it might impose emergency swordfish conservation measures in January. Federal official have since dropped the plan, citing the high cost of enforcing the regulations. But by then the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council's proposal also had the fishermen up in arms.
The council, an arm of the Federal Government, has proposed reducing the swordfish catch to 1.85 million pounds a year, about 78 percent less than the eight million to nine million pounds of swordfish that United States fishermen caught in 1989. The proposal allows fishermen to keep only ''bi-catch'' swordfish, which are caught while fishing for other species like tuna. The plan also prohibits fishermen from using light sticks to attract the fish at night and restricts them to six swordfish a trip.
Council officials said the measures were needed to prevent the fishery from shutting down entirely. The council estimates that the adult swordfish population declined by more than 60 percent from 1978 to 1987, while the number of fish being caught more than quadrupled. The average swordfish size has also declined, from 115 pounds in 1978 to 60 pounds in 1988, said Steven Berkeley, a council biologist.
''It tells you that the fishing mortality rate is very high,'' Mr. Berkeley said. ''It tells you that very few fish will reach adulthood, will reach spawning age, and it tells you that if you don't do something to reverse the situation, you will have a collapse of the fishery.''
The council, which is one of eight regional councils charged with establishing United States fishing regulations, expects to present its final swordfish plan March 27 and 28. The plan then goes to the Department of Commerce for approval. Lawmakers expect the Commerce Department to be receptive, given that officials at the National Marine Fisheries Service gave serious thought to emergency measures.
''The resource is being severely dropped to the point where if we don't do something drastic soon, the stock will not be able to replenish itself,'' said Richard Schaefer, director of the Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management at the National Marine Fisheries Service. ''And the longer we wait, the longer it may take the stock to recover.''
But long-line fishermen question the council's statistics, citing large numbers of swordfish and healthy catches. At 18 public hearings throughout the East Coast, held from Jan. 3 to Feb. 1, hundreds of fishermen spoke out against the plan, Mr. Berkeley said.
The restrictions would directly affect about 700 Atlantic long-line boats and about 3,500 fishermen. In New Jersey, the council's proposal would mean a net economic loss of $40 million a year, said Nils Stolpe, director of the New Jersey Commercial Fishermen's Association.
According to the National Marine Fisheries Service, 162 long-line boats are registered in New Jersey. Industry officials said about 25 percent of those boats primarily catch swordfish.
But Mr. Beideman warned that the state's $15 million tuna industry could be cut by 70 percent if the swordfish restrictions took effect. Tuna fishermen inevitably haul in swordfish and would have to stop fishing completely once they caught their swordfish limit.
In addition, the fishermen said, each long-line boat supports a series of related industries, from truck driving to distributing bait, fuel, tackle and ice, all of which would be jeopardized by the plan.
''I feel they have not explored the economic impact of their proposal,'' Mr. Welch said of the council. ''And as it is written, I think we would be pretty much devastated.''
Another of the fishermen's complaints is that the council's proposal would not affect the many foreign boats catching swordfish in the Atlantic. Mr. Hoey of the National Fisheries Institute estimates that United States fishermen are responsible for only 29 percent of the North Atlantic swordfish harvest.
Officials at the National Marine Fisheries Service put that figure at closer to 50 percent. But since swordfish are migratory, New Jersey fishermen said, it makes no sense to regulate only half the ocean.
''It's not really a management plan,'' Mr. Beideman of the Bluewater Fishermen's Association said. He added that the proposal did not address ''the drastic economic impact and consequences of shutting down the domestic fishery, and would provide very little - if any at all - conservation benefits.''
''Unilateral actions,'' he said, ''simply do not work with highly migratory species.''
Mr. Beideman questioned the council's data, which he said were ''tilted, slanted, massaged and assessed from every different angle.'' Since foreign fishermen would continue to catch swordfish in large numbers, he said, the council's proposal would fail to protect the fishery while putting American fishermen at a disadvantage.
''Why sacrifice the U.S. industries when we'll have to turn around and import fish products and export jobs?'' he said.
Some New Jersey lawmakers are wondering the same thing. Representatives Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of Long Branch; William J. Hughes, Democrat of Ocean City, and H. James Saxton, Republican of Southampton, took steps to combat the stringent swordfish regulations in their rewriting of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, which governs Federal fishing laws.
 
Plan to Change Management
House members approved a two-year reauthorization of the act on Feb. 6, including a provision to take swordfish management out of the hands of the South Atlantic council and make it the joint responsibility of the five regional councils that have swordfishermen in their districts.
''In this case, I'm not sure the fishermen have gotten a fair shake,'' said Mr. Saxton, who sent an aide to a council meeting in December to make sure that the 50 New Jersey fishermen who attended would have their say. ''I don't think there was any intention of listening to them until we got involved.''
Mr. Saxton and his New Jersey colleagues also included a ''sense of Congress'' provision in the new Magnuson Act calling for broader industry representation on the fishery management councils. Fishermen say the councils are deaf to their concerns.
''Many of the fishermen do not feel that they have been represented on the councils,'' Mr. Hughes said, ''that the resource has not dwindled as much as has been suggested, that there is not sufficient research to establish that there is a need for draconian reductions in catch. And they feel in many instances that they are alien to the process.''
 
Need for Conservation
New Jersey fishermen said they recognized the need for conservation, but would prefer a more moderate plan that sets minimum size limits for the swordfish and closes off designated areas. Mr. Hoey of the National Fisheries Institute said industry representatives had not prepared a detailed proposal, but believed that conservation measures should be international.
The problem, conservationists said, is that international swordfishermen are resistant to change. Spanish officials said at a November meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, ''As for our country, if a choice has to be made between man and fish, it would first choose man.''
D. W. Bennett, executive director of the American Littoral Society, a coastal conservation group in Sandy Hook, said: ''It's an absolute fact that the swordfish is in trouble. And one of the main measures is that the size of swordfish landed keeps dropping. Which means that it's overfished. There's no question about it.''
Mr. Berkeley of the South Atlantic council admitted the plan would hurt fishermen. In a sense, he said, the long-liners are victims of their own success. Rising swordfish prices and rapid strides in fishing technology, from electronics to light sticks and more sophisticated tackle, have made long-lining increasingly profitable, popular and efficient.
''Some of the fishermen may have to go out of business,'' Mr. Berkeley said. ''The other side of the coin is that if they don't take action, the fishermen may put themselves out of business, and then the fishery may never recover.''

Trafficking
The Boom and Bust of the Air America Cocaine Ring
 
By Berkeley Rice
Charles Scribner's Sons, 303 pages. $22.95.
Here is the story of several middle-class young men getting together to fulfill the American dream of accumulating wealth, prestige and happiness.
It is also the carefully researched story of the Air America cocaine ring that those men ran, which at the time of its breakup had brought nearly 10 tons of cocaine into the United States from Colombia.
As the Government prepared to take the case to a grand jury, Attorney General Edwin Meese proclaimed that the Air America ring was responsible for ''the largest documented amount of cocaine ever smuggled into this country by a single trafficking organization.'' 
Berkeley Rice, a former foreign correspondent for Newsweek and senior editor for Psychology Today, has written three other books, including ''The C-5A Scandal,'' about defense contracting.
In ''Trafficking'' we find that a Westchester resident and neighbor of Mr. Rice played a role in the case, which drew national press and television attention.
As Gordon Zubrod, the assistant attorney general who prosecuted the case put it: ''We've been arresting the pillars of the community all over the country.''
Forty-year-old Michael Phillippo was one of those pillars of the community. But he was also holding more than $3 million in drug money for an Air America friend in a secret hiding place behind a wine rack in his basement.
''He and his family lived a few blocks from my home in an affluent suburban neighborhood in North Tarrytown, in New York's Westchester County,'' Mr. Rice writes in ''Trafficking.'' ''Phillippo is a husky, likable, good-natured fellow, described by one friend as 'a great big teddy bear.' A graduate of Cornell's School of Hotel Administration, he was the manager of the Ardsley Country Club. When questioned by reporters after the arrest, club members vouched for his diligence and character.''
Mr. Rice, who said he and Mr. Phillippo were Little League coaches together, emphasized that his neighbor was really a small fry in the cocaine ring.
''I couldn't believe he was involved in something like a cocaine ring, because he seemed like such a nice guy,'' Mr. Rice said of his neighbor. ''When I learned about the rest of the ring, of which he was just a small part, they were all thought to be nice guys - educated, well respected, not criminals, not Mafiosi, not Colombians. They could be anyone's next-door neighbors.''Air America, a company in Scranton, Pa., that added extra fuel tanks and made other modifications to small planes to enable them to fly great distances nonstop. When Mr. Luytjes flew loads of cocaine into the United States, he reportedly earned $1 million a trip, and officials said he took a cut of the $1 million when he assigned other pilots to transport the drugs.
Mr. Rice said a very important key to completing his book was the Federal Government's release of a 600-page debriefing document from Mr. Luytjes.
''Rik is a wonderful storyteller,'' Mr. Rice said. ''He had an incredible memory. He told his entire story about Air America the way he would want it to be told, as a romantic adventure. I realized also that he was a compulsive liar. If not outright lying, he always colored things that made him look innocent or more romantic than he was. You see, I had heard those same stories from other members of the ring.''
''Trafficking'' has gone into a second printing and a third printing has been ordered. The book is a best seller in the Scranton area, where several figures in the Air America ring lived.
Mr. Rice lives in North Tarrytown with his wife, Annegret, an artist and real estate agent. They have two sons. ''She was not overjoyed with the subject,'' Mr. Rice said of his wife's reaction to his work on the book. ''I think she got tired of the dinner-table conversation about cocaine and drug smuggling. About dinnertime on Sundays, I would get collect calls from prisons.
''I joke about these guys looking upon this as an adventure, but it was sort of an adventure for me to just be involved in it.''
Mr. Rice said he wrote the book for people like himself, people who had read the papers and watched the evening news and heard about big cocaine busts.
''We don't connect them with us,'' he said. ''All those stories are about criminals, about evil people. All of us don't believe that those can be our neighbors.
''As my neighbor said - and I quoted him in the book - he was annoyed that all of his neighbors said, how could you have done this sort of thing? He said, 'Do you really think none of my neighbors would have been at least tempted if they had had the same opportunity? Of course they would say no quickly. Perhaps too quickly.' ''
 
The Trial Of Levi Weeks
Or the Manhattan Well Mystery
 
By Estelle Fox Kleiger
Academy Chicago Publishers. 224 pages. $18.95.
If the reader is interested in traveling nearly two centuries into the past and visiting the sights and sounds surrounding America's first recorded murder trial, then ''The Trial of Levi Weeks'' is the proper transportation.
The time is Dec. 22, 1799. The place is lower Manhattan, then the center of New York City. A 22-year-old woman, Gulielma Sands - known as Elma - leaves the home where she boards with the respectable Quaker family of a cousin. She has said privately that she is to be married this night to another boarder, Levi Weeks.
Elma Sands does not return, and her bruised body is found a week later in the depths of the Manhattan Well. Levi Weeks stands accused.
The Elma Sands case stirred the passions of the city's 60,000 residents. Here was a woman of good family found in a most horrible condition. As a witness at the well when her body was recovered testified:
''It looked like a person who had been walking against the wind - flush but not so much so as she appeared a few days after. Her appearance was horrid enough - her hat and cap off, her hair hanging all over her head, her comb was yet hanging in her hair, tied with a white ribbon; her shawl was off; her gown was torn open with great violence, and her shoes were off.''
The curious public went to the boardinghouse in such numbers that her body was taken to the porch for public display.
Levi Weeks, a carpenter, was the brother of Ezra Weeks, a builder who erected Alexander Hamilton's estate house, The Grange, which still stands on Convent Avenue in upper Manhattan. He also dealt with Aaron Burr and supplied wood for pipes for the Manhattan Company water system, which owned the well in which Elma Sands's body was found.
Hamilton, Burr and Brockholst Livingston represented Levi Weeks. The prosecutor was an assistant attorney general, Cadwallader David Colden, who 10 years after the Weeks trial would be Mayor of New York City and later yet a United States Representative. Four years after the trial, Burr would kill Hamilton in a duel in Weehawken, N.J.
This is the first book for Estelle Fox Kleiger, who has published articles in American History Illustrated. The 15-year resident of Scarsdale said she began collecting material for the volume many years ago, when she saw a reference to the case in a small exhibition at the New-York Historical Society in Manhattan.
''The Trial of Levi Weeks'' offers the full transcript of the first murder trial recorded in the United States, which was taken in shorthand by William Coleman, a clerk of the circuit court.
''I'm not greatly interested in crime, but I am interested in social history,'' Mrs. Kleiger said. ''I've found that sensational crime was a good way of finding the thinking of the time, the social mores and just about everything else.''
The defense team attacked the prosecution on two main points. One, that there had been no murder at all, that the young Sands woman had committed suicide. Two, that the defense had accounted for all but about a half-hour of Weeks's whereabouts that evening.
''I don't think that Elma could have made her way to the well alone,'' Mrs. Kleiger said. ''It was supposed to have been a terrible night. I don't think she could have found it. I think someone must have led her there.''
Murder, or no murder? Was Weeks found guilty, or not guilty? A partial answer lies in the book.
Mrs. Kleiger, who has two grown children, said she has begun collecting material on a murder that took place in 1836. ''This, too, was a very sensational one - a murder in a brothel,'' she said.
 
On an Average Day
By Tom Heymann
 
Fawcett Columbine. 228 pages. $6.95.
What is average? What happens in America on an average day? Well, Tom Heymann, who fashioned his first book ''On an Average Day'' out of his interest about statistics and demographics, lets the reader know, in an easy-to-digest form.
''I've always been a trivia buff,'' said Mr. Heymann, who lives in Chappaqua with his wife, Grace, an assistant grants officer for the Council for the Arts in Westchester. They have a son, Gabriel, 1 1/2 years old. Mr. Heymann employed statistics and demographics in his previous job as vice president for program development for Lorimar Home Video in California. ''I wanted to find a way to share that kind of information that would be acceptable and fun for the general population.'' ''On an Average Day'' has been plugged on the Arsenio Hall show ''Arsenio Hall used the book in his monologue one night,'' Mr. Heymann said. ''He was talking about the number of people who still call Elvis Presley [four call Graceland daily asking to speak to the King] and the number of people who use condoms [1,109,589 are sold; 443,836 to women]. Regis Philbin focused on economics - how many Americans begin work each morning for a Japanese company [214]. A lot of people are using it in groups and putting it into a game format and quizzing each other about it. I know of a teacher in New York City who is using the book to get students in the third to fifth grade turned on to numbers.'' The book does have an addictive quality to it. Some examples: ''On an average day American children watch three-and-a-half hours of telvision, during which time they will see, 5 beer and wine commercials, 33 acts of violence and 38 sexual references and innuendos''; ''On an average day, 1 American is injured by lightning, 35 are injured by fireworks, 68 are injured playing golf, 104 are injured while shaving, 153 are injured using chain saws, 189 are injured using lawn mowers, 307 are injured in the bathtub or shower.''
Mr. Heymann noted that his first writing outside of a business context would not be his last: ''It's becoming a series and the next book to come out - in the fall - will be 'On an Average Day in the Soviet Union.' ''
The author said he continues to act as a consultant on educational videos and audio cassettes but added that with his ''efforts in the book area, I've been doing less.''
''I'm enjoying writing,'' he said. ''It's a very solitary pursuit but you don't have to worry about office politics. At the same time, however, you don't have a lot of people to bounce ideas around with. You have to govern yourself.''

For a Fund-Raiser, Women Develop A Calendar of Men

DATELINE: NORTHAMPTON, Mass.

 BODY:
A new Smith College calendar portrays unusual representatives of a women's college - men.
The calendar, called ''The Men of Smith,'' mocks pinup calendars at the University of Southern California and elsewhere, which feature men with hairy chests wearing G-strings.
''The Men of Smith'' is not beefcake, its promoters say. Instead, it features professors and staff members. It is intended to show brain, not brawn, said Marie Macri, a senior art major from West Hartford, Conn., who came up with the idea for the calendar. 
Selling for $8 each, the calendars are intended to help pay the $2,000 in printing costs of Smith's annual humor magazine, the Porcupine Rag. Ms. Macri, one of the magazine's founders, said she had been concerned that students might consider the calendar sexist for excluding women, but she said their reactions have been positive.
''If it were sexist, we'd be portraying men as empty vessels,'' said Karen Libsch, a sophomore classics major from Salt Lake City.
Many students said they would not have wanted a beefcake calendar. ''Why should we insult men by putting them in bathing suits, showing their hairy chests, when we complain about women in bathing suits being plastered all over posters and calendars?'' said Gwen Lohse, a sophomore government major from Attleboro, Mass.
The staff members of the Porcupine Rag chose popular male faculty members and men from the security and service staffs for the calendar. Timothy Contant, a short-order cook at the student center, who is Mr. February in the calendar, said he was nervous about the venture. ''When you know your face is going to be spread all over campus, you begin to wonder how you're going to look,'' he said, adding, ''I was born in February, so I wanted that month.''
William Hurley, a security officer who was shown with a fellow officer, Robert Young, said he had no reservations. ''There are so many men on campus,'' he said, ''I was honored they picked me.'' Smith, which enrolls 2,700 women, employs 520 men and 898 women, a college spokeswoman said.
Stanley Lewis, an assistant professor of art, is shown in the calendar surrounded by his sculptures. Randall Bartlett, an economics professor, is shown holding his son, David, and reading from an economics book he wrote.
But not all models were humans. The male for March is a dog that the college president, Mary Maples Dunn, had owned. The dog, called Harpo Dunn, died in December. In an editor's note, Ms. Macri said she was not trying to equate men with dogs.
The only nude in the calendar is on the cover. It is a sculpture by Rodin.

HEADLINE: A Stronger Profile For Culture Is Urged

BYLINE: By BARBARA GAMAREKIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
As the governors of the nation met here this week for the National Governors Conference, a dozen state cultural advisers gathered at the Library of Congress to engage in a little networking.
The mood was upbeat as the cultural representatives told of new political power coming from state legislators' recognition that an enhanced quality of life brings economic benefits to their districts and their states, not only in the form of tourism but also in business opportunities.
''Twenty-five years ago, state arts and humanities councils were just coming into being,'' said Sondra Myers, cultural adviser to Gov. Robert P. Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, who organized the meeting on Tuesday. ''But today, the breadth and depth of the cultural presence in government have grown tremendously, and I thought it important to develop a greater sense of solidarity and collegiality.'' 
The advisers met with James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress, and Representative Mary Rose Oakar, Democrat of Ohio, who has introduced a bill calling for a cabinet-level office for the arts and humanities. Those attending discussed their programs and methods to attract the support of legislators for cultural projects.
Joining them were several national cultural leaders, including Milton Rhodes, president of the American Council on the Arts; Jonathan Katz, director of the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, and John Hammer, of the National Humanities Alliance.
 
'An Attack on Creativity'
''This kind of a meeting bringing the arts and the humanities together is unusual,'' said Jamil Zainaldin, president of the Federation of State Humanities Councils, before the forum.
''Events of the past year with Mapplethorpe have made us aware that an attack on the arts is an attack on creativity, and we can't let the arts take that beating,'' he said about the furor last summer over an exhibition of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe and the ensuing Congressional effort to curtail governmental financing of artwork deemed obscene. ''The specter of Congressional regulation of creativity has helped to bring us together for some common conversation.''
Patric Dorsey, secretary of the Department of Cultural Resources of North Carolina, said: ''Industry looks very closely at the environment of a community before they decide to move into it. Now legislators are asking, 'What are you doing in my county; in my district?' ''
Ms. Myers said: ''I used to be ignored by the lowest staff person on a legislator's staff. These days, I don't know one legislator who doesn't have a theater they want to reclaim for restoration.''
 
On Securing Attention
Pat Clubb of the Texas Commission on the Arts said she discovered that doors were opened to her in the state legislature when the arts were linked to public policy and social issues. ''Most legislators think in terms of broader agendas than just the arts,'' she said. ''So you get their attention by talking about the drop-out rate and what kinds of arts education programs you can put into schools to alleviate dropouts, and you talk about rural arts programs, about minority participation.''
Joan Baldridge, director of the Department of Arkansas Heritage, said: ''We keep in constant contact with state legislators. We inform them of every program and how it helps them in their district. Giving that information to your state legislators is vital: it enables them to share in your success.''
The participants heartily endorsed Representative Oakar's proposal for the creation of a position called Secretary of the Arts and Humanities. She urged their support in lining up co-sponsors for the bill, which she introduced in January.
 
'Where Is Our Revolution?'
''There is nothing like having someone right in the room with you around that cabinet table when you are discussing national priorities,'' she said.
She mentioned that she had just returned from Eastern Europe. ''When we asked, 'What do you want from us?' their priorities amazed me,'' she said. ''They want cultural exchanges, artist exchanges, Peace Corps volunteers to teach English. I must confess, I was a little jealous. I had to ask myself: 'Where is our revolution? What are we doing in our quest for loftier things?' ''
Mr. Billington said: ''We are living in a world where increasingly we have to live by our wits rather than our strength. More and more people are playing the arts-and-humanities game.''

HEADLINE: YOUR TAXES;
Saving to Retire? Tax Code Helps

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
RETIREMENT can be the time to enjoy the fruits of a life's labor, or it can be a time of penny-pinching uncertainty. To be sure it is the first, an understanding of the role tax laws play, both in saving for retirement and during retirement, is essential.
''We're doing a lot of pre-retirement planning, and probably the single most common comment is: 'I wish I had done it 20 years ago','' said George E. L. Barbee, executive director of Price Waterhouse Personal Finance Service, Waltham, Mass.
''Anyone contemplating retirement should ask himself or herself three key questions,'' Mr. Barbee continued. ''One, obviously, is: Can I afford to retire? Secondly, what do I have going for me now in financial terms? Thirdly, what should I do between now and then?'' The answers to these questions will vary greatly, depending large part on a person's age. 
Those who start well in advance can take advantaged of tax-deferred compounding to save for their retirements, for Congress has recognized the need to provide an incentive for retirement savings and has offered a powerful one by shielding money placed in qualified retirement plans from taxation until it is withdrawn.
Even so, Mr. Barbee noted, those under 40 years of age can find retirement savings difficult because they are focusing on raising children, their education, career plans and, increasingly, caring for parents unable to provide for their own health and financial needs.
For this group, the best investment can be the equity in primary or secondary homes, company pensions, health and other insurance, he said. But they should also take advantage of tax-sheltered retirement accounts, such as I.R.A.'s, company-sponsored 401(k) plans - particularly when an employer makes matching contributions - and Keogh plans for the self-employed, he added.
The 40- to 55-year-old group often finds itself in a much tougher position. They are tugged at both ends -meeting college costs and the needs of parents, as well as of rising health-care costs, so their own retirement plans may get short shrift.
One way out of this financial bind for those over age 55, Mr. Barbee suggested, may lie at home. Many parents continue to maintain larger homes than they need.
The parents can often pare living expenses and receive a one-time windfall to invest by selling those homes and buying smaller ones, for homeowners over 55 can escape Federal taxes on capital gains of up to $125,000 on the sale of a home.
The first step in retirement planning is to project cash income and living costs, which can be difficult.
Laura Shanley, tax partner in Ernst & Young, said, ''These projections are often overly optimistic because they are based on the belief that living expenses will decline after retirement. She cautioned that inflation has become one of the most important variables in planning ahead.
Mr. Barbee pointed out that at a 4 percent inflation rate, which is a bit less than the 4.6 percent the Government calculated for 1989, an expected $117,000 of future income would be reduced to $100,000 by 1993; $122,600 would be worth $60,500 in 2007; $142,000 would shrink in value to $42,100 in 2020.
Once a person reaches retirement age, or changes jobs and is vested in a pension plan, a crucial decision is how to take the money out. Withdrawals must begin by age 70 1/2.
''If you want the distribution of lump sum payouts to provide a stream of income throughout retirement,'' Mr. Barbee said, ''it is generally preferable to roll the funds into an I.R.A. The funds will not be initially reduced by taxes, and the portion not withdrawn will continue to earn interest deferred.''
Despite the political furor over how to fund Social Security, the system will continue to play a large role in the retirement plans of most people.
Andrew E. Zuckerman, senior manager of employee benefits and compensation at Grant Thornton in Washington, advised those planning to retire to consider carefully when to start receiving Social Security. For those under age 70 earnings can cause a loss of Social Security benefits, and other income can subject Social Security payments to taxation.

1866 Building Gets a Reprieve

BYLINE: By LYN RIDDLE

 BODY:
SPURNED in its application for a permit to demolish the 124-year-old, downtown Tracy-Causer building, the Fineberg Group, a Wellesley, Mass., developer, has decided instead to restore the 1866 structure.
Preservationists say the decision shows the benefit of the city's demolition ordinance, which was passed in 1988 after a public outcry over the demolition of two other historic properties. The ordinance forces property owners to prove a building proposed for demolition has no economic value. 
''It shows how effectively an ordinance can work,'' said Deborah Andrews, executive director of Greater Portland Landmarks, a private nonprofit preservation group. ''Without the law on your side, you have a hard time saving old buildings.''
The three-story Greek Revival building was put up shortly after a fire in 1866 destroyed much of this city. It is historically significant because most of the buildings built after the fire were of the more popular Victorian style. It was done in the older style because the owner, John Tracy, a tinsmith, wanted it built quickly to house his business and a grocery.
''It is one of the few remaining examples of what commercial architecture looked like after the fire,'' said Martha Deprez, director of preservation services for Greater Portland Landmarks.
Restoration is to start in the spring, to a design by CSS Architects of Wakefield, Mass., with completion expected by fall, said John Sherman, project manager for the Fineberg Group. So far, a restaurant is the only tenant for the building, which will have 8,000 square feet of space, plus a two-story, 3,000-square-foot addition to the rear. It will occupy the basement and first floor and part of the second. The rest will be office space. Leasing rates have not been set.
Without disclosing figures, Mr. Sherman said it was going to cost more to renovate the building than it would have to raze it and start afresh.
''We are very fortunate that Portland withstood a lot of the urban renewal thrust of the 1960's,'' Ms. Andrews said. ''Neighborhoods are remarkably intact.''
For years, developers, buoyed by Federal tax credits, seemed more interested in restoring buildings than in tearing them down, but this changed when the tax credits were removed in 1986. Last week the City Council passed an ordinance requiring city review of any remodeling or additions to historic properties.
''At long last, the city has been convinced that it must take the lead in preserving public buildings,'' Ms. Andrews said.

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY Q & A: BILL MATHESIUS;
Favoring the Legalization of Illicit Drugs

BYLINE: By JEFFREY HOFF

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
BILL MATHESIUS, the Mercer County Executive since 1980, is the most prominent elected official in New Jersey to support publicly the legalization of drugs like marijuana, cocaine and heroin. He is a former Mercer Prosecutor and an assistant United States attorney.
A Republican, Mr. Mathesius has been speaking before Chambers of Commerce and other groups about drug abuse. He says he hopes his statements will initiate a broader debate on the issue in the state.
His first public mention of legalizing drugs came in his October 1988 State of the County Message. By his 1989 State of the County Message, he had solidified his own position, and he spoke strongly in support of legalizing drugs. When he was Mercer County Prosecutor from 1973 to 1975, Mr. Mathesius said, he was opposed to legalization of heroin and cocaine. 
Mr. Mathesius, a law graduate of Seton Hall University, lives in Hopewell Township with his wife, Michelle.
Q. Why legalize drugs?
A. Legalization is an imprecise term that means different things to different people. To the parents of a 14-year-old who may believe their kid will suddenly have access to drugs, that is not what I mean.
I speak in terms of controlled access and controlled distribution. The simple reason I am for something other than what we are doing is that what we are doing now does not work. We are kidding ourselves and the public to suggest that you can lock everybody up. We don't have the money. We don't have the jail cells and we don't have the capacity to ruin generations of minorities, which is what is happening.
Q. Do you find there is any ability to stop the use of drugs on the streets?
A. I say without any equivocation we can't stop it. We can't stop it the way we are trying to stop it and with the system that we have.
Q. What do you see as the failure of law enforcement?
A. The criminal-justice system has become so overburdened with delays it costs approximately $2,000 per arrest. You don't have an economical system. You don't have a system that is dispensing justice. It has no reliability, and it is now being overburdened by a fantastic influx of drug cases.
It costs $100,000 to build a jail cell. If I was going to take all the money available from the Federal ''war on drugs,'' you could absorb $7 billion in New Jersey to build the capital facilities needed and you still would have to operate them and then have the rest of the country to worry about.
In Mercer County I have a prosecutor who wants another $500,000 in his budget. I had an uprising in the jail, where most of them are small-time druggies, and we are not proving anything by putting them in a box.
Q. Are you saying we are treating people unfairly? Instead of building jails, we should be offering other solutions?
A. Absolutely. It's much more of a medical problem than a criminal-justice problem. It's got to be oriented to rescuing people rather than disposing them in jails.
What happens in jails? The best that happens in jail is you are in a holding pattern for months or years of your life, and you get out no worse than you went in. The actual fact is you will tend to come out more sophisticated and more hopeless than you went in.
Q. What do we know about who is in jail?
A. Eighty percent are in for simple possession. So you are talking about a lot of chumps in jail. You can argue all you want about the moral issues about permitting a person to abuse himself with drugs, with alcohol, with nicotine. As far as I am concerned, what people want to do to themselves is a secondary issue. When they start hurting other people, then I get upset. And that is what jails should be for. To protect other people. Not to protect a person against themself.
Q. There are people who feel that is the point. That we need to keep people off the streets so they don't hurt other people. That is what jails are for.
A. The reason they have to go to jail is that they can't get the drugs that they want. So they rip people off. They mug, they sell, they use, and if they were provided access to drugs, perhaps they would not have to mug as many old people or stick up as many bars or burglarize houses.
Q. How do you envision providing access to drugs? Do you see marijuana, cocaine and heroin being available the way bourbon is or the way methadone is or the way Valium is?
A. You have to start from a broad substance-abuse policy that is consistent. That would include more controls on alcohol, more control on cigarettes, on all the panorama of drugs.
Q. You see that as part of a package?
A. Yes, that is part of the whole picture. Increased control on substances which people use and abuse. Then you have to gradate those substances. You have to determine the severity of the implications of their use.
When I was Prosecutor in Mercer County, I functionally decriminalized marijuana in Mercer County. I told my investigators we were not prosecuting people who were using marijuana and leaving other people alone. We had Princeton University, which at that time probably could have put to sleep the entire community with the use of marijuana, with no damage done.
Other drugs I am open to suggestion, to experimentation of how you dispense them. Perhaps with a doctor's certification, similar to the way you dispense drugs per se.
Q. How does legalization work in terms of policy, say in Mercer County, if one were no longer arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine, crack? Perhaps you would be saving money?
A. If you assume there are 10,000 people who could be locked up today in the City of Trenton, that is 10,000 people are violating drug laws, and you multiply that by the $100,000 it costs per jail cell, that is $1 billion. Be conservative and say 5,000 people; that is $500 million that could be used primarily for education.
The Head Start program happens to be the best anti-drug program going. The conditioning, the imprinting upon young people, is the best anti-drug program. Take the money we are throwing away in prison and redirect it toward education, toward rehabilitation, toward drug treatment, as opposed to incarceration. So if the 9-year-old addict shows up, you might be able to help him.
Q. How do you respond to the national drug policy director, William J. Bennett, who believes drug education does not work?
A. I have found many of the so-called drug czar's statements so bizarre that I welcome them because they fall on their face as illogical. People can see they are wrong.
Q. How do you as a County Executive begin to look toward a program within your own budget?
A. How I do it is I am not going crazy building jails. I am not going to fund a prosecutor $500,000 more so he can hire four more prosecutors, six more investigators, so he can do more investigation of drugs. For him to convict more people does not prove a thing, and we would not be getting at the root. We would be dealing with a symptom.
Q. How do you respond to those people who say perhaps we cannot stop it, but it is ethically, perhaps morally, wrong for society to say this is O.K.? Are you saying this is O.K.?
A. I am saying it is a moral question on which reasonable people disagree. If people are not hurting other people, if people are making considered choices of their own.
Q. But you would be in favor of increased restrictions on cigarettes and alcohol? You give two messages there.
A. No. No. The increased restrictions relate entirely to the effect on people and how they operate under whatever it is they are abusing. If a person wants to sit in a corner of his house and smoke marijuana until his ears catch on fire, God bless him. I am not going to make a moral judgment for him.
Q. But while you accept the right of individuals to do what they want, you are also in favor of programs in schools telling children this is not a healthy way of life.
A. Absolutely. You are making a clear message similar to the message that has resulted in the decrease in smoking. And we tell them if you are going to use coke, maybe your heart will fibrillate and you will die. There should be appropriate warnings that you may be Len Bias or Stanley Wilson. You might drop dead.
Q. Could you have this discussion at the State House?
A. It is very dangerous for politicians to discuss this subject. I have been threatened with my position on drugs. In the last campaign, people ran against the Republican Freeholders saying that Mathesius wants to legalize drugs. It is an exposure that most politicians are not willing to make. Politicians come up and say to me, and police do the same thing, ''You are right, but I can't say anything about it.'' None of them who run for office would have the temerity to do so.

HEADLINE: To the Dying, Life Policy Can Bring Money Now

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
For anyone who is terminally ill, with 18 months or less to live, Rob T. Worley Sr., of Albuquerque, N.M., has an offer: Assign a life insurance policy to his company, Living Benefits Inc., and get up to 80 percent of the policy's value, now.
Mr. Worley's two-year-old company was apparently the first of its kind, but the concept of cashing in life insurance policies early is gaining popularity as more people confront the rising cost of dying, and more business owners see what looks like a low-risk profit.
But in most states, insurance regulators have not come to grips with what some say is a potentially exploitative business.
''Some people make it sound like you're a crook or you're doing something ghoulish,'' said Mr. Worley, who works with his son, Rob T. Worley Jr., an insurance agent. ''But all you have to do is go to a hospital and talk to people who are dying, and you will see what a great need there is for this. If sick people have cash, they can get better-quality health care and live with dignity. Without cash, they can't.'' 
 
Enthusiasm From One User
What Living Benefits offers is a contract under which the company is assigned the life insurance policy as the sole beneficiary; it takes on responsibility for any premiums due, while the policyholder is given 55 to 80 percent of the face value to spend. The exact amount depends on prevailing interest rates and on a determination by the company's medical panel of how long the policyholder is expected to live.
''It has made all the difference in the world to get the cash that lets me survive independently,'' said David F., who spoke on the condition that his full name not be used. A Los Angeles AIDS patient, David has cashed in four policies, getting more than $100,000 from Mr. Worley. ''They have been nothing but first class with me, and I cannot express the state of elation I feel to be able to pay my own bills and reap my own harvest in a way you never expect when you buy life insurance.''
Mr. Worley said he had bought about 50 policies since starting the company two years ago. Business has been picking up, he said, and another 50 applications are under review.
New Mexico last year became the first state to address the legality of contracts for such benefits, passing a law authorizing them. The law, prompted by Mr. Worley's operations, requires companies to make sure that the seller is of sound mind and understands that he is terminally ill. Insurance departments in several other states are investigating the issue.
 
Practice Labeled as Illegal
In February, in response to an inquiry from a Manhattan druggist who asked if it would be legal to start such a business, the New York State Insurance Department published an informal opinion that it is against the law to solicit or buy a stranger's life insurance policy.
''If you're terminally ill and destitute, and your relative says he'll give you money if you make him your beneficiary, that's O.K.,'' said Alan Rachlin, the insurance department lawyer who made the ruling. ''But if a stranger who has no insurable interest in you advertises to buy it, that violates the law. It's against public policy to speculate on death.''
In January, the Prudential Insurance Company of America announced a plan that would let policyholders have the bulk of their life insurance benefits if the policyholder has six months to live or less or has spent six months in a nursing home and is unlikely to leave. The new plan is to be offered at first to policyholders in 10 states where regulators have approved it and then expanded as other states approve it.
One drawback to the Prudential plan and other such programs has been that life insurance benefits paid before death are usually taxable, while those paid after death are not. But legislation introduced in Congress last week would make benefits tax-free for policyholders with less than a year to live. The sponsors said many Americans with cancer or AIDS need programs like Prudential's to handle astronomical health costs.
''Two more insurers, Connecticut Mutual and Metropolitan Life are considering plans similar to Prudential's,'' said Robert Waldron, a spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurance, an industry group. ''Everyone knows there's a great need for help in this area, with the costs of medical care, especially for people with AIDS.''
 
Several Follow the Leader
Several people around the country have seen business potential in meeting that need.
''We were the first on the face of the earth to do this, but I've had calls from all kinds of people who see the market in it,'' said Mr. Worley, who says he has used several of his other business interests, including a baking company and a leasing company, to finance Living Benefits.
Mr. Worley said that he knew of people who were offering cash for life insurance policies in Miami and New York and that he had had queries from a mortgage banker in Dallas, a lawyer in San Antonio and others about starting similar businesses.
While some expected insurance companies to cut into business, Mr. Worley said he did not.
While some expected insurance companies to cut into business, Mr. Worley said he did not.
''The people we're dealing with don't want to wait until they have a life expectancy of less than six months,'' he said. ''They want to use the money to extend their lives or improve the quality of their care. We have gotten clients with Prudential policies, even after they announced their plan.''
Some AIDS groups say that getting death benefits before entering the terminal stage of an illness could do more harm than good. For one thing, those who get substantial death benefits may lose their eligibility for Medicaid. Then, too, the groups say, those who think of themselves as about to die may give up the fight to live.
''I can see the justification where you are clearly terminal,'' said Lewis Katoff, director of client services at Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York. ''But you can't predict whether someone with AIDS is going to live 15 months or five years. I was diagnosed three and a half years ago, when the evidence suggested I would live about nine months, and here I am. Psychologically, it would have been very damaging to give up, stop working and wait to die.'' Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Metropolitan Life Insurance

HEADLINE: A Generous Reply to the Neediest

 BODY:
The 78th annual appeal of The New York Times Neediest Cases collected a total of $4,372,283, surpassing last year's record by more than $332,000.
The city's economy may be less than exuberant, but citizen generosity appears to be at an all-time high. The two phenomena are, of course, closely related: greater and more visible need has sparked an even more compassionate response than in any previous year.
This demonstration of concern has been achieved in response to the fund's traditional low-key appeal, which offers the assurance that all contributions flow entirely to those in need, without any deduction for fund-raising or administration.
All that remains now is for The Times to offer heartfelt thanks to all who have shown how much they care, and to underscore one vital point: while the official drive has ended, the need continues. As in the past, the fund operates throughout the year.
Contributions and bequests from here on will be credited to the 79th appeal, which begins next December. Such donations, tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law, should be sent to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, P.O. Box 5193, General Post Office, New York, N.Y. 10087.

HEADLINE: I Quit To Sound An Early Alarm

BYLINE: By Ariel Sharon; Ariel Sharon was Israel's Minister of Industry and Trade.

DATELINE: TEL AVIV

 BODY:
I resigned from the Israeli Government because I fear that its present political initiatives, even if founded in a sincere attempt to achieve peace, reward the Palestinians for their terrorism and increase the risks of war.
What Israel should be doing immediately is putting an end to the Palestine Liberation Organization's terrorism, which has claimed hundreds of innocent Jewish and Arab victims in the last two years alone.
The Government's initiatives include movement toward Palestinian elections in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip. They are paving the way for establishment of a second Palestinian state in the land of Israel, west of the Jordan River, in addition to the existing one, the Kingdom of Jordan. 
But no democratic elections would take place because of the P.L.O.'s on-going terrorism; instead, the state would be created by the P.L.O. Such a state would control strategic mountainous terrain on the West Bank overlooking the coastal plain.
This means the width of Israel's coastal plain (where two-thirds of the Jewish population lives) would, on average, shrink to about 14 miles. This would constitute a death sentence, for Israel's main infrastructure would be at the mercy of Palestinian and Arab missiles, rockets and artillery, as well as terrorism and a large-scale conventional invasion.
The Government's policies are also leading to a renewed division of Israel's sovereign and eternal capital, Jerusalem.
Predictably, the Arab states will take our policies as an indication of weakness, and will begin a campaign of total military aggression. The continued state of war between Israel and the Arab states (apart from Egypt) has no logic or justification.
If regional piece is to be reached -in the near future, I hope - it can be achieved only if the following conditions are met:
First, an opening of the bridges between Israel and Jordan. Second, democratization of the totalitarian regimes in the Arab countries. Third, reduction and equalization of the military might of the two parties. Fourth, a solution to the problems of Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip. Fifth, conclusion of a formal peace treaty between Israel and the Arab states.
The long-term pressure exerted by the U.S. undoubtedly has contributed to the political tremors in the Soviet Union and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Today a similar U.S. effort must be directed toward the Arab regimes, for the best guarantee of real peace is genuine democracy in the Middle East.
A stable peace can be achieved only by a drastic reduction of the great military threat. Surely we can reduce and equalize the military strength of the two parties, even as relations between NATO and the Warsaw Pact are undergoing a historic change. First, the long-range arms systems should be reduced, and then tactical forces like armor and combat aircraft. The aim would be to return to the force levels of the 50's, when the mutual military threat was minimal.
Mideast disarmament must be dealt with at the global level. In contrast to the Soviet Union, which is reducing its armed forces, the Arab states are escalating the arms race in our region. Their tremendous purchasing power and the surpluses created by the force-reduction agreements in Europe are making disarmament more difficult to accomplish.
Pressuring Israel to reach immediate solutions to the differences with its neighbors instead of first guaranteeing democratization and disarmament throughout the Arab world amounts to asking Israel to be prepared to commit suicide for the sake of peace.
A more fruitful approach would lie in working out interim procedures so that Israel and the Arabs states can test each other and gradually build mutual trust. For example, it is necessary immediately to open the bridges between Israel and Jordan in the same way the Berlin wall was pulled down and barbed wire dismantled in Eastern Europe.
Once the Jordan River bridges are open, the free traffic in both directions would help create a climate of peace. Instead of symbolizing enmity and suspicion, the river would signify hope for peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians.
The Arabs cynically chose to turn the Palestinian refugee problem into a political weapon. The U.S., European countries and Israel must join together to assist these refugees. It is possible to start toward this goal by urbanizing and industrializing the Gaza Strip, where hundreds of thousands of refugees live.
Several Arab countries could well be the first to enjoy the dividends of peace if my program were instituted. Egypt, for example, is undergoing a chronic and ever more acute economic crisis. Why is it using a large part of its U.S. aid for military growth? Why does it need to maintain a gigantic army? Why does it need the 700 new tanks the U.S. is about to give it at no cost? Who is threatening Egypt, especially since Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, is now its close friend?
Jordan, too, is undergoing a crisis and is investing vast amounts in armaments. Against whom will these arms be used - Israel?
One of my intentions in resigning from the Cabinet was to make sure no one would be able to ask why no member of the Government's inner circle stood up in time to warn against what was likely to happen (as they now ask of the Jewish leaders of Europe in the 30's and America in the 40's).
Freed from Cabinet restraints, I am trying to exploit the golden opportunities resulting from the relaxation of international tensions so that Israel can move further down the road toward genuine peace.
More than 13 Likud members of the Knesset who share my opposition to policies advanced by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir have been working with me and two Cabinet ministers to try to push the peace process the right way.
The proposed summit meeting of the Israeli, Egyptian and U.S. Foreign Ministers is the wrong way. It would not encourage the peace process but rather would lead to false expectations and more bloodshed.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
What Savings Crisis?

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
One of the peculiar complaints of the Japanese - presumably repeated by Prime Minister Kaifu to President Bush at the Rancho Mirage summit meeting - is that Americans don't save enough. We are accused of spending too much on Japanese cars and other imports, thus increasing our trade deficit through no fault but our own.
Mr. Bush agrees; he wants to attract savings by setting up special accounts into which individuals could deposit up to $2,500 annually, with interest tax-free. The Democrats also agree; they're backing a 50 percent tax deduction on the original deposit (up to $2,000) in an individual retirement account. 
There are at least two problems with these proposals. The first is that they won't work. The second is that what they're supposed to fix ain't broke.
They won't work because most of the ''savings'' that would go into these accounts would be shifted out of other forms of investment, not increasing the total. That was the problem with the I.R.A. scheme of several years ago, now defunct. Even if such ideas did result in some additional savings, banks would only re-lend the ''saved'' funds for consumer spending - most conspicuously through credit cards.
Don't take my word for it. The economics writer Robert J. Samuelson pointed to these flaws in an article in The Washington Post. He suggested that both plans actually formed ''a respectable pretext for enacting new tax relief for the middle class,'' and probably would ''end up reducing national savings.''
Mr. Samuelson also provides authority for the assertion that there is no U.S. savings problem that needs fixing. ''The great savings debate,'' he declared in The Post, ''is mostly a political charade.'' Similarly, Robert Eisner, an economist at Northwestern University, referred in an article in The New York Times to a ''phantom savings problem'' that is ''badly overstated.''
What are the facts? Mr. Samuelson wrote that ''between 1980 and 1988, the private savings rate [in the U.S.] averaged 16.7 percent of gross national product, down negligibly from the 16.8 percent average between 1950 and 1979.'' Personal savings did fall, leading to the perceived ''savings problem''; but three-fourths of new savings result from the retained profits and depreciation of business -which rose. The increased business savings rate offset the personal savings drop, as it has for a century.
Mr. Eisner pointed out that ''we are not alone.'' Net national savings in Japan declined by 7.9 percent from 1976 to 1987; savings usually decline as nations reach higher income levels and growth rates fall off. On the other hand, as Mr. Samuelson noted, the Soviet Union has a higher investment rate than the U.S., but its poorly managed economy is a basket case nevertheless.
What about the Federal deficit? Doesn't it prove that the U.S. doesn't save enough? Mr. Samuelson disagrees; but he does regard the deficit as a ''drag'' and favors deficit reduction over tax-cut boondoggles ostensibly aimed at enhancing savings.
Deficits, however, stimulate the economy; they inspire not only consumption but more private investment, as businesses respond to increased sales by adding to plant and equipment. In Mr. Eisner's view, this leads to more than enough additional private saving to finance the greater deficits. Reducing the deficit, if it slowed economic growth, might therefore actually reduce savings, too.
Besides, U.S. savings are calculated less inclusively than those of most countries, Mr. Eisner asserted. Most count as savings ''government investments in roads, airports and other infrastructure''; if the U.S. savings account included such investments, he calculated, ''our net national savings would have risen by $53 billion in 1988, from 2.95 percent of net national product to 4.17 percent - an astonishing 41 percent.''
He gave this homely example: If a family spends money to educate its children, surely that family is ''saving'' for the future - but the costs of education are not counted in U.S. national savings, nor is spending on the environment or on research and development.
Mr. Eisner therefore advocates more realistic accounting and greater Federal investment in ''the public, national saving that provides the real defense of our future'' -education, for the best example. Isn't that more practical than those deceptively political savings schemes? Doesn't it make more sense than pouring additional billions into the military, to guard against a threat ''crumbling before our eyes''?

Thank You, Jesse

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Republicans are joyful that Jesse Jackson has chosen to become the black Stassen.
He could have run for and easily won the mayoralty of Washington, a war zone passing for an American city. He could then have made demands on the Congress for enforcement and education, exhorted the drug-imperiled kids in need of a role model, and built a reputation of a politician willing to put his future on the line in a great cause.
In short, he coulda been a contender. As an elected official who paid his dues in the trenches, he might have earned a spot on the Presidential ticket in 1992, perhaps the top spot in '96. 
But when his moment came, Jesse Jackson choked.
None of that dreary day-to-day responsibility for a man who has tasted adulation at a national convention. Instead, last month's prediction by the columnist A. M. Rosenthal that Jesse would demur proved prescient.
Mr. Jackson fantasizes about being a ''shadow senator'' against the day that the District might become a State. This pitch for representation by geography rather than population subverts the principle of one person, one vote.
Don't hold your breath waiting for that. First, Staten Island would have to secede from New York City and establish a pattern of electing Republicans. Then it would have to be paired for admission with Democratic D.C., as Hawaii and Alaska were, so that neither party would gain an advantage.
Then, in a decade or two, we might have four unnecessary new senators, necessitating another new Senate Office Building. All because one star thought that serving as mayor was too demeaning an audition.
Now to why his decision to turn tail and run for President again has caused such G.O.P. elation.
Let's project ahead two years. Mario Cuomo will be basing his convoluted campaign on Vincentian reasoning (only last week, this iconoclastic pol knocked George Washington as a ''lousy soldier'').
Al Gore will be older but greener; Bill Bradley, under Sidney Pollack's Hollywood direction, will be slam-dunking third-world debt down voters' throats; and Sam Nunn or Chuck Robb will try to sell an economic-defense buildup against the Axis powers.
Against that field, Mr. Jackson will do as least as well as last time out in the Iowa caucuses, but probably dip to 10 percent in the New Hampshire primary, getting only the traditional what-the-hell vote, dismissing a Cuomo or Bradley victory as a Northeast ''hometowner'' win. Then may come California, on the verge of moving its primary up to March 3. Democrats there figure on a low Republican primary turnout because George Bush will be unopposed in 1992, and a big Democratic turnout in a fight for Senator Alan Cranston's seat; that's why Democrats want to put a few propositions on the ballot. California Republicans say no, but national leaders want that primary early because of the Jackson factor.
Mr. Jackson won 38 percent of the vote in California in 1988, a state with a black and Hispanic population of 25 percent and a significant gay vote. He may not do as well as last time, but in a five-man white and nonliberal field, Mr. Jackson will probably win the nation's largest state.
Super Tuesday follows right on. Mr. Jackson will do poorly in Florida, but almost as well as before in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, North and South Carolina. (''And to my friends in Virginia, I want to say that I never considered General Washington to be a 'lousy soldier,' as my Yankee friend Mr. Koo-mo does.'') By the end of March, 60 percent of the delegates will have been chosen, with Mr. Jackson well out front; in mid-April, he will be the only outsider to challenge Governor Cuomo in the New York primary, and will grab a third of those delegates.
Thus will the Democratic Party be a national laughingstock. Its front-runner cannot be nominated because he chose the fun of national campaigning over the work of local governing; all he can do is threaten to bolt and accuse the party of racism if he is not given the Vice Presidency.
Damned if it does not and deluged if it does, the convention must turn to a serious black elected official: Andrew Young if he is elected governor of Georgia, or Gov. Douglas Wilder of Virginia (''and let me say in defense of my fellow Virginian, General Washington . . .'') But Democrats already have 90 percent of the black vote. Thanks to Jesse Jackson, the party will spend all 1992 polishing its racial bona fides, while - barring a major recession -the Bush-Quayle ticket breezes in. That's why Republicans are so delighted Jesse turned down a serious job.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Schools: Rich, Poor, Unequal

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST ORANGE, N.J., March 1

 BODY:
The urban school system here and the suburban district in nearby Millburn are separated by only six miles. Academically, socially and economically, they are worlds apart.
Millburn spends about $1,400 more for each school child in a year, thanks to a wealthier tax base. Its high school's programs are broader than those in the two high schools in East Orange, and its ninth graders score far better on New Jersey's standardized basic skills test.
The differences in the East Orange and Millburn schools - and similar ones in many other urban and suburban districts across New Jersey - are central to a landmark court fight on the constitutionality of the state's school-financing system, its heavy reliance on local real-estate taxes and its inbred advantages for property-rich suburban districts. 
 
A Nine-Year Fight
After nine years of protracted hearings and preliminary rulings, including a state administrative law judge's finding that the system is unconstitutional and the rejection of his decision by the State Education Commissioner, Saul Cooperman, the State Supreme Court is now preparing a final ruling on the issue. It is expected in the next few weeks.
Foes of the existing system want radical changes. The Education Law Center of Newark, which filed the pending challenge in 1981, has urged the Supreme Court to order creation of a uniform statewide per-pupil spending level between $6,200 and $7,000 and to allow automatic increases for poor urban pupils enrolled, say, in compensatory education or bilinqual courses.
Average per-pupil spending statewide was nearly $5,200 last year. Higher Income Tax? Advocates of a new system say the most logical source of any new financing the court orders would be an increased income tax or perhaps creation of a form of regional property tax.
In recent months, the high courts of Texas and Kentucky have ordered equalized per-pupil spending in decisions that struck down their states' school-financing formulas.
Marilyn J. Morheuser, head of the Education Law Center and its chief lawyer in the current court fight, says a uniform per-pupil spending level could require a handful of high-spending suburban districts to reduce programs or staff to get within a proscribed level.
Under her plan, 95 percent of all educational spending would fall within the equalized per-pupil rate and local districts could spend only 5 percent more per child.
''If there is any local leeway, it would be very narrow,'' Ms. Morheuser said.
Kentucky, which is revising its formula, is considering allowing wealthy districts to exceed an equalized rate by 30 percent, said Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States, in Denver.
''Wealthy districts say: 'We can do more. Why should our kids be held back? Why should we be denied?' '' Dr. Newman said. ''That's a big debate. The constitutional question is: Can you hold back the wealthy district?''
Any deep cuts in surburban school spending in New Jersey under an equalized-rate system would likely bring sharp protests from local boards. They have long cherished local control over school spending, and home rule is deep-seated in New Jersey.
Commissioner Cooperman, who is leaving office in June, has fought the lawsuit partly on that ground that local districts are entitled to shape their own programs and spending. He says local districts satisfy the state Constitution's guarantee of a ''thorough and efficient'' education as long as they pass the state's criteria for certification, no matter what they spend per pupil.
In its last major ruling on school financing, in 1973, the State Supreme Court ruled that the constitutional guarantee of a ''thorough and efficient'' education required that all public schoolchildren receive an ''equal educational opportunity.'' That ruling threw out the existing financing formula and led to the Legislature's enactment of the state income tax and a new spending formula in 1975. Both were intended to equalize per-pupil spending.
But the Education Law Center's 1981 suit contends that the formula still relies too much on local property taxes and perpetuates the urban-surburban disparities found unconstitutional by the high court in 1973.
These disparities abound in Millburn and East Orange.
Millburn is rich in property values. Its spacious homes on quaint country lanes fetched an average sales price of $370,000 in 1988, compared with East Orange's median sales price of $84,000. The gulf in real-estate wealth allowed Millburn to spend $6,247 on each school child last year, while East Orange spent $4,867.
The spending variation leads to educational differences.
When Scott High here needed a new library six years ago, a gymnasium was converted. Millburn High's new library was built in a spacious courtyard. Millburn High offers its athletes golf, fencing, ice hockey and lacrosse and its top-level students 14 advanced placement courses. East Orange has nothing similar.
On average, East Orange's teachers have 14 years of experience and earn $35,000 a year, school officials say. Millburn's teachers average 20 years of experience and $41,520 a year.
The pupil-teacher ratio in elementary schools in East Orange is 27 to 1; in Millburn it is 18 to 1.
 
A Bulging High School
Millburn High has plenty of classroom space. Scott High, built here 52 years ago for 800 students, is bulging now with 1,200. The other day, Deborah Mayes's American history class was squeezed into the music room, next to the piano. Ester Lundy was teaching a freshman business course in the typing room as her students tried to balance their open texts atop typewriters.
Scott High's principal, Irene Nichols, said, ''I need three new math teachers, but if I got them, I'd have no place to put them.''
The school-financing fight is reaching a climax at a precarious financial time for New Jersey. A $500 million deficit in the current budget has to be eliminated, and Gov. Jim Florio is struggling to find money to balance a 1990-91 budget he is to introduce on March 15.
A year after the 1975 financing system now under challenge was created, the State Supreme Court found that it was constitutional, if the state gave local districts all the money required by the spending formula.
The Legislature, however, has fully financed the formula only twice in the last 14 years. Money raised for schools and spent elsewhere in the budget since 1975 now totals $657.1 million. Much of that would have gone to poorer urban districts. #56% From Property Taxes Reliance on local property taxes has grown and accounts this school year for nearly 56 percent of all educational spending in the state. Last year, local taxes provided 52.4 percent. Only 14 states relied more heavily on local spending.
Should the court overturn the current financing system and order revisions requiring millions of dollars in new spending for poor urban districts, East Orange's Superintendent, T. Josiha Haig, has a broad shopping list in hand.
Topping his wishes are statewide pupil ratios for teachers, administrators, librarians and social workers; a new 16-room wing at Scott High and a new school for fifth and sixth graders, and more teachers, including two per class in lower elementary grades, to reduce the current 27-to-l pupil-teacher ratio to 17 to 1 in kindergarten to third grade and 21 to 1 from fourth to eighth.
He also wants all-day kindergarten classes, half-day classes for 4-year-olds and an afterschool program for latchkey children.
Equally important, Dr. Haig said, is money for more psychologists, social workers and counselors to help East Orange's students overcome the disadvantages of poverty and the emotional scars of drug, alcohol and child abuse found in some homes here.
In addition, Dr. Haig, who is black, said many of East Orange's students came from households headed by women. ''Many of our young black males don't have enough role models and strong black images in their homes. Our job is to compensate for that. We just need more services.''
Continuity of classroom instruction, Dr. Haig said, is continually disrupted by a turnover in teaching staff, which he said is directly related to under-financing, and by the transiency of East Orange's population. Between 70 and 80 of East Orange's 900 teachers leave annually, most to seek higher-paying jobs in other school districts, he said.
 
Higher Dropout Rate
In the last school year, nearly 22 percent of Scott High's 1,200 students entered or left the school. Another 6.4 percent dropped out. Millburn High's equivalent figures were 2.4 percent and .1 percent.
The stresses of family instability and homelessness on children increases nonacademic burdens on teachers, said Ms. Nichols, principal at Scott.
She told the story of a girl who came to the district recently from California and tried to cut her wrists because of sexual abuse by an uncle.
''We have to deal with her,'' Ms. Nichols said. ''Everybody in this building is locked into children's problems. And the problems are very deep. For many, this school is a sanctuary, a place of peace. We do a lot of hugging of our children. And we need more support in schools than we did 10 or 20 years ago.''

HEADLINE: Job Growth in Health Care Soars

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
The number of jobs in American health care is soaring at a rate three times faster than the growth of the population, troubling experts concerned about the sharp rise in the nation's medical costs. Thirty-seven of every 1,000 Americans worked in health care last year, compared with about 28 for every 1,000 just 10 years earlier.
Wages in the industry are also rising much faster than in the rest of the economy. The Labor Department said that in the last five years, the median weekly pay of salaried doctors increased 30 percent, nurses 31.1 percent and physical therapists 25.8 percent, compared with 16.3 percent for all full-time wage and salary workers.
Experts on the economics of health care attribute some growth to the increasing number of older Americans and to advancements in medical technology that require additional people to push the buttons and decipher the printouts. But many new jobs also owe their existence to the rapid growth in 25 years in the number of people covered by Government and private health insurance and in the kinds of treatments covered. 
 
Unintended Jobs
Attempts by insurers to limit costs by shifting some care outside hospitals have also had the effect of creating extra jobs without an equal reduction in jobs in the hospitals. And the number of record keepers has risen sharply as hospitals and doctors have scrambled to meet demands for paperwork from Federal and private insurers.
All told, the number of health-related employees working for wages or salaries has surged 43 percent, to 8.7 million in 1989, from 6.1 million in 1979, while the population has grown only 10 percent. There were at least 260,000 self-employed doctors and 137,000 dentists last year, compared with about 200,000 self-employed physicians and 117,000 dentists a decade ago.
By the end of the 1990's, at least 12 million Americans will work in health services, even though the growth in population is slowing, the Labor Department and Census Bureau estimate. Based on present trends, the Labor Department said, 7 of the 10 fastest-growing occupations in the 1990's will be in health services.
The rapid growth in spending on health has encouraged comparisons with increases in military spending. ''The medical-industrial complex is larger than the military-industrial complex,'' said Dr. Philip R. Lee, director of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California at San Francisco Big Part of the G.N.P.
Health care, which cost $599 billion last year, absorbed 11.5 percent of the gross national product, up from 8.3 percent in 1975. About 60 percent of the $599 billion went to labor costs. And the nation's spending on health is expected to increase by between 10 percent and 14 percent in each of the next five years, exceeding $1 trillion in 1995 and reaching about 15 percent of G.N.P. in the year 2000, the Government estimates. Military spending peaked at 6 percent of G.N.P. during the Reagan Administration and is currently about 5.5 percent.
To be sure, many Americans strongly approve of spending on health care, and the progress in medicine, while seemingly expensive, has made life considerably better for many people. What is more, the jobs that health care provides are warmly welcomed by most public officials and business groups. Hospitals, for example, are important employers of minority and entry-level workers in cities like New York and Boston. The Texas Medical Center complex is Houston's largest employer, with a $2 billion payroll.
But many experts warn that the huge increases in medical expenditures are sopping up money sorely needed by business and government for other national priorities.
 
Other Social Needs
''The problem is that we have other social needs,'' said Dr. Lee, who is also chairman of the Federal advisory commission on payments to physicians. ''The educational system is deteriorating; so is the infrastructure,'' he said. ''And research, except for military research, is not adequately financed.''
Given these other needs, many experts have expressed concern about unnecessary spending in health care. ''We're spending $100 billion more on health care than any other country would spend if it had a population as large and the same per capita income as the United States,'' Dr. Lee said.
''The health people hate it when you draw the analogy to the Defense Department,'' said Stuart H. Altman, chairman of the Federal hospital payment advisory commission and dean of the Heller School for Social Welfare Studies at Brandeis University. ''But to me, there is a lot of similarity.''
But where the biggest excesses lie is a matter of much debate between the insurers and individuals, and the hospitals and doctors.
 
Consequence of Insurance
On one side are the people trying to control costs. They argue that because Federal and private insurers have in recent decades paid most of the medical bills, patients and health-care providers have seen little reason to hold back on expenses.
Dr. Altman criticizes ''the number of hospital administrators and what we pay them.'' He also thinks that too many consultants, lawyers, strategic planners, marketing people and specialists on selling bonds are on hospital payrolls. Many hospitals could be reduced in size and staff by 10 percent to 20 percent, he said. With these and other cuts in the system, ''easily $50 billion to $60 billion'' could be saved each year, he added.
Experts also attribute the rise in medical costs to the fact that the number of physicians has grown far faster than the population. There were 142 physicians per 100,000 people in 1960. ''We are close to 240 per 100,000 this year,'' said Eli Ginzberg, director of the Conservation of Human Resources project at Columbia University.
 
Increased Competition
The argument goes that with the increased competition for patients, many doctors will perform extra and unnecessary tests and procedures on the patients they do get.
''Physicians are responsible for about 75 percent of all health-care expenditures,'' Dr. Ginzberg said. ''They admit people to hospitals and nursing homes, write prescriptions for drugs, order extra nurses. The constant increase in the number of physicians has a lot to do with the increase in health expenditures.''
Some health economists say there are too many specialists, who have the training, knowledge and inclination to order expensive services, and too few general practitioners or primary-care physicians, who may be less likely to order costly treatments.
Trying to hold down costs, insurers have begun programs that scrutinize medical claims to uncover and prevent excessive spending.
 
Increased Paperwork
But the hospitals and doctors argue that such reviews have vastly increased the amount of paperwork, forcing them to hire extra people to take care of it. Many in the medical field say the insurers' efforts to control costs have made the problem worse. They resent what they call third-party efforts to interfere with the proper care of a patient. And they say that many patients demand certain tests and treatments even if they are not called for.
Critics of insurers' attempts to control costs also say that efforts to reduce the use of hospitals have had distressing side effects. Services provided outside the hospital have often escaped the controls on costs and quality in hospitals. And as patients are increasingly cared for outside hospitals, doctors have expanded their offices, hiring nurses and technicians to run tests and clerks to file reports and send bills - duplicating many hospital services.
''We have one of the highest administrative costs for health care of any country,'' Dr. Lee said. ''Almost every doctor's office has somebody to do the billing and somebody to deal with the managed-care plans,'' he said, referring to the health maintenance organizations and discount arrangements that require extensive record-keeping.
 
Clear Phenomenon
While the best way to deal with surging health-care labor costs may not be clear, the size of the phenomenon certainly is.
Hospitals are still the largest medical employers by far, with 4.6 million workers last year, up 24 percent from 3.7 million in 1979. More than 1.1 million hospital employees are nurses. The number of nurses working inside and outside hospitals rose 50 percent, to 1.7 million, in 10 years, five times as fast as the population increased.
This growth came in part because hospitals have doubled the ratio of nurses to patients since 1975. (Because of cost-conscious efforts to keep people out of the hospital, the patients who go to hospitals now are on average sicker than years ago and require more nursing care.) Also, nursing jobs have opened up outside hospitals, in health maintenance organizations, nursing homes and home health care.
Physicians' payrolls for nurses, technicians and clerks rose sharply, to 1.2 million employees last year, from 739,000 a decade ago, said Dan Hecker, an economist at the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. And the number of doctors, self-employed and on salary, working with patients rose 39 percent, to 373,747 in 1988, from 268,578 in 1978 and may reach 500,000 at the end of the 1990's, the American Medical Association said.
 
Hiring Outside of Hospitals
Employment is also growing fast in the offices of other independent health practitioners like physical therapists, who move out of a hospital to start their own practice and hire assistants, Mr. Hecker said.
The Labor Department said that among the fastest-growing occupations in the 1990's will be medical assistants, home health aides, radiology technicians, medical records technicians and secretaries, physical therapists and surgical technologists.
Wages are also rising in the health-care industry. As hospital workers joined labor unions and the flow of Federal dollars soared, the wages of rank-and-file health workers rose faster than general inflation, ''outpacing employees in the rest of the economy,'' said Victor R. Fuchs, an economist at Stanford University.
For instance, the median weekly wages of registered nurses rose 31.1 percent, to $569 in 1989, from $434 in 1985. Over that period, the salaries of all full-time workers increased by 16.3 percent, barely keeping ahead of the 15.3 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index.
As for self-employed physicians, the average income after office expenses was $160,000 in 1988, up 29 percent from $124,500 in 1985.
In hopes of slowing the growth in spending, members of Congress are discussing ceilings on Government-paid doctor's fees, like those already in force for hospital care.

HEADLINE: Talks End, Wait Begins

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PALM SPRINGS, Calif., March 4

 BODY:
In an era in which the cold war is ending, the Germanys are moving toward reunification and the South African Government has legalized the major black opposition, is it possible to resolve trade disputes with Japan?
The grand strategy that President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu espoused in their weekend talks was to accelerate the internationalization of Japan - giving it a greater voice in world councils and a greater appetite for the world's goods and services.
Should the strategy succeed, Japan's surpluses with the United States and other countries would recede, dampening retaliatory sentiments in Washington. And more yen would be plowed into Latin America, Eastern Europe and other areas hungry for capital. 
 
Vision of the Dangers
If Mr. Kaifu left Palm Springs with a conceptual framework for greater Japanese political influence in the world, he also had a vision of the dangers if he fails to internationalize his economy.
The President told White House reporters Saturday, after Mr. Kaifu left for Tokyo: ''I had, in that one-on-one, the opportunity to be just as clear as any Congressman would have liked me to be on what needs to happen to keep this terribly important relationship on track.''
The President had come to the meeting with letters from lawmakers warning of protectionist reactions if the Japanese, after a decade in which they accumulated $400 billion of trade surpluses with the United States, did not open their markets.
While Mr. Kaifu said all the right things about his determination to make trade problems ''one of the top priorities of my new Cabinet,'' there is still some healthy skepticism about whether he can deliver.
As the President himself put it, ''I think the proof of the pudding is in the eating.''
The House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who has been a sharp critic of Japan, observed today that over the last decade Japanese prime ministers and American Presidents have had any number of meetings at which trade breakthroughs were supposed to have been made, to little avail.
''Nothing has changed,'' Mr. Gephardt said on NBC-TV's ''Meet the Press.''
Taking note of the generalities that both Mr. Kaifu and Mr. Bush used to describe their talks, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee's trade subcommittee, commented today, ''in trade the devil is in the detail.''
 
'U.S. Is Serious About Trade'
But Mr. Baucus, who has also been highly critical of the Japanese, noted that ''the very fact that the summit was held will send a message that the United States is serious about trade.''
The President spoke Saturday of a ''trialogue'' among the United States, Japan and the European allies to promote economic development and ''to think about how Japan can more fully play a leading role in the world's political and economic institutions.''
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama have already begun exploring ways to develop the ''trialogue.''
One possibility would be for a Japanese to become head of either the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund, the two most prestigious global economic institutions, in the next few years.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Kaifu, in their closing statements after the talks, also hinted at deeper monetary understandings, renewing a pledge to cooperate in foreign exchange markets. The dollar has recently climbed in value against the yen, which threatens improvement of the trade deficit by making Japanese goods less expensive.
As an export-oriented superpower, Japan has done very well capitalizing on global free trade while restricting foreigners in its market. Powerful industry groups in Japan have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.
But in some ways the Japanese consumer has gotten short shrift. Mr. Kaifu is trying to build a power base by allying himself with the consumer.
His plans for deregulation, increased antitrust enforcement, more effective land use, a more efficient distribution system and other structural changes in Japanese society -all of which would help internationalize the economy - are being sold politically not as concessions to the United States but as essential ingredients to improve the quality of Japanese life.
President Bush was asked Saturday how confident he was that Mr. Taifu would produce results.
 
'I Wish Him Well'
''Well, he's just won a good victory there,'' he said, referring to the Liberal Democratic Party's victory last month. The President continued: ''He's solidified his party's position. He himself emerges as, I would say, a dynamic new leader. And so we will simply wait and see. But I wish him well.''
Mr. Bush is under pressure from American trade law, which sets deadlines for retaliation against nations that trade unfairly. In coming months, deadlines loom for trade disputes in such sectors as telecommunications, forest products, satellites, supercomputers, shipbuilding and the broader area of structural differences between the United States and Japan.
The deadlines are the result of stepped-up efforts by Congress in 1988 to deal with mounting business complaints about unfair trade abroad, chiefly in Japan.
They also reflect frustrations about the rising trade deficits, even though a greater cause of those deficits, most economists agree, is the weak competitive position of the United States, a condition whose causes include low savings, high consumption, high budget deficits and a corporate emphasis on short-term profits.
The Bush Administration does not want to have to retaliate. As the President noted, it is better to resolve trade imbalances by expanding exports, rather than limiting imports.
 
Retaliation Less Likely
Because of Mr. Kaifu's promises, the weekend meeting between the two leaders probably makes retaliation less likely. Despite the deadlines, the President retains flexibility if he can assure Congress that progress is being made.
Although the business community favors keeping pressure on Japan, it too has little stomach for retaliaion, at least this year. Instead, it is pinning its hopes for trade gains and profits on the international free trade negotiations currently under way that are known as the Uruguay Round.
These talks, conducted by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world body that oversees trade, are scheduled to end in December. The agenda includes providing international protecton against theft of patents and copyrights, as well as expanding trade in agriculture and in financial and other services.
Jerry Jasinowski, president of the 13,500-member National Association of Manufacturers, commented, ''I think there is general support for moving ahead with a strong Uruguay Round and a reluctance to have bloody battles with our trading competitors.''

HEADLINE: Kaifu Returns to Political Outcry in Tokyo

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, March 5

 BODY:
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu returned to Japan on Sunday from his meeting with President Bush in California to face what politicians and commentators agreed was a severe test of his leadership.
Some opposition politicians, serving notice of the obstacles that Mr. Kaifu faces, criticized the Prime Minister, asserting that he had made concessions on trade and security matters without pushing Mr. Bush on any issues in return.
Accounts of the sessions in Palm Springs dominated the news here all weekend, suggesting that Mr. Bush had pressed the Prime Minister hard to commit himself on a range of actions to resolve the mounting trade disputes between Japan and the United States.
 
Sentiment of Local Boosters
Amid the pictures of Mr. Kaifu relaxing in Palm Springs were articles giving an indication why American criticism of Japan often puzzles the Japanese. 
On the one hand, Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, was quoted as saying that Japanese investment in the United States was a matter of concern. On the other, attention was given to comments by people in Palm Springs saying that they hoped the meeting would bring an infusion of Japanese investment to their valley.
The Desert Sun, a newspaper in the Palm Springs-area, was quoted as saying, ''The summit comes at a time when this valley is aching to attract more Japanese tourists and real estate investors.''
Mr. Kaifu pledged to ''firmly tackle'' the trade difficulties as ''one of the top priorities of my new Cabinet.'' This promise became a focus of commentary pointing out that the Prime Minister's leadership of his own party is tenuous, with two major Liberal Democratic leaders eager to oust him at the first opportunity. Lack of Resourcefulness? A leader of the main opposition party in Parliament did not even wait for Mr. Kaifu's plane to land on Sunday night before criticizing the Prime Minister for what he said was a ''lack of his own individual diplomacy'' in the sessions with Mr. Bush.
Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary general of the Japan Socialist Party, said it appeared that the Prime Minister had too readily accepted Mr. Bush's demand that Japan undertake major structural changes to make it easier for foreign products to be purchased and accepted by Japanese.
He was referring to the American demand that Tokyo undertake a major program of spending on public works, reduce the power of business cartels and to make changes in Japanese laws that would encourage large retail stores to expand and replace small ''mom-and-pop'' stores in many neighborhoods.
These and other adjustments are deemed by United States negotiators as essential in opening Japanese markets.
 
Where the Power Lies
But in order to make these changes, Mr. Kaifu would not only have to step on the toes of the opposition, which controls the upper house of Parliament, but also offend major constituents of his own ruling party.
Business cartels are the party's main power base, for example, but Japan's huge network of tiny retail outlets are so politically powerful that they have for years kept intact laws permitting such stores to band together in neighborhoods to block the establishment of large retail stores.
In addition, the Finance Ministry and other Government agencies are wary of major public works programs that could add to inflation, budget deficits and the problem of rising real estate values.
In an editorial this morning, the newspaper Yomiuri, which is normally friendly to the Government, said Mr. Bush had taken a ''surprisingly tough'' stance toward Japan.
 
Request Is Criticized
''It is rare for a United States leader to ask a Japanese Prime Minister to intervene politically on individual trade problems,'' the paper said. ''This request will severely test Kaifu's leadership ability.''
Besides the Socialists, other opposition parties indicated some support for Mr. Kaifu's notion, articulated in Palm Springs, that there should be new emphasis on the needs of the Japanese consumer, but leaders said they would question him on what he meant.
More serious for the Prime Minister are lingering indications of opposition within his party. Mr. Kaifu angered two faction leaders, Shintaro Abe and Michio Watanabe, by excluding their proteges from his Cabinet.
 
Criticism Turned Back on Him
The reason he cited was that these politicians were tainted by various influence-peddling scandals, including the one last year involving gifts to politicians by the Recruit Company. Mr. Watanabe has responded by demanding that Mr. Kaifu clear up his own record of receiving gifts from Recruit.
Mr. Kaifu, 59 years old, was chosen Prime Minister in August after the party lost the elections for the upper house of Parliament because of the party scandals and controversy over its enactment of an unpopular sales tax. Last month, he led the party to its victory in elections to the more powerful lower house.
The Prime Minister has a small power base of his own and owes his position to a group of kingmakers who are described as ready to turn against him should he falter in relations with the United States, or in resolving the controversy over the tax increase.

Steady Rates Expected If Dollar Stays Strong

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Fuzzy signals about the domestic economy and rising foreign interest rates are likely to create a standoff and keep interest rates in the United States in a narrow trading range - as long as the dollar remains strong, many analysts say.
''If the dollar holds, the negative implications of rising interest rates abroad can be largely mitigated,'' said Robert M. Giordano, a partner and director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company. ''If the dollar comes under pressure, the results in our bond market would be far worse.''
A strong dollar suggests that despite rising interest rates abroad, investors continue to put money in dollar-denominated financial assests instead of investing in yen- or mark-denominated stocks and bonds. 
 
Uncertainty Overseas
Political and economic uncertainty in West Germany and Japan has buoyed the dollar even as interest rates in those two countries have soared.
Yields on 10-year bonds rose to 7.16 percent in Japan late last week and to just under 9 percent in West Germany.
Under different circumstances, those rates might prove highly attractive alternative sources of investment to Treasury securities of comparable maturity. At the end of last week, the Treasury's 8.5 percent 10-year notes were offered at a price to yield 8.54 percent. Although the Japanese bonds are at a lower yield, they normally would be seen as a better investment because inflation in Japan has historically been well below that of the United States.
The state of affairs in West Germany and Japan is unsettled enough that analysts said the dollar was likely to remain attractive against the yen, the mark and other major currencies for the near term at least.
 
Confusion About U.S. Economy
To a certain extent, the market's fixation on the dizzying increase in interest rates abroad stems from the fact that for the past few months it has been difficult for analysts to interpret what is happening in the domestic economy.
Weather, strikes and inventory-related cutbacks in production in the auto industry have clouded the picture.
Some reports, like the sharp drops recorded in January durable-goods orders and new-home sales that were reported last week, suggest weakness. But construction expenditures were strong in January, and the February survey of the nation's purchasing managers suggested that conditions in the manufacturing sector improved slightly from the previous month.
Analysts said special factors had much to do with the conflicting data. Testifying before Congress last month, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said a clearer picture might not emerge until spring.
For the most part, private analysts agree.
''There were weather distortions in the latter part of 1989 that impacted the economy and took a few months to get worked out,'' said William N. Griggs, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm, referring to an abnormally cold December. ''Then we had the Boeing strike, and the shutdown in the auto industry,'' he continued. ''March would be the earliest you might expect to see the numbers start to lose some of those distortions. But those data won't be available until April.''
In the meantime, Mr. Griggs said, the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 are likely to remain in a tight trading range of 8 3/8 to 8 5/8 percent.
At the close of a volatile week, the closely watched issue was offered at a price to yield 8.53 percent, down 2 basis points, or hundredths of a point, from its close on Feb. 23.
 
'Can't Trust Them'
Erratic movements in the economic numbers have also played havoc with portfolio managers. Some said that for the time being they have had to adjust their trading strategies to compensate.
''There is so much noise in the numbers that you can't trust them,'' said Roberta D. Olsen, a fixed-income portfolio manager at the Banc One Asset Manangement Corporation in Columbus, Ohio. ''In that sort of an environment you take a day-trading approach rather than establish big positions. But at the same time we don't want to get caught short, because longer-term we think that rates are going to come down.''
Special factors - ''noise'' in Ms. Olsen's parlance - are likely to influence the February employment data to be released on Friday.
By most estimates, returning auto workers, an infusion of census takers and a weather-related rise in construction employment increased non-farm payroll employment by about 250,000 last month. But that sort of a gain would overstate the strength in the economy, analysts said.
''Layoff patterns and the winter's seasonal vagaries probably distorted the measure,'' Alan Levenson, an economist at Salomon Brothers, writes in the firm's weekly Comments on Credit.
 
No Shift by Fed
''Adjusted for these factors, activity in the goods-producing sectors likely stayed tepid, while the pace of hiring in service-producing sectors remained sufficient to support modest growth in consumer incomes and spending.''
The Federal Reserve Board is mindful of the special factors, but private analysts said that even without those considerations the employment numbers are likely to be strong enough that the Fed will not choose to ease monetary policy.
''If 250,000 or a shade above that is the number we are talking about, then the Fed will remain on hold,'' said Steven Slifer, a senior vice president and financial market economist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. ''For the moment, the markets are priced about where they should be, and are likely to remain at these current levels for the next couple of months.''

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
World Bank's Lesser Role in China

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 4

 BODY:
More than any other foreign institution, the World Bank has had enormous impact on China's economic transformation of the last decade. It was not just a large lending institution but a bank of ideas.
While many experts say the World Bank is inching toward resuming normal lending to China, the institution is unlikely to regain its previous role and influence.
During China's economic change, when Chinese economists debated vigorously about stock markets and privatization, the World Bank was there, its data-sheet wizards and worldly economists offering strategy tips and lectures on how to create economic progress. And the bankers were always ready to back up the ideas with money. 
The bank had a direct line to China's research organizations, even to some of the nation's top leaders, who were willing and eager to absorb advice on how to make China economically strong. And the bank has been a consultant on China's five-year economic plans.
 
Ready to Resume
Much of that relationship and all new lending were frozen after the military crackdown in June. The Chinese were furious, and the topic immediately became a central issue in Chinese-American relations, with the Chinese apparently suggesting that lending had to resume before the dissident Fang Lizhi could be allowed to leave his refuge in the United States Embassy.
Now, with the approval on Tuesday of a $60 million agricultural loan for one of China's poorer provinces, the World Bank appears poised to resume a normal lending pattern. The next loan proposal is expected to be presented within weeks. Last month, the bank approved a $30 million loan to help earthquake victims.
While World Bank officials dispute it, many bankers and economists say the organization has lost some influence with China's policy makers, mainly because the environment for economic change is different. They note in particular the fall from power of Zhao Ziyang, the former Communist Party General Secretary who took a special interest in the bank.
''China was their biggest success story in the world,'' said Richard E. Feinberg, the executive vice president at the Overseas Development Council, a Washington-based research group. ''Macroeconomic performance of the country was terrific, and there were good policy changes. No doubt they had the ear of senior officials.
''The general line of the World Bank in the 80's was to accompany projects with some reforms and policy changes in that sector.Now, the World Bank may not have enough clout to do that today.'' $780 Million in Loans Suspended After the Government cracked down on the democracy movement in June, the United States and six other industrialized countries on the World Bank's board decided to suspend approvals on seven projects requiring $780 million in new lending to China. Many private banks then decided to postpone their lending to China until the World Bank returned.
The commercial banks have not yet moved back toward China, apparently waiting to see a normal, steady flow of World Bank loans.
The two loans approved last month are regarded as humanitarian loans and are not enough for the financial community.
The Japanese Government, the largest single Government lender to China, will wait for all seven projects postponed by the World Bank to go forward before it will proceed with a financing package worth about $5.6 billion, a Japanese official said.
But some government lending has resumed. Early last month, the Export-Import Bank, a United States Government agency that supports American exports, announced two loans totaling $32.85 million.
Many foreign banking analysts and diplomats say the decision to halt lending to China was motivated more by political protest than by economic changes. In turn, the suspension of loans made China more cautious and less willing to discuss radical changes with the World Bank and other foreign institutions.
''The interest in the World Bank is still there,'' said one economist familiar with the bank's operations in China. ''But the World Bank is increasingly being viewed, at least at the top, as a lending institution rather than as a place that generates new ideas. China is still interested, but in the long run that sort of interest is not enough to make the World Bank's role in China grow.''
One American diplomat characterized the Chinese view of the World Bank loans approved in February as ''page one, paragraph one of negotiations with Americans'' in bilateral disputes.
 
Little Impact Felt
The suspension of new loans had little immediate impact on the economy. Of the World Bank's previously arranged loans of $8.5 billion, about half had not been completed, and these loans have continued to provide money to the Chinese without interruption. Because any new loans would have taken months to disburse, the suspension's impact was greater psychologically than economically.
While the bank appears to have lost some influence, particularly at the top levels of China's Government, it will continue to have power simply because of its vast resources. And China's appetite, perhaps even desperation, for loans, is great, especially for loans to finance projects in basic infrastructure, like power and transportation.
Money has already been earmarked for 78 projects that range from improving the life of the underfed in Gansu Province in western China to building hydroelectric plants in coastal Fujian Province to developing freshwater fish ponds in China's cities.
The bank continues to have ties to all levels of Chinese economic life.
Through links with thousands of provincial, local and midlevel officials with whom it collaborates on projects, the bank has helped raise China's understanding of modern methods of project design and feasibility, cost-benefit analysis and implementation. Since much of the advantage also goes to the regions where the project is carried out, local officials are still eager for World Bank involvement.
''You've got to distinguish between the decision makers, that is, the leaders, and the rank-and-file cadres in China,'' said a Chinese familiar with the World Bank operation. ''The cadres are willing to collaborate with the World Bank. They are aware of what's going on in the economy and know that the market economy is the way to go.''
The bank's role has also been complicated because the environment for change is different. China's retrenchment program, with its emphasis on greater central planning, has slowed growth to 4 percent last year from double digits a year earlier. Under the program, begun a year and a half ago, any fundamental economic changes will proceed more slowly than Western economists had hoped for.
 
Too Much Administration
''We believe the Government is relying too much on administrative measures, which causes a hard landing rather than a soft landing,'' said the bank's chief in Beijing, Edwin R. Lim. ''The reliance on administrative levers makes it difficult to solve fundamental problems in the economy.''
Mr. Lim, who disagrees with the assertions that the bank's role has changed, cites continued contact with Chinese research institutions. Indeed, the bank is promoting seminars and lectures on topics like industrial policy, wage reform and even privatization of state-owned enterprises.
Mr. Lim, a Chinese-Filipino economist who has been influential among China's policy makers, still calls China's economy ''one of the best in the world.''
''As a development institution, the bank has to look beyond one to two years,'' he said.

Manhattan,inc. Seeks to Revive Its Fortunes

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
D. Herbert Lipson, the owner of Manhattan,inc., has been getting a lot of calls lately from admirers - and not just from people praising the magazine's splashy behind-the-scenes business articles. Some callers want to buy the magazine.
But Mr. Lipson says Manhattan,inc. is not for sale, even though advertisers have cooled to the once-sizzling magazine.
''It has been financially disappointing,'' said Mr. Lipson, chairman of Metrocorp, which publishes the New York business monthly and Philadelphia and Boston magazines. ''But I'll stand behind it. I have an emotional attachment to the magazine.'' 
 
At Least $8 Million in Losses
Magazine industry analysts estimate that Mr. Lipson has lost at least $8 million in the last five years. During the last three years, advertising pages at Manhattan,inc. have dropped nearly 28 percent, to 660 pages in 1989, from a peak of 912 pages in 1986. Mr. Lipson said the magazine would not make money for ''two or three more years.''
Despite the magazine's troubles, interest in Manhattan,inc. is high. Mr. Lipson, while he did not identify the potential buyers, said he had both American and foreign suitors. And John Veronis, chairman of Veronis, Suhler & Associates, an investment firm specializing in media properties, said people were fascinated with the magazine. ''As long as the magazine has editorial vitality, it will ultimately be successful,'' he said.
The magazine certainly looked like a hit when it was started five years ago. Under its founding editor, Jane Amsterdam, it became one of the most talked-about new magazines.
Readers were attracted by articles that took a sometimes titillating look at the powerful people making news in New York's supercharged business climate. Advertisers liked the magazine's rich demographics. Subscribers tend to be the same kind of people that the magazine writes about - big income business executives.
 
Two Powerful Blows
But in 1987 the magazine was dealt two powerful blows. First, Ms. Amsterdam and several other top editors left. Ms. Amsterdam resigned in a dispute with Mr. Lipson over his role in the magazine's coverage.
Then, the October 1987 stock market crash virtually wiped out financial advertising, the magazine's most important category.
As a result, the magazine has been struggling in the New York magazine market, which has become even more crowded. Now, it must compete for a shrinking pool of financial, retail and real estate advertisements with new rivals like 7 Days and Spy, along with well-established competitors like New York and Avenue.
Since Clay Felker replaced Ms. Amsterdam as editor, the magazine seemed to flounder, media experts say. The magazine also lost some of its edge when top writers like Ron Rosenbaum and John Taylor left.
 
Showcasing Young Talent
Mr. Felker has tried to replenish the magazine's roster by hiring such writers as Michael Lewis, the author of ''Liar's Poker,'' and by showcasing such young talent as Jennat Conant, a former Newsweek writer.
Over all, though, morale is low, people at the magazine said. Co-workers characterized Mr. Felker as volatile, bad tempered and inflexible. In working with editors and writers, these people said, Mr. Felker often sees an article only from his point of view and will insist an article be done his way. Frustrated by what they called Mr. Felker's ''autocratic'' style, several top editors have left the magazine.
Mr. Felker acknowledged that he could be ''pretty passionate about his work.'' But he said he was not harder to work with than any good editor. ''I don't think my way is the only way, but it is an editor's job to give a publication a vision,'' he said.
Media experts say Mr. Felker, who founded New York magazine, blurred the magazine's focus by trying to turn it into a national business magazine. ''The magazine lost its way editorially,'' said David Lehmkuhl, a magazine consultant. ''Suddenly there was nothing special about it.''
 
Looking Beyond New York
Mr. Felker introduced fiction and non-business articles. He also broadened the scope of the magazine to include articles about business personalities outside of New York.
The focus has narrowed recently. ''When Clay joined, he was figuring out what to do,'' Mr. Lipson said. ''He broadened the focus to cover too wide a territory. Now, he is clicking.''
For his part, Mr. Felker said that although the magazine now included some articles about people outside of New York, it was not his intention to make Manhattan,inc. into a national business magazine. ''It is not the same magazine, of course,'' he said. ''The business world is different. But the strategy is the same.''
Some media analysts are concerned that Mr. Felker might leave Manhattan,inc. to run The Battery News, a biweekly newspaper in lower Manhattan, which he acquired in April. But Mr. Felker said he was ''in for the long haul at Manhattan,inc.''
 
'Too Narrowly Targeted'
The magazine has also suffered from a self-imposed restriction. By its very nature, Manhattan,inc. appeals primarily to readers curious about New York's business community. But big advertisers want to reach large numbers of consumers.
''The magazine's biggest problem is that it is too narrowly targeted,'' said John Power, a group vice president at Vitt Media International, a buying service for advertisers. ''It reaches too small an audience.''
Manhattan,inc.'s publisher, Sandra Ourusoff, is trying to change that perception. Since she joined the magazine a year ago, circulation has jumped to about 113,000 last month from about 90,000, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
The price, however, has been high. Subscriptions are selling for as little as $6 a year, an 83 percent discount on the magazine's $3 cover price.
Manhattan,inc. is also offering a bargain of sorts to its advertisers. Most publications raise advertising rates as circulation climbs. Not Manhattan,inc.: This year a full-page color ad in the magazine will cost $11,265, the same as in 1989.
Media experts said the magazine had been hampered by high turnover of its advertising sales staff. Mrs. Ourusoff acknowledges that this ''is a big problem.'' She is the third publisher in the last two years.
Manhattan,inc. has a thornier problem. The magazine rose with New York's economic resurgence in the 1980's. ''The magazine made its name covering the people who created the Wall Street boom,'' Mr. Power said. ''Writing about the decline makes for a less interesting magazine.''
Mr Felker does not agree. ''This is a bumpy period, but New York is still the financial capital of the world,'' he argued. ''It isn't possible to run out of first-rate stories in New York.''

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
Arabs Fear End of Cold War Means a Loss of Aid and Allies

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAMA, Bahrain

 BODY:
The changes sweeping through Eastern Europe represent a major strategic setback for Palestinians and other Arabs, regional officials and experts say.
The consensus of dozens of officials, scholars and businessmen interviewed in the Persian Gulf region and Western Europe is that Arabs, especially the Palestine Liberation Organization, have begun to see a steep decline in the open political, moral and material support that they have received for more than a quarter of a century from Eastern Europe.
Many of those interviewed expressed the view that the end of the cold war has upset basic Arab strategies for dealing with the 40-year Arab-Israeli conflict.
 
Like a Military Defeat
When those results are combined with the rapid melting of the Eastern bloc's freeze-out of Israel after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, some policy makers and Arab commentators go so far as to suggest that the decline of Communism in Eastern Europe is comparable to the defeats suffered in 1948, when Israel was established, and 1967, when the West Bank and Gaza were lost in the Arab-Israeli war. 
''There is a sweeping feeling among Arabs that they have lost an ally of the kind that stood by them at times of crisis,'' said Fouad Zakaria, a philosophy professor at Kuwait University.
''From now on, the Soviets' interests, as well as those of Eastern Europe, will be focused on getting closer to Western Europe and diminishing tensions with the United States,'' he said. ''The Middle East may well rank last on the scale of interests.''
 
Palestinians the Biggest Losers
By far the biggest losers appear to be the Palestinians. Palestinian leaders say they no longer have access to military training and weapons supplies, and that they fear a loss of medical assistance and the hundreds of scholarships granted to Palestinian students for study in Eastern Europe.
The Warsaw Pact countries, which over the last three decades offered military training to 5,000 to 6,000 guerrillas from the P.L.O. and other Palestinian organizations, according to estimates, have largely ended that cooperation.
Bases of operation for extremist Palestinian groups like the Abu Nidal organization, which worked out of Warsaw and East Berlin, have been disbanded. Palestinian officials assert that the new Governments of Poland and East Germany have supplied intelligence to Western agencies.
''Our mistake was that we formed relations with the Governments of these countries, not with their peoples,'' said Radwan Abu Ayash, a leading figure among Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and head of the federation of Arab journalists there.
 
Fewer Advisers in Syria
Militant Arab nations like Syria, Southern Yemen, Algeria and Libya are also feeling a sharp impact from the decline of support from the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc.
Andrew Duncan of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies said the number of Soviet military advisers stationed in Syria has dropped significantly since the winds of perestroika began to blow through Moscow.
In its yearly publication ''The Military Balance,'' the institute reported that the number of Soviet military advisers in Syria dropped from 4,000 in 1988 to 3,000 last year. ''We expect the figure will be further reduced by June,'' Mr. Duncan said.
The Soviet Union has also served notice that it will no longer support President Hafez al-Assad's decade-long quest to put Syria in what he calls ''strategic parity'' in armaments with Israel.
Most important, one senior Soviet diplomat said in an interview, Moscow has told Damascus that it will not back Syria in another war with Israel.
As a result, Syria and even Libya, which had stood firmly against the reintegration of Egypt into the Arab League and opposed moderate pro-Western Arab regimes, have substantially toned down their militancy. Both countries have resumed ties with Egypt and are eagerly seeking to reintegrate themselves into the Arab mainstream.
 
Hard-Liners Begin to Soften
''None of this is lost on Assad,'' an Israeli diplomat said of the new Soviet attitude. ''He is readjusting his policies vis-a-vis Egypt, the P.L.O. and the peace process. Militarily, he realizes that the Soviets today are not the Soviets of 10 years ago. He cannot depend on them in the same way.''
The softening of the hard-liners' stance has given more freedom to conservative Arab nations led by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Morocco, which are slowly shaping new outlines for Arab policies, advocating peaceful settlements of disputes in Lebanon and with Israel.
But it is not evident that the collapse of Communist governments in Europe and the shift in Soviet strategy is all that profitable for the moderate oil-producing regimes of the Gulf either.
''We in Kuwait always balanced our relations with the United States with our ties to the Soviet Union,'' said Abdullah Y. al-Ghanem, who heads one of Kuwait's largest trading companies. ''When the U.S. refused to sell us F-16's, we went to the Russians. Now that the two superpowers are playing ball together, what are we supposed to do?''
For the moment, the most insistent Arab and Palestinian fears center on the relaxation of of Soviet restrictions on the emigration of Soviet Jews, a move that is sending tens of thousands of Soviet immigrants to Israel every month and upsetting a basic tenet of Palestinian demographic calculations.
 
Soviet Emigres Seen as Threat
For years, the Palestinians, and many Israelis, have argued that one of the biggest incentives for Israel to cede the occupied Arab territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip is that the rate of population growth among the Arabs in Israel and the occupied territories is so much higher than among Jews that by the end of the century the demographic balance will tilt in favor of the Palestinians. Those calculations are being scrambled by the flow from the Soviet Union.
Moreover, ''the professional qualifications of arriving Soviet migrants, who are almost all educated and well-trained professionals, further enhances Israel's technological superiority in the face of all its Arab neighbors,'' said Abdullah al-Nobari, business editor of the Kuwaiti newspaper Al Taliaa.
Ghassan Salameh, a Middle East affairs expert at the University of Paris, argues that Moscow has come to look upon some Arab, and some Muslim but non-Arab, Middle Eastern countries like Iran and Afghanistan, as potential menaces, because of the effect that Islamic fundamentalist currents emanating from them could have on the Soviet Union's Muslim republics, like Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Kirghizia.
The dominant sentiment in this region was summarized by Abdullatif al-Hamad, a former Kuwaiti Finance Minister and head of the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, who said, ''We suddenly find ourselves alone on a stage from which we should have exited some time ago.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 9, 1990, Friday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about Arab and Palestinian political setbacks in light of the changes in Eastern Europe misstated the number of Soviet Jewish immigrants to Israel. The highest monthly number of immigrants was roughly 5,000, in February.

HEADLINE: Reports Indicate Mounting Efforts To Free U.S. Hostages in Lebanon

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
There are growing indications from Washington and the Middle East of a flurry of diplomatic activity to free the American hostages in Lebanon.
The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said today that ''there is a lot happening'' behind the scenes, although he said there was no indication that the hostages would be freed soon.
''We cannot say that there is any movement,'' he said. ''We know of no imminent release.'' 
Mr. Fitzwater made his remarks amid a swirl of rumors and speculation in recent days that the United States was secretly negotiating with Iran to win the freedom of the eight American hostages, rumors that Mr. Fitzwater and other senior Administration officials have strongly denied. [Excerpts, page A14.] His remarks also coincided with hopeful statements from Iran, Syria and Lebanon saying the hostages should be freed soon.
The 8 Americans are among at least 16 Westerners held in Lebanon, many of them by kidnappers thought to have connectons to Iran. Responsibility has been claimed in the name of at least eight groups, several of which seem to represent the same organization.
 
Anderson Held the Longest
The hostage who has been held the longest is Terry A. Anderson, who was the chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press when he was abducted on March 16, 1985.
One statement about the hostages was made by The Teheran Times, a pro-Government Iranian newspaper linked to President Hashemi Rafsanjani. The paper said in an editorial to be published on Tuesday that Western hostages in Lebanon could be freed before the end of the year, Reuters reported from Nicosia, Cyprus.
''Our own assessment indicates that this thorny issue can be sorted out in the near future in a sincere spirit by sincere people,'' the editorial said. ''An attempt is being made even right now as we go to press.''
The editorial followed a meeting on Sunday between Mahmoud Hashemi, the brother of the Iranian President, and the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, in Damascus. The two officials reportedly discussed efforts to free the hostages.
 
Activities of Intermediaries
In an elaborate statement that some Administration officials characterized as an unofficial message to Iran, Mr. Fitzwater described the activities of intermediaries around the world acting on behalf of American hostages, including what he called ''freelance people'' like businessmen and other people who have contacts in Iran and Lebanon, foreign diplomats and family members and other representatives of the hostages.
''I will never rule out meetings anywhere, any place, anytime, by anybody on the hostage question, because these meetings are happening,'' he said.
Mr. Fitzwater said the intermediaries often claimed to represent the United States, which he said was untrue.
''Many of them have had contacts with the U.S. Government,'' he said. ''They have told us what they are doing. They have asked us for advice.
''And when all this comes out later, I don't want it said they were working for the U.S. Government.'' He added that many of the intermediaries had received advice and comments from the Administration.
''So there's a lot happening, and I don't want to be discouraging,'' Mr. Fitzwater said.
 
Clarifying Quayle's Statement
Mr. Fitzwater's remarks were intended in part to clarify an ambiguous statement on Sunday by Vice President Dan Quayle. When asked on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation'' about talks between the United States and Iran on the hostages, Mr. Quayle did not issue an outright denial, but replied, ''There is no negotiation on a quid pro quo basis.''
There is no consensus within the Administration on the significance of the recent encouraging signals about the hostages' fate. One Administration official who has followed Iranian affairs for more than a decade said he was ''very optimistic.''
But a senior State Department official said, ''I've seen as many reports as anyone, but don't see any analytical basis for any conclusion this is going to lead to the release of a hostage or group of hostages.'' The official said the United States had not sent any official message to Teheran through the Swiss Government, which represents United States interests in Iran, since the flurry of positive signs from Teheran and elsewhere began.
Some Administration officials have complained that there has been a tendency in the White House for several months to overreact to small signals abpit the hostages. These officials said many of the statements about the hostages came from people close to Mr. Rafsanjani. The officials said Mr. Rafsanjani had believed for some time that the hostage issue was an impediment to Iran's economic recovery and had long sought to resolve it.
Nevertheless, Administration officials agree that recent signals about the hostages are positive.
 
Unconditional Release Urged
Reflecting an important recent departure from long-held Iranian policy, the editorial in The Teheran Times said the hostage issue should be solved without any preconditions. The newspaper also dismissed reports of secret talks between Iran and the United States about freeing the Americans among the hostages.
The first encouraging signs from Teheran came on Feb. 22, when an editorial in the same paper said the hostages should be freed because they had become a propaganda tool of Iran's enemies. The next day, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, a leading Shiite Muslim cleric in Lebanon, said that the hostages were being used by the West to distort the image of Islam and that a means should be found to free them.
 
Interview With Iranian Cleric
That was followed by an interview with Ayatollah Mohammed Yazdi, a senior Iranian cleric and head of the Supreme Court, who said that the taking of hostages was un-Islamic and that Iran opposed the practice.
Ettela'at, Iran's second-largest newspaper, which is linked to President Rafsanjani, said in an article at about the same time that the hostages should be released without preconditions on Islamic and humanitarian grounds.
Administration officials said they were encouraged that recent Iranian statements had dropped preconditions for the release of the American hostages. Until recently, Iranian leaders have linked their release to the release of Iranian financial assets frozen after the seizure of the American Embassy in Teheran in November 1979.
In addition, these officials said there had not been denials or criticisms in Iran of the conciliatory statements. But officials said that Iran had only limited control over the hostage-takers in Lebanon and that some Iranian factions might still oppose the hostages' release.

HEADLINE: Big Shortfall in Corporate Taxes Thwarts Key Goal of 1986 Law

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
Corporate income taxes have produced much less revenue than was predicted when the monumental Tax Reform Act of 1986 was enacted, and individuals have made up the shortfall.
One of the main political selling points of that law, which changed the income tax system more than any other legislation since World War II, was the expectation that $120 billion in taxes would be shifted from individuals to corporations in the first five years.
But for reasons Government experts and outside economists do not completely understand, corporate tax receipts, while higher than they were under the old law, ran $20 billion to $30 billion less each year than anticipated in the three full fiscal years since the law was enacted. The shortfall in years to come is expected to be even larger. 
 
A 'Revenue Neutral' Bill
Lawmakers were told when they passed the sweeping legislation in the fall of 1986 that it would be ''revenue neutral'' over the first five years, meaning it would generate almost exactly the same amount of total money for the Government as the old tax law.
So far, that has proved to be the case. Tax receipts from individuals have exceeded expectations by more or less the same amount that corporate receipts have lagged.
Experts agree on why tax payments by individuals have been higher than was estimated four years ago. The economy has performed better than was anticipated, giving people higher incomes and, thus, higher tax bills.
But most Government officials and private economists who have studied the matter say they are not sure why tax receipts from corporations are so far off the mark.
In early 1987, shortly after the new law was enacted, the Treasury Department and the Congressional Budget Office, using different computer models of the economy, predicted the effects of the law on revenues. Each study overestimated corporate tax receipts by about the same amount.
After checking with tax specialists at the Treasury, Roger Bolton, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Treasury, said the department's view was that the shortfall in corporate tax receipts can be almost entirely explained by the fact that corporate profits have been lower than anticipated.
''It's not that tax reform didn't do what was predicted but that the economy didn't do what was expected,'' Mr. Bolton said. Other economists and tax experts agreed that was part of the cause, but they said they doubted it was the full reason. They say that the Government's overestimates of corporate profits varied enormously: The estimate was $23 billion too high in the fiscal year 1987, $9 billion in 1988 and $60 billion in 1989.
By contrast, the shortfall in taxes paid by corporations did not vary by nearly so much. It was $20.9 billion less in 1987 than the estimate the Treasury made right after the tax law was passed, $22.7 billion less in 1988 and $25 billion short in 1989.
Rosemary D. Marcuss, assistant director for tax analysis at the Congressional Budget Office, said she and her staff studied the issue carefully last year and finally threw up their hands in frustration, unable to determine why corporate tax payments had not met expectations.
Other economists in Congress and outside the Government suggested these other possibilities:
* With leveraged buyouts and other structural changes, corporations took on much greater debt in the late 1980's than was foreseen when the law was passed, and that reduced their tax burden.
* The computer models used in estimating revenues did not take account of the negative effects on the economy in general and corporations in particular of the abolition of various tax breaks.
* Foreign ownership of American businesses increased dramatically at the end of the decade, and the American subsidiaries of foreign companies have underpaid their taxes.
* Some small businesses became partnerships instead of corporations or changed their accounting practices to lower their tax bills.
* Some corporations took deductions to which they were probably not entitled and were able to do so without fear of prosecution because the Treasury took so long to produce regulations interpreting the new law.
The 1986 law changed the tax landscape for corporations. The top corporate tax rate, previously 46 percent, was lowered to 40 percent in 1987 and to 34 percent thereafter. The investment tax credit, which had saved companies billions of dollars a year in taxes, was abolished; a stiff minimum tax was imposed; depreciation schedules were made much less generous, and many accounting rules were made less favorable.
Scores of highly profitable corporations that had used tax breaks to cut their taxes to little or nothing have been making large payments under the new law. For example, the Walt Disney Company and the General Dynamics Corporation received tax refunds from the Government between 1981 and 1985, but paid more than 30 percent of their profits in taxes in 1988, according to a study by Citizens for Tax Justice, a research organization sponsored by labor unions.
Because of the changes, corporate taxes have increased as a proportion of total Government revenues from about 8.5 percent just before the law was changed to about 10.5 percent now. Income tax payments by individuals have remained at about 45 percent of all income.
All the experts interviewed agreed that at least part of the shortfall in corporate tax receipts was the result of lower-than-expected corporate profits.
Tax specialists at the Treasury use estimates for corporate profits that are made by the Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of Management and Budget. Almost invariably over the years, the estimates have been too high.
C. Eugene Steuerle, a top tax policy specialist at the Treasury for many years and deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis in the last years of the Reagan Administration, said officials in other agencies often made unrealistic estimates of profits so that their projected budget deficit would be smaller.
But that does not explain why the Congressional Budget Office, using a different computer model, also overestimated corporate profits. Officials of the office said they had no reasonable explanation.
 
The Effect of Debt
Many economists said that leveraged buyouts, the hottest trend on Wall Street in the late 1980's, surely reduced overall corporate tax payments somewhat. In those deals, a group of investors using borrowed money, often raised by issuing high-yield ''junk bonds,'' buys up the stock of a company. Such a substitution of debt for stock reduces taxes because a corporation can take a tax deduction for interest payments on debt, but gets no deduction for dividend payments on stock.
The economists said, however, that leveraged buyout activity was not large enough to have caused more than a small fraction of the total shortfall in corporate tax payments.
No one can guess how much increased foreign ownership of business may have changed the tax equation, but Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, is one of the economists who believes it must have played a part in the lower corporate tax receipts.
Internal Revenue Service officials have said they suspect that many American subsidiaries of foreign companies are not paying their fair share of taxes, and the agency has begun an investigation of the matter.

HEADLINE: Few Willing to Help Britain Help Hong Kong Emigrants

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, March 5

 BODY:
Facing a British political backlash to her plan for granting up to 225,000 Hong Kong residents full British citizenship, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is trying to persuade the United States and other Western nations to make similar offers to the people of Hong Kong.
The 5.7 million people of Hong Kong, the vast majority of them ethnic Chinese, have become increasingly nervous about their fate after control of the British colony reverts to China in 1997. Britain wants to encourage them to stay, not emigrate. London hopes that the granting of British passports, and the similar action it wants other Western countries to take, will calm them. 
Asked about the British request, an American diplomat here said: ''We have agreed to look into it and do what we can after looking into it.'' Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Britain's Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, have discussed the matter, she added.
But she cautioned that the United States was unlikely to act quickly. She noted that Britain wants the United States to substantially increase the allowed number of immigrants and to grant special visas that would not have to be used immediately, which she said ''would mean a major change in U.S. legislation.''
 
Action in the Senate
The Senate has passed a bill that would double, to 10,000 a year, the number of permanent visas granted to Hong Kong residents. The bill is now before the House.
One big complication would be to take action that treated Hong Kong as a special case.
Under current law, a foreigner who is granted a visa entitling him to permanent residence in the United States must show an intent to do so once he has picked up the visa. So someone who got such a visa and then continued to spend most of his time in Hong Kong might have it revoked.
Britain has reportedly also approached Japan, Singapore and some other members of the Commonwealth or the European Community. These reportedly include Australia, Canada, France, Italy and the Netherlands. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office would say only that ''we're talking to a very wide range of countries.''
 
Italy Trying to Help
Although some British newspapers indicated that some agreements might be imminent, Mr. Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, said at a news conference in Budapest on Thursday that the prediction was ''slightly premature,'' according to Reuters.
An Italian diplomat said it was ''the political will'' of the Italian Government ''to find a way to help these people,'' and that Italy was exploring ways to change its laws to do so.
Canada, whose annual quota on immigration from Hong Kong is now 23,000, has a law like America's that requires foreigners granted permanent residence to move to Canada. It has no intention of changing the law, said Raphael Girard, Minister of Immigration and Consular Affairs at the Canadian High Commission in London. ''Changing the law solely for the benefit of residents of Hong Kong doesn't fit the context of Canadian constitutional guarantees for equality,'' he said.
Taizo Watanabe, a spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry in Tokyo, said British newspaper articles suggesting it was prepared to offer passports to Hong Kong citizens were ''totally speculative,'' Reuters reported.
One of Britain's goals is to do a better job of calming the fears of Hong Kong residents about Chinese rule. Since the current plan calls for Britain to take only the families of 50,000 people deemed essential to the colony, there have been doubts that it would stem the heavy emigration, which is averaging about 1,000 a week, Emigration totaled about 42,000 last year. In the year that ended Sept. 30, 8,861 emigrated to the United States. Last year, 1,150 emigrated to Britain from Hong Kong.
In response to the reports of Britain's efforts to get other countries to help Hong Kong, a spokesman for the Hong Kong Government in London questioned on Thursday if any actions would be great enough to make a big difference. ''Obviously the people of Hong Kong welcome any other efforts to build confidence and help people stay in Hong Kong,'' he added.
The violent suppression of the democracy movement in China last spring sent shock waves through Hong Kong.
Diplomats and analysts say Mrs. Thatcher also hopes that if the Hong Kong initiative becomes an international effort, it will become more palatable for the British.
 
A Worrisome Rebellion
Indeed, Mrs. Thatcher is having to contend with a worrisome rebellion within the Conservative Party that is endangering legislation to enact the plan, which is now before Parliament. As many as 86 Conservative Members of Parliament are threatening to vote against the legislation. The Labor Party, the major opposition, is against the plan, arguing that it is elitist.
Political commentators say they believe Mrs. Thatcher is especially eager to diffuse the anger over her Hong Kong policies because it is not the least of her problems. The Conservative Government, which is now trying to put into effect a controversial change in household taxes, also has to contend with a host of economic problems: 7.7 percent inflation, mortgage rates that just rose above 15 percent and an anemic economy. This helps explain why the Conservatives are trailing Labor by as much as 18.5 points in opinion polls.

HEADLINE: Seeking Aid, Chamorro Advisers Present Economic Plan to Baker

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
Aides to the President-elect of Nicaragua, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, met today with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d to lay out an economic recovery plan, plead for United States aid and discuss a timetable for demobilizing the Nicaraguan guerrillas.
Under the plan, Mrs. Chamorro would sell off state enterprises, eliminate Government subsidies for many industries, slash Government regulation of the economy and introduce a new currency with a fixed rate of exchange tied to the United States dollar.
With such changes, the Chamorro advisers told United States officials today, Nicaragua could look forward to economic growth of 10 percent a year for five or six years. That, they said, would return Nicaragua to the output of goods and services that prevailed in 1977, before the Sandinista revolution. 
 
Chief Economic Adviser
The delegation was led by Mrs. Chamorro's chief economic adviser, Francisco Mayorga Balladares, and by Alfredo Cesar Aguirre, a former contra leader who returned to Nicaragua in June to work in the election campaign.
In the elections last month, Mrs. Chamorro led a coalition of parties known as the National Opposition Union, or UNO. Mr. Mayorga and Mr. Cesar today gave American officials a document titled, ''The UNO Agenda for Economic Recovery.''
It says Nicaragua urgently needs assistance so that farmers can plant new crops. The inauguration of Mrs. Chamorro as President is scheduled for April 25. ''Because the rainy season occurs shortly after the new Government will take over, time is of the essence in securing necessary supplies such as seed, fertilizer and fuel,'' the plan says.
Mrs. Chamorro's plan, written mainly by Mr. Mayorga, says that ''all state companies in the production of goods and services will be privatized.'' Moreover, it says: ''All of the state companies will pay taxes and social security and interest on their bank loans, and repay the principal. They will now pay for public services. We will try to avoid all subsidies and privileges.''
Under United States law, Nicaragua is ineligible for most types of economic aid until it clears up arrears of $65 million to $70 million. However, Congress could pass legislation canceling the old debts, most of which were incurred when Anastasio Somoza Debayle was President of Nicaragua.
Though sometimes described as Marxists, the Sandinistas say their economic policy is an eclectic mix of elements drawn from socialism and capitalism. In the last year, they have imposed economic austerity measures to combat inflation.
The Chamorro plan offers incentives for contras and other exiles to return home. ''Amnesty will be decreed for political offenses so that all exiled Nicaraguans who wish to return can do so enjoying full human rights,'' it says. The Government will also help pay ''repatriation expenses.''
Jorge I. Dominguez, a professor of government at Harvard University, said the Nicaraguan economy was so depressed that he could imagine ''a jump-start recovery'' with robust growth of 10 percent in the first year, provided that Managua got ''a flood of money from outside donors.'' But, he said, ''sustained economic growth of 10 percent a year over five or six years strikes me as wholly unrealistic.''

HEADLINE: Gallup Shifts Emphasis Toward Market Studies

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN

 BODY:
The Gallup Organization, which helped invent the public opinion poll more than 50 years ago, is scaling down that business and taking on more market research instead, several current and former Gallup employees said.
Since Gallup was bought 18 months ago, its new owner, Selection Research Inc., a market research company based in Lincoln, Neb., has been slashing staff at Gallup's office in Princeton, N.J., and de-emphasizing research on social issues, former and current employees say.
The company's new owners concede there have been structural changes.
Jim Clifton, a former SRI executive and now the president and chief executive of Gallup, said the ratio of public opinion polling to market research polling was 50-50 when his group bought Gallup. Now, he said, 30 percent of the work is in public opinion research, and the rest is work for health-care companies, hospitals, banks and insurance companies, trade associations and newspapers. But he said the commitment to public opinion research remains the same. 
 
How to Pay for It
George Gallup Jr., co-chairman of Gallup with his brother Alec, and son of the founder, who died in 1984, said: ''My father would have understood. The Gallup Organization remains dedicated to public opinion research on a broad scale. Market research is a way of paying for it.''
Many longtime Gallup employees disagree with that view, and in recent months four top executives have left and formed their own polling companies. One hundred and fifty people were working at Gallup's headquarters when the company was bought in September 1988; now there are fewer than 60.
''When they bought Gallup, what they were really doing was buying the name,'' said Neil Upmeyer, a former vice president of public affairs research and one of several senior employees to leave the company recently. ''My feeling is that six months from now, there won't be anything left of Gallup as it used to be.''
''The culture inside Gallup has changed,'' said Andrew Kohut, who was president of the Gallup Organization before the acquisition and division president afterward, until his departure.
 
Change Is No Surprise
Observers say the new emphasis is not surprising in an industry where profits have been flat in recent years. ''It's very difficult to make money in the public polling business,'' said Norman M. Bradburn, director of the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. ''You make money essentially in the commercial side of it.''
Nonetheless, the unrest at Gallup concerns many in the opinion field.
''I think that Gallup has lost the people who are strong in the public opinion area, and I don't see who is going to do the kind of work that made them what they are,'' said Warren Mitofsky, the executive director of voter research and surveys for the newly combined exit-polling efforts of the three major over-the-air television networks and the Cable News Network.
Both Gallup and SRI are privately held, and neither SRI nor Gallup officers would reveal the purchase price. Mr. Gallup said his company ''was not in the black'' when it was sold.
SRI was founded in 1969 to develop psychological screening tests that help employers find employees for particular jobs.
When SRI offered to buy Gallup, Mr. Clifton spoke to the company's employees and assured them nothing would change. But change did come.
 
Phone Interviewers Dismissed
First the company moved from its old building to a suite in a new office building nearby. Then the entire staff that conducts telephone interviews, about 40 people, was dismissed and all telephone work was assigned to the 800 SRI interviewers in Nebraska.
''We expected that,'' said Diane Colasanto, former senior vice president for opinion research at Gallup who has joined Mr. Kohut and formed a new company that does business with Gallup. ''Their strength is telephone interviewing.''
In another change, the SRI marketing staff in Nebraska has now become the marketing staff for Gallup, Mr. Clifton said.
The personal-interviewing staff -people who went to homes for in-depth interviews - was cut, Mr. Upmeyer said, from 15 employees to two or three. He said the coding staff -trained to interpret answers to open-ended questions - was also cut.
These methods, particularly personal interviewing, can sometimes be more effective. But personal interviewing is much more expensive than a standard telephone poll, and companies are cutting back on the practice.
 
In Some Ways the Same
The Gallup Poll has stayed essentially the same, although it was assigned a new chief last month. It still comes out once a week and is syndicated to 100 newspapers around the country.
It is the Poll that most people think of when they think of Gallup, and it has been described as the ''public face'' of the company. But that department is only one of several in the organization.
To be sure, Gallup has always worked for corporate clients. Sometimes the clients wanted to know which colors or flavors the public prefers. That was considered market research. Sometimes the questions were broader - for instance, an airline seeking information on public safety issues, or a newspaper wanting to gauge opinion on abortion for a series of articles. That was considered social public opinion research.
The Opinion Research division of Gallup, headed by Mr. Kohut, was responsible for the latter. Although its staff remained intact after the purchase, employees say they saw a blurring of the traditional line between the two types of work done for corporate clients.
Mr. Kohut left Gallup last autumn, and Ms. Colasanto followed soon after. The two were credited in polling circles as being the backbone of the organization.
No one has been named to fill Mr. Kohut's job. Mr. Upmeyer, who left Gallup last week, said Mr. Kohut's Public Opinion division has been ''dismantled'' into smaller groups.
But Mr. Clifton of SRI said the complaints by former employees are out of proportion. ''There is nothing wrong with making money,'' he said. ''The changes allowed us to be profitable. And being profitable is the only way any to get any research done.''

HEADLINE: Selection of Jurors Is Started for Trial of Poindexter

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
Jury selection started today in the trial of John M. Poindexter, the former national security adviser accused of concealing the Reagan Administration's actions in the Iran-contra affair from Congress.
Drawing from a pool of 206 potential jurors, Judge Harold H. Greene of Federal District Court summoned more than two dozen people on the panel to his courtroom, questioning them individually about their backgrounds and their knowledge of the case.
By the end of the day, Judge Greene had qualified 21 jurors, representing a broad cross section of the city's residents. They included an unemployed truck driver, several health care workers, a janitor, a cook and a real estate lawyer who worked as a volunteer in the Bush campaign for President in 1988. 
It is from a pool of some 50 prospective jurors that lawyers for each side, who are allowed to challenge for cause in the current winnowing process, will be permitted peremptory challenges. Eighteen people will be chosen for the Poindexter trial, 12 regular jurors and 6 alternates.
 
Dismissed for Prior Knowledge
Judge Greene dismissed several prospective jurors because of prior exposure to Iran-contra matters. One man said that ''when the whole thing was going down'' after public disclosure of the affair in November 1986, ''all you heard was North and Poindexter.''
In response to questionnaires completed by each of the 206 prospective jurors, 76 of them answered that they had some knowledge of the affair.
 
The Names Are Familiar
But most of those 76 who were questioned by Judge Greene today said that their knowledge did not go beyond an ability to recognize the names of Mr. Poindexter and other prominent figures in the affair, like Oliver L. North, the former National Security Council aide who has been convicted on three counts.
Mr. Poindexter, a retired rear admiral, was Mr. Reagan's national security adviser from December 1985 until he resigned in November 1986 when the Government announced that it had been engaging in covert arms sales and had discovered that some of the proceeds had been diverted to Nicaraguan rebels at a time when aiding them was prohibited by Congress.
The defendant faces five criminal charges, including accusations that he obstructed Congressional inquiries and made false statements to Congress.
 
Poindexter Watched the Show
At today's session, Mr. Poindexter leaned back in his chair watching the questioning of people who will decide his guilt or innocence. He smiled occasionally when defense lawyers pointed him out to prospective jurors who were sometimes unsure whether they could recognize him. His wife, the Rev. Linda Anne Poindexter, sat in the first row of the gallery.
Judge Greene said exposure to Mr. Poindexter's testimony at the Iran-contra Congressional hearings would not automatically disqualify a juror even though the admiral testified on the condition that none of his statements could be used against him at his trial.

HEADLINE: Debut of Commercials on School TV Renews Debate on Programs' Value

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNION, N.J., March 5

 BODY:
The camera pans the Berlin wall as the narrator discusses the divided city and the outbreak of the cold war.
Cut to a cartoon cheetah. Students at Union High School laugh as the animal is flattened by trucks and falls into manholes in his pursuit of Cheetos, the cheese snack. Fade out for the first day of Channel One, a news program for teen-age students complete with commercials.
Zoom across the state line to Peekskill, N.Y. There Michael E. Griest's students watch news too, but without commercials. Mr. Griest uses the program CNN Newsroom to test his government and economics students' understanding of current topics, from world events to geography to marketing principles. 
Television news has arrived in the classroom, and today's debut of Channel One in 400 schools across the country brings one of the fiercest educational battles in years to a new phase.
Banned in New York, California, and Rhode Island, Channel One has been branded a pernicious, cynical attempt to make profits from school children under the guise of educational television. Others call it visionary, applauding the idea of tailoring a news program for teen-agers and arguing that the much-needed video equipment that schools receive free for subscribing to the program outweighs two minutes of commercials a day.
 
Education Concerns Raised
The furor surrounding Channel One raises other, broader educational concerns. Is television the way to reach the majority of teen-agers who say the tumult in Eastern Europe leaves them cold - and who do not bother to vote? Can a brief daily news program interest and inform them or does it present too simplistic and fragmented a picture? Is this a genuine educational innovation or a quick fix for historical and geographical ignorance that will not deepen knowledge?
Both programs, Channel One and CNN Newsroom, aim to teach teen-agers about world events and to counter political apathy. But whether either program will achieve its goal depends on their formats and how well teachers use them, say experts.
''Learning about contemporary events from television, it's a natural,'' said Sam Gibbon, director of the award-winning science television program, ''Voyage of the Mimi,'' from Bank Street College of Education in New York City. ''As far as the power of television to transport students to other worlds, to teach, to introduce a variety of subjects to the classroom, I think its power is very well established.''
But Herbert Kohl, a former teacher and author of several books on education, worries that the brevity of the program will leave students with superficial knowledge of world affairs. ''You can put this on, let it play, and have no responsibility for going deeper,'' he said. ''It won't provide extra learning that teachers don't provide, but administrators find this a cheap and easy way to look good.''
While teachers have used educational television programs in classrooms for years, last year Whittle Communications was the first company to announce a daily news program for teen-agers. So far the company, a unit of Time Warner Inc., says 2,700 schools across the country have signed on.
 
Programs Have Similar Formats
The Cable News Network, which had the same idea a few months after Channel One was announced, got its program on the air first, starting CNN Newsroom last September. The Turner Broadcasting System Inc., which operates CNN, says 7,000 schools have signed up to receive the program, and more than half show it regularly.
Channel One and CNN Newsroom have similar formats, opening with fast-paced news reports, slowing to focus on a few topics in more detail, cutting to graphics like pop quizzes or quotations of the day, slowing again for one or two longer features.
The 12-minute Channel One program broadcasts a five-part series every week on one topic, like Eastern Europe, drugs or summer jobs. The 15-minute CNN Newsroom includes daily longer features, like reports on American Indians' anger over celebrations of Columbus's discovery of America, or a debate on whether to end Baylor University's 145-year-old ban on dancing.
Channel One has flashier graphics and more music; CNN Newsroom looks more like standard news.
Educators who have seen both programs say their producers need to slow the pace and create more material tailored for teen-agers. Even more important than the format, said Terry Baker, dean of the research division at Bank Street College, is how teachers use the programs.
''If this is used by itself, it's not going to be used effectively,'' he said. ''It depends on whether teachers prepare to do something with it.''
In Peekskill, Mr. Griest has written the main themes of Friday's CNN Newsroom program on the blackboard: the debate over the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant, civil disobedience, a compromise on the clean air bill, a debate about ending the dance ban at Baylor. Standing by the television set, he tosses out questions as the program unfolds.
 
Teacher Detects Improvement
''Who started civil disobedience?'' he asks as CNN Newsroom shows nuclear plant protesters being dragged by police. ''What American used it in the '60's? What worldwide figure used it?'' His students correctly answer: Henry David Thoreau, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mohandas K. Gandhi.
After the broadcast, he leads a discussion on the pros and cons of nuclear power and tells his students, to their dismay, that he favors Baylor's dancing ban.
Mr. Griest has shown CNN Newsroom to his government and economics students every school school day since September, and he believes he can detect improvement in their ability to find countries on maps, their knowledge of world affairs and their understanding of economics and government. He said the program particularly appeals to students who are uninterested in textbooks.
''It gives us more knowledge about the world and what's going on.'' said Aaron Paige. ''A lot of people don't know about East Germany, or why the wall is coming down. This makes you a worldly person. You can talk about anything.''
At Union High School, students generally liked their first look at Channel One. In Rita Duane's journalism class and Tom Quinn's social studies class, they watched as Channel One moved quickly through some top reports: the death of a college basketball star, the Cuban defector who windsurfed to the United States, President Bush's meeting with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan, the landing of the space shuttle Atlantis.
The program offered special reports on a Japanese high school in Tennessee, the history of the Berlin wall and the stricter educational requirements of the United States Army. Some students watched the screen; some quietly painted their nails or applied lipstick and hair spray.
 
High School Piques Interest
The Japanese high school clearly sparked the most interest.
''What I don't like is the Japanese can get a scholarship before another guy,'' said Don Matera. His teacher pointed out that a student interviewed on the program had expressed the same fear, but that it had been shown to be not necessarily true. Many students expressed resentment that Japanese lived in the United States, but did not choose American high schools.
The report did not explain that the Japanese high school was founded because Japanese students educated overseas often fall behind their classmates at home and then fail the competitive examinations necessary for college in their country.
Such problems with sophistication and nuance were evident with both programs. For instance, even though the students had been watching discussions of Eastern Europe on CNN Newsroom for months, few moved beyond comments like, ''Communism is really falling apart.'' In both schools, discussion of the programs was fairly brief, given the constraints of 45- to 50-minute class periods.
Under contracts with Channel One, schools must show the program to most children 92 percent of the time. No videotaping or deleting of the commercials is allowed. Whittle will check compliance by installing monitoring devices, with permission of the schools, in certain sets. Participating schools receive, for the contract's three-year duration, a satellite dish, through which they receive the program directly; two video recorders, and televisions for most classrooms.
Turner Broadcasting, which briefly considered including commercials but dropped the idea after meeting stiff opposition, offers CNN Newsroom free. Local cable companies will connect schools to cable systems without charge. Schools, which must be in areas that have cable television available, pay $1 a day to receive the teachers guide through electronic mail, but get no free video equipment.
Explaining the need for the programs to slow their pace, Carla Seal-Wanner of Columbia University's Teacher's College said her research shows that teen-agers learn more from formats that include historic background and emphasis on people their age.
Ms. Seal-Wanner, director of the graduate program in instructional technology, praised Channel One's longer reports with their focus on teen-agers, but she found the program too simplistic.
CNN Newsroom did a better job presenting the news, she said, but failed to adapt the news to its audience.
''CNN has skewed it a little too much to making a news program and repackaging it for kids,'' she said. ''Whittle tried to make it too entertaining, assuming that kids aren't going to be interested.''

HEADLINE: GROWING CRITICISM FOR CLEAN AIR BILL

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
Governors Mario M. Cuomo of New York and Jim Florio of New Jersey today criticized the clean air bill offered as a compromise last week by Senate leaders and the Bush Administration, saying it would impede their ability to fight air pollution.
Mr. Cuomo said in a statement that the compromise had valuable provisions but that amendments would be needed ''to attain our goal: assuring every American citizen healthy air to breathe.''
Mr. Florio expressed similar concerns in a letter to the Senate Democratic leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine. Mr. Mitchell was a chief architect of the compromise, which was reached after a month of negotiations with the White House. 
The legislation would amend the Clean Air Act of 1970 to deal with unsolved air pollution problems, including acid rain, urban smog and toxic airborne chemicals. Senate leaders, giving ground to White House demands for a less costly effort, agreed to less stringent standards and a slower cleanup schedule. That concession angered some environmentalists and lawmakers.
 
Stiffer Controls Are Urged
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, said the bill proposed insufficient controls on tailpipe emissions, which are a major contributor to smog; on small factories and shops that also create smog, and on toxic chemicals in the air. Mr. Lautenberg said he would introduce amendments to strengthen these and other provisions.
The associations of state and local officers who administer the Federal air pollution law also criticized the agreement today and called for changes that would strengthen their authority to crack down on polluters. ''If we are to be successful in providing our citizens with healthful air,'' they told Senator Mitchell in a letter, ''we must have strong regulatory tools with which to work; this agreement falls short of providing us with those tools.''
James M. Lents, the president of the local air pollution control group, said the proposed compromise could lead to ''a new economic war between the states.'' Without a provision requiring the Federal Government to step in when states or cities are not complying with the law, he said, the way would be cleared for polluting industries to ''shop around from state to state to find those areas promising the least regulation.''

HEADLINE: Breaking the Ice With Japan, Again

 BODY:
President Bush's weekend talks with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu produced yet another Japanese pledge of economic reforms that could ease the two nations' tension over trade. Previous Prime Ministers have been unable to deliver as much as they seemed to promise but Mr. Kaifu introduced a welcome new element. His aim, he said, is to improve the quality of life in Japan - that is, to make changes because Japan needs them, not because America demands them. 
The bilateral friction turns on Japan's huge and seemingly intractable $50 billion surplus in trade with the United States. Removing Japanese barriers to imports won't remove the surplus but should reduce it.
It is unrealistic for Washington to demand a revolution in Japan's consensus-bound society. But Japan's friends in America and Europe grow increasingly impatient with a supposed ''partner'' who exports aggressively while limiting imports.
Mr. Bush proposed the meetings on the spur of the moment after Mr. Kaifu's re-election last month. If the President meant to convey frustration over the lack of progress in current trade negotiations between Washington and Tokyo, he surely made his point. If he sought an immediate breakthrough, he pounced too soon.
Mr. Kaifu had barely patched together his Cabinet before he was off to California to discuss fundamental issues he hasn't yet resolved at home. As Prime Minister, he has much less governmental power than a U.S. President. And Mr. Kaifu is further handicapped by the lack of a political following. He was a compromise choice of the long-dominant Liberal Democratic Party when its leaders were disgraced by scandal. To make matters worse from the American perspective, all the major candidates took tough positions on trade issues.
There are two negotiations under way, both forced on Japan by last year's U.S. trade legislation. In one, on specific products, Washington is pressing the Japanese to open their markets for supercomputers, communications satellites and wood products. In the other, broader talks, both governments seek basic changes. The U.S. wants Japan to open up its retail distribution system, to crack down harder on antitrust violations and to encourage consumption. Japan says America should reduce its budget deficit, raise its savings rate and improve education.
In terms of pure economics, both sides are talking good sense - about the other side. America could improve its competitiveness by doing what Tokyo urges; even President Bush agrees, but offers half-measures. Japan, in its turn, could improve the lot of the Japanese, and its acceptance as a world power, by opening up. Its hostility to foreign commerce and investment serves neither its own interests nor anyone else's.
No one should expect miracles from the new Prime Minister, still struggling to establish his grip. But his willingness to meet on short notice and his positive response to the President's arm-twisting demonstrate a welcome tilt toward comity.

HEADLINE: No Grand Turkish Alliance Looms on Horizon;
What 'Ethnic' Conveys

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I would caution against the tendency to refer to political demands by non-Russians in the Soviet Union as ''ethnic unrest,'' while referring to similar demands by Russians in ethnically neutral terms. Just because people are ''ethnic'' doesn't mean that so are their demands. 
I was struck by the difference in terminology in your two Feb. 15 reports on Soviet civic unrest. One article describes how Russians in Volgograd took to the streets to protest deteriorating economic conditions and calls this ''democratic, populist'' politics. Another article on the same page reports Tadzhiks in Dushanbe involved in ''ethnic violence.'' But a closer reading shows that the Tadzhiks too marched on Communist Party headquarters to demand the resignation of the local party chief and ''more action by the party to improve living standards in the impoverished area.'' Granted, the demands started after rumors were spread that Armenian refugees would be given scarce apartments, but the core of dissatisfaction is bad living conditions, rather than ethnic conflict.
More is at stake than linguistic exactness. People of all nationalities in the Soviet Union increasingly engage in assertive grass-roots politics and attack the Communist Party for political and economic mismanagement. Communist Party leaders are fighting back by raising the specters of anarchy and ethnic violence.
Granted that democratic traditions and ethnic tolerance need strengthening in the Soviet Union, but the way to do this is through more democracy and negotiation, rather than through martial law and an autocratic presidency.

HEADLINE: G.M. Layoffs: Wait It Out? Start Again?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: LINDEN, N.J., March 5

 BODY:
The 1,600 people laid off from the night shift at the General Motors assembly plant here 10 days ago find themselves at a crossroads.
Should they try to get by on unemployment insurance or temporary jobs and wait for G.M. to call them back? That might take two years. Or should they forget the high-paying assembly line and find new, more stable jobs?
''I don't expect ever to come back,'' said James Craig of Maplewood, who has worked for General Motors more than 20 years. ''And being 50 years old, it's kind of difficult to find something new. I'm just living day-by-day.'' 
Mr. Craig was one of about 30 unemployed workers who showed up at the United Auto Workers Local 595 union hall today as state employment counselors laid out options for them. An upstairs meeting room has been turned into a temporary hiring hall, and starting today workers will come here for advice, job referrals and unemployment checks. Some workers doubt that G.M. would shut down the Linden plant completely; it is one of the most modern that the company operates. It was built in 1937 but rebuilt and highly automated four years ago to turn out small Corsica and Beretta cars.
This layoff - which will last indefinitely, the company says - is to help reduce a backlog of inventory. Workers who plan to tough out the period of idleness expect to go back to some of the sweetest factory jobs in the state, with average wages of $15.36 an hour.
 
Other Jobs Are Limited
But the auto industry has been in a slump for more than two years, and if they are rehired, the workers know they could find themselves collecting unemployment insurance again someday.
Job hunting for factory workers is not what it used to be in New Jersey. According to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, 220,000 production jobs disappeared in the 1970's and 1980's and were replaced by office jobs. For workers with only assembly-line skills, finding work in an office is a long shot at best.
As they sat around long tables at the union hall smoking or sipping coffee, some of the G.M. workers appeared lost. Others looked like students in a classroom, listening with blank stares as job counselors cautioned them to be wary of expensive private technical schools promising quick careers. There wasn't much joking. ''I never thought I'd be laid off with 14 years on the line,'' Nancy R. Vine of Howell Township said during a coffee break.
 
Alert Given in December
Having been through a yearlong layoff when the plant was rebuilt, Mrs. Vine wasted no time deciding what to do when the recent layoffs were announced last December. She plans to start computer programming classes March 21 at the Brick Computer Science Institute, a private technical school near her home.
Mrs. Vine, 33, said she was going to try to make her way in a completely new field because her assembly-line experience - she worked on dashboards - cannot easily be transferred to other work.
She asked the counselors if G.M. would pay the $3,600 for her computer programming course. G.M. reimburses each laid-off worker up to $5,500 in tuition. But Mrs. Vine took a course in computer repair when she was laid off four years ago, and that cost $3,600, leaving her just $1,900 of the $5,500 to spend.
''They said come back next week to take an aptitude test,'' Mrs. Vine said.
 
'It's Going to Be Tough'
During the last layoff Umberto Pecoraro of Linden took a $2,000, two-week course in how to drive a tractor-trailer at the Smith & Solomon School in New Brunswick. ''But it's four years, and I didn't touch a truck,'' he said. He wants to take a refresher course, but he is not sure if G.M. will pay for it, because workers cannot take the same course twice.
The counselors could not give Mr. Pecoraro an answer either. They asked him to wait, but he said he could not wait long. He has a mortgage to pay and three children, 5, 6 and 9, to support. His wife does not work outside the house. ''It's going to be tough,'' he said.
Some of the more optimistic of the unemployed hope they can replace workers who retire from the day shift, where 1,700 people build about 430 cars a day. They do not plan to do anything but wait. Arnold J. Ricerca of Cranford is one. A maintenance worker with more than 16 years' seniority, he says he is not worried.
''We Italians are never insecure,'' said Mr. Ricerca, who came to the United States from Sicily 33 years ago. ''I don't have a big mortgage. I have a few thousand in the bank. The only thing is that it's hard, when you're 56, to put some money aside for retirement when all of a sudden you don't have a job.''
 
'How Much Can You Take?'
The uncertain nature of the auto industry, where one-month layoffs occur regularly and permanent shutdowns are always a possibility, has pushed some workers to their limits. ''I'm thinking of going down to Florida if I can find a job there,'' said Joseph Paprocki of Clark. ''I'm getting tired of G.M. throwing us out.''
Mr. Paprocki worked at the company's Hyatt Bearing plant in Clark for more than a decade before it closed in 1981. Then he shifted to the Linden plant. This is his second major layoff there. ''G.M. has been good to me all my life,'' he said, ''but how much can you take?''
Besides the tuition reimbursement, workers receive supplemental benefits to augment state unemployment checks. These benefits can equal 70 percent of their regular salaries and last for a few weeks to two years, depending on seniority.
Laid-off workers can be rehired by G.M. if they take other jobs, so long as they are not laid off longer than they worked at G.M.
 
Just Waiting Not Advised
The president of Local 595, Charles L. Marshall, has advised workers not to just collect their benefits and wait to be called back. He has urged them to go to school or get retraining, just in case they have to find another job.
Most of the 30 workers at today's workshop seemed to have accepted the union's advice. But some said they just did not care. While the unemployment counselors were interviewing workers upstairs, Stanley E. Drake sat downstairs at the union local's bar, tipping back a few drinks.
''There's a good chance that I'll be back, but I don't know.'' said Mr. Drake, who has worked on the line since 1976. His wife works, he has no car payment to make, no credit cards to pay and only a small mortgage on his house.
''If I have to, I'll wait the 11, 12 months until my benefits run out,'' Mr. Drake said, ''and then I'll start worrying.''

HEADLINE: 'Sense of Belonging' Keeps Carril at Princeton

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
Every now and then an offer would be made, and Pete Carril would have to decide, again, whether he wanted to remain the basketball coach at Princeton University or depart for a place where a coach's life could be simpler.
How simple? There is that world out there where scholarships are awarded on the basis of athletic ability, where centers are 6 feet 10 inches and taller, where athletes perform feats of great skill and coaches are paid major dollars to direct them. Even now, the thought of having that type of athlete in Jadwin Gym pushes his eyebrows upward.
''Pretty good, right?'' he said. ''But the response comes back: If he was 6-10 or 6-11, he wouldn't be playing for you.'' 
 
The Telling Sign
The reality could have been changed if Carril said yes when that other world was calling with some frequency. But when it did, something strange would happen. ''When I have a difficult decision to make,'' he said, ''I get a paralysis in my left arm. It's like anxiety. Once the decision is made, it begins to disappear.''
In an era that has seen games transformed into highly marketable properties and coaches abandon athletes they recruited for the sake of security or opportunity, Pete Carril's 23d Princeton team has secured an eighth appearance in the national collegiate tournament.
Next season, depending on the outcome of a computer evaluation of the relative strengths of conferences, the Ivy League's entry into the national tournament may not be so simple.
With 31 conference champions eligible for the field, and only 30 automatic bids in the 64-team field reserved for those teams, the leaders of the two lowest-rated conferences will have to compete for a position in the field. Which would mean that the Tigers, who one tournament ago were one controversial call away from the chance to defeat a No. 1-seeded team, could be placed in the position of a qualifier.
''I think it's wrong,'' Carril said the other day. ''It's unacceptable. But it's understandable. And it's unavoidable. For the schools that are concerned about revenue, they're going to get the same amount of revenue. We're not concerned that much about the revenue. What we're concerned about is a sense of belonging. You'd like to have a little sunshine in your life.''
Princeton (20-6) won the league championship with home victories over Cornell and Columbia last weekend, and now a National Collegiate Athletic Association computer will dictate some low-seeded position for the Tigers and they will be dispatched anywhere from Hartford to Long Beach, Calif., to meet one of the best 12 teams in the nation, and perhaps one of the top 4.
And then the Tigers will attempt to produce the type of effort that last March gave the tournament one of its more unlikely moments in years: the 50-49 loss to top-seeded Georgetown on St. Patrick's night. That loss in-spired congratulations for weeks and restored some self-esteem to Ivy League programs, but it did not change the role of the Tigers in the national basketball marketplace. ''The supermarket goes up,'' Carril said, ''and the little guy down the block has to sell his oranges. Milk costs more. Meat costs more. So the little guy goes out of business.''
 
No Network Offers
Princeton's most recent moment of athletic glory did not inspire network officials to beat down any doors. ''Let's say we opened the season this year with Georgetown,'' Carril said. ''We could have gotten on TV with that.'' It was mentioned that John Thompson, the Hoyas' coach, made it clear he had seen enough of Princeton.
''I might say we had enough of them, too,'' Carril ididanansmsmedede At a time when the offices of coaches are littered with videotape cassettes, Carril sits in a room that is dominated at one end by reminders of Princeton's past: neatly stacked and carefully labeled reels of film. A brown paper bag rests on the floor, near his left foot. A paper cup of soup, which has just been removed from the bag, is lunch.
''We don't have great basketball players in our league,'' he said. ''We have very good players and good players. I don't think anybody can expect more, considering the way things are done in the Ivy League, academically and in a financial way. It's not going to happen.'' The emotional national discussion of how to deal with athletes with combined college board scores of less than 700 points out of 1,600 takes place a solar system away. Academic credentials have always limited the league's pool, but economics have intensified Carril's limitations. There are roughly 21,020 reasons each year why a motivated student and outstanding athlete would choose to go elsewhere, and not even Carril can argue with that.
''When it comes down to Princeton and Duke, are you going to go to school for free, or are you going on your savings?'' he asked. ''That one is tough, because Duke is a good school. Not as highly ranked as ours, but it's a good school.''
 
Finally, He Really Is 59
All the while, as he has writhed in his seat on the Tiger bench as the result of a player's mistake or an official's judgment, or forcefully lent his players post-game criticism - constructive or otherwise - the Carril era has often given every appearance of self-inflicted torture. At 59 years, after 408 victories, 395 of them at Princeton, Carril is only now beginning to reach the age he has looked for years.
When the phone rang with opportunities - once, he said, from a professional team, the rest from colleges - the coach's left arm held proof that the genuine torment would be the contemplation of a goodbye. ''Every time I thought about it, I always had a guy on my team I liked, that I felt responsible for, and to,'' Carril remembered. ''The first time, Armond Hill was a freshman. I really liked that kid. I wanted to coach him. Then I had Frank Sowinski and Billy Omeltchenko. I really liked them, too. I said, 'No.'
''And then the next time, I had Craig Robinson, Richie Simkus and Gordon Enderle. The next time, I had Billy Ryan. Whenever it happened, there was someone I liked. It created a little dilemma. Thank goodness it's a little dilemma.''
Combine enough dilemmas and the result is an era. Carril estimates this one will last five more seasons, and then he has this idea of retirement:
''I wouldn't mind hooking on with a pro team,'' he said. ''I really would. I'd like to help some young guy out. Tell him some individual things. I wouldn't even sit on the bench. Sit in the press box somewhere and watch the game. And at halftime go down there and tell him what I saw. Nothing big.''
That is how his life could become simpler. Carril could play a part in the game without being dominated by the games. ''Just work on fundamentals,'' he said. ''Go in there and say hello to the head coach and say, 'What do you want me to do today?' '' Another Serious Problem? That is a question for another era. His oranges are still worth buying, and there will soon be another opportunity to force a highly ranked, high-profile operation to look at a first-round game as a suddenly serious problem.
Not that Carril would gloat about that. Until Princeton's latest championship weekend, he considered Yale a team of destiny and the only vibrations he felt were bad. At the start of another March, the coach would like you to believe the Tigers are on their own.
''Like I've told them,'' Carril said, ''if they're waiting for me to teach any more basketball than I've taught them, I don't know any more.''

HEADLINE: Defender of Rain Forest Is Named Secretary of Environment in Brazil

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, March 5

 BODY:
A pioneer conservationist is about to become Brazil's new Secretary of Environment.
The official, Jose Antonio Lutzenberger, was named last Friday by Brazil's President-elect, Fernando Collor de Mello. He will assume his new duties when the government takes office here on March 15. 
Over the last two decades, Mr. Lutzenberger built a worldwide reputation by assailing Brazilian governments over the burning of the Amazon rain forest, uncontrolled use of pesticides and invasions of Indian lands.
''It's stupefyingly positive - no one has more consistently fought for environmental awareness and legislation in Brazil than Jose Lutzenberger,'' Stephan Schwartzman of the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington, a longtime critic of Brazil's environmental policies, said today.
''It is difficult to imagine someone with a more solid international and national reputation on the environment,'' said Mr. Schwartzman, who is an anthropologist.
 
Repairing Brazil's Image
Indeed, a desire to repair Brazil's international image on environmental issues undoubtedly pushed Mr. Collor in recent days to assiduously court Brazil's crusty, 63-year-old environmental pioneer. Mr. Lutzenberger, an agronomist who speaks fluent English, French, German and Portuguese, emerged in the 1980's as an international spokesman for Brazil's fledgling environmental movement.
In 1984, he testified before the United States Congress against a World Bank loan for development of the Western Amazon. In 1988, the Swedish Parliament awarded him the ''Right Livelihood'' award, an environmental distinction billed by the parliamentarians as an ''alternative Nobel Prize.''
To win the support of the internationally respected environmentalist, Mr. Collor appears to have given ground on a key issue in the Amazon - the construction of a highway linking the untapped hardwood forests of the Western Amazon with Peru's Pacific Ocean ports.
''The private talks I had with Mr. Collor lead me to think that the road is not going to go forward,'' Mr. Lutzenberger said in a telephone interview today from his office in the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre.
''The only people really interested in that road are the Japanese wood industry,'' said Mr. Lutzenberger. ''It would be disastrous for the Amazon.''
As Brazil's top environmental official, he will have authority over environmental units that Mr. Collor promises to create in each of Brazil's 12 ministries. Mr. Lutzenberger will also oversee the Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, whose president, Fernando Cesar Mesquita, steps down in 10 days. $117 Million Loan Unlike his predecessor, Mr. Lutzenberger may have the means to carry out his plans. Last week the World Bank approved a $117 million loan to Brazil for environmental education, research and protection.
''Priority No. 1 is Amazonia; we have to reverse the devastation there,'' Mr. Lutzenberger said today. Mr. Lutzenberger, who in 1971 helped found one of southern Brazil's most militant ecological organizations, spent years in the 1950's studying soil science and agricultural chemistry at the University of Louisiana.

HEADLINE: Melamed Leaving as Head of Chicago Merc

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 5

 BODY:
Leo Melamed, whose leadership transformed the Chicago Mercantile Exchange from a sleepy backwater where mostly agricultural products were traded into a leading arena for the management of interest-rate and currency risks, announced today that he would relinquish his exchange duties at the end of the year.
Mr. Melamed, whose name has become synonymous with commodity and financial futures trading, said that he would step down from his $500,000-a-year job as chairman of the exchange's executive committee and as special counsel to the exchange's board.
Mr. Melamed, 57 years old, said that after 23 years in the exchange's leadership he had sacrificed enough and would now devote himself to his family, to trading for his own account, to managing the commodity firm he owns and to writing his memoirs and fiction. In 1987, Bonus Books of Chicago published Mr. Melamed's science-fiction novel, ''The Tenth Planet.'' He plans to write a sequel. 
''I want to recapture my life,'' Mr. Melamed told a crowded news conference here. ''I want to smell the flowers along the way while I can.''
No successor to Mr. Melamed was named, and the indications were that there would be none. Exchange officials suggested that Mr. Melamed's responsibilities would likely be shared by William Brodsky, the exchange's president and chief executive; John T. Gelderman, the chairman of the exchange's board of governors; Jack F. Sandner, a senior policy adviser to the exchange, and by other top exchange officials.
''Leo is irreplaceable,'' Mr. Brodsky said. ''In two short decades, he had led the futures industry to unparalleled dimensions, and he has shaped the Chicago Mercantile Exchange into a world-class institution. To say he will be missed is the ultimate understatement.''
The announcement caught the brokerage industry by surprise. ''I'm shocked,'' said T. N. Grant, the president of Refco Group Ltd. of Chicago. ''His retirement is a tremendous loss to the industry. He has made an enormous contribution and he will be missed.''
Indeed, Mr. Melamed is leaving an indelible imprint - not only on the mercantile exchange but on financial markets in general.
 
Futures Trading
Mr. Melamed's biggest contribution was to develop the idea of a financial future. In the early 1970's, he proposed a currency future that would allow banks, insurance companies, and other corporations to shield themselves from swings in currency rates. The financial future, like any other future contract, is an agreement to deliver a set amount of a commodity or cash in the future at a fixed price.
Working with Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate in economics, Mr. Melamed won Government approval in 1972 to trade contracts based on movements in the Swiss franc, the West German mark, the Canadian dollar and the Japanese yen. Later, what the exchange came to call its International Monetary Market was expanded to cover the Australian dollar and the British pound.
It was not until 1981, however, that the importance of Mr. Melamed's concept was to be fully appreciated. That year, the exchange introduced the first futures contract to be settled in cash. It allowed corporations to protect themselves against swings in interest rates.
And one year later, in 1982, Mr. Melamed's concept was again put to use, this time in the creation of a futures contract whose value would be tied to the level of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Since then, these ''index futures'' have come to be used by institutional investors around the world as a way to speculate on the direction of the stock market or to provide a level of insurance against a decline in the market, what investment professionals called ''portfolio insurance.''
 
Factor in Crash
To the extent, however, that portfolio insurance can cause declines in stocks themselves, the mercantile exchange has had to defend itself against criticism that its financial futures contribute to market instability. That is what happened in October 1987, when outsiders accused traders in the S.& P. 500 index of contributing to the stock market crash.
Mr. Melamed, however, came to the traders' defense. An often fiery orator who holds a law degree, he first placed advertisements in national newspapers to defend his exchange's activities. He then proved to be a convincing industry spokesman before Congress, providing testimony that helped stave off legislation that would have severely restricted commodity trading.
Mr. Melamed soon faced a new problem: the threat of tighter regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission after disclosure of a ''sting'' operation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the exchange's floor and at its larger rival, the Chicago Board of Trade. Worried that news of the sting might destroy the futures industry's image, Mr. Melamed assembled a panel of experts to recommend changes in commodity-trading practices and regulation. While the futures industry must now operate under tougher constraints, it remains largely self-regulated.
Critics have noted that it was on Mr. Melamed's watch that these abuses took place, saying that the exchange's leadership failed to take preventive steps.
Lately, Mr. Melamed's attenton has been focused on Globex, the after-hours electronic trading system he was also instrumental in developing. Globex is running behind schedule and has caused some internal battles at the exchange, but most experts agree that the computerized system will help insure the continued competitiveness of the exchange at a time when futures markets worldwide are competing for business.
 
Emigrated From Poland
Born in Poland, the son of Yiddish teachers, Mr. Melamed moved with his parents to Chicago in the early 1940's. Years later, Mr. Melamed drove a cab to pay his law-school tuition and to support his wife and child. Shortly after graduating from law school, he borrowed $3,100 from his father to begin trading egg futures at what was then the mercantile exchange's predecesor. Striking it rich, he organized young members of the exchange into a coalition that in 1967 elected him to his first position in the exchange's leadership, a seat on the exchange's board of governors.
When he joined the board, stock traders in the East either thumbed their nose at the Chicago exchange or considered it to be populated by ruffians and hayseeds. By persuading corporations of all stripes to hedge their currency and interest-rate risks at the exchange, Mr. Melamed helped raise the self-esteem of its members, and the exchange's reputation and influence grew.
''We've achieved a level of respect,'' Mr. Melamed said. ''We're an equal in our industry.''

HEADLINE: Rate Moves: No Firm Global Link

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
When interest rates go up in one major industrial country, must they also do so in others? The recent rise of West German, Japanese and American rates, in tandem, has given that impression. But plenty of room still exists for the United States to control its own interest rates, even going against the trend in other countries.
The United States, in fact, has been quietly going against the global grain for over a week. While people buying German and Japanese bonds have insisted upon somewhat higher interest rates in return for their money, those buying American securities have settled for rates that have remained essentially unchanged since late February.
''Interest rates in one ocean bay are affected by rates in another bay,'' said Paul Samuelson, the Nobel laureate in economic science. ''But they don't mingle perfectly. There is considerable room for differences.'' 
The differences stem from such distinctly national phenomena as whether investors consider a particular country a safe place to put their money and whether a nation's inflation rate is rising or falling.
These differences, however, did not show themselves in January, when German and Japanese interest rates suddenly rose and American rates went up with them. The phenomenon seemed to confirm the often-cited ''pool of money'' thesis, which holds that a worldwide pool of savings exists, one that moves easily across borders, seeking the highest rate of return, as measured by interest rates. The rates are offered to attract money for such things as financing the American budget deficit or the rebuilding of East Germany.
There is such a worldwide pool of savings and it does move across borders, but not as easily as theory suggests and not in such single-minded response to the highest bidder, economists say. The problem is that the demand for loans is rarely as great as the worldwide supply of savings, so rates do not have to rise to compete for funds. ''Using the concept of funds flowing across borders to explain interest rate movements is a trap,'' said Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant. ''Rates can change in one country or another without any great demand for money.''
 
Behind the Divergence
As if to demonstrate the point, American, German and Japanese rates have begun to decouple, marching once again largely to their own tunes. Economists cite two major reasons for the divergence.
One is safety or, more specifically, whether investors feel sure that money invested in one country's securities will not suddenly disappear or suffer an accident. Right now, concern is growing about the safety of money in Japan and Germany. Japanese stock prices have plunged in recent weeks, suggesting that the Tokyo stock exchange might be flirting with a crash. And investors are nervous about the economies in Eastern Europe.
In these uncertain situations, American securities are often thought of as a safe place to park money, even though Japanese and German interest rates keep rising, as they have in recent days to lure the money to Tokyo and Europe.
 
Inflation Concerns
The second reason why interest rates go in different directions is the most important, involving a distinctly national phenomenon that money brokers everywhere refer to as their ''expectations'' about inflation. ''Right now, they expect the inflation rate to rise more in Japan and Germany than in the United States,'' said Nicholas Sargen, chief of bond research at Salomon Brothers.
The mechanics are plain enough. When inflation seems to threaten in Germany, for example, an investor thinking of buying German bonds reasons this way: Why purchase a bond that yields 9 percent when inflation in that country might rise to an annual rate of, say, 6 percent or 7 percent, diluting most of the income's purchasing power, not only in Germany but probably elsewhere as well. Better to buy an American bond that pays 8.5 percent interest and count on the American inflation rate of 4.5 percent to remain unchanged.
If the expectation about the American inflation rate turns out to be correct, then only about half the purchasing power of the income from the Treasury note would be eaten up. The ''real'' return would be 4 percent (the 8.5 percent yield minus the 4.5 percent loss to inflation) while the real return on the German bond would be only 2 or 3 percent.
 
Seeking the 'Real' Return
Just this sort of thinking is now in evidence. Interest rates on German and Japanese 10-year bonds have risen by one-quarter to one-half a percentage point since Feb. 22, reaching 7.12 percent yesterday in Japan and 8.97 percent in Germany. But the rate on 10-year United States Treasury notes has held steady at just above or just below 8.5 percent, closing yesterday at 8.63 percent. Americans, and also foreign investors, have gone for the higher ''real'' return on American securities, and as they bought the dollars needed to purchase them, the dollar rose in value.
Never mind that actual inflation is less of a problem in West Germany and Japan today than it is in the United States. The annual inflation rate in the United States is now 4.5 percent, compared with rates in Germany and Japan of less than 3 percent. But the expectation is that inflation will get worse in Japan because of its booming economy and in West Germany because of the financial strain in rebuilding East Germany.
A third factor that makes interest rate movements a national rather than global phenomenon is the power of the major central banks to manipulate interest rates on short-term securities. Changes in these rates usually influence long-term rates, independently of international forces.
 
'Large Exaggeration'
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, weighed in on this point in Congressional testimony last week. He said that while there is influence from rising rates in Germany and Japan, ''the presumption that it ties our hands and makes our monetary policy ineffective is a very large exaggeration.''
If all this is true, why then did American, German and Japanese rates rise in unison from early January through mid-February? Some economists, among them A. John Steigmann, research director at the Ford Motor Company, call what happened ''largely a coincidence.'' Three factors came together in December to create the global rise in rates.
One was the view that the American economy had finally gotten as weak as it was going to get and would rebound in the new year, pulling up the American inflation rate as the demand for goods intensified. Suddenly, a 7.7 percent yield on the 10-year Treasury note did not seem so appetizing, and it rose to offset the expected erosion from a higher inflation rate, reaching 8.66 percent last month before expectations changed again. Fresh data about the American economy have convinced the bond market, for the moment, that last year's 4.5 percent inflation rate might continue unchanged, after all, into 1990.
Simultaneously in December, rates rose in Japan because a new chief of the Bank of Japan called attention to the potential for a higher inflation rate in that country, and tried to head it off by pushing up Japanese interest rates. That was a classic tactic of central banks. Higher rates discourage spending financed with loans, thus reducing the demand for goods.
Also in December, expectations changed in West Germany. The Berlin wall was breached and suddenly there was talk of extending the West German currency to East Germany, giving 15 million East Germans, in one fell swoop, the wherewithal to buy West German goods. That is potentially inflationary.
What's more, the expectation arose that West Germany would need higher interest rates to attract billions of dollars from the world's pool of savings to finance the rebuilding of East Germany. ''Markets run in anticipation of real events that might never materialize,'' said Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economic consultant.

HEADLINE: End-of-Month Vehicle Sales Decline 7.9%

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 5

 BODY:
Sales of domestic cars and light trucks fell 7.9 percent in late February, dimming hopes that a sales surge at the beginning of the month had signaled an end to the automobile industry's slump.
''The industry still has not emerged from the woods,'' said Maryann N. Keller, an auto industry analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney. ''The fact that sales are down in February compared with January is not a good sign.''
On a seasonally adjusted basis, cars sold at an annual rate of 6.8 million for the entire month of February, down from 7.1 million a year earlier and well below the January sales rate of 7.5 million. But the seasonal rate improved from December, when cars sold at a rate of 6.5 million. 
 
One Encouraging Sign
The lackluster results were still encouraging to some analysts, who noted that vehicle sales actually picked up after a dismal reporting period in the middle of the month.
''The auto industry has reduced inventories dramatically, and it looks poised for a very nice second quarter,'' said John V. Kirnan, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Company.
Sales of light trucks, which account for nearly a third of vehicles sold in the United States, also declined by 10 percent in late February. For the month, light-truck sales dropped 6.7 percent.
Sales of cars and light trucks, including imports, fell 4.6 percent in the month, to a total of 725,153 cars and 330,694 light trucks.
The sales results for February suffered by comparison with last year, when the big auto makers kicked off a round of incentives that resulted in higher sales. Some analysts suggested that big discounts in January had contributed to the monthly sales decline, by drawing buyers who might otherwise have waited and bought cars in February.
 
Dealers Wait to Order
But dealers reported that they were still holding back on orders for many new cars and trucks, as showroom traffic and sales volume dwindled during a normally slow month.
Some analysts suggested that potential buyers were concerned about a slowing economy, postponing new vehicle purchases. ''It's more of a weakness in consumer confidence rather than a downturn,'' said Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's survey of consumer attitudes.
The Ford Motor Company's car sales plunged 24.5 percent for the 10 days, and the Chrysler Corporation suffered an 11.6 percent downturn in car sales.
''Ford's 10-day performance results from being extremely lean in inventory,'' Mr. Kirnan said.
The General Motors Corporation fared relatively better than its domestic rivals, with car sales down 3.8 percent for the 10-day period and down 6.4 percent for the month.
Ford's truck sales fell 10.8 percent in late February.
 
End of Rebates Hurts Chrysler
Chrysler suffered the results of discontinued rebates on its mini-vans. Sales of Chrysler's light trucks dropped 21.3 percent in late February, and car sales fell 11.6 percent.
''Chrysler took incentives off the most important vehicle, Voyager,'' said Joseph C. Masterpaul, sales manager at South Bay Chrysler-Plymouth in Torrance, Calif., referring to one of the popular mini-van models. ''And that one move made February a slow sales month.''
The Voyager normally outsells all other Chrysler cars and trucks at his dealership, Mr. Masterpaul said, accounting for half of the dealership's sales. While South Bay is continuing to stock up on mini-vans, ''we're still holding off on orders for other Chrysler vehicles until we can see signs of something positive happening,'' he said.
The Japanese producers that build cars in the United States - known as ''transplants'' - posted gains for the 10 days and the month, with the exception of the Nissan Motor Company.
The Japanese transplants accounted for 10.2 percent of February car sales, up from 7 percent in 1989. Import sales volume for the month remained steady at 26.5 percent of the market this year and last.
The foreign brand share of the car market, consisting of imports and transplants, amounted to 36.7 percent of sales in February, compared with 33.5 percent last year.

Chief Executive Post For Armco President

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Armco Inc., the nation's fifth-largest steelmaker, announced yesterday that Robert L. Purdum would be the company's next chief executive, succeeding Robert E. Boni.
Mr. Purdum, 54 years old, is currently Armco's president and chief operating officer. He will assume his new post April 27, the date of the annual shareholders meeting. He will continue as president. 
Mr. Boni, 62, chairman and chief executive, will stay on as chairman and devote his efforts to board matters as well as strategy and technology, the company said.
The announcement held no surprises. Mr. Purdum is a longtime Armco executive who is likely to keep the company on its present course. Neither Mr. Boni nor Mr. Purdum was available for interviews yesterday, an Armco spokesman said.
In a statement, Mr. Boni said his decision to step down as chief executive was ''part of a succession plan we have had in place for some years.'' He added that ''the time has come for me to turn over the day-to-day guidance of this company to a man who has more than earned the opportunity.''
Under Mr. Boni, Armco, which is based in Parsippany, N.J., struggled back from the brink of financial disaster and is now showing a profit. But its income for the fourth quarter of last year dropped 51.6 percent from the corresponding period a year earlier. The company cited a softening economy, particularly in the auto industry.
Last year, Armco sold 40 percent of its Eastern steel division to the Kawasaki Steel Corporation of Japan for $350 million in a bid to make its operations more efficient and to lower costs.
Mr. Boni gives Mr. Purdum some of the credit for pulling the company through in the years of its worst financial problems. ''Bob Purdum and I have worked together over the past five difficult years, first to survive, and then to build this company into a strong, competitive force in the industry,'' Mr. Boni said.
Mr. Purdum joined Armco in 1962 after graduating from Purdue University as a civil engineer. In an interview when he was named president in 1986, Mr. Purdum said he had ''grown up with Armco'' and held a wide variety of jobs in most of its units. He and his wife, Arlene, have three sons.

HEADLINE: G.M. Plans To Merge Engine Units

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 5

 BODY:
In a move that analysts say may cut costs and improve efficiency, the General Motors Corporation disclosed plans today to consolidate its two engine operations into a single division.
The action further blends the identities of G.M.'s once-distinct car divisions, which were merged in 1984 into two automotive groups, Chevrolet-Pontiac-G.M. of Canada and Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac. Critics of the reorganization suggest that G.M. has lost some of its distinctiveness as a car maker, saying brand distinctions have blurred and lookalike cars have emerged from the two groups. 
 
Focusing Resources
But G.M. officials say the new engine division will bolster the company's market appeal by cutting out redundant operations and focusing resources on engine development.
''Outwardly, G.M. has worked hard to differentiate its models and get away from criticism that all of its cars look alike,'' said Michael M. Luckey of the Luckey Group, an auto industry consulting firm. ''At the same time, in their effort to make money and control costs, G.M. is trying to consolidate a lot of the things that are not outwardly visible, like engines.''
Company officials declined to say how much money could be saved by the consolidation. But they acknowledged some overlap in the cost-intensive design and engineering activities that go into developing engines.
''The recommendations to form a single engine division were not put together with the goal of idling plants and laying off people,'' said Charles C. Licari, a G.M. spokesman. ''On the other hand, we know there are efficiencies to be gained by integrating the operations.''
The auto maker now employs 20,000 in the engine-making operations of the two groups, which manufacture 19 different engines.
 
Stempel's Stamp Is Seen
The project bears the imprimatur of G.M.'s president, Robert C. Stempel, an engineer and a backer of the Quad 4 multivalve engine.
Industry analysts say many G.M. cars do not meet the demands of performance-conscious car buyers.
''Engines are super-important,'' Mr. Luckey said. ''One of the reasons that the Japanese continue to gain market share is because their multivalve engines give higher performance and better fuel economy.''

HEADLINE: Volvo Accord With Renault

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 5

 BODY:
The chairman of Volvo A.B., the Swedish auto maker, said today that it could take until the mid-1990's for the fruits of its alliance with France's state-owned Renault to show up in the form of higher profits.
Pehr G. Gyllenhammar said that while cost-cutting measures could be carried out almost immediately, significant payoffs from the alliance would take much longer. ''The big money will take four to five years, I think, because it has to do with the components and products that we can develop jointly,'' Mr. Gyllenhammar said.
The two auto makers on Feb. 23 announced an agreement in which they will take stakes in each other and work jointly in the future in such areas as research, product development and purchasing.
The accord aims to achieve economies of scale and to extend the reach of both companies, although each will remain legally independent. Executives at both companies say the Volvo and Renault brand names will remain distinct.
Renault's president, Raymond H. Levy, accompanying Mr. Gyllenhammer at a news conference, declined to say when he thought profits would improve as a result of the alliance.
Mr. Gyllenhammar reiterated that the decision to forge the agreement with Renault did not represent an effort by either of the partners eventually to take over the other.
Asked about rumors that Volvo was in talks with Mitsubishi Motors of Japan and the Chrysler Corporation of the United States on possible cooperation agreements or joint ventures, Mr. Gyllenhammar said, ''There's an ongoing dialogue in our business.''
Under terms of the accord with Renault, each partner can enter joint ventures and partnerships with other companies, provided that the other partner approves, he said.

 BODY:
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told Parliament today that his meeting with President Bush had produced ''very good results'' in reducing economic friction and was not a case of one-sided yielding to United States pressure on trade issues.
''Do you really believe dialogue is bad?'' Mr. Kaifu asked the chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party, Takako Doi, who delivered lengthy criticism of the policies of his Liberal Democratic Party. ''To avoid going backward, we must continue cooperating.''
Leaders of the Socialists, the largest opposition group, accused Mr. Kaifu of weakness in the weekend meeting in Palm Springs, Calif. ''What promises did you make to President Bush in the United States?'' Miss Doi asked after maintaining that Mr. Kaifu's trip, on a week's notice, lacked ''adequate preparation or consultations.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Down Sharply

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell sharply in light trading yesterday as dealers, facing losses from a weakening market, chose to liquidate positions.
A number of factors contributed to the selloff, traders said, including revived rumors that the Bank of Japan is almost sure to raise its discount rate, currently at 4.5 percent, by at least half a percentage point. A rise in Japan's discount rate could lead to a further increase in Japanese market rates, which, investors fear, could have an adverse impact on interest rates in the United States.
In addition, market participants took little comfort from comments by Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Mr. Parry, a well-known inflation hawk, said the inflation rate, currently at about 4.5 percent, is not likely to move lower until 1991. Bond prices move higher when inflation falls, so market participants are not likely to be encouraged by the forecast of inflation remaining at current levels for the foreseeable future. 
 
Effect of Auto Report
On the other hand, dealers for the most part shrugged off a report that showed auto sales weakened in February from the month before. The nation's Big Three auto makers sold a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.8 million vehicles last month, down from 7.5 million in January.
''The market is not paying any attention to fundamentals right now,'' one government-bond trader said. ''All of the economic news right now is bullish, but the Street got trapped long, and now they are getting out.''
Bad news for the economy, like the lower auto sales report, is good news for the bond markets because it is generally assumed that slower economic growth will lead to lower inflation. Lower inflation means higher real rates of return on fixed-income securities.
Dealers said the dollar, which declined slightly on foreign exchange markets in the face of concerted selling by major central banks, was not an influence in yesterday's selloff.
''The dollar was off a little bit, but not enough to explain the magnitude of the decline that we have had,'' said David Green, manager of government-bond trading at Chemical Bank.
 
Full-Point Declines
Price declines of more than a point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, were recorded for some long-term issues.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at 98 14/32, down 37/32, to yield 8.64 percent. In late trading on Friday, the closely watched issue was offered at a price to yield 8.53 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 5/32, down 22/32, to yield 8.62 percent. Meanwhile, the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offerd at 99 18/32, down 14/32, to yield 8.59 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 29/32, down 1/8 of a point, to yield 8.55 percent.
Rates rose on new three-month and six-month Treasury bills offered at the weekly auction yesterday.
Three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.85 percent, up from an average rate of 7.72 percent at the bill sale a week earlier. It was the highest rate on a three-month bill since the auction of Sept. 5.
Six-month bills were sold at an average rate of 7.79 percent, compared with 7.70 percent at the sale last week. The new rate was the highest since the six-month bill auction on Oct. 2.
 
Link to U.S. Rates
Despite concerns about a possible rise in the Japanese discount rate, analysts suggested that such an increase was not likely to move interest rates in the United States up by very much.
''Long-term interest rates in Japan are only 1.5 percentage points below where they are in the United States, yet inflation there is only about half a percentage point lower than it is here,'' said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides analysis on activity in the credit and foreign exchange markets. ''On that basis, it seems to me that the Bank of Japan has plenty of room to tighten monetary policy.''
In other fixed-income markets, traders said that prices of most actively traded investment-grade corporate bonds dipped by about 3/8 of a point in sympathy with the decline in Treasury prices.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, market participants said that prices of most issues fell by between 1/4 of a point and 3/8 of a point in light trading.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Drops After Selling By the Main Central Banks

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar dropped yesterday after a round of coordinated selling by central banks including the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the West German Bundesbank and eight other European central banks.
The surprise of the day was that the Federal Reserve intervened by selling dollars for West German marks in addition to selling dollars for yen, which it has been doing since Feb. 23. The West German central bank, the Bundesbank, and the other European central banks all sold dollars for marks, traders said. The sale of dollars depresses the dollar's value. 
The dollar selling for marks by the Federal Reserve, which traders said the Fed did once, seemed to add to the belief that a joint effort was under way to keep the dollar from rising against the mark. This was taking place even though the dollar has been at the bottom of or below the range of 1.70 marks to 1.90 marks that the United States and its economic allies are believed to have agreed on.
In late trading in New York, the dollar was valued at 1.6965 marks, down from 1.7150 on Friday. Against the yen, the dollar was at 148.96, down from 150.25 on Friday, its highest close in New York trading in two and a half years.
The British pound continued to fall against the dollar, a decline that traders said reflected growing concern about inflation in England and worries about the future of the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Government. The pound fell to $1.6443, down from $1.6500 on Friday and $1.6983 a week earlier. The dollar also declined against other major European currencies and the Canadian dollar.
The decline of the dollar yesterday meant that the intervention had more impact than a similar round on Friday, when the Bundesbank first showed its concern about the rising dollar as it sold dollars for marks for the first time since Jan. 4. The dollar rose against the yen and fell only slightly against the mark.
The effort to prop up the yen has gone on for several weeks. The declining yen has been a significant factor in the fall of Japanese stock market. But there is still a stalemate in Japan over the decision to raise interest rates, which would help support the yen.
''You add a little bit of mystery with the Fed,'' said James T. McGroarty, senior vice president of Greenwich Captial Markets Inc., in Greenwich, Conn. He said the action seems to indicate that there ''still is a preference to see the dollar lower'' than the 1.70 level at the bottom of the range.
Mr. McGroarty acknowledged that the Fed selling of dollars for marks could signify less than he suspected. The Fed simply could have sold dollars for marks at the request of the Bundesbank, a courtesy extended between central banks.
The dollar's rally against the mark has reflected uncertainty over the inflationary consequences of the unification of the two Germanys and doubts about the Bundesbank's ability to contain that inflation.

HEADLINE: Careers;
A New Look At M.B.A. Education

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
NOT all M.B.A. students are created equal, a problem that has bothered faculties and deans for years.
Some of those working toward a master of business administration degree have majored in engineering, others in liberal arts. Some are foreign citizens with different cultures; others have personality difficulties. Many lack communications skills; some lack a knowledge of history, mathematics or languages that can give depth to careers. Most need more understanding of international affairs. 
Last week David H. Blake, since January the dean at the Edwin L. Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University, presided at a regional meeting of liberal arts and business school professors. The conference, titled ''International Dimensions in U.S. Higher Education: New Directions in Business School and Liberal Arts Cooperation,'' was held at the Peat Marwick training center in Montvale, N.J.
Dr. Blake summarized the group's findings. One was that ''so many students lack language ability'' and another was that ''exposure to history, culture and political issues is so crucial to international understanding.''
In an interview, he said there would be a new ''commitment to individual assessments'' at his school to recognize differences in students' backgrounds.
Assessing such differences is an idea whose time has come in a world where diversity is widespread, Dr. Blake said. ''We now are trying to focus on the individual.''
Individual assessments are already being made at a few other schools, like Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Management, which measures each student's management abilities as a guide to developing the most effective program for that student.
Listing changes already in place at S.M.U.'s Cox school, Dr. Blake spoke of ''the effort to weave international and ethical considerations into courses.'' In another year there will be a business school requirement that students take at least one international course in area studies, like the Pacific Rim, or in cultural anthropology.
Citing the importance of a multi-disciplinary approach, he explained that as a professor ''I always talked about balance-of-payments problems in my political science courses.''
To strengthen the curriculum, he said, there would be more recognition of the value of a multi-disciplined faculty. In the past, when he was dean of the Rutgers University Graduate School of Management, he hired psychologists, sociologists, philosophers of science and even an art historian. ''It forces faculty members to think more broadly and talk to each other,'' he explained.
Dr. Blake, 49 years old, a Dartmouth College graduate who got his M.B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh and a Ph.D in international politics from Rutgers, was a professor at the Rutgers business school and later dean until his move to S.M.U., in Dallas.
Since 1974, he said, S.M.U. has called upon top corporate executives to meet the students. Because executives are not expected to provide jobs, the relationship remains relaxed. The discussions concern job opportunities, company problems, international aspects and executive life. For example, a top executive of a Dallas company took a half-dozen students in the corporate jet to a New York securities analysts' meeting at which he spoke.
In addition to its 11-month-long M.B.A. program with 160 students, S.M.U. offers the degree in evening classes for 350 students. In addition, 80 executive M.B.A. students are spending about two years in part-time studies to complete the program and take a trip abroad, this year to Britain.
One interesting, and largely undocumented, change at graduate business schools, he said, involves the growing use of endowed chairs, both to attract new faculty members and to encourage those already on the staff. The chairs, usually named for a donor, enable schools to offer higher pay. S.M.U. has about a dozen business school chairs, he said. As a lure for younger faculty members, S.M.U. has ''named professorships,'' which last five years.
One indication of this trend came last week when New York University's Stern School of Business named Dr. Richard Sylla, a leading economic historian, to its new professorship of the history of financial institutions and markets, endowed by the economist Henry Kaufman.
Dr. Sylla was most recently a professor and associate head of the economics and business department at North Carolina State University. His history specialty is one that many graduate school deans like Dr. Blake say will have growing importance at a time when the nation faces crises like the failure of many savings and loan institutions, the overlending by major commercial banks to developing countries, and the collapse or near collapse of some large investment houses.

HEADLINE: Upheaval in the East;
Webster and Cheney at Odds Over Soviet Military Threat

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
The Director of Central Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense are at odds over whether the Soviet Union will continue to pose a serious military threat to the United States and the West.
The dispute, embarrassing to an Administration that has tried to keep divisions hidden from public view, arose last week when the Director of Central Intelligence, William H. Webster, said American intelligence experts believed it unlikely that the Soviets would pose a major conventional military threat in the forseeable future, even if President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is replaced by hard-liners.
Mr. Webster's assessment drew a pointed response over the weekend from Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who said in a television interview that Mr. Webster's remarks were ''not helpful'' to his efforts to win approval of the Bush Administration's defense spending proposals.
 
Dispute Over Core Issue
Mr. Cheney seemed nettled by the timing of Mr. Webster's comments, which were made to the House Armed Services Committee at a time when the Defense Secretary is seeking to persuade the same committee not to make large cuts in military spending. 
But the two men appear to be in disagreement over the core issue of whether the Soviet Union will remain a rival to the West in the long-term future. Mr. Cheney has repeatedly argued that Moscow will pose a potentially serious military threat for some time, regardless of who is in power.
''No one predicted what's transpired in the Soviet Union in the last few years,'' he said on Sunday. ''So I'm a little reluctant to make hard and fast judgments about the future that assume that the Soviet peaceful intentions will continue, that Gorbachev will be successful and that the Soviets will never again adopt a hostile policy toward the rest of the world.''
 
Differences Played Down
A Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, said today that Mr. Cheney and Mr. Webster differ ''on predictions for the future'' but basically agree on the current state of the Soviet military and the nation's political situation.
The White House played down any difference between the two men. President Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said today that their views of the Soviet military capability ''are not mututally exclusive, but indeed give us a good picture of the problem.''
The White House said today that officials there had read Mr. Webster's remarks before they were delivered to the Armed Services Committee and saw ''no problems'' with them.
A Pentagon spokesman said today that Mr. Cheney had not seen Mr. Webster's testimony before it was delivered. But a Bush Administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said copies of Mr. Webster's remarks were given in advance to the National Security Council and to aides to Mr. Cheney and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.
 
Political Implications
The dispute has important policy and political implications because estimates of the Soviet threat are a key consideration in the preparation of the defense budget and military strategy, and are also likely to play an important role in Congressional discussions about whether to make deeper cuts in the Pentagon budget.
Within the intelligence community, Mr. Cheney's suggestion that Mr. Webster should hedge the conclusions of his analysts to suit the Bush Administration's effort to sell its Pentagon budget is regarded as an insult to the integrity of the intelligence system.
Mr. Webster's predecessor, William J. Casey, was sometimes accused of shading the judgments of C.I.A. analysts on such sensitive subjects as Nicaragua to manufacture support for the Reagan Administration's political goals. The accusation is regarded as an especially serious breach of ethics among intelligence experts.
A spokesman for the C.I.A., Mark Mansfield, today refused to concede even that Mr. Webster and Mr. Cheney disagreed, and he would not comment on Mr. Cheney's weekend criticism.
 
A Scheduled Breakfast
Asked several times to address the difference of opinion, Mr. Mansfield eventually replied, ''Our job is to provide the best information and analysis that we can, and that was reflected in Judge Webster's testimony to the House Armed Services Committee.''
Another Government official said the two men were expected to discuss the matter more thoroughly at a scheduled breakfast in the next few days.
Mr. Webster's testimony was his most extensive public statement to date on the Soviet military situation. In it, he acknowledged for the first time the possibility that Mr. Gorbachev might be ousted from office and succeeded by reactionaries who favor rebuilding the nation's offensive military capacity.
But even so, he said, ''there is little chance that Soviet hegemony could be restored in Eastern Europe.''
 
A Conflicting View
''A successor regime would face the same types of economic and political pressures that President Gorbachev has, and would probably continue to pursue arms control agreements with the West,'' he said. ''It would be unlikely, in addition, to seek a broad reversal of the changes that have occurred in Eastern Europe, or to try to reverse the Warsaw Pact.''
That view conflicts with Mr. Cheney's stated opinions on the Soviet conventional military threat. The Secretary's 1990 budget proposal states on its first page that Mr. Gorbachev's reductions in Soviet military capabilities in Europe and elsewhere ''are still relatively easy to reverse,'' and that the United States ''must be prepared to remain in long-term competition'' with the Soviets.
Similarly, Mr. Cheney told a Houston audience in January that changes in the Soviet Union ''are potentially reversible'' and that ''it would be very risky business for the United States to make policy based on the assumption that the transition we now see in the Soviet Union will continue on a peaceful, orderly basis.''
The Commerce Department is reworking proposed Federal limits on the export of high-performance computers to Western allies, agency officials said. Business Day, page D2.

HEADLINE: Daimler-Benz and Mitsubishi Negotiating Cooperative Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 6

 BODY:
In what may prove to be one of the most far-reaching industrial linkups, the largest business groups in Japan and West Germany, Mitsubishi and Daimler-Benz, said today that they were negotiating a plan of ''intensive cooperation'' in automobile technology, aerospace, microelectronics and a number of service industries.
If the agreement is completed, as executives on both sides said they anticipated, it will create a series of joint ventures that will give Daimler access to some of Japan's best technology and give the giant Mitsubishi empire a desperately needed foothold in Europe before that market is integrated in 1992.
The arrangement could also pose an enormous competitive challenge for the United States, pitting its biggest businesses against the combined talents and marketing skills of the two most aggressive industrial groups in the booming German and Japanese economies.
 
Areas of Interest
Japan is particularly interested in Daimler's jet engines and the prospect of building cars with the world's leading maker of luxury cars, Mercedes-Benz; Germany's main interest is electronics, high-technology equipment and space technology, all areas in which Mitsubishi excels.
In separate statements today, both companies said they would meet soon to work out specific accords, but Daimler said that they regarded the talks as ''promising of success.'' 
The announcement came after a secret meeting this weekend in Singapore involving the top executives of Daimler-Benz and the presidents or chairmen of the four biggest of the 29 Mitsubishi companies - Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Motors, Mitsubishi Electric and the Mitsubishi Corporation. The Mitsubishi Corporation, the leader of the group, is one of Japan's biggest trading companies. The meeting was apparently suggested by Edzard Reuter, the energetic chairman of Daimler's managing board.
Neither side would say whether the two groups planned to take an equity interest in each other or whether the arrangement would go beyond cooperation in technology and marketing. But Daimler said, ''The independence of both groups will be respected.'' Daimler-Benz had sales of $37.3 billion in 1988, before its recent acquisition of Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm G.m.b.H., the aerospace concern; the combined Mitsubishi companies had sales of about $82 billion.
In an unusual statement, Japan's powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry appeared to give its blessing to the deal tonight, saying, ''We welcome the two groups entering into broad-ranging cooperation at a time when international cooperation is seen in so many areas.''
But a senior ministry official acknowledged that the proposed alliance was rife with political problems. Members of the European Community are deeply suspicious of Japan's rush to enter the European market before 1992. On Monday, amid renewed debates over restraints on Japanese ''transplant'' auto plants in Europe, Edith Cresson, France's Minister for European Affairs, said Japan's ''strategy is to set up plants in Japan, Europe and America wherever they can and switch production so they can destroy U.S. and European auto makers.''
Moreover, both companies are closely associated with the rise of the Axis powers 50 years ago, a history that, one Japanese official said recently, ''will never go away.'' Mitsubishi Heavy Industries built the Zero, the durable fighter that led Japan's invasion forces throughout Asia; Messerschmitt built much of the Luftwaffe. Even today, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is Japan's largest arms maker and Daimler is one of Europe's largest.
Japan is barred from exporting arms or arms technology, except for special agreements with the United States. And a Mitsubishi spokesman, Masao Takemoto, said tonight that the exchange of ideas and technology would ''specifically exclude defense.'' It is unclear how the two companies would handle what the military terms ''dual use technologies'' that can be used for both commercial and military purposes, like electronics or high-temperature metals used in jet engines.
The announcement of the agreement comes as a number of Japanese companies are scrambling to link up with European partners, or build their own operations in Europe. Most of Japan's leading car makers, for example, have announced plans to build plants within the European Community, except for Mitsubishi Motors, which has long been rumored to be negotiating with Mercedes for a production partnership. Mitsubishi helps market Mercedes in Japan.
 
To Relax Frictions
At a news conference today, attended only by Japanese reporters, Yoshio Taniguchi, vice president of Mitsubishi, reportedly said the company hoped the business alliance would relax trade frictions between Japan and the European Community. But he gave no specifics of the arrangements, saying only that the companies had scheduled further meetings.
The Singapore meeting, he said, was attended by Yotaro Iida, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries; Toyoo Tate, chairman of Mitsubishi Motors; Moriya Shiki, president of Mitsubishi Electric, and Shinroku Morohashi, president of the Mitsubishi Corporation. In addition to Mr. Reuter, Daimler was represented by its deputy chairman, Werner Niefer, who is also chairman of Mercedes-Benz.
The Japanese executives negotiating with Daimler run one of the most powerful industrial groups in the world, made up of the remnants of one of Japan's leading zaibatsu, or interlocking business groups. It was broken up by Gen. Douglas McArthur when he headed the postwar occupation.
Today the companies are perhaps more closely linked than at any time since the end of the war, sharing technology, holding one another's stock. The United States has protested that these ties give the Japanese companies an unfair advantage over American concerns trying to enter the market here.
Internally, the Mitsubishi group calls itself the ''Kinyokai,'' which literally means ''Friday meeting,'' an outgrowth of end-of-the-week meetings of top leaders of each of the companies.
 
Corporate Turnaround
Over the last decade, that meeting has been the breeding ground of a sweeping corporate turnaround involving most, though not all, of the Mitsubishi members. Until the early 1980's the group was known for steady but plodding growth and little imagination. Today revenues and profits have soared, and the group has edged out its three main competitors among the conglomerates in Japan - Mitsui, which includes Toshiba); Sumitomo, which includes NEC, and Fuyo, which includes Nissan and Hitachi. Mitsubishi has also been involved in some of Japan's biggest and most controversial projects.
Moreover, Mitsubishi's reach within Japan is unusually long, presumably the main reason Daimler sought it out in the German company's diversification plans. Its members make Nikon cameras, Kirin beer, steel, petrochemicals, rockets and luxury cruise ships, and they include the huge Mitsubishi Bank and the real estate group that bought a controlling interest in Rockefeller Center last fall. It also owns most of the central business district in Tokyo, purchased in 1890 by the company's second president, Yanosuke Iwasaki, when it was still covered with grass and bamboo.
''To the Japanese consumer, we are like the air: invisible but pervasive, providing essential things to sustain life,'' Yohei Mimura, the company's chairman, said some time ago.
 
Needed Technologies
For all of its power, though, Mitsubishi is in great need of several technologies that it may gain from Daimler. Many are in aerospace. Although Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is building the FSX fighter jet with General Dynamics, and is one of three companies working with Boeing on a new aircraft, it has never been able to design its own aircraft engines or develop a successful commercial plane. Daimler owns an engine maker and, through Messerschmitt, owns West Germany's 37.9 percent stake in Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium.
Mitsubishi Motors, meanwhile, is engaged in a big struggle at home to remain a main force in the Japanese auto market, where it is virtually tied for third place with Honda Motors. The company has had a long association with Chrysler, but the American car maker's recent troubles have sent company executives in search of a stronger partner. An alliance with Mercedes would be a coup, especially at a time that Mitsubishi Motors' two largest domestic rivals, Toyota Motors and Nissan Motors, are bringing out luxury cars directly aimed at the market dominated by Mercedes-Benz and BMW.
 
More Pressure on U.S.
American reaction to the announcement of talks between Daimler-Benz and Mitsubishi suggested that an alliance between the foreign giants would intensify the pressures on American companies to become more competitive.
''Certainly American industry is not in a position to criticize two private-sector companies getting closer together,'' said Howard Lewis, vice president for international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers. ''It goes on all the time. This is increasingly the way the global environment works. But to the extent that this cooperation makes a competitive world even more competitive, it is all the more incumbent on America to wake up and put our own economy in a more competitive posture. We better get our act together.''
And John Ettlie, an associate professor of operations management at the University of Michigan,, said: ''It's definitely an important event with important implications. Clearly this puts more pressure on the European agenda. Up to now, I think there has been a relaxed attitude among American companies that the West Germans were reluctant to do joint ventures with the Japanese. This signifies a softening of that position.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans to Shift Responsibility For Many Road Pojects to States

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is drafting highway legislation that would concentrate Federal spending on major national arteries, while imposing on the states costly new responsibilities for building and maintaining local roads.
The Administration intends to pay for the Federal role without raising the Federal motor fuel tax, in keeping with President Bush's promise not to raise taxes, while urging states to raise their own fuel taxes.
Most of the Federal spending would be drawn from a highway trust fund made up of revenue from the Federal taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel. The fund has a surplus that officials estimate can support substantial increases in Federal highway spending for three years. The current level of Federal highway spending is about $14 billion a year. 
 
Routes of Special Significance
The program, say senior Transportation Department officials, would commit the Federal Government to expanded spending on about 160,000 miles of highways that are considered to have special national significance because they connect population and economic centers. The roads would include most of the Interstate System, many other expressways and some smaller highways crucial to their region.
In addition, about 740,000 miles of other roads would remain eligible for Federal aid, but under the Administration's thinking the responsibility for these routes would shift significantly toward state and local governments.
For motorists, the major concern about the highway program is whether it will achieve its goal of providing some relief to the growing congestion that plagues even the largest and most sophisticated roads. On Interstate highways in 1987, congestion bogged down 65 percent of urban rush-hour traffic and 17 percent of rural rush-hour traffic, the Administration's figures show.
 
Plan Long in the Making
The plan's premises will be set forth Thursday when President Bush presents a comprehensive new national transportation policy that has been under development for many months. Later that day, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner will discuss it at a Congressional hearing.
Its full details will not be published for several months, and Congressional debate about the proposals is likely to extend into next year.
No matter how the costs are shared, it seems virtually certain that motorists will be paying new fuel taxes, tolls and other fees, if not to the Federal Government then to states.
Reaction to the plan, which Mr. Skinner has explained at recent meetings with state highway officials, has been mixed.
''The Federal role has been shrinking steadily throughout the decade,'' said David Ernst, an official of the New York State Transportation Commission. ''This would shrink it further. We don't know quite what their definition of nationally significant highways is, but we're concerned they won't include most of our roads.''
But Carl B. Williams, assistant director for fiscal policy of the California Transportation Department, praised the Administration's approach. ''It permits each state to identify its priorities in the context of its own environment,'' he said. California already has a ballot initiative under way to raise its fuel tax by nine cents a gallon.
 
A Shift in Emphasis
Mr. Skinner said in an interview today that ''there is always going to be a major Federal role'' in highway systems. ''But traditionally,'' he added, ''the Federal Government has assumed an 80 percent role, in some cases a 90 percent role. That is not realistic.''
He said that if states ''have to come up with a 50 percent local share, they are going to pay much more attention to how the money is spent.''
Although the costs of the proposed program cannot be calculated until legislation to carry it out is submitted, it would clearly be in the billions of dollars. Some lawmakers say the highway program should exceed $100 billion over the five years beginning in September 1991, when the current five-year program expires.
The Administration's plan probably would probably increase the Federal budget deficit in its first few years as the trust fund shrinks and the Administration and Congress debate whether there should be an increase in the Federal fuel tax.
Mr. Skinner said the Administration was eager to speed up the rate of withdrawals from the fund to pay for the Federal road work. ''If we possibly can, we want to do it,'' he said.
The current surplus in the trust fund exceeds $10 billion and is growing each year. While highway spending is about $14 billion a year, fuel tax receipts total more than $16 billion a year.
Although some lawmakers favor increasing Federal fuel taxes, Mr. Skinner said the Administration remains opposed. As he has in the past, Mr. Skinner noted approvingly that many states have already raised their fuel taxes. He added that the opportunity to increase them further might be lost if the Federal Government ''pre-empted'' this source of revenue.
 
Most Extensive Program
The national highway program, which must be renewed by Congress every five years, is the nation's most extensive public works program and interest in the impending revision has been high among state and local governments, members of Congress and industry groups.
The Interstate System, 43,000 miles of highways begun by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, is 98 percent complete, but it is afflicted with congestion and decay, and policy makers have been pondering solutions for some time.
The highway program enacted in 1987 provoked a bitter fight after Ronald Reagan's veto was overridden by Congress. President Reagan said the bill was too costly and contained too many projects of strictly local benefit.
Gene McCormick, deputy administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, which is part of the Transportation Department, said in an interview that the agency was writing legislation to focus Federal money on modernizing and expanding the 160,000 miles of major roads, including most Interstates, that are essential to commerce and to regional transportation.
The additional 740,000 miles of roads that would remain eligible for Federal aid under the Administration's proposal states would require states to pay a larger share of the costs. States would be urged to increase their fuel taxes and would allowed to impose more tolls with a removal of the ban on tolls on most roads built with Federal assistance.
 
Changes in Fees Studied
The Administration is considering, but has not yet decided upon, changes in Federal methods of charging highway users for the enormous costs of roads. One possibility would be to charge commercial trucks fees based on their weight and the distance they travel, reflecting more accurately than a flat fuel tax the disproportionate damage the big vehicles do to roads and bridges.
Administration officials say the highway proposals are intended to complement other transportation projects, like urban mass transit systems, airports and passenger railroads. The entire transportation strategy is meant to address even broader social issues, like safety, environmental protection, urban renewal and rural growth, international trade and economic competitiveness, officials say.
Accounting for more than half of Federal spending on transportation, the highway proposals typify other parts of the broader transportation policy, calling for an increasing reliance on the states and local governments, additional user fees to pay for new investments and incentives for the private sector to bear a greater share of the investment burden.
''The highway system obviously is our most extensive transportation system and the one most people rely on most of the time,'' Mr. Skinner said. ''Anything we do on highways is going to be the most important part of our transportation policy.''
Representative Norman Y. Mineta, a California Democrat, said many members of his party believe highway spending will have to rise from the current $14 billion to as much as $23 billion a year to meet pressing needs. Mr. Mineta last year changed his role on the House Public Works and Transportation Committee so that he could head its surface transportation subcommittee when the new bill is drafted.

HEADLINE: Selma 1990: Old Faces and a New Spirit

BYLINE: By GAY TALESE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SELMA, Ala., March 6

 BODY:
The writer of the following article, a reporter for The New York Times from 1955 to 1965, was among those covering the civil rights march in Selma, Ala., in 1965.
Twenty-five years ago, after borrowing a tail-finned Cadillac hearse from the mortuary owned by his family in this onetime plantation town in south central Alabama, a young man named Randall Miller joined hundreds of other blacks as a volunteer ambulance driver in a civil rights march that was soon scheduled to head east to the state capital, Montgomery.
The distance to the Governor's office, where the marchers would protest the lack of voting rights for blacks in the Deep South, was a little more than 50 miles. But it would take 19 days to complete the journey, for it was marred by tear gas, billy clubs and the bullets of white racists.
 
Beyond Brutality
The moss-draped rural town of Selma, with its white-columned mansions and its many monuments to Confederate heroes, would continue for years to symbolize white racism in America. But now - a quarter century after the highway clash that was commemorated this past weekend by returning veterans of the march - Selma reflects much advancement in the quest for racial harmony. 
Not only interracial harmony, but also, on occasion, interracial love. Last weekend, the former ambulance driver, Randall Miller, now 51 years old, was married here to a 38-year-old white woman, Betty Ramsey.
They were married in the presence of 20 white and black friends in Mr. Miller's house, in an integrated neighborhood within hearing of the cheers from the thousands who attended the commemorative ceremonies. It is also within hearing of the screams of demonstrators re-enacting the terror of 1965, although on this occasion they were fleeing machine-blown smoke rather than the gas canisters that had stunned the original marchers while awakening the national conscience.
A Voting Rights Act was passed by Congress in the late summer of 1965, prompted in part by the brutal harassment of the demonstrators -especially during the first day's outing, on March 7, 1965. That afternoon, as millions watched on national television, a charging wedge of Alabama state troopers and a sheriff's posse gassed and battered marchers whom Randall Miller and others would rush to the few hospitals that accepted blacks; more than 80 were hurt.
The new law encouraged more black citizens to vote than ever before and in time led to the election of many more black candidates than ever before, not only in the South but throughout the nation.
Many of the 1965 activists who made speeches this weekend from a sound truck across the bridge are now paunchy and balding. As often as not, they went unrecognized by the young onlookers, whose sense of history is limited to their own short lifetime. This occasion was, in a sense, Old Timers' Day for those in the Selma vanguard.
But while parading through the center of town and crossing the steel bridge that arches over the muddy Alabama River, they were spry of step and smiling as they waved to the crowds and the television trucks that preceded them. On the bandstand along the highway, where some of them made speeches, they recalled the pain of Selma with words of lasting pride and satisfaction.
One of the speakers was John Lewis - at 25 a battered figure on the highway, at 50 a member of Congress representing Georgia's Fifth District. Microphone in hand, he told the crowd, ''I shed a little blood here, but I was blessed to make a small contribution.''
Near him stood the gray-bearded Hosea Williams, one of the lead marchers in '65; the Rev. L. L. Anderson, the slightly frail but erect 70-year-old preacher from Selma who was once a frequent guest in Southern jails; and his colleague in offenses against the sensibilities of Southern sheriffs, the 70-year-old F. D. Reese, who on the bandstand, resplendent in a kelly-green suit with lapel adornments, suggested a dignitary reviewing a St. Patrick's Day parade.
 
Confederate Statues, And One of King
Appearing in a well-fitting dark suit with a white shirt and subdued maroon silk tie, and looking very Presidential, was Jesse Jackson, the only speaker who truly required no introduction. He stood not far behind the seated Coretta Scott King, who said nothing to the crowd but by her presence lent exaltation to the sun-sharpened surroundings.
In this town there are now street signs and a monument in the name of her late husband, the leader of the Selma-to-Montgomery march, but more prominent still are the statues and larger monuments honoring those white Southerners who, during the Civil War, had no higher aspirations for black people than slavery. Higher than all the community landmarks is the bridge itself - bearing in bold lettering the name of Edmund Pettus, a Confederate general and later a United States Senator who went to his grave in 1907 believing in the supremacy of whites. He is buried in Selma. Most though not all of Selma's white citizens - 48 percent of the town's 25,340 people - stayed away from the weekend's commemorative activities. But one who was in evidence was Selma's loquacious white Mayor, the 60-year-old, bifocaled, chain-smoking Joseph T. Smitherman, to whom photo opportunities are a narcotic he can no more resist than cigarettes.
A onetime appliance salesman, and before that a brakeman for the Southern Railway, Mr. Smitherman has been Selma's Mayor, with a brief interruption, since its first days of televised notoriety. Since then he has been interviewed thousands of times and has an anchorman's ease in front of a camera. In 1965, when he was 35, he weighed 145 pounds; now, at 60, he is 56 pounds heavier, but he says he has never been happier.
 
A New Look In City Hall
As he stood on the sidewalk with other members of Selma's first family, waving toward the passing procession of blacks whether they greeted him or booed him, he said in several interviews that egalitarianism had never risen to such heights as exists these days in Selma. Although the Selma Country Club and the old-line Elks Club still refuse to admit blacks, he said, the rest of the city bears little resemblance to the Selma of 1965.
The Mayor, who still keeps a Confederate flag in his office, points out that 35 percent of the police force is black, as against zero in 1965. Blacks make up 25 percent of the firefighters and more than 90 percent of the sanitation workers. He cites similar statistics among other municipal employees, City Council members and teachers, and he minimizes the current dispute over the decision by the white-majority school board not to renew the contract of the city's first black Superintendent.
The Mayor considers the new wave of black activists impossible to please, insufficiently appreciative of the gains won by the previous generation. ''But,'' he conceded, in the philosophical tone he exuded in network interviews last week, ''the blacks are now doing the same thing we did 25 years ago. We hollered for 'segregation,' and played on the white people's fear of integration - and this got us elected. Now, 25 years later, the black elected officials, and black leaders not elected, are hollering 'white racism,' and 'de facto segregation' and 'economic oppression' to get elected, and they're doing a good job.''
One of the most powerful black figures in city government, the occupant of an office in City Hall that the Mayor complains has more space than his own, is the onetime volunteer ambulance driver and the town's most recent bridegroom - Randall Miller. After taking over the family funeral business in partnership with his aging father, he was appointed in 1972 to head the city's urban renewal program. In 1985 Randall Miller became the city's Director of Personnel, overseeing hiring and placement of the 300 employees in the police, fire, sanitation, public works, recreation and cemetery departments.
 
Integrated Schools, Integrated Couples
Mr. Miller did not take part in the voting rights celebration this week, being preoccupied with his wedding. Both he and his wife agree that her race signifies nothing except that interracial couples can carry on a courtship and have it culminate in a peaceful and pleasant wedding. (Both were married before, within their own race, and divorced.) Concurring in this opinion were other guests at the wedding: the bride's two daughters, age 18 and 15, who flew in from Arkansas (where they attended all-white schools, and where their father teaches in an integrated high school); and the groom's three sisters and brother, all natives of Selma who have taught in its once all-black school system.
The public schools in Selma are now integrated, although, as in cities throughout the nation, there are private schools here for those usually more affluent white parents who prefer a color balance in their favor.
Much as Randall Miller might wish to attribute little social significance to this weekend's wedding, the fact remains that only one other married interracial couple is known to be living in Selma. They are John Farris, 42 and white, and his wife, Roslyn, 36 and black, who teach at the Westside Middle School. Married in 1983 and both natives of Alabama though not of Selma, they have lived here since their wedding. They teach in a school that has an almost equal racial balance and whose acceptance of their interracial marriage is rather typical of the town.
''If you're open and honest about your relationship,'' Roslyn Farris said, ''and don't hide it and sneak around, they'll respect it - even in Selma.''
Another interracial married couple first met in Selma during the confrontations of 1965, and remain married today. They are Dr. and Mrs. John L. S. Holloman of New York City. Long affiliated with the William F. Ryan Community Health Center on West 97th Street, Dr. Holloman, who is black and will soon be 70, flew into Alabama in 1965 after the highway incident and lent medical support to the marchers continuing on to Montgomery.
Dr. Holloman was then part of the Medical Committee for Human Rights, the national organization formed in 1964 to give aid and a ''sense of medical presence'' to the civil rights demonstrators throughout the South and elsewhere. When Dr. Holloman arrived in Selma in 1965, some of his out-of-state colleagues were already busy treating the hospitalized marchers.
One of them was Dr. Alfred Moldovan, also of New York, the first doctor across the bridge after the cavalry of militia had begun to beat the marchers to the ground. With Dr. Moldovan and several other physicians and nurses, Dr. Holloman later accompanied the regrouped marchers on to Montgomery. A member of their medical team was a Brooklyn-born nurse from Kings County Hospital, Patricia Ann Tatje, whose bus-driver father she later identified with Archie Bunker.
 
Fellowship Recaptured
Midway along the road to Montgomery, Patricia Ann Tatje administered medical aid to the feet of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who had been wearing new shoes and was so blistered that he could not conceal his limping. Pausing briefly while she daubed his bare feet with Benzoin, Dr. King then again put on his shoes and socks, thanked her and, concealing the limp, continued on his way.
The nurse and Dr. Holloman, who fell in love after their return to New York, had by then divorced previous mates and were ready to marry - a union that would produce two daughters. They have also kept ties to their earlier families. And when Mrs. Holloman's daughter by her first marriage was married on Feb. 6, 1988, she walked up the aisle with her white natural father, Dr. Thomas Leo, and her black stepfather, Dr. Holloman.
Last week in New York, Dr. Holloman reflected on that happy day and reminisced about the bond that existed 25 years ago between the blacks and the out-of-state whites in Alabama after the highway confrontation. The wedding two years ago restored for him some of the blissful feelings he felt back in 1965, after the tear gas had faded.
As he walked up the aisle of the chapel, he was back on the path with whites toward a common cause. It was as it had been on the road between Selma and Montgomery, when everybody advanced together and held hands and rocked from side to side and joined in singing, ''We Shall Overcome.''

HEADLINE: Iranian Report on Hostages Seen as a Signal to the West

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, March 6

 BODY:
West German and French officials said today that an Iranian newspaper editorial calling for freeing the Western hostages in Lebanon represented an Iranian admission that the West will widen economic and diplomatic ties with Iran only after the hostages are free.
The officials, who closely follow relations with Iran, said the editorial in The Teheran Times today was an early signal that Teheran's leaders acknowledge the significance of settling the hostage issue in a satisfactory manner, after five years of insisting that the hostages are bargaining chips.
The officials did not have any independent confirmation that a flurry of current moves on the hostages would lead to their early release. But a West German foreign affairs official said there were clear ''indicators'' of Iran's appreciation that ''there is no no further advantage in holding the hostages.'' 
''We all have hostages and our signals have always been clear that if Iran wants better ties with the West to reconstruct the country they have to go through the hostage doors and demonstrate respect for international law,'' said the official, who asked not to be identified. #1990 'the Last Year'
As the European officials discussed the editorial, Irfan Parviz, editor of The Teheran Times, insisted in a telephone conversation from Teheran today that the newspaper's editorial expressed only the view of the publication, but added that many people in the Government ''may also share this view.'' The paper, which is known to have close ties to Iranian Foreign Ministry circles, said in its editorial that ''1990 can and will be the last year of the captivity'' for Western hostages.
West German and French officials said one incentive for Iran to move on the hostage issue may be the severely deteriorating economic situation in the country and Iran's failure so far to break the unofficial economic freeze imposed on it by Western countries.
Over the last 18 months Iran has been able to secure limited credits for industrial projects from West Germany, France, Italy and Japan, but they fall far short of the enormous financial and technical assistance Iran needs to rebuild its shattered economy, particularly its vital oil industry.
While there have been reports from the Iranian opposition of widespread demonstrations against the Government, the Western officials dismissed them as exaggerated.
 
Questions of Dissatisfaction
They said there was a pro-monarchist demonstration in Teheran on Feb. 16, and that incendiary bombs were thrown twice at a fundamentalist school. But the officials reported that their embassies in Teheran did not agree that dissatisfaction with the Government has reached the point of threatening the clergy's rule over Iran.
One Iranian official based in Western Europe said the flurry of activities surrounding the hostage issue may not lead to the release of any of the 16 Westerners, including 8 Americans, held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian militias. The official said his ''guess'' was that non-American hostages were likely to be released first.

HEADLINE: Gephardt Proposes Aid to Soviets

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, said today that the United States should offer direct aid to the Soviet Union to insure that its reforms succeed.
''We should be investing in our own self-interest,'' Mr. Gephardt said. ''And stability, democracy and a market economy in the Soviet Union are in America's strong self-interest.''
The proposal brought immediate criticism from some quarters.
The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said, ''The Soviet Union doesn't want direct aid.''
Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, also said that Soviet officials had not requested help from the United States and that if they did, the aid would be wasted without economic reform. ''Unless they reform the economy, it's going down a rathole,'' Mr. Bradley said.
Others on Capitol Hill said that although they thought that Mr. Gephardt's proposal would spark a useful debate, the idea would fall on disapproving public ears.
''If you're going to start giving foreign aid to the hated commies of 70 years' worth, you've got a real sales job to do in the United States,'' said Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming.
The Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, said he agreed with Mr. Gephardt.
''It's a dramatically different circumstance from a few months ago,'' Mr. Foley said, noting that local elections that had taken place in the Soviet Union and the existence of political opposition to the Communists.
''Those changes are coming on very fast,'' Mr. Foley said, ''and we have a stake in this country in supporting those changes.''

HEADLINE: Postal Service Proposes Rate Increases

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
The United States Postal Service today proposed an increase in all classes of mail that would raise the price of a first-class stamp to 30 cents and increase costs to businesses for second- and third-class mailings by billions of dollars a year.
The Postal Service, which faces a $1.6 billion loss this years, expects to raise $7 billion a year in additional revenue from the rate increases.
The proposed five-cent increase in first-class mail is the biggest since universal rates were introduced 127 years ago. That proposal, along with the other proposed increases, now goes to the Postal Rate Commission, which has 10 months to make a recommendation to the Postal Service Board of Governors, which makes the final decision. 
A few rates would decline under the proposal. For example, volume advertising sorted by letter-carrier route and weighing no more than three ounces would drop to 9.6 cents from 10.1 cents.
Business and consumer groups are already mounting strong opposition campaigns.
 
'Customers Aren't Happy'
Businesses that advertise and sell by mail, including catalogue marketers, banks, credit card companies, insurers automotive manufacturers and magazines, would face significant increases in costs, ''Our customers aren't happy,'' said Anthony M. Frank, the Postmaster General as he outlined the proposals at a news conference here. ''For them it's a case of too much too soon.''
''To be honest, we agree,'' he added, noting that the proposed increases substantially outpace the rate of inflation in the general economy.
If the proposed rate increases are approved, they would take effect next February. If they do, it would mean mailing costs will have gone up an average of 19 percent since April 3, 1988, when the last increase took effect. Over the same period, inflation is expected to increase by 13 percent, according to the Postal Service calculations.
Mr. Frank said the increases are needed to meet rising wage and benefit costs, including new responsibilities for paying some of the costs of retiree health benefit and pension plans that have been transferred from the Federal Government. The Postal Service employs about 757,000 full- and part-time workers, making it the nation's largest private employer. Labor costs account for 83 percent of its $35 billion a year budget.
 
Businesses See Mismanagement
But business groups, which did not dispute the Postal Service's financial difficulties, blamed the problem on mismanagement and a failure by Postal Service officials to achieve the improvements in productivity that were supposed to result from the introduction of new technology and more automated mail processing systems.
''As mail users we recognize the inevitability of periodic rate increases, but there has been a waste, an enormous waste of postal resources over the past two years,'' said Gene Del Politio, executive director of the Third Class Mail Association, which represents businesses advertising by mail.
Mr. Del Politio said that while his group plans to seek relief from some of the increases in third-class mail rates, the rate fight is in many ways a side show to the more important issue of expiring labor contracts with the four major unions that represent the vast majority of Postal Service workers. Negotiations to renew the contracts are scheduled to begin in August.
Mr. Frank said the Postal Service was committed to keeping its costs at 2 percent below the inflation rate over the next five years in an effort to ''pay back'' the amount by which the new increases would exceed inflation.
 
Postal Rate Called Bargain
Vincent R. Sombrotto, president of the 315,000-member National Association of Letter Carriers, said that even at 30 cents, the cost of mailing a first-class letter would still be a bargain for Americans compared to costs for first-class mail in other industrialized countries. Using figures that were also cited by the Postal Service, he noted, that first-class postage is 59.9 in West Germany cents and 42.8 cents in Japan.
Robert Setrakian, chairman of the board of governors of the Postal Service, acknowledged that the rate increases would have a significant impact on businesses, but said they would not overburden the average household. He esitmated that they would raise the average person's postal bill by about $10 to $11 a year.
Business representatives disputed that assessment, warning that quite apart from the increases proposed for second- and third-class mail, increases in first-class mailing costs for businesses would ultimately affect customers as well. The American Banker's Association estimated, for example, that each one-cent increase in the nation's first-class postal rate would cost banks and their customers an additional $50 million annually.
''The proposed increase will encourage large mail users such as the banking industry to reduce the number of pieces they mail, which could result in a loss of revenue for the Postal Service despite the higher rates,'' said Vincent A. Liguori, chairman of the A.B.A.'s Postal Service committee and a vice president of First Chicago Trust Company of New York.
Mr. Liguori said banks may find that private couriers, electronic fund transfers, facsimile machines and other high technology delivery systems may become an increasingly less expensive alternative to first-class mail if rates continue to rise at rates that greatly exceed inflation.
Business groups are hoping to make their case to the rate commission for further reductions in costs for mail that requires minimal handling by Postal Service employees. In challenging previous rate increases, business users have had some success in convincing the rate commission to make changes in some of the sub-category rate hikes sought by the Postal Service.
Ralph Nader, the consumer activist, said that none of the bargaining that will go on over the next 10 months will represent the interests of consumers. ''The iron triangle of postal managment, postal unions and commercial lobbies are controlling the process to the exclusion of 120 million first-class users,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bennington Journal;
Is the Statehood Honeymoon Over?

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BENNINGTON, Vt., March 4

 BODY:
In 1791, Vermont patriots gathered here, voting to join the union as the 14th state. Almost two centuries later, in a pristine clapboard church a few yards from the site where that historic decision was made, an assembly of Vermonters voted by a 2-to-1 margin to secede from the United States.
The nonbinding vote today came at the end of a debate on secession sponsored by the Vermont Statehood Bicentennial Commission. It was the first of six debates being held this month as part of the state's anniversary celebration. 
''We thought there was no better way to get people to focus on statehood than to discuss secession,'' said the commission's director, Carolyn Crowley Meub.
But while Ms. Meub describes the debate as ''half whimsical,'' at least one debater, Frank Bryan, a professor of political science at the University of Vermont in Burlington, appeared to be in earnest.
''Vermont is America's conscience,'' Dr. Bryan told the audience of nearly 200 people who gathered at the First Congregational Church 199 years to the day after Vermont was admitted to the union. Many applauded as he denounced the impersonal ''mega- , macro-bureaucracy'' that he said the Federal Government had become. He said that secession would be a ''sharp slap on the cheek'' to the rest of the country, and that ''a century hence, America will say 'thanks, I needed that.' ''
His remarks were variations on a theme he embraced three years ago with the publication of ''Out! The Vermont Secession Book,'' a humorous tract. ''Pogo was wrong,'' Dr. Bryan and his co-author, Bill Mares, wrote. ''We have met the enemy and he is not us. The enemy is you guys, and we're leaving.''
''America has given up on democracy,'' the authors continued. ''We haven't. We tried to tell you a thousand times. But you wouldn't listen. Well maybe you'll pay attention to this: Get lost!''
The task of supporting the union in the debate fell to John Dooley, an Associate Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. Secession, he said, would be the ''easy way out,'' the kind of solution the American journalist H. L. Mencken would have called ''neat, simple - and wrong.''
Judge Dooley argued that the United States would erect trade barriers against a nation of Vermont. He said the state's personal, low-key government would become just as bureacratic as the Federal Government to cope with complexities like taxation, economic policies, human service needs and environmental pollution. Vermont needs the union, he said, adding, ''A cute little government will not stop acid rain.''
Dr. Bryan countered that ''all those Americans who like eating Ben & Jerry's'' ice cream, made in Vermont, would not stand for trade sanctions.
The idea of secession is not new to Vermont. The State Archivist, Gregory Sanford, says the most frequently asked question concerning the state's constitution is from angry Vermonters who are convinced that there is an ''escape clause'' providing for secession, and who demand to see it. There is none.
''I think in the end that people seeking secession are seeking escape, rather than solutions, to the problems in our society,'' Mr. Sanford said.
But the idea appears to be gaining some popular support. On a recent call-in program on Vermont Public Radio, the vote was 20 to 1 in favor of secession.
''There is a sense out there that the Federal Government is out of control and that we can handle things better here,'' said Rod Clarke, the producer and host of the program.
''Vermont is small, and we don't have much of an impact in Washington, but we have great ideas,'' said Mary Ann Pembroke of Bennington, who, with her husband, Richard, a State Representative, voted for secession after the debate today. ''This might make Washington take notice of how we really feel.'' The majority of the 164 audience members who voted on the issue agreed, casting 99 votes for secession.
Lieut. Gov. Howard Dean, who moderated the debate, called the event ''good history, good politics and good theater.''
But Dr. Bryan has dreams of something more:
''You know what I hope? I hope that the Bicentennial Commission has opened a Pandora's Box. I hope that a few months from now, they'll have occasion to say: 'Wow! We had no idea what we were doing!' ''

HEADLINE: 250 Million Now in U.S.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
The nation's population reached 250 million today, according to the Census Bureau, but no one in Washington seemed to know how - or if - they should react to the milestone.
On November 20, 1967, when the Census Bureau clock struck 200 million, President Lyndon B. Johnson made a speech celebrating the nation's size. 
But since then the country has gone through mood swings on the population question, as one vision of demographic apocalypse replaced another. In 1968, Paul R. Ehrlich's book ''The Population Bomb'' gave widespread currency to the notion that big was bad. Then in 1987, Ben J. Wattenberg weighed in with ''The Birth Dearth,'' warning of the dangers of economic and political decline inherent in a grow-slow philosophy.
Whatever the reason, official Washington remained unexcited by the latest landmark, which is based on the assumption that the country is growing by 6,300 people a day. It is likely to be another 29 years before the milestone of 300 million is reached, according to current projections. Next month's census is expected to provide a more accurate picture of the nation's exact size.
''It looks like we're going to have a commemoration on Thursday,'' said James Gorman, a spokesman for the Census Bureau, who said he expected Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher to speak. Why March 8, when the press release said the magic day was March 6? ''We couldn't get it together,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Studies Cause Confusion on Impact of Teen-Age Pregnancy

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
New research on teen-age mothers has produced seemingly contradictory results and created confusion and concern among those working to prevent teen-age pregnancy.
In late January, researchers at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health announced that unmarried black teen-agers who chose abortions fared better economically and educationally than those who bore a child.
Three weeks later, researchers announced the results of two other studies involving teen-age pregnancy. One, from Johns Hopkins and Columbia University, found that teen-age mothers were no more likely to drop out of school than their childless classmates. 
The other, from the University of Michigan School of Public Health, suggested that teen-age child-bearing did not decrease the mother's long-term economic status, perhaps because childbearing helped teen-age mothers form alliances with the father's family and receive help from their own mothers. That study also found that in very poor communities, infant mortality rates for teen-age mothers were lower than for mothers in their 20's.
 
Geronimus Study Criticized
This study, by Dr. Arline Geronimus, immediately generated criticism. ''Her facts are misrepresentative, her premise is wrong, and the policy implications of her arguments are perverse,'' said Karen Pittman of the Children's Defense Fund, which works to prevent teen-age pregnancy.
But the apparently contradictory findings of these studies can be read to shed new light on why girls become teen-age mothers.
''One way to look at the studies is to see what they say about which teens choose abortion and which choose to bear the child,'' said Dr. Jacqueline Forrest, an expert on teen-age pregnancy at the Alan Guttmacher Institute. ''They are two very different groups. The teens who choose to give birth tend to be those with low grades, few options and few aspirations toward the future. So those who abort do better educationally and economically, and those who have babies do better at becoming tied into a dependent status in their families.''
 
Abortion and Independence
Looked at that way, Dr. Forrest said, the studies are almost mirror images. The study released in January, by Dr. Lauri Schwab Zabin, shows that teen-agers who choose abortion are more likely than those who did not to be successful at building an independent life, Dr. Forrest said.
In contrast, she said, the Geronimus study suggests that teen-agers who have babies are likelier to live with their parents and to get help from an extended group of people that may include the father's family.
''I think it's selling those girls short to consider that a success, though,'' Dr. Forrest said. ''Most teens don't want a future of living with their mothers.''
Dr. Geronimus emphasized that she did not advocate teen-age parenthood but said it might be a rational choice for a small group of poor teen-agers.
''The teens who choose to have babies are the poorest of the poor, and within that group, they're the ones who performed worst in school and were not likely to go on in school anyway,'' Dr. Geronimus said. ''Teen-age childbearing is not the cause of their problems. The same things that explain the decision not to abort explain the outcomes for the mothers.''
 
Deteriorating Health
For socioeconomic reasons, the health of women who are poorest deteriorates rapidly, Dr. Geronimus said, so the women likely to become teen-age mothers are healthier in their adolescence than they will probably be in their 20's, and their infants are likely to be healthier if the mothers do their childbearing early.
Ms. Pittman attacks that finding, saying that it is based on neonatal mortality rates only for the infant's first month of life. ''You have to look at what happens over time, and what you find is that teen mothers do not care for babies very well, and the mortality rates are higher than for older mothers,'' she said.
Neither the Geronimus study nor the Hopkins-Columbia study included data comparing girls who chose abortion to those who had babies. And like the Zabin study, the Hopkins-Columbia study does find educational disadvantages among teen-age mothers.
 
Return to School Unlikely
''Early childbearing did have an effect on high school graduation rates, but not in the way people had thought,'' said Dr. James McCarthy, an author of the Hopkins-Columbia study.
The study showed that teen-age mothers were no more likely to drop out than their childless classmates. But among dropouts, those who were mothers were less likely than others to return and to complete high school.
What Dr. McCarthy concludes from that is perhaps the only common ground among the researchers into teen-age pregnancy.
''My conclusion is that the baby doesn't cause the problem, but the baby is an outgrowth of the girl's problem,'' Dr. McCarthy said. ''But even if it's the basic background factors, and not having the baby, that are responsible for the poor educational outcomes, the implications are pretty much the same. To change things, you have to improve the life options of young girls, keep them in school and give them more control over their lives, including their reproductive lives.''

HEADLINE: N.A.A.C.P. in Hiring Pact With South Carolina Mall

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., March 6

 BODY:
In an agreement with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a shopping mall has pledged to hire more blacks and stop detaining black teen-agers under a 1960's trespassing law.
The civil rights group's national chairman, William F. Gibson of Greenville, S.C., announced the agreement with the Columbia Mall on Monday, saying it was the first pact reached with a shopping mall on the hiring and treatment of blacks. He encouraged other N.A.A.C.P. chapters ''to negotiate similar agreements.'' 
The agreement, negotiated over the last month by officials of the N.A.A.C.P. and the mall, calls for the mall management to hire and promote more blacks and encourage the 128 stores in the mall to do the same, and for using more black contractors and suppliers.
Mr. Gibson said the civil rights group had planned to call a boycott of the mall if an agreement had not been reached.
 
'Spirit of Cooperation'
Civil rights groups asserted last summer that about 50 black teen-agers had been detained by mall security officers under the trespassing law, which permits the detention of anyone ''disorderly and boisterous.'' The youths were photographed, their names were placed in security files and many were told not to return to the mall for six months. In most cases, no criminal charges were filed.
George Forbes, a lawyer for the mall owner, Jacobs, Visconi & Jacobs of Cleveland, said the agreement was reached in a ''spirit of cooperation'' but was not legally binding.
''The Columbia Mall does not, it has not and it will not discriminate as regards to race, creed or color,'' said Mr. Forbes, who is a member of the N.A.A.C.P.
In December, two black teen-agers were wounded by gunfire by other shoppers at the mall. Two other shooting incidents occurred at the mall earlier last year.
In an interview after the December shooting, Sheriff Allen Sloan of Richland County was quoted in The State, a Columbia newspaper, as saying the best way to reduce violence at the mall was to ''keep the niggers out.'' Sheriff Sloan denied making the statement.
 
Pact Called 'Long, Long Overdue'
State Senator Kay Patterson, who led other black officials in calling for the sheriff's resignation, said the pact with the mall was ''long, long overdue.''
''I think when you hire people and give them economic opportunity, it has a tendency to cut down on some of the racial strife,'' Mr. Patterson said.
In the agreement, the mall owners also offered to sponsor a job fair, create an employment center, advertise in black news media, provide sensitivity training for employees in dealing with minority members and work with the N.A.A.C.P. to monitor the mall's relationship with blacks.
Mr. Forbes said the mall owner was committed to hiring minorities. One of the mall's four administrators is black, he said, and blacks are 35 percent of its security force. ''We think that is not only good sense, but it makes good business,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bank Law Reform for Panama and for Us

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a former financial executive covering Panama, diplomat and senior trade officer, let me compliment you for ''Panama Is Resisting U.S. Pressure to Alter 'Inadequate' Bank Laws'' (front page, Feb. 6).
It may be expected in a country Panama's size, for centuries an international trade hub, that everyone from the president down is linked to whatever is going on, the good, the bad and the ugly. The Panamanian banking system's growth was triggered not purely by drug lords and our favorite usual suspect, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, but by the capital-destructive policies of many Latin American nations. While the populations of those countries have taken tremendous economic blows in recent years, it isn't surprising that their elites have banked in Panama. And in Miami (as your article implies), New York and elsewhere.
Instead of bringing pressure on Panama, a fragile economy, even in better times, wouldn't it be better (a) to be much harsher on the United States drug trade in penalties and exemption from the witness-protection program (they're running around free as birds in southern Florida) and (b) to consider liberalization of United States banking restrictions and reporting requirements, so that we, the other 99.9 percent, aren't put through the hoops?
If Federal and state investigators weren't so lax, such measures wouldn't be necessary. With the crisis in United States banking, particularly the savings and loan associations mess, it's amusing to watch Washington attempt to graft its solutions onto Panama.

HEADLINE: For Eastern Europe, a $25 Billion Aid Package

SERIES: Designs for Europe; An Occasional Series

BYLINE: By Zbigniew Brzezinski; Zbigniew Brzezinski was President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser. (A longer version of this article will appear in the spring issue of The National Interest.)

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The external Soviet empire lasted 45 years. It is shattered, beyond redemption or repair.
The Soviet Union, suffering from a bad case of imperial fatigue, itself is struggling for survival. The internal crisis - simultaneously ethnic, economic and political - will be of long duration. 
In the meantime, a new geopolitical reality in the very heart of Europe is emerging. Today, Eastern Europe is again Central Europe - which it has always been historically, culturally and philosophically. This post-Communist region is threatened by chaos and instability even as it yearns for a Western European style of life and for Western-type institutional arrangements.
Central Europe's economies are in a shambles. Its political systems have to be rebuilt from scratch. The threat of national and territorial conflicts overhangs the internal difficulties that every Government will have to overcome on the way to the stable democracy all profess to seek.
A policy that responds creatively to all these overlapping dilemmas will have to be comprehensive geographically and ambitious politically.
It must be capable of harnessing Western popular support and of captivating the political imagination not only of the Central Europeans but also of the many Soviet nations. It must build on the success of Western policy, not diluting but enhancing the processes of Western European integration while also seizing the moment in Central Europe to capitalize on that integration's ripple effects.
That policy should be founded upon the grand concept of a trans-European commonwealth with the European Community at its core but embracing Central Europe and being open also to eventual association with the Soviet Union.
Such a strategic vision should include the following seven specific but interconnected and historically ambitious policy components:
Acceleration of Western European integration; enhancement of trans-Atlantic ties; consolidation of democratic reform in Central Europe; negotiation of a German confederation within an all-European security framework; facilitation of cross-cutting multilateral cooperation; promotion of Central European regional cooperation, and encouragement of a new Soviet confederation.
These components have to be viewed as a package, with the pursuit of one facilitating and necessary to the attainment of the others. The end result of the effort should be the emergence of a more stable, cooperative and democratic all-European order as well as the termination of the American-Soviet rivalry over the fate of Europe.
Accordingly, it will be critically important to the success of the entire agenda for Western Europe's political integration to be accelerated further. Indeed, that integration must serve as the cornerstone of any eventually wider European commonwealth and as an attractive, and badly needed, example of successful multilateral cooperation for the Central Europeans and Russians. Without such integration, any attempts to promote the regional recovery of Central Europe will lack the necessary source of stability and support.
American support for European integration is consistent with the fostering of even more intimate trans-Atlantic ties. Firm linkage with the U.S. would make it easier and safer for the Europeans to try to foster a more genuinely cooperative relationship, beyond Central Europe, with the Soviet Union. A continued - even if significantly diminished - American military presence in Europe is, therefore, in the self-interest of Europe and America.
The promotion of stable democracy in the post-Communist countries will require a major and immediate commitment of Western resources, far beyond existing commitments. In the first half of 1989, it appeared that only Poland - the spearhead and historic catalyst for the collapse of the Soviet bloc - and Hungary would require Western assistance. It is now obvious that all Central European countries will have to be aided in the extraordinarily difficult transformation of their economic and political systems.
The level of Western capital needed to prevent the region's slide into political and economic chaos might well range from $25 billion to $30 billion. Since this figure may appear at first glance appallingly large, it should be viewed in historical perspective.
Between 1946 and 1955, the U.S., then with a gross national product about one-third of today's, contributed a total (in 1989 dollars) of $171 billion to Western Europe's recovery. That came to an annual contribution of $17 billion. The result was a historical triumph.
The economic response to the challenge of Central Europe certainly should not be America's burden alone. Western European countries likewise have a stake in Central Europe's stability. Japan, with a G.N.P. more than half that of America's, also should play a role.
The peaceful transformation of Central Europe will require a stable security context, one that is reassuring to the West and East alike. Accordingly, the West, in embracing the cause of German unification, should move forward with a comprehensive plan for a German confederation and for special security arrangements to accompany it. Indeed, German acceptance of the existing frontiers is the sine qua non of international acceptance of unification.
Moreover, for an agreed transitional period, NATO and the Warsaw Pact should retain some military contingents in the two parts of united Germany, thereby guaranteeing a secure transition to the new European order.
Members of the two political-and-military alliances should also be free to choose their economic associations through memberships in multilateral organizations. Thus, the Central European states, as they move toward market economies, should be permitted and encouraged to seek some form of association with either the European Free Trade Association or eventually the European Community - even while they remain Warsaw Pact members.
The West should also encourage the Central Europeans to develop new forms of regional cooperation among themselves. Western economic and ecological assistance could even be made conditional to some degree on the recipients' willingness to engage in multilateral cooperation.
Finally, the Soviets must be constructively encouraged to see their future in trans-European cooperation. The option of participation in the expanding European adventure should be explicitly held open to a new and genuinely pluralistic Soviet confederation in the event that Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika does lead to fundamental reformation of the Soviet Union.
A necessary concomitant to any process of creating a genuinely voluntary Soviet confederation will be the right of secession. Some parts of today's Soviet Union may choose to exercise that right. But such secession could become more tolerable to the Soviet Union if it led to new forms of association between the seceding states and the remainder of the current Soviet Union with an emerging trans-European commonwealth.
It is not too early for Europeans and Americans to start thinking about the implications of the epochal fact that the Eurasian map, as much of this century has known it, is being shaken. Given the accelerating velocity of history, we should begin charting deliberately the next phase in its trajectory.

HEADLINE: Dinkins, in Washington, Seeks Aid for Cities

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
David N. Dinkins sat in the front of a packed Senate committee room this morning, surrounded by Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, Alan Cranston of California and Paul Simon of Illinois. Just when it seemed the Mayor of New York City could not bask in a warmer spotlight, in walked Elizabeth Taylor.
The occasion was a news conference to discuss the Senators' proposed bill to provide emergency-relief money to the areas hit hardest by AIDS. For Mr. Dinkins, his third visit here in nine days was part of a steadily building strategy to style himself as a national spokesman for urban areas. ''If we can't begin to address the health-care crisis now, in the midst of a public-health disaster far worse than the polio or tuberculosis epidemics, then we might as well permanently resign ourselves to the fact that this nation doesn't really care about the health and well-being of all its citizens,'' Mr. Dinkins said. 
 
An 'Urban Agenda'
Because they lead the nation's largest city, New York City mayors have historically had more prominence than most municipal chief executives.
Now, with New York facing problems from AIDS to crack to homelessness, and with the state and city struggling to fill huge budget gaps, Mr. Dinkins's advisers say he is determined to use his position as mayor to be heard in and seek help from Washington.
''We're trying to build a coalition of urban centers,'' said Mr. Dinkins's deputy, Bill Lynch.
The two arrived for a day that included the AIDS news conference, another on the census, a lunch with the New York Congressional delegation, a meeting with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development about housing financing and another news conference with a Soviet citizen, Carmella Raiz, whose family is not being allowed to immigrate to Israel. ''The message we want to send is that New York City can't do it alone,'' Mr. Lynch said.
On a visit last Monday, Mr. Dinkins told the National Press Club that conservatism was dying, and said it was time for the nation and its cities to build ''a new foundation upon the rubble of the conservative decade.''
Today, after testifying before a House budget committee hearing on AIDS, Mr. Dinkins elaborated.
''It's not because I'm trying to run for national office, because I'm not,'' he said. ''But it's because that's one of the better ways to assure the kind of assistance and sympathy we need for New York. I just can't tell you how pleased I am. D'Amato, all of those guys, they're on board on this stuff.''
Mr. Koch was no stranger to Washington, where he served eight years as a Congressman before becoming mayor. Neither is Mr. Dinkins, who spent four years here as a mathematics major at Howard University in the late 1940's.
Today Mr. Dinkins came as New York's mayor, and the treatment was different. Two bodyguards drove down at 4 A.M. with a back-up security car. The District of Columbia police met him at National Airport with a blue Lincoln Continental 'You Get Treated Differently ''There's a difference,'' Mr. Dinkins said softly. ''It's nice to come back here. Just as Joe Citizen you get treated differently and as mayor of the greatest urban center on earth you get treated still differently.''
The Mayor made it plain that he speaks with special feeling for disenfranchised people. At a news conference in his role as co-chairman of the United States Conference of Mayors' task force on the census, he faulted the Census Bureau for its reluctance to adjust its count to compensate for expected undercounting, which especially affects minorities in big cities.
''This to me is as bad as the early days of our country when the census said we will count African-American slaves as three-fifths of a person,'' he said.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who appeared with Mr. Dinkins at several events, said, ''I think our Mayor already in two months has established himself as a leading voice for urban America.''
''He has an extraordinarily strong voice, a tough voice when it's needed, but a voice with gentility - gentleness, I meant, I guess.''
At that Mr. Dinkins interrupted, ''Whatever works, Chuck.''
Just how well the Mayor's approach will work remains to be seen, but he seems to be winning some good will.
''Thank you for being so outspoken on the national issues that are so important to us,'' said Representative Frank J. Guarini, Democrat of Jersey City, after the budget hearing.
For his part, Mr. Dinkins said, ''I think we're making some progress.''

HEADLINE: Fernandez Plans Schools in Workplaces

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
New York City Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez plans to open a network of elementary schools inside office buildings and other workplaces, where young children can attend classes as their parents work nearby.
The plan hinges on the willingness of the city's businesses to contribute space and amenities, and yesterday Mr. Fernandez invited a large gathering of executives to join him in setting up such schools as early as September, starting with a program for children in kindergarten through second grade.
 
Businesses Asked for Day Care
Mr. Fernandez said he would provide the teachers and books, and he asked the business leaders to furnish the classrooms, maintenance, heat and electricity and after-school day care. Mr. Fernandez has a track record for establishing ''satellite learning centers'' in workplaces. In Miami, where he was superintendent, he set up three such schools - at an insurance concern, a community college and the city's airport - and 11 more are planned. 
To sell his plan in New York yesterday, Mr Fernandez offered a vision of working parents talking with their children on the way to school, doing their jobs with the ''peace of mind'' that comes with having their children close at hand and visiting their children during lunch breaks.
Employers could attract workers by offering them ''the perk'' of having a school at the job site, he said; attendance and punctuality by workers should increase.
 
Help With Overcrowding
''Bringing schools to the workplace,'' Mr. Fernandez said, would also free space in the city's overcrowded schools and provide greater economic and racial integration in a system whose students are largely minority-group members and poor.
''We could have the vice president's kids sitting next to the janitor's kids,'' he told a breakfast of over 700 members of the Association for a Better New York, a private civic group of business and government leaders.
So far, Mr. Fernandez's staff has sent feelers or begun discussions with a handful of businesses or institutions, including a Queens real-estate developer, and it has invited other business executives for a briefing next month. There are hopes that a pilot school could open as early as September, the start of the next school year, and that additional schools could be set up soon after in corporate headquarters, airports, hospitals, or even shopping malls, Mr. Fernandez said. He said no specific sites had been chosen.
 
Seen as Harder in Manhattan
Several executives interviewed after the breakfast expressed interest in the proposal, including Lewis Rudin, the association's chairman and a major real-estate owner in the city. Many businesses have struggled to hold onto female employees with young children and have looked into day-care arrangements. But some executives cautioned that satellite schools could be set up more easily in quieter boroughs like Queens and Brooklyn than in the hurly-burly of midtown and lower Manhattan. The program would be available free only to city residents.
While supportive of the proposal, Meyer S. Frucher, an executive vice president at Olympia & York, the world's largest commercial real-estate developer, pointed out that employees are sometimes reluctant to take small children on crowded subways and through the frenetic atmosphere and heavy traffic of Manhattan's streets.
As a former director of labor relations in the administration of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Frucher helped set up 32 day-care centers at mental hospitals and state prisons, but he said he did not get a receptive response from employees at large office buildings like the World Trade Center.
 
Plans for a Survey
Mr. Fernandez has already put together a resolution asking the seven-member Board of Education to approve the concept in principle, and Amina Abdur-Rahman, Deputy Chancellor for External Programs and Community Affairs, has scheduled a meeting in April with interested executives.
Ms. Rahman said she wanted the employers to understand the school system's requirements for adequate space, access to toilets and the like. She also wants to use the meeting to design a survey so the Board of Education can find out how many workers are likely to enroll their children. Roughly 25 children would be required for each classroom, she said.
Amy Linden, executive director of the Division of School Buildings, said she has been talking with Dominik Ciampa, a Queens developer, about setting up such a school at a new office complex Mr. Ciampa is building in Flushing. Other sites under consideration, she said, include LaGuardia Airport and Kennedy International Airport, which are operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Metrotech complex of four office buildings under construction in downtown Brooklyn, and the new Citicorp skyscraper in Long Island City, Queens.
''As Mr. Fernandez says, 'it's a win-win situation,' '' Ms. Linden said. ''It's such an easy concept and everyone immediately grasps it. Parents think of all the hassles of getting their kids to schools and the worries they have when they go to work all day. This solves all those problems.''
 
Costs Said to Be Minimal
As superintendent of Dade County's school system, Mr. Fernandez installed satellite schools for young children at the American Bankers Insurance Group, at Miami International Airport and at Miami-Dade Community College. Mr. Fernandez said the program, which began in August 1987, has been well received.
Ms. Rahman said the satellite schools would not cost the system any more money. Parents who sent their children to such workplace schools would have to obtain waivers from the school near their homes. State and city money would essentially follow the children to the satellite schools.
For athletic activities and assemblies, children from a satellite schools would have to visit a nearby elementary school. Since the school day ends at 3 P.M. and most workers in the city work until 5 P.M., companies would have to pay for day care for children in the intervening hours. The schools would be confined to the early grades, officials said, because legal requirements for such amenities as gymnasiums were less stringent.
 
Help for 'Latchkey Children'
In unveiling the proposal at yesterday's breakfast at the New York Hilton, Mr. Fernandez pointed out that 60 percent of the city's public school children have only one parent at home and that many are ''latchkey children'' who come home to empty apartments. Satellite-school children, he said, would be brought home by their parents.
When the satellite school was set up at the American Bankers Insurance Group, employee turnover dropped to 4 percent from 11 percent, he said.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
Women's College Struggles to Keep Its Identity

BYLINE: By KATHERINE BISHOP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., March 6

 BODY:
The official T-shirt of the small liberal arts college here reads: ''Mills College: Not a girls' school without men, but a women's college without boys.''
But this winter, many Mills students on this graceful, wooded campus have joined their counterparts at other women's colleges in wearing an unofficial one. It reads: ''Mills College: Better Dead Than Coed,'' an acknowledgement that their school, too, may be faced with the necessity to change or perish.
As at other women's campuses that have faced the possibility of transition to a coeducational institution, the students here are strongly opposed. Admitting men ''destroys the whole mission of the college, which is the empowerment of women,'' said Robyn Fisher, a senior who is the president of Mills' Associated Students. 
Alexa Pagonas, a junior from San Francisco, said, ''We need women's colleges because a woman needs to find herself, and go with that, instead of with the male model.''
But the message from the Mills board, which will vote in May on the issue, is that this campus must quickly find a way to increase enrollment by nearly one-third, to 1,000 students.
 
National Predicament
Mills, founded in 1852, is the latest victim of the national predicament in women's higher education: Despite the enthusiastic support of their graduates, women's colleges find it increasingly difficult to attract and hold enough students to sustain them.
The number of high school graduates in general has been declining, and for the select group of approximately 230,000 students who meet the high admissions standards of schools like Mills, competition is intense. And while gifts from alumnae remain high, financial aid from the schools to deserving lower-income students is increasing, thereby decreasing net tuition income.
With only 777 undergraduate students for the fall 1989 semester, Mills is less than half the size of Mount Holyoke at 1,939. Wellesley, with 2,145 students, is nearly three times as large. Mills believes it must have no fewer than 1,000 to maintain its standards and survive financially.
''It's very clear that the college cannot keep going the way it is,'' said F. Warren Hellman, chairman of the Mills board. ''Nearly every college that has gone down this track has gone coed.''
To some degree, the college's problems are made worse by its location in California, which has an extensive system of excellent, tuition-free public universities, including the prestigious Berkeley campus just a few miles north of Mills. With annual tuition at $11,900 and room and board charges at $5,100, Mills costs $17,000 a year for the 80 percent of its students who live on campus.
 
Decrease in Women's Colleges
Peter Mirijanian, spokesman for the Women's College Coalition in Washington, says there are only 94 women's colleges today, down from approximately 300 in 1960. That number may decrease as 121-year-old Chatham in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's oldest women's college, will make its decision on April 22 whether to approve its trustees' recommendation to admit men in 1991.
Dr. Mary S. Metz, who has been president of Mills since 1981, said: ''It's a great dilemma because of the evidence that attending women's colleges makes a difference in the lives of women. It has truly empowered women, and they've gone on to do greater things.''
Dr. Metz cited statistics showing that nearly half the women in the 101st Congress and one-third of those on the boards of the 1,000 largest American corporations attended women's colleges. Conversely, she said, studies have found consistent patterns of women getting less attention and being more frequently interrupted in coeducational classes.
''A lot of research shows that women do best in an atmosphere that is affirming and supporting in a way coeducational colleges have not replicated,'' Dr. Metz said. ''Even small coeducational schools have a problem with dynamics in the classroom when men dominate class discussions and take more time of the professors.''
Jodi Preston, a junior majoring in psychology who transferred to Mills this year after two years at another college, said such considerations were part of her decision.
''Everything in the other college was run by men,'' Ms. Preston said. ''I felt stifled most of the time. I felt I wasn't living up to my potential.''
 
Issue of Male Dominance
Dr. Virginia Smith was president of Vassar in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., for a decade beginning in 1977, seven years after that college began admitting men. She said it is harder to nurture women in a coeducational setting. But as a member of the Mills board, she said she had not decided how she would vote on whether the college should admit men.
''Most schools are not really coeducational because they are male-dominated,'' she said. ''If women are to be served well in a coeducational setting, there may have to be more awareness by teachers and administrators that women may have to be given more support.''
Mr. Mirijanian said that if Mills is to remain a women's college it must ''reposition itself in the market.'' Because women's roles have changed, he said, institutions like Mills are now challenged to change the perception of women's colleges, emphasizing the success of their graduates in the marketplace as their selling point, ''They can say they are leaders in the business community, that they go into Congress, that they have more women in science, economics and math than coed schools do,'' Mr. Mirijanian said. ''Their women are going into Fortune 1000 companies and other male-dominated institutions and they're better prepared.''
One possible alternative is to recruit in the ''secondary markets'' of women over 25 years old and foreign students, a strategy followed, with apparent success, by Russell Sage College in Troy, N.Y., which decided to remain women-only in 1987, and which this year has 1,000 undergraduates, one of the highest enrollments in its history.
''Women's colleges must go after these women as a way to supplement their student body,'' said Mr. Marijanian, who cited a recent report showing that in five years the majority of undergraduates at colleges will be over 23 years old.
''There is a huge, growing market for part-time and resuming students,'' Mr. Hellman said. At present, fewer than 20 percent of Mills undergraduates are ''resumers,'' students over 23 who have returned to school after a break to work or rear children.
The issues, as Mr. Hellman sees them, are: ''What can Mills do to get these markets and do we then end up with an institution we're proud of?''

HEADLINE: K Mart Gambling on Renovation

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TROY, Mich.

 BODY:
When it comes to merchandising revenues, the K Mart Corporation, Sears, Roebuck & Company and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are now so close that it is difficult to say which of the three is the nation's largest retailer. But when it comes to merchandising profits, K Mart is a weak third.
Dismayed by earnings declines in the last three quarters and a loss of market share, K Mart is responding with a huge gamble. Accelerating and increasing the scope of a program announced last October, the company said last week that it would spend $2.3 billion over the next five years to enlarge 930 of its discount department stores and to give all 2,190 of its stores a fresher look.
To be sure, when the company completes the task in 1995, its stores will still have all the things that have made it a fixture in American retailing: bluelight specials, ''Attention, K Mart shoppers'' announcements, and enough synthetic-fiber clothing to retain its industry nickname - the Polyester Palace. Is the Risk Worthwhile? The risk is that K Mart will open bigger and better stores and nobody will come, or at least not enough people to make the company anything more than an also-ran in its industry. ''They could open up all this new space and find that there is simply not enough additional business to have made it worthwhile,'' said Kurt Barnard, the editor of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report, a leading industry newsletter. 
Any retailer faces such a risk when it expands. What makes K Mart's expansion at once striking and perilous is its speed and scope.
Retailers of all stripes are working with bigger spaces so they can display more merchandise and, they hope, garner more of a shopper's purchases. K Mart has determined that roughly 42 percent of its stores are too small to be competitive, and they will either be closed, moved to larger quarters or expanded in their present locations. The goal is to increase the average size of these stores to 85,000 square feet from just more than 60,000 square feet at present. In addition, K Mart plans to open 250 new stores by early 1995, all in the 85,000-square-foot format.
At the same time, K Mart plans to give all of its stores a new look. Heartened by the increased sales being reported by three prototype stores, K Mart will widen the aisles in its stores, install track lighting, use splashy graphics and replace worn display shelves with wider, taller ones. The company will also be purging product laggards and loading up on good sellers. The latter move is aimed at building an image as a merchant on the cutting edge of consumer tastes. The store face lifts are intended to make K Marts more inviting places to shop and to convey a sense of a store brimming with fresh merchandise.
''Presentation, presentation, presentation,'' said Marc Buchi, manager of the prototype K Mart store in Oak Park, Mich., outside Detroit.
 
Industry Slowdown
By the time K Mart completes its expansion in early 1995, the company will have enlarged its selling space by a third from the beginning of 1989, to roughly 174 million square feet, or by roughly 5.5 percent a year. This is more than double the rate at which K Mart expanded its store space between 1983 and 1988, and more than triple the industry growth rate, according to James P. Ruf, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Company, the Wall Street firm. But this new space will be available in years when, in the view of most retail analysts, sales at discount department stores will be growing slowly, if at all.
To justify the huge outlay for additional selling space, K Mart must add $7.6 billion to its merchandising revenues of $23.2 billion just to maintain sales per square foot at their current level. K Mart's chairman and chief executive, Joseph E. Antonini, who declined to be interviewed for this article, told securities analysts last October that his goal is to increase sales to $40 billion by 1994.
Such an accomplishment would mean taking market share from competitors, including Wal-Mart, Target, Ames, Caldor and, for some merchandise, Sears. Doing that would mark a big departure from K Mart's recent performance. After increasing its sales and profits rapidly in the 1970's and through much of the 1980's, K Mart of late has been a font of disappointing news.
K Mart is almost at the bottom of the profitability heap. Partly as a result of charges relating to its modernization program. K Mart is expected to soon report less than $200 million in profits for 1989, according to analysts' estimates. Sears recently reported that its merchandising group's profit was $646 million; Wal-Mart's merchandising profit was $1.1 billion.
K Mart's pretax profits have been about 4.5 percent of sales in recent years, compared with 6.5 percent at Wal-Mart and 5.4 percent at Target Stores. At Sears, it was 3.6 percent.
Sales increases at K Mart stores open for at least a year have been running at only about 3 percent -less than the rate of inflation. Analysts blame factors from poorly chosen merchandise to dingy, cramped stores to a lethargic sales staff for the sluggish growth in same-store sales.
Meanwhile, returns from K Mart's specialty stores, which include Waldenbooks, Pay Less Drug Stores and Builders Square home-improvement centers, have been depressed badly by expansion expenses. The specialty stores account for roughly 15 percent of K Mart's revenues.
In the three quarters ended last Oct. 31 - figures for the most recent quarter have not yet been released -K Mart reported lower earnings. One reason was a move to a policy that keeps prices low every day instead of offering many advertised sales. The company also said that inclement weather in the winter and spring of 1988 depressed sales of gardening tools and spring apparel.
 
Wal-Mart Moving Up
In terms of revenues, K Mart, which traces its roots to 1899 with the founding of the S. S. Kresge Company, will report about $27.5 billion in domestic merchandising sales for 1989, according to analysts' estimates. Sears also had an estimated $27.5 billion in domestic merchandising sales last year. Wal-Mart reported recently that its 1989 sales were $25.8 billion, but its double-digit sales increases should push it ahead of K Mart and Sears by the end of this year.
Given K Mart's difficulties, even the company's most vocal critics agree that the retailer must do something to stem its decline. But some outsiders are skeptical of K Mart's expansion and renovation program. ''What they have talked about is purely housekeeping issues,'' said Sidney Doolittle of McMillan & Doolittle, a Chicago-based industry consultant. ''They need to work on the strategic edge of K Mart: Who is K Mart going to be?''
Indeed, the prevailing view of retailing experts is that for now K Mart would be better off maintaining its current size and focusing instead on building its position in a few product categories in which it can dominate. K Mart stores already sell a huge amount of live plants and gardening equipment.
Herbert Fisher, who runs the Jamesway Corporation, a big discounter based in Secaucus, N.J., pointed up the risk of an expansion: ''Unless one of our stores is doing a fantastically large volume, it just doesn't make sense for us to expand it right now,'' he said. ''The added overhead would eat us up. We'd have to price ourselves out of the market.''
But K Mart argues that its larger stores perform better than its midsized stores and that small stores perform the poorest. It says that sales at some 83 K Mart stores enlarged in the last year and a half have already begun to improve.
 
'This Will Work'
''The weight of evidence is that this will work,'' said Orren Knauer, a K Mart spokesman. ''If we sit still with these undersized stores, we risk being eaten alive by the competition.''
Like K Mart, Sears, Montgomery Ward & Company and other retailers have been renovating their stores -making them brighter and more inviting through the use of better lighting and display shelves. They have also been narrowing their product lines to focus on better-selling items.
Mr. Knauer argued that in many product categories K Mart does not compete with Sears or Montgomery Ward. He argued that consumers would choose K Mart over competitors because K Mart stores would have better prices and better locations than rivals. They will also have better customer service than the competition, Mr. Knauer contended, and they will have fewer out-of-stock goods because K Mart is installing an advanced inventory-tracking system.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Fall By 5.4%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
Orders received by the nation's factories fell in January at the steepest rate in 15 years, the Commerce Department said today, reflecting a slump in the nation's manufacturing sector.
Factory orders in the month fell 5.4 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $227.7 billion, primarily because of a sharp drop in transportation orders. Orders had a slim four-tenths of 1 percent gain in December.
''This is consistent with a picture of definite economic sluggishness,'' said Cynthia Latta, senior economist with DRI/McGraw Hill Inc. in Lexington, Mass. ''But there's really nothing that suggests a drift to recession,'' she added. 
 
Biggest Drop Since '74
The January drop in factory orders was the biggest one-month decline since December 1974, when they fell 7 percent. The increase last December was revised downward, from the 1.9 percent originally reported.
Excluding the volatile transportation sector, factory orders fell 1 percent in January, after a decrease of three-tenths of 1 percent in December, the department said.
One-third of the decline in orders reflected a steep drop in commercial aircraft orders after an unusual spike in sales that followed the November settlement of a strike against the Boeing Company, the nation's largest aircraft manufacturer.
 
Aircraft and Parts Down
Transportation equipment orders over all fell 28.8 percent in January, after gaining 4.7 percent in December. Within that category, aircraft and parts orders were down 27.3 percent, after a 9.3 percent December rise.
Auto orders weakened, while orders for military tanks and ships fell by 72.5 percent in January after more than tripling in December.
Noting that manufacturing makes up 25 percent of the economy, Ms. Latta said, ''There has been some spillover of the existing decline in the industrial sector to the services side, but there's no evidence yet of serious repercussions.''
Last month, the Government reported that orders for durable goods - items designed to last three or more years - fell 10.5 percent in January after a 1.2 percent increase in December.
Jean Sundrla, an economist with Evans Economics, a forecasting group in Washington, said the weak orders could signal lower investment spending by big companies.
''This falloff portends a damper on capital goods expenditures,'' the economist said, because corporations will try to tighten up outlays to avoid running up inventories.
 
Shipments Fall
In the report, factory inventories expanded by seven-tenths of 1 percent in January after being drawn down by five-tenths of 1 percent in December. Shipments also fell 1.9 percent after falling eight-tenths of 1 percent in December.
Laurence Meyer, president of Laurence Meyer & Associates of St. Louis, said the January inventory buildup was troubling because it pointed to an oversupply of goods.
''What we're seeing is weakness in orders at the beginning of the year and weakness in shipments, but the falloff in production is lagging the drop in demand,'' Mr. Meyer said.
Recent indicators have presented a mixed picture of the economy. Personal income and construction spending rose strongly in January, but housing sales fell sharply for a second straight month.
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said last week that he thought the economy's weakest point had passed and put the chance of a recession at less than 50 percent.
Still, manufacturing jobs fell for a 12th straight month in February, according to a survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management published last week. Government employment figures for February are due Friday.
 
Electrical Orders Drop
The Commerce Department said factory orders for nonelectrical machinery rose 2.4 percent in January after falling 4 percent in December. Electrical machinery orders fell 15.5 percent after a 5.4 percent December gain.
Military orders for capital goods, which fell 13.3 percent in December, dropped 28.8 percent in January.
Excluding the volatile military category from both months, factory orders fell 4.4 percent in January after a 1.1 percent rise in December.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Global Warming: China Perplex

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
THE bad news, say Alan S. Manne of Stanford University and Richard G. Richels of the Electric Power Research Institute, is that it would probably cost Americans trillions of dollars to reduce their output of ''greenhouse effect'' carbon dioxide gas by as little as 20 percent. The really bad news, the two economists say in a new, unpublished paper, is that a 20 percent cut would almost certainly be offset by increased emissions from poor countries.
The Manne-Richels estimates are, of course, no better than the computer simulation that generates them. And many environmentalists contend that the simulation assumes away the possibility of rapid technological change under pressure - of finding ways to decouple economic growth from increased use of carbon fuels. 
But it is hard to be optimistic about the prospects for ''clean'' growth in the third world, most notably in China. If the two economists are even close to right, the costs of a successful global effort to control atmospheric warming would be daunting.
Europe, America and what used to be called the Soviet bloc generate 71 percent of the world's carbon dioxide. Suppose they agreed to stabilize emissions at current levels, and then gradually reduced them by 20 percent by 2020. That goal, almost everyone acknowledges, could be achieved by conserving energy and switching to less polluting fuels.
According to the Manne-Richels model, Europe and Japan could manage the task by sacrificing 1 to 2 percent of national income. Hitting the 20 percent target would cost the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe much more - perhaps 4 percent of income - because capital is more expensive and the prospects for technological fixes more problematic. America, with a 3 percent loss of potential income, is in between.
If it were widely accepted that the only alternative was ecological catastrophe, it might well be possible to build a political consensus for sacrifice. But properly calculated, the cost would be awesome.
The ''present value'' of the cumulative loss over the next century would be roughly $1 trillion for America alone. And the benefit in the absence of a similar commitment to conservation from the third world, where the rate of growth of energy use is double the world average, would be modest. If, for example, China and other poor countries agreed to limit carbon emissions to just double the current level, total carbon dioxide emissions would increase by 15 percent by 2030.
Doubling seems a generous allowance; surely, even the penurious passengers on spaceship earth would accept a tougher constraint?
Do not count on it. According to the model, the doubling constraint would reduce the potential income of coal-rich, capital-poor China by a distressing 10 percent. To limit the level of sacrifice to 3 percent of income, China would have to be allowed a fourfold increase in carbon emissions.
Put the problem another way. Suppose China was permitted to quadruple emissions while the rest of the third world was limited to just a twofold increase. To reduce the total output of carbon dioxide to 80 percent of the 1990 level, the industrial countries would have to cut emissions to zero.
Necessity, one is told by environmentalists, is the mother of energy conservation. It is conceivable that the developed countries could manage an aggressive program for constraining carbon emissions, and subsidize a more modest technical fix for poor countries. But the depressing conclusions of the Manne-Richels simulations suggest the need to look hard at alternatives to carbon constraints.
One possibility would be to focus efforts on containing other greenhouse-effect gases. The class of chemicals known as CFC's are wreaking havoc with the earth's ozone layer, as well as helping to warm the atmosphere. Since the industrialized countries are already committed to phasing out their use, it might make sense to accelerate the process.
Another potential target is methane, a byproduct of rice cultivation and animal husbandry. No one is suggesting that Asians switch to Wonderbread or that Americans become vegetarians. But it may be possible to limit methane pollution by modifying agricultural techniques.
Last, but hardly least, it might pay to roll with the greenhouse punch, accepting some increase in atmospheric temperature and mitigating the consequences. That might, for example, include irrigation of regions that lose rainfall, or building dikes around coastal cities threatened by rising ocean levels.
Rolling with the greenhouse punch would cost a small fortune. But if the Manne-Richels numbers are on the mark, confronting the problem directly would cost a large one.

HEADLINE: Slump in Securities Industry

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
Four senior securities executives told Congress today that their industry was in a period of economic decline, but said only minor legislative changes were needed.
In general, the executives testified that the securities business was cyclical, with any downturn followed by an upturn. 
''There is no question that the industry is at low ebb right now, economically, and to some extent, in its public image,'' said Robert N. Downey, chairman of the Securities Industry Association, the leading industry trade group.
John H. Gutfreund, the chairman and chief executive of Salomon Inc., said: ''The problem of the 80's - in terms of the excess leveraging - nature has taken care of that. There is no question that we can do very well in the 90's in our industry.''
W. Lucas Simmons, managing partner of J. C. Bradford & Company, a Nashville-based brokerage, and Philip J. Purcell, chairman and chief executive of Dean Witter Financial Services Group, also testified.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who heads the securities subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee, had asked the executives for their appraisal of the securities industry, especially in the wake of the recent collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
The panel unanimously endorsed only one recommendation: giving the Securities and Exchange Commission exclusive regulatory authority over stock-index futures. At the moment, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission regulates those stock-index futures.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Shifting Auto Gears by Computer

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER

 BODY:
Sports cars and automatic transmissions have never mixed well. Car enthusiasts say automatics rob a car of performance and fuel economy while giving the driver less control than a manual gearbox.
Now Porsche A.G. hopes to change all that with the Tiptronic, a new automatic that uses a microprocessor and an array of electronic sensors to provide better performance, economy and control. It was co-developed with Robert Bosch G.m.b.H., the German electronics concern, and ZF-Getriebe G.m.b.H., the German transmission manufacturer. 
The Tiptronic is already being sold in Europe on the Porsche 911 Carrera 2, and will be available on that car in the United States in late spring or early summer. Auto analysts say variants are likely to appear soon in other sports/ luxury cars, beginning with those from the German manufacturers BMW and Mercedes. And some executives say that similar electronically controlled automatic transmissions will not only become common in the 1990's, but may be essential in meeting more stringent emission and fuel economy standards.
While conventional automatics respond to a very limited set of mechanical data in determining when to shift - engine speed, road speed, the position of the gas pedal - the Tiptronic considers 40 kinds of data, responding to electronic sensors that measure lateral forces in a turn as well as forward acceleration, engine and air temperature and even the driver's driving style. It also compensates for altitude and wear.
Some contemporary automatics allow the driver to choose between ''sport'' and ''economy'' modes of shifting; the Tiptronic chooses for itself, among five shift patterns. For example, sensors detect whether a driver presses the accelerator more rapidly than normal, something that alerts the gearbox to shift into its ''performance'' program. Drivers can also use the gearbox manually; here, too, the Tiptronic differs from other automatics.
 
'A Two-Personality Gearbox'
The Tiptronic's shift lever moves in two planes, one marked with the normal Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive and gears one through three; the other plane, to the right of the normal selector panel, is labeled Plus and Minus. In that setting, tipping the lever forward shifts up one gear and backward down one gear, much the way the shift pedal on a motorcycle works. This prevents the overshifting that can occur when a driver tries to shift from, say, first to second gear on a conventional automatic.
''It's a two-personality gearbox; it acts almost like any automatic gearbox but it's a bit smarter than most,'' said Victor H. Elford, a former Porsche racing driver who now manages promotional activities for the company in the United States. ''It almost thinks for you.''
Even using the Tiptronic in manual mode, ''you can't make it do anything wrong,'' Mr. Elford said. ''When you get to the red line it will shift anyway, even at full throttle, so smoothly you hardly notice it,'' he said. ''It almost makes a traditional manual transmission obsolete.''
 
Microprocessor Is the Key
Internally, the Tiptronic is similar to other automatic transmissions. What sets it apart is the microprocessor, the computer-on-a-chip found at the heart of personal computers and, increasingly, in automobile engine control systems. The microprocessor interprets the input from the various sensors and selects among the five shift patterns stored in memory.
It also helps eliminate many of the unpleasant traits of conventional automatics, like undesired shifting back and forth between two gears or shifting at the wrong moment. With other automatics, if a driver lifts off the accelerator pedal in a tight turn, a shift to the next higher gear occurs, which can cause a loss of control. The Tiptronic electronically senses that the car is in a turn and will hold the gear until an upshift is appropriate.
Peter Albrecht, engineering editor for Sports Car International, an enthusiasts' magazine, said that he and most other Porsche lovers would probably still prefer a car with a clutch pedal, but that the Tiptronic was the most capable automatic available. ''If you have to have an automatic, this is the best way because you can have your cake and eat it too,'' he said. ''It gives you a far greater degree of control than a normal automatic does.''
 
Meeting the Requirements
Porsche calls the Tiptronic ''transmission technology for tomorrow,'' and Mr. Albrecht said this might be more than just sloganeering. ''Porsche thinks that in the future it may be necessary for all cars to have automatics just to meet emission and fuel efficiency requirements,'' he said.
Indeed, the Tiptronic transmission already equals the performance of manual transmissions for those two standards; engineers expect future electronic transmissions to be more efficient than manual ones. By controlling shifts electronically an engine could be held in the proper range of revolutions per minute at all times to maximize economy and minimize pollutants. The Tiptronic, for example, raises the r.p.m. of the points at which it shifts when an engine is cold in order to warm up the catalytic converter faster, thereby reducing emissions.
Performance suffers slightly for the Tiptronic-equipped 911, which accelerates from 0 to 60 miles an hour in 6.3 seconds, compared with 5.5 seconds for a similar Porsche equipped with a five-speed manual gearbox. Fuel economy is similar. Porsche expects a fifth of Carrera 2's sold to be equipped with the Tiptronic, but at this stage the technology is not cheap. The Tiptronic adds $3,255 to the $58,500 base price of a 911 Carrera 2.
 
Broad Use Expected
Nevertheless, this kind of technology is likely to appear in a wide array of cars in a few years. Auto analysts say that just as electronically controlled engines and antilock breaking systems have moved from elite sporting vehicles to mass-production cars, so too will electronically controlled automatic transmissions.
''In the near term, we will have a sizable volume in electronically controlled transmissions,'' said Donald L. Runkle, the General Motors Corporation's vice president, advanced engineering staff. As a long-term research effort, General Motors is developing electronic automatic transmissions with seven or eight speeds, compared with the typical three or four.
''We are spending quite a bit of energy on electronic control of the shift schedule, and interfacing the transmission with the engine,'' Mr. Runkle said. By linking the engine and transmission electronically, one microprocessor can control both, which would reduce costs and optimize fuel economy and reduce emissions.

Looking Beyond The Debt Burden

BYLINE: By Phillip H. Wiggins

 BODY:
AS the fallout from the heady days of overleveraging continues, investors have abandoned the stocks of many companies with high levels of debt on their balance sheets.
Doubtless most of these are deservedly abandoned. But some Wall Street specialists say the selloff of these stocks has left good buys among some leveraged companies that generate enough cash flow to manage their debt and still record strong profits.
''The prices of some quality, highly leveraged companies may not reflect the underlying value of the stock,'' Neil R. Feldman, an analyst at Gruntal & Company, said in a telephone interview. ''It appears that investors have tended to discount these companies, given their heavy debt load. As a result, many of these stocks are trading at undervalued levels.'' 
Finding bargains among the highly indebted is not a game for everyone. Several analysts, including Mr. Feldman, are quick to warn that highly leveraged companies remain vulnerable to an economic downturn or rising interest rates - either of which could hurt their ability to pay off the debt or indeed to survive.
To evaluate companies with lots of debt, some analysts recommend that investors focus on cash flow because it can be indicative of the earning power of a company. Cash flow is generally defined as net income plus depreciation minus preferred dividends. But looking at cash flow may not be enough. Some analysts say investors should also calculate the cash-flow-to-price ratio. To do this, an investor needs to first obtain a cash flow per-share figure by dividing the dollar amount of cash flow by the company's total shares outstanding in the latest full fiscal year. The cash-flow-to-price ratio is achieved by dividing the stock's price by the cash flow per share.
According to Wall Street analysts, stocks are now trading at about eight times cash flow and investors should seek companies trading at less than that.
Joseph Arsenio, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco, points to the IDB Communications Group, as an example of a company with a low cash-flow-to-price ratio. The company, an independent supplier of satellite transmission services for radio and television programming in Culver City, Calif., trades on the over-the-counter market.
Recently, IDB announced that Teleglobe International U.S., Inc. had purchased a 20 percent stake through the acquisition of a little more than 1.2 million shares at $11.165 a share. With the Teleglobe investment, IDB's debt-to-equity ratio was reduced from 5 to 1 to about 2.6 to 1; its long-term debt decreased by $13 million, to about $90 million. Mr. Arsenio's 1990 earnings estimate is 51 cents a share. Based on a projected 1990 cash flow per share of $1.80 and a closing price of $9 a share yesterday in over-the-counter trading, IDB is selling at five times cash flow, making it attractive.
Superior Teletec Inc. of Atlanta is a $108 million manufacturer of copper telephone wire and cables, test equipment for transmission lines, and specialty fiber optic products for the telecommunications industry. The company's customers include independent telephone companies, like the GTE Corporation, and regional Bell operating companies, like Nynex.
Analysts say that the company's debt was incurred under an earlier management and in a completely different business that did not generate the cash levels necessary to service the debt. Some analysts also say that cash flow for the fiscal year 1990 ending March 31 is expected to be 80 cents a share, and earnings are likely to increase to between 45 cents and 50 cents a share.
The fiscal year 1989's net income was 30 cents a share. Some analysts rate the stock, selling at 5.5 times projected 1990 cash flow, as a buy. The stock closed yesterday at $4.375 on the American Stock Exchange.
Mr. Hackel of Systematic Financial focuses solely on ''free cash flow,'' or the maximum amount of cash a company can distribute to its stockholders.
''VF Corporation, at 8.3 times its four-year average operating cash flow and 12 times free cash flow, and Ethyl, at 8.7 times operating flow and 12 times free cash flow, are two consistent free cash flow producers, and only moderately leveraged,'' Mr. Hackel said. ''Both stocks have needlessly declined so far this year.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Notes and Bonds Rise

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds rose in thin trading yesterday, as many dealers who sold securities on Monday turned around and bought them yesterday.
''For all practical purposes, prices are as low as they have been all year, and that led some folks to figure they should go ahead and take a shot,'' one government bond trader said.
But the buying that was going on was largely done by the dealers themselves, not retail investors, market participants said.
''This bounce is not retail-inspired,'' the bond trader said. ''This is a largely professional trading market.'' 
A report that new factory orders in February posted their largest one-month decline since 1974 had no impact on the credit markets. Analysts said the next important piece of economic data will not be released until Friday, when February employment statistics are expected.
 
Drop in Factory Orders
''The big decline in factory orders reflected the big drop in durable goods orders we saw last week,'' said Stephen W. Gallagher, a money market economist at Kidder, Peabody & Company.
Mr. Gallagher said that while the coming employment report had the potential to move the prices out of the narrow trading range they have occupied for the last two weeks, it would probably take more data to move the market.
''We probably need to see a good round of inflation numbers for February before we can get out of these ranges,'' he said.
Yesterday's price gains made up most of the losses that were recorded Monday.
In late trading, the 8 1/2 percent Treasury bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 99 1/4, up 25/32, to yield 8.56 percent. Late Monday the closely watched issue was quoted at a price to yield 8.64 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 99 19/ 32 late yesterday, up half a point, to yield 8.56 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent two-year notes were offered at 100, up 3/32, to yield 8.50 percent.
 
Bill Rates Are Mixed
Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.87 percent, up four basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bill rates were unchanged, at an offered rate of 7.77 percent. And one-year bill rates dipped by three basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.69 percent.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, a $114.8 million offering of bonds from the New York State Medical Care Facilities Finance Agency was tentatively priced through an underwriting syndicate led by WR Lazard & Laidlaw Inc.
The issue consists of serial and term bonds.
Coupons on the serial bonds range from 6 percent on securities maturing in 1991 to 7.40 percent on bonds that mature in 2002.
Among the term issues, the 7.70 percent bonds maturing in 2010 were priced to yield 7.75 percent, while the 7 3/4 percent bonds of 2020 were priced to yield 7.79 percent.
The issue is rated A by Moody's Investors Service and A-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the new issue market for investment-grade corporate bonds, the First Boston Corporation acted as lead manager for a $150 million offering of 10-year notes for the Japanese Finance Corporation for Municipal Enterprises.
The 9 1/8 percent bonds, which are guaranteed by the Japanese Government, were priced at $99.709, to yield 9.17 percent, 52 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 8 1/2 percent 10-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The issue is rated AAA by both Moody's and S. & P..
Participants in the secondary markets for tax-exempt municipal bonds and investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most actively traded issues were unchanged. Activity was said to be very sluggish in both markets.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Higher in U.S. After Declining Overseas

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed mostly higher in domestic trading after falling overseas in the absence of any major developments to move the foreign exchange markets.
The dollar closed in New York at 149.85 yen, up from Monday's 148.96 yen. And it rose to 1.7035 West German marks, from 1.6970 late Monday. 
The dollar declined in early trading because of speculation that an interest rate increase in Japan was imminent. Such a rise would bolster the yen against the dollar. When the increase did not materialize, the dollar recovered some ground in Europe, although it still closed down from Monday's levels.
The dollar then moved higher against most currencies in New York. Robert Ryan, senior foreign exchange trader with the Bank of New York Company, said the market shied away from testing the upper end of the dollar's trading range, the point at which central banks, including the Federal Reserve, would be expected to step in and try to push the dollar down.
 
Bank of Japan Acts
The Bank of Japan intervened in Asian dealings overnight, pushing the dollar down. Dealers said the Fed sold dollars for yen late in the day in the European market, but the impact was minimal.
The rise in the dollar yesterday came after it fell sharply on Monday following a coordinated round of dollar selling by the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the West German Bundesbank.
The Bank of Japan and the Fed have been selling dollars against yen for two weeks in an effort to support the yen, whose weakness was widely cited as a reason for the recent sharp fall in the Tokyo stock market.
The Bundesbank signaled its unhappiness with the rise of the dollar against the mark by selling dollars Friday. The Bundesbank wants to keep the mark strong to help it fight the inflation that might result from the unification of the two Germanys.
In Europe, the dollar closed at 149.75 yen after slipping by 0.45 yen in earlier Tokyo trading to 149.50 yen.
Mr. Ryan said traders generally were awaiting the Labor Department's employment report for February, scheduled for release Friday. The market expected the nation's non-farm payroll to have expanded by 225,000 jobs, indicating that the economy is stronger than many have thought.
Such a report is expected to move the dollar higher because the Fed is less likely to nudge interest rates down - which would diminish returns on dollar-denominated investments - when the economy shows signs of strength.
The dollar fell against the British pound yesterday. In New York, sterling was quoted at $1.6475, up from $1.6445 late Monday, and in earlier London dealings, it rose to $1.6495 from $1.6390.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, were: 1.5000 Swiss francs, up from 1.4970; 5.7565 French francs, up from 5.7330; 1,257.00 Italian lire, up from 1,252.00, and 1.18565 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18905.

Fictional and Factual Views On the Future of China

Heavy Wings
By Zhang Jie
Translated by Howard Goldblatt. 308 pages. Grove Weidenfeld. $19.95.
 
'Tell the World'
What Happened in China and Why
By Liu Binyan with Ruan Ming and Xu Gang
Translated by Henry L. Epstein. 195 pages. Pantheon Books. $18.95. 
The clouds of censorship that still hover over Tiananmen Square are parted in two newly translated books in which dissidents voice their most intimate ideas and dreams about China today and tomorrow. As readers who have followed recent events in Eastern Europe have discovered, the first truths about freedom or the lack of it often appear in novels, plays and reports from the underground.
Zhang Jie's novel, ''Heavy Wings,'' first published in China nine years ago, foreshadows the frustrations that erupted in student demonstrations last year and led to the democracy movement. Her fictional characters are not simply political puppets but vividly realistic women and men whose family goals and working problems appear universal. At heart this is a story about the struggle of a small group of people to break out of a rigid social and economic structure and seek the right to express themselves as individuals.
The main characters in ''Heavy Wings'' have experiences that resemble some in the author's life. She graduated from People's University in Beijing in the late 1950's, then worked as a government statistician until she was sent to the countryside for ''re-education'' and given a factory job. After the Cultural Revolution, she began to write this outspokenly critical novel about the unswerving hold of China's society before and after the Communist takeover.
In her novel, the fictional Morning Light Auto Works in Beijing is the center of the struggle between reformers and party hard-liners. The novel's family includes a deputy minister of heavy industry, his unhappy wife and a rebellious daughter who wants to marry a man with a checkered past for love. The dialectic is present, but it would be an oversimplification to call this another boy-meets-girl-meets-tractor story.
We watch as government intrudes on the personal lives of these characters. Here, for example, is a glimpse of the author's boldness in describing a morning at the factory: ''Strange how a branch secretary who has dished it out to disgruntled workers for over 20 years can suddenly fall prey to the same discontent himself. How has it come to this? At first he was angry, as though someone had moved his memorial tablet in Heaven.''
There are some 30 characters in ''Heavy Wings,'' often making it difficult to distinguish among them. But it is worth the effort for American readers willing to meet a Chinese novelist of knowledge and courage.
Zhang Jie now lives in Connecticut and teaches at Wesleyan University.
In '' 'Tell the World,' '' Liu Binyan, probably China's best-known investigative reporter, describes what happened in Tiananmen Square in June 1989 and why. Because of his earlier reporting of corruption in the Communist Party, he lost his job on People's Daily, was expelled from the party and now lectures in the United States. His co-authors are Ruan Ming, a former party theoretician who is at Columbia University, and Xu Gang, a poet who participated in the democracy movement last year and now lives in Paris, where he edits Chinese Writers, a journal. The book was translated from the Chinese by Henry L. Epstein.
In an unusually frank interpretation of the motives of the Tiananmen Square demonstrators, this is how Liu Binyan characterizes the young men and women who, for one brief shining moment, dominated Beijing and astonished the world:
''They were the most selfish generation since 1949. They were cynical, contemptuous of all authority, had no hope of nor good feeling toward the Communist Party. They did not think China had a future; nor did they think they had a responsibility for their country and society. However, precisely because they valued their own feelings and individuality so highly, they could, compared with previous generations, least tolerate the suppression of individuality, the limits on freedom and anything else against human nature that was imposed by the tradition created by the Communist Party. They grew up at a time when all traditions had lost their effect, so they never gave themselves up to the constraint of any party or ideology.''
Although helicopters instead of kites now fly over Tiananmen Square, the author writes that the Chinese people will no longer allow what he labels ''the Gang of the Old'' to control their destiny. He predicts that ''a people's movement will expand from the bottom up'' and that ''relatively moderate'' leaders will emerge to replace the hard-liners in the next Chinese Government.
Unlike ''Heavy Wings,'' which appeared during a period of openness in Beijing, '' 'Tell the World' '' has not been published in China.

GORBACHEV WANTS LITHUANIA TO PAY BILLIONS TO SECEDE

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 7

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has demanded that Lithuania pay compensation equivalent to $33 billion if the republic goes ahead with plans to secede from the Soviet Union, Lithuanian officials said today.
Mr. Gorbachev also challenged Lithuania's boundaries for the first time, suggesting that the republic must surrender the major Baltic port city of Klaipeda and other territory before going its own way.
Lithuanians rejected the demands but said Mr. Gorbachev's readiness to begin negotiating the terms of separation was a clear sign that the Kremlin had accepted in principle the republic's right to leave the union.
 
Independence Move Expected
The Lithuanian Parliament has scheduled a meeting Sunday at which it is expected to declare the restoration of the independent nation that existed before the Baltic republics were forcibly annexed by Stalin in 1940. 
In an interview tonight on Lithuanian television, Algirdas Brazauskas, the Lithuanian president and Communist leader, said Mr. Gorbachev had told him that Moscow's financial claims would have to be paid in Western currency rather than Soviet rubles.
''We don't have this kind of hard currency, and to be sure we won't have it for some time,'' Algas Zukas, an aide to Mr. Brazauskas, said in a telephone interview.
The Soviet ruble is nonconvertible -that is, its exchange is strictly controlled by the Government. Western currencies like the American dollar, the Japanese yen and the West German mark are all hard, or convertible - their value is determined by market forces and they can be freely exchanged for other currencies.
It could not be learned what hard currency, if any, the Lithuanians now have. But if they become sovereign, the Lithuanians could conceivably try to borrow from Western banks, countries or international lending agencies.
Mr. Brazauskas, who has generally supported a gradual, negotiated secession, bristled tonight when the television interviewer suggested that he and Mr. Gorbachev were trying to frighten Lithuanians into postponing independence.
 
Argument With Gorbachev
The Lithuanian leader denied that he was trying to slow the process of independence, and reported that he argued with Mr. Gorbachev on several points during the 90-minute meeting.
The Lithuanian leader did not disclose the size of the Soviet leader's financial claims, but in the Lithuanian capital, the Vilnius radio said Mr. Gorbachev presented documents putting the republic's obligations to Moscow at 17 billion rubles for capital investment in the republic and 4 billion rubles for undelivered production.
Lithuanian officials confirmed the sum, which would amount to $33 billion at official exchange rates. [The Lithuanian press agency, Elta, quoted Mr. Brazauskas as saying that the Baltic republic's annual trade with the rest of the Soviet Union amounts to about $13 billion a year, about one-third of its annual national product.] Mr. Gorbachev has also indicated that Moscow wants the republic to pay relocation costs and compensation for any Russians who choose to leave Lithuania.
''Gorbachev said that if Lithuania proclaimed independence, its economic relations with the Soviet Union should be legalized as relations between two independent states, and accounts will have to be settled in freely convertible currency,'' Mr. Zukas said.
 
'No Extreme Measures'
''This can be interpreted as recognition that if independence does come about, no extreme measures will be taken, but relations will be established as between two states,'' the party aide added. ''That is the way we see it.''
Lithuanians demonstrated their support for secession in elections Feb. 24, when the pro-independence movement Sajudis swept the ruling Communist Party from power. Sajudis candidates hold 90 of the 116 seats filled so far in the Lithuanian Parliament.
On Sunday, the Lithuanian Parliament is expected to declare the formal establishment of an autonomous state, and initiate negotiations as equals with the Soviet Government in Moscow on future relations.
The key questions would be removal of more than 30,000 Soviet troops based in the republic, the division of industrial assets, the clarification of boundaries, and financial claims of Russian- or Polish-speaking citizens who want to relocate to Russia.
 
Claims by Lithuania
Moscow's financial claims are disputed by Lithuania, which argues that Soviet investments are offset by Lithuanian claims - including the use of Lithuanian ports and military bases, the right-of-way used to pipe Soviet oil to Eastern Europe, and the compensation for thousands of Lithuanians interned at forced labor or killed after the Red Army occupation, which followed the Soviet-Nazi nonaggression pact of 1939.
Anticipating that Moscow may try to apply economic pressure, economists in the republic have already prepared detailed reports on coping with an economic blockade.
Mr. Zukas said that Mr. Gorbachev had raised the issue of borders, questioning Lithuania's right to at least two cities.
 
Status of Klaipeda
The most contentious element is likely to be the port of Klaipeda, an important base of the Baltic fishing fleet and a center of shipbuilding and electronics.
Historically a German port, Klaipeda, then called Memel, was administered by the Allied Powers after World War I and then given to independent Lithuania. Hitler reclaimed it in March 1939 by threat of force.
The Soviet Union took over the port in 1945, and Mr. Gorbachev now apparently claims that since it was ceded directly to Moscow, it is Soviet, not Lithuanian territory.
''It is asserted that no official documents exist certifying the annexation of Klaipeda to Lithuania,'' Mr. Zukas said. ''that is, Klaipeda is suspended in the air, legally speaking.''
He said one possibility under discussion was to make the port an autonomous zone.
Mr. Gorbachev reportedly also challenged Lithuania's right to Druskininkai, near the Byelorussian border, a spa city famous for its mud baths.

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
In West Germany, Anxiety Over Unity

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAMBURG, West Germany, March 2

 BODY:
In the turbulent debate about German unification, West Germany's intellectuals reflect a national mood of confusion - a profoundly troubled mix of anticipation, anxiety and resentment.
What many of them resent is not only that the rest of the world has reservations about the prospect of one Germany again, after 45 years of partition. They are irritated by the undertone: the suggestion that there are still doubts, even after so long, about the depth and permanence of the West German commitment to peace and democracy.
A united German nation, feeling misunderstood and brooding with resentment about the outside world as it did under the Weimar Republic, would indeed be a repetition of history that none of its neighbors want. But there are internal causes for the confusion, as well - divisions between West German generations, and between the intellectual traditions of the two Germanys. 
 
Writings and Comments
The difficulties are evident from the writings and comments of some leading opinion makers in West Germany that follow.
One of the key factors is the distance that West Germans too young to have experienced or borne responsibility for the Nazi crimes feel toward the horrors of Auschwitz, the Holocaust and World War II.
Few of those under 50 still feel the anguish that Gunter Grass, at 62 probably West Germany's best-known writer, felt in 1945 as a youth of 17, when American soldiers showed him photographs of the piles of spectacles, shorn hair and corpses of the victims of Auschwitz. Insult or Equation? His first reaction, he recently recalled in a lecture given to students at Frankfurt University, was that it couldn't have happened, that Germans couldn't have done this. Later, he said, he knew that Auschwitz could never be forgiven, never be overcome - Germans would bear it like a brand until the end of history.
Auschwitz could not have happened then without a united Germany, he argued, and so Auschwitz forbids German unification now.
Mr. Grass's thesis is part of the intellectual debate, though few West German leaders agree that unification led to Auschwitz. Indeed, some younger writers resent this equation, which they believe is an unstated premise of much of the foreign criticism, as a personal insult. Many young Germans refuse to accept that they have been ''branded.''
Dr. Michael Naumann, the 48-year-old head of the Rowohlt Verlag publishing house in Hamburg, for example, said that during a business trip to New York last month, he found, as he put it, that ''they think we're about to reopen the concentration camps.''
Dr. Naumann, who fled Communism with his part-Jewish mother from Kothen in East Germany when he was 12, in 1953, resented this suggestion from American acquaintances. ''What you are saying is that you, Michael, are just like your father's generation,'' he said.
West Germany's intellectual tradition, unlike East Germany's, did not pretend that nobody alive in West Germany after 1945 had had anything to do with the crimes that had taken place before. Many West German journalists and writers, like their politicians and bureaucrats, did not come pure from emigration like Thomas Mann or Willy Brandt, but had tainted pasts as servants of the Nazi regime - something that has been outraging left-wing West German intellectuals for 40 years.
By its very nature, the ambiguity - and the Federal Republic's commitment to democracy and the European Community -kept the question of responsibility in the air in West Germany.
Indeed, attempts to explain how the same people who had been such good citizens of Europe since 1945 spat on all its values before then and nearly wrecked it forever were a central theme of the first West German postwar books about Hitler.
 
Victory of Open Society
The author of one of the first of these, Joachim C. Fest, now 62 and a co-publisher of the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, is one of those who welcome unification now as the victory of an open German society over a closed one.
But even many West German intellectuals are not sure of how to integrate the East German intellectual tradition into their own. For in the German Democratic Republic, as Monika Maron, a 48-year-old writer from that country wrote recently, the official attitude was that the war crimes were the product of German imperialism.
That did not exist on the soil of the first ''socialist'' state in German history, and therefore East Germans were taught to feel no responsibility for it. Communist ideology may have been idealistic in the early postwar days when leftist writers like Bertolt Brecht found their way back from exile to what was to become East Berlin. But by the mid-1950's, it was totalitarian and Stalinist, and until last fall, East German intellectuals who questioned the official line there were either silenced, imprisoned or expelled.
Mrs. Maron, forbidden to publish in East Germany for 10 years, was allowed to leave two years ago for Hamburg with her husband and her 21-year-old son, Jonas. It is natural, perhaps, that she welcomes unification as a kind of liberation. But many others, in East and West, say they would prefer liberalization in an East German state that remained economically and politically separate from West Germany, in a loose confederation that nobody seems quite able to define.
 
Unification, Not Reunification
Unification (most West German intellectuals prefer that word to ''reunification,'' which they say implies a return to the prewar German state) could, indeed, bring a repetition of history, Dr. Naumann and Mr. Fest both said, though not the one the rest of the world fears.
The Communists who ran and repressed East Germany, they said, would have to be decommunized in a process probably just as fallible and ridden with compromises as denazification was after the war.
In many conversations these days, German intellectuals deplore the current political debate in Bonn about whether to recognize the East German border with Poland, as providing ammunition for those who fear that unification will revive German expansionism in the East.
The debate is a typically German preoccupation with an abstraction that has almost nothing to do with reality, most of them felt. Chancellor Helmut Kohl was playing domestic politics with the question of whether, in legal theory, the prewar German Reich somehow still existed, thus preventing anything short of a reunited Germany from finally renouncing Silesia and Pomerania and East Prussia and the Sudetenland, 45 years after they were lost forever along with the war itself.
The real problems of reunification, some thinkers believe, will come from the effects of nearly half a century of division across not just a wall but a world. West Germans have always felt somewhat guilty about the deprivations and sufferings of their brothers and sisters in the east. Now they feel guilty even when they ask how much unification is going to cost them.
Here are some fragments of writings and conversation with a few of these German voices at a crucial moment in German history. One of them is Werner Hofer, a 76-year-old journalist who ran the country's best known Sunday television talk show until 1987, when questions once again surfaced about his work as a journalist during the war. ''We've become a different people,'' he believes today.
The others include Klaus Harpprecht, a 62-year-old author and former speechwriter for Mr. Brandt whose wife, Renate Lasker Harpprecht, is a survivor of the Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, and Mr. Kohl's predecessor as Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, now 71 years old and co-publisher of the weekly journal Die Zeit.

'We Cannot Get By Auschwitz'
From his lecture ''Writing after Auschwitz,'' delivered Feb. 13 in Frankfurt and Feb. 25 in East Berlin:
When I, like many of my generation, was first confronted with the results of crimes for which Germans were responsible that are summed up by the word Auschwitz, I said: Never.
Even when this 'never' or 'never ever' was destroyed (at the latest, by the Nuremberg trials) . . . it took years until I began to understand: It will never go away; our shame can never be repressed or overcome . . . Auschwitz can never be comprehended, no matter how many explanations surround it.
Auschwitz speaks against even a right of self-determination that is enjoyed by all other peoples, because one of the preconditions for the horror, besides other, older urges, was a strong, united Germany. Not Prussia, not Bavaria, not even Austria, alone, could have developed and carried out the will and the method for organized genocide; it required a united Germany.
We have every reason to be afraid of ourselves as a functioning unity. . . . We cannot get by Auschwitz. We shouldn't even try, as great as the temptation is, because Auschwitz belongs to us, is branded into our history and - to our benefit! - made possible an insight that could be summed up as: Now we finally know ourselves.''
 
Klaus Harpprecht/Writer
 
European Unity: 'The Most Urgent Task'
I was, like everybody else, profoundly moved by what happened in Eastern Europe - I wrote my first book, ''Der Aufstand,'' in 1954 about the workers' uprising on the 17th of June 1953. Our French neighbors in La Croix-Valmer shared the joy, in November and December, but they quickly developed uneasiness when the tempo began to accelerate in December. My barber told me, ''It's beginning to scare me.''
The great problem of a united Germany in the past was that its weight overwhelmed the rest of Europe. Our neighbors wouldn't be quite so upset if the European Community had developed enough authority to counterbalance this fear today. The Warsaw Pact doesn't exist anymore, NATO is weakening as a force capable of providing this kind of order, and the only thing left is the European Community. The most urgent task before us is to accelerate steps toward European unity.
I fear a resurgence of nationalism, and I would rather have had a confederation. It's a tragedy that East German society fell apart like a house of cards so fast. The majority of Germans would have been satisfied with a confederation, but now they've worked themselves into a sort of delirium that disturbs me.
But I don't agree with Gunter Grass that Auschwitz was a consequence of German unity, and have written him to tell him so. Renate, who survived Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, shares this view.
 
Michael Naumann/Book Publisher
 
'The Right of Self-Determination'
My father died in the battle of Stalingrad, but my mother was one-quarter Jewish, and by 1945 the Nazis were beginning to go after people like her. Most of her family immigrated to England or the United States. We stayed in Kothen, in what became East Germany, and in 1953 there was a big workers' revolt and the Communists went looking for scapegoats. This time they weren't looking for the ''race enemy'' but for the ''class enemy.'' Only the names had changed. We left in the middle of the night, I left some food for my fishes, which hurt me very much at the age of 12 at the time, and I really hold the loss of my childhood against the Communists. I have no nostalgia for East Germany.
In February I finally went back, for the first time, and nothing had changed. I had scratched a ''B'' on the wall, and it was still there. The shutters of our house were still painted green. But it wasn't nostalgic - it was filled with horrible memories. I saw the house where Jutta Wolf, the girl I used to play with, lived, but she wasn't there. In 1961, her husband escaped to West Germany, and she got caught when she tried to follow - her three-month old baby was taken away from her and she spent two years in prison, tried to escape and was caught again and spent three more years in prison. For what - trying to rejoin her husband.
Emotionally I was happy not to be a citizen of the same country as Erich Honecker, Hermann Axen, Gunter Mittag and all those Communists - and I assumed reunification would bring us some of the same problems as we had with denazification after the war, another generation of compromisers, political cowards, killers and collaborators. So I don't get excited about reunification, and I don't want to get any of my property back.
But what worries me in the extreme is that abroad, in England, France and America, people will, willingly or unwillingly, prompt a resurgence of the nationalism that people of my generation fought so hard to get rid of. Denying the right of self-determination to Germans is appalling. What you're saying is that you, Michael, are just like your father's generation. I don't trust you - you're the people who started two world wars.
I agree that the neighbors of Germany have a right to fear unification, but their politicians don't have a right to exploit those fears to win votes, the way the leaders of Italy, France and Britain have been doing. In New York, they think we're reopening the concentration camps.''
 
Joachim C. Fest/Newspaper Publisher
 
'A Victory of an Open Society'
In principle, I've always supported Democrats were wrong to write it off and recognize a regime that never even had human rights. I never thought it would collapse so fast, but I'm happy it did. It is a victory of an open society over a closed society, and I'm just as happy about the similar developments in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia as I am about East Germany.
If things could develop more slowly and peacefully, I'd prefer it. But I don't think it's possible. I've been in the G.D.R. three times, and people there say they only have one life to live and they just can't wait. I think we'll have to accept it, even though there could be great problems - Communists have a long tradition of undermining democratic institutions from minority positions. Suppose a core of convinced Communists infiltrates our unions, universities and so on?
As far as the border with Poland is concerned, it's a question in two parts - the political question is solved, nobody's going to change the border. But the juridical one can't be solved until there's a government of a united Germany to declare it's not going to change the border. The expellees who were driven out of the former German territories there don't want any of them back. I was in Breslau (Wroclaw) last summer and saw busloads of the expellees visiting ever day, and I asked them, do you want to come back and live here? And they said, ''No, for God's sake, we just want to look around.'' Let them visit, let them buy houses and even factories if they want to. It's the same as if I wanted to buy a house in Alsace. If I have the money, I can do it and there's no problem - even though there's a border between France and Germany. I hope it can eventually be that way in the East.''
 
Werner Hofer/Former TV Journalist
 
'Who Are Our Enemies Going to Be?'
We have to move fast because if things go on the way they are now, the influx of people from East Germany here will be catastrophic. You already see a kind of ''racism'' about it here. At first, people welcomed the East Germans. Now they say they should stay where they belong. Some people are afraid of losing jobs to them. Others look forward to holding an Olympic Games in Berlin in the year 2000 with a single German team that will win all the gold medals!
The people of the G.D.R. have us to help them. We had help from the Americans, who had thought carefully about what should become of Germany and enabled us to make something of ourselves. We owe our good economic performance to the fact that we lost two wars and had to send all our old plants to France, Britain and the Soviet Union after the last one.
What will be more difficult are the political and military questions. Who are our enemies going to be? Both the Warsaw Pact and NATO are already having trouble justifying themselves. A few weeks ago, here in Cologne, there were rumors that the Belgian army was going to pull out, and there was panic here. Not because of any defense function they perform, but because they provide jobs and because people know them.
I told the child of a friend, a few weeks ago, ''Stefanie, what a fortunate child you are -you and your children will never experience a nuclear war in Europe.'' If it were up to Gorbachev, the Soviets wouldn't have 3,000 soldiers in Europe. But it would be a catastrophe for us Germans, who have brought so many to the rest of the world, if Gorbachev failed now.
 
Helmut Schmidt/Former Chancellor
 
'If the French and the Poles Agree to It'
The real beginning of the Eastern European revolution was in Poland, 10 years ago. They were the pioneers. I told Erich Honecker, back in 1981, ''Why don't you open the borders - let people travel wherever they want,'' and he told me, ''I can't. They won't come back.'' And he was right.
I saw the avalanche coming at the end of August, when it began to be clear that the Hungarians would let all those East German vacationers cross the border and go west. But I never thought it would happen so fast. Now economic unity is already coming about, unofficially. Political, formal unity is a completely different thing, and it could take months, or it could take years. It's not impossible it could be accomplished by the end of this year, though it's rather improbable, I would say.
Where I fault our political leaders is that they haven't taken the feelings of our European neighbors into account. German unification can only be legitimate if the French and the Poles agree to it. Both nations have existed for a thousand years - 800 years longer than the Americans. There will always be a negative attitude in New York to German unification, but it doesn't matter. What really matters now is the soul of the Polish nation and the French nation. The Germans have not gone far enough to calm their concerns.
It was a major mistake not to create the European Monetary System years ago, to really persuade the French that Germany was willing to be a real part of the European system. It was a mistake for Helmut Kohl to just go ahead and announce his proposal for a monetary union with the G.D.R. These things have to have the effect, on the Danes, the Dutch and the Belgians, of making them feel the Germans are already behaving the way we were afraid they would once they were reunited.
But there's no European leadership at all at the moment. Maggie Thatcher is the only outstanding personality, but she's on the wrong wavelength. We need a European Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe, and the European Community leaders should be sitting around and talk about it informally, among themselves. But it isn't happening.
 
Monika Maron/Writer
 
'Germans Are Terribly Anxious'
I left the G.D.R. two years ago, for a three-year period in Hamburg, so I knew something would happen there. But that all the dikes would break at once, that I didn't see coming.
But I've been for unification for some time. It's duality I'm afraid of. When there are two German states, the smaller one can only make itself legitimate by building up some kind of separatist ideology, and we know what that led to.
The first trip I took to West Germany was in 1983, and ever since, it's been harder for me to understand why there were two Germanies than to imagine how there could be one. The Rhine did it. I had been to the Frankfurt Book Fair, and had had too much to eat and drink the night before, and the next morning I was on a train to Wuppertal and opened my eyes and looked out the window and said, 'My God, what is that?' And the other passengers in the compartment said it was the Rhine. I looked out the window at this landscape of river and hills and knew right away it was a thoroughly German landscape - kitschy and sentimental as the thought was. It couldn't be anything else.
Germans are terribly anxious. Maybe it comes from the Thirty Years' War, this irrational love of order and security, because Germany was born out of war and insecurity, and periodically insecurity turns to panic and then the Germans go crazy. Maybe once they become a single state, embedded firmly in a united Europe, they will relax.
I come from a Polish-Jewish family, and my grandfather was killed by the Nazis. My son is German. But he didn't kill my grandfather. And I don't need to be afraid of him.

HEADLINE: U.S. PLANS TO MAKE SWEEPING CHANGES IN LABELS ON FOOD

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
The Bush Administration announced plans today for mandatory nutritional labeling on virtually all packaged foods.
In a speech before a food policy conference, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, said: ''The grocery store has become a Tower of Babel, and consumers need to be linguists, scientists and mind readers to understand the many labels they see. Vital information is missing, and frankly some unfounded health claims are being made.''
He outlined what he called ''a comprehensive reform of the nation's food labeling,'' the first substantial change in nutritional labeling in 17 years, when the current requirements went into effect.

The plan, which would take effect next year after a period of public comment, would require labels with nutritional information on nearly all foods that are meaningful sources of nutrition and make it mandatory to provide more information, including the amounts of saturated fat, fiber and cholesterol, and the calories that come from fat. 
The Food and Drug Administration regulates about $350 billion worth of food sold each year, and about 30 percent of that has mandatory nutritional labeling, which covers the amounts of protein, fat, vitamins and other components. Another 30 percent has been labeled voluntarily. The remaining 40 percent is not labeled.
The changes would affect virtually all of the 20,000 different labels found in the average grocery store.
 
Fruit and Produce Covered
Dr. Sullivan's plan would also give formal definitions for such phrases as ''low fat'' and ''high fiber.'' At present, manufacturers can decide for themselves what is low or high. Under the Administration's proposal, products may be labeled ''no fat'' if they have none, ''low fat'' if they contain less than a certain number of grams of fat, an amount that is being decided, and ''reduced fat'' if they contain substantially less than the fat in similar products.
The proposal would extend the required nutritional information to fresh fruit and produce. This information would not be on the food but on shelves or in booklets available at the store, said Dr. Frank E. Scarbrough, acting director of the F.D.A.'s office of nutrition.
Government and industry officials said that the agency, which regulates food labeling, has the authority to carry out the proposal without action by Congress. But officials for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group for consumers, said legal challenges were possible. But they said none were foreseen.
The plan came only weeks after Dr. Sullivan proposed changes in the rule governing health claims made on packages. The earlier proposal would limit health claims to the few that were scientifically supported. This proposal has been published in The Federal Register for public comment.
The foods that already have mandatory labels are those that have vitamins or other nutrients added to them, as well as products that make some nutritional claims, like a tomato juice cocktail that claims to be high in vitamin C. Among the products now commonly without any nutritional labeling are desserts, ketchup, steak sauce and other condiments and crackers, candy, cookies, salad dressing, olives and pickles.
The proposal was greeted with a variety of cheers and boos from the industry and consumer groups. The National Food Processors Association said it cannot support the proposal because it would not prevent states from making their own tougher rules. John R. Cady, president of the group, said, ''Why can't this country have a single, uniform food labeling system instead of a hodge-podge of conflicting requirements?''
 
Industry in Basic Accord
He said the association is in basic agreement with most parts of Dr. Sullivan's proposal, including mandatory nutritional labels.
Industry has, in recent years, moved from opposing more labeling rules to supporting them or going along with new rules.
One of the reasons for the switch is the discovery by industry that labeling is widely read and heeded by consumers and can become a marketing tool if the product has some nutritional feature, as with adult breakfast cereals. The companies that now carry nutritional labeling have pressed for mandatory labels. ''We'd love mandatory labeling,'' said David J. McDonald, chief executive officer of the Curtice-Burns Food Company, which is affiliated with Agway Inc. ''It's a level playing field.''
Congressional aides who follow the industry also said the companies now recognize that consumer demands for labeling are strong and more regulation is inevitable.
C. Manly Molpus, president of the Grocery Manufacturers of America, put his group's position this way: ''Dr. Sullivan's strong and speedy nutrition labeling program is on the right track, but it is wrong to permit 50 food and drug administrations to label food. We agree that today's consumers deserve a modernized nutrition label, and manufacturers are ready to undertake the enormous task of revising the almost 20,000 food labels found in the average grocery store.''
 
Little Extra Cost Seen
Industry officials said that labels are changed frequently and if the the rule is phased in as planned, little cost would be added. Some minor costs would also be incurred in chemical analysis of foods to produce the label information. But ''we do not consider this a major economic item,'' said Jeffrey I. Nedelman, a spokesman for the grocery manufacturers.
Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, was not in accord with the proposal. ''Congress can do the job better and faster through a change in the law than the Administration can do through a change in regulations,'' he said. ''Congress can make sure the changes are real and not just proposed.''
Mr. Waxman and Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, have proposed bills which would be somewhat tougher in some regards than the Administration's proposal.
Bruce Silverglade, legal director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the proposal is ''an important step forward.'' He saw the situation this way: ''We have been fighting to get information on food labels for years. Now, Secretary Sullivan is staring down the barrels of two bills in Congress, and he would like to act before he is forced to. Unfortunately the Secretary's proposal is years away from being seen on the grocery shelf - it will take longer than he says.''
Mr. Silverglade said he would prefer the somewhat tougher rules in the Congressional bills over the Adminisration's proposal.
Ellen Haas, the executive director of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a consumer group, said of the proposal: ''We have been here before. In 1979 we had proposals. But we've not seen them implemented. This proposal will not get us out of the minefield either. We need action much faster than he is suggesting - the process could take three years.''
Dr. Sullivan said the mandatory labeling is especially important because recent studies have shown that the American consumer's chief source of information about nutrition and foods is the food package.
Along with adding saturated fats, cholesterol and fiber to labels, Dr. Sullivan also suggested removing from the label less important items like thiamine, riboflavin and niacin and the percent of the recommended daily allowance of protein. F.D.A. officials said these were listed only because disorders result if not enough of the minerals are in the diet, but the disorders are extremely rare.
Also, the proposal will make some rules to standardize the ''serving size'' on labels. Some companies now reduce serving size to make a product seem to have fewer calories and more nutritional value, Dr. Scarbrough said.

HEADLINE: Cuba Says It Is Ending Military Aid to Nicaragua

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 7

 BODY:
President Fidel Castro of Cuba said today that he is cutting off all military aid to Nicaragua before the new government takes office there next month, according to Cuba's official press agency, Prensa Latina.
Prensa Latina, monitored in Mexico City, quoted Mr. Castro as saying that Cuban assistance in housing construction and health care could continue if the new government desires. 
Mr. Castro had close relations with Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government, which governed Nicaragua for a decade. Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and her 14-party opposition coalition easily defeated President Daniel Ortega Saavedra in Feb. 25 general elections. Mrs. Chamorro, who was strongly backed by Washington, is to take office as president on April 25.
Mr. Castro blamed the United States and world developments for the Sandinista loss.
Mr. Castro was quoted as calling the elections ''a challenge accepted by the Sandinistas in adverse conditions, amid a dirty war imposed by the United States and an economic crisis generated by the U.S. blockade.
''The elections took place a few weeks after the fall of socialist governments'' in Eastern Europe, he added, ''and the Sandinistas had to make many concessions and made mistakes.''
Exact figures on Cuban military aid have never been announced by the Havana or Managua governments. However, the State Department said in a report last year that Moscow provided about $500 million in military aid to Nicaragua in 1988.
The Soviet Union has since said it would stop military aid to Nicaragua.

HEADLINE: UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST;
Congress, Hoping to Aid New Democracies, Finds Itself Shackled by Budget

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
As democracy blooms in capitals from Managua to Prague, policy makers in Washington are struggling to muster the foreign aid dollars and the political will to bolster a new world order.
But they are faced with three politically unattractive choices: Enlarge the foreign aid budget at the expense of domestic programs; cut aid to current recipients to make room for new ones, or accept a greatly diminished role for the United States in shaping events abroad. Many in Congress fear that the third choice is being made by default.
''I'm embarrassed as an American when I see our inability to address these issues,'' said Representative Dave McCurdy, a Democrat from Oklahoma who serves on the House Intelligence Committee. ''There is a growing sense of powerlessness here because of the incredible bind we are in with the budget.'' 
 
Shortfall Even Before Nicaragua
Foreign aid spending, which will amount to $14.6 billion this year, accounts for only 1 percent of the $1.2 trillion Federal budget. And the Congressional committees that dole it out complained about serious shortfalls long before Nicaragua joined the growing appeals for assistance in moving from Communism to democracy.
But spending abroad has rarely been a high priority in Congress, particularly when pressure to reduce the budget deficit has squeezed many popular domestic programs.
Now some internationally minded lawmakers watch in frustration and even bitterness as prosperous allies like Japan and West Germany plunge ahead with government and private assistance for Eastern Europe while the domestic budget crisis sidelines the United States. ''They lectured us about our deficits while we were paying their defense costs,'' said Representative Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, the senior Republican on the House subcommittee that oversees foreign aid.
Some in Congress look to anticipated savings in the military budget as the solution to the foreign aid problem, but Mr. Edwards, in a view echoed by Democrats as well as Republicans, is skeptical. He cites the pent-up demand for domestic spending.
 
'You Can't Blame People'
''While the politics may have changed in Central America and Central Europe, they haven't changed in central Oklahoma or central Iowa,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''You can't blame people outside the Washington Beltway who say that if there is going to be a peace dividend, we ought to be using it to rebuild our own highways.''
The House Majority Leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, gave partisan voice to that frustration on Tuesday in a speech blasting President Bush for lacking ''either the vision to know what steps we must take, or the courage to take them.''
Last year, as Poland and Hungary became the first Eastern European countries to break Soviet ties, Congress used creative accounting to scrape together a modest assistance package. But this year, with new demands in Panama, new opportunites to nurture free-market economies throughout Eastern Europe and new promises by the Bush Administration to combat drug production and trafficking in Latin America, the options for money shuffling have been exhausted.
Democrats and Republicans who serve on the foreign-aid committees doubt that the United States can honor existing commitments, let alone undertake new ones. They have pledged a review of current aid allotments, raising the possibility of cutbacks for major recipients like Israel, Egypt, Turkey, the Philippines and Pakistan.
''We are overpromised and underfunded and there are going to be some very red faces,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who heads the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations. The most glaring example, he said, is the $500 million in immediate aid that the Administration has promised Panama.
 
'$10 Million in Wiggle Room'
''The fact is, aid for Panama is not going to be anywhere near $500 million,'' Mr. Leahy said. ''And if you look at the Administration's request for Eastern Europe, there is all of $10 million in wiggle room to cover Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania and Bulgaria. The paperwork alone will eat that up.''
Senator Robert W. Kasten Jr. of Wisconsin, Mr. Leahy's Republican counterpart on the foreign operations panel, pointed to the tempest last month when members outside the foreign-policy committees learned that the first small portion of Panama aid would be financed by taking money allotted for the Sudan and Somalia. The plan was approved only after Congressional leaders promised that they would find a way to replace the money for Africa in the 1991 budget.
''Panama was the end,'' Mr. Kasten said. ''We've gone as far as we can go playing off one region against each other.''
Mr. Kasten favors an increase in the foreign aid budget, a position that puts him at odds with some of his party colleagues. Republicans, heretofore skeptical about the value of foreign aid programs in general, have been increasingly vocal in warning that American influence abroad is threatened unless the foreign aid pie is enlarged.
 
General Tax Increase Ruled Out
In hearings on Capitol Hill last week, a number of Republicans made that clear to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d as he outlined the modest increases the Administration is seeking in the fiscal 1991 foreign aid budget. Mr. Baker said he was open to suggestions, but added that the Administration was not prepared to see a general tax increase to expand foreign aid.
''I know you're not used to having people considered to be on the right of this committee say we should enlarge the foreign aid budget,'' Representative Jerry Lewis, a conservative California Republican, told the Secretary when he appeared before the House Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations.
''If we can't use this opportunity to raise the level of contributions generally, then we are missing an important bet,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''I don't know where we go from here.''
Mr. Baker got precisely the opposite message at another House hearing today when Democrats on a panel that oversees domestic programs complained that the United States was spending too much abroad and neglecting important priorities at home.
Senator Robert C. Byrd, the West Virginia Democrat who heads the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Federal dollars are not the only means of asserting American influence abroad.
''The American entrepreneur needs to get in on the ground floor,'' he said. ''Surely the American businessman is as ingenious as the German or Japanese businessman.''
Representative Silvio O. Conte of Massachusetts, the senior Republican on the House Approriations Committee, urged Mr. Baker and the Administration to go back to the drawing board on foreign aid and find the kind of vision that inspired the authors of the Marshall Plan at the end of World War II. Alluding to Vaclav Havel, the Czechoslovak President and playwright who addressed a joint meeting of Congress last month, Mr. Conte said, ''If you need help, go back and read the speech from that playwright.''

HEADLINE: Bush Says Inadequate Financing Imperils Transportation System

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7

 BODY:
President Bush will announce a transportation policy on Thursday declaring that the nation's economy is ''at risk'' because of inadequate investment in public works projects, but seeking to minimize Federal subsidies for transportation.
''The transportation infrastructure is vital to the nation's economy,'' said a final draft of the report. ''There are increasing signs, however, that the system is beginning to break down. We cannot afford inadequate, inefficient transportation.'' 
But, as expected, the Administration's new policy does not promise a blank check to be drawn against the Treasury. It presents a broad outline of transportation programs, without naming individual projects that should be completed or estimating exact costs.
A major element of the policy is a renewal of Federal highway aid programs for the next five years, but the policy seeks to focus Federal spending on highways of national significance while increasing the states' responsibility for other projects.
 
Revenue Sources
To the extent that highway, aviation and rail programs are of national importance and should be controlled by the Federal Government, the document says, they must be financed by fees paid by their users. To the extent that transportation is more local or regional, the burden should be shifted to state and local governments.
The report suggests revenue sources like increased state gasoline taxes, local airport passenger taxes, highway tolls, Federal charges on shipping and boating to help pay for Coast Guard activities, and private investment.
The document makes no estimate of the amount of spending that is needed. Outside experts in recent years have repeatedly called for doubling both state and Federal spending on transportation.
The Administration's policy statement calls for a more flexible approach to Federal transportation aid, allowing states and localities to tailor their use of Federal money to meet the most urgent needs.
Such flexibility, it says, will improve the connections between various forms of transportation, linking railroads and subways to airports and highways in a manner that has not always been accomplished because each form of transportation is supervised by a separate bureaucracy in Washington.
 
Maintenance Needs
In general, it says, the shortage of Federal money for transportation means that priority must be given to maintaining existing transportation arteries rather than building new ones.
But the statement calls for insuring ''that essential new capacity is provided in transportation systems of national significance to meet critical national needs.'' In some cases, it says, the Federal Government should act now to acquire or preserve corridors for future development. It did not give specific examples.
Whether the Administration's approach is eventually adopted depends in large measure on the outcome of legislation extending and renewing aviation and highways programs. Debate on both bills has just begun in Congress and will take months to complete.
The document does not explicitly address a chief issue that is already being debated in Congress: how quickly to spend money from existing transportation taxes and fees and held in special trust funds for aviation and surface transportation. If the money is spent more quickly without increasing the fees, the budget deficit increases.
The policy says simply that the Government should ''spend transportation trust fund balances over time in a fiscally responsible way.''
Many aspects of the Administration's new policy have been revealed in recent weeks in its latest budget request and in speeches by senior officials.
 
Encountering Resistance
Development of the policy has been the top priority of Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, who wanted a single plan that would unify Federal measures governing diverse forms of transportation.
But Mr. Skinner ran into some resistance from other economic policy makers, who insisted that the document not include major conclusions about how much money should be spent.
The policy calls for an increased Federal role in transportation research and development. It cites as examples the need for research into high-speed railroad systems for trips of 100 to 500 miles, and the promise of new computer technologies that in a few decades might permit ''intelligent'' automobile and highway systems.
Groups involved in transportation welcomed parts of the plan, but decried others.
The American Trucking Associations welcomed the efforts to focus Federal highway aid on roads of ''national significance.'' And the group lauded the Administration's insistence on accomplishing its program without raising Federal fuel taxes.
But the trucking lobby objected to the plan's strong support of highway tolls to finance projects.
The American Public Transit Association, which represents state and local mass transit groups, objected to the Administration's insistence that cities and states should bear most of the costs of public transit.

HEADLINE: St. Louis Paper's Staff Bars Use of Bylines

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, March 7

 BODY:
All but three of the reporters, photographers and artists at The St. Louis Post-Dispatch withheld their names from items published today as their union stepped up pressure in a contract dispute.
The byline strike, the first in the Newspaper Guild's 56 years at the flagship paper of the Pultizer Publishing Company, is scheduled to continue until a new contract is signed. The guild, which represents about 620 news, advertising and circulation employees, has been operating under a contract that expired Feb. 28.
Negotiations are focusing mainly on broader management rights and a wage system in which less-experienced employees would be paid at lower rates than others.
The guild also wants a cost-of-living raise that would match inflation; management has offered a onetime 3 percent pay increase. The top basic wage for reporters is $830 a week. Talks are to resume Thursday.
Union leaders say they will begin distributing leaflets in mid-March describing their position to customers and major advertisers. Herbert L. Goodrick, executive secretary of Local 45 of the St. Louis Newspaper Guild, said the next step, asking people not to buy the paper, would start before the end of the month. Last fall, guild members authorized a strike, but they will vote again before walking out.

HEADLINE: Clean Fuels, Clean Air

BYLINE: By Timothy E. Wirth; Timothy E. Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, is a member of the Senate Energy Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As the Senate votes this week on proposals for amending the Clean Air Act, Americans' health and environment are on the line. If they are to be protected, the Senate must make long-overdue choices about fuels to be burned in cars and trucks.
The nation has fought a losing battle against urban smog since 1970. Deadlines for meeting Federal health standards have been missed repeatedly, despite local governments' use of every strategy available to meet them. The casualty list includes more than 100 major urban areas with unhealthy levels of air pollution and tens of billions of dollars of avoidable health costs. 
The single biggest culprit is the gasoline-fueled car. Standards enacted by Congress in 1977 have made new vehicles cleaner, but each year Americans buy more cars and drive more miles. These increases in vehicle miles traveled force polluted cities to run hard simply to stay in place, let alone make progress toward reducing air pollution.
There is just one way to escape this treadmill. We must break our addiction to today's high-polluting gasoline and take advantage of new clean-burning fuels. As President Bush said, we must ''reconcile the automobile to the environment.''
That's what Mr. Bush proposed when he introduced his clean air bill last summer. Its centerpiece was a mandate for the production of a million clean-fuel vehicles yearly by 1997. William Reilly, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, called this program ''the most innovative and far-reaching'' component of the bill.
New, proven technologies are already producing vehicles that run on low-polluting natural gas, ethanol and methanol. By early in the next century, nearly pollution-free vehicles powered by hydrogen, electricity and solar power should be available.
Clean fuels are good for the environment and the economy, and would enhance national security by reducing our dependence on foreign oil. We can reformulate gasoline to make it burn more cleanly, by replacing some imported oil with domestically produced alcohols and ethers, such as ethyl tertiary butyl ether, made from corn, wheat, barley and other crops. This shift would open up major new markets for our farmers, and it could save taxpayers millions of dollars in farm-price supports.
Domestically produced natural gas, a clean-burning fuel, can also be turned into methanol. The use of these fuels not only would displace foreign oils but also give a much-needed shot in the arm to domestic gas producers in Louisiana and the West.
Unfortunately, during recent closed-door negotiations on clean air in the Senate, oil and auto companies made quick work of the President's original proposal.
Aside from a very limited program for certain Federal and commercial fleets, the Senate compromise does not provide for a new generation of vehicles using natural gas, ethanol, methanol or electricity.
I hope the Senate will breathe new life into the President's original vision and put a strong clean-fuels program back in the Clean Air Act amendments.
Building on the Bush initiative, a successful clean-fuels program should have three central elements:
The first is to require that reformulated, clean-burning gasoline be sold in our most polluted cities. (It can be used in any car, no matter how old.) The second is a program calling for large commercial fleets to begin using special super-clean fuels like natural gas and methanol in the mid-1990's. Fleet vehicles - taxis, garbage trucks, delivery vans - travel twice as many miles as private vehicles; thus they offer a cost-effective target for emission reductions. Since they are centrally fueled, they can be more easily converted to new fuels.
The third element is a program calling for these same special super-clean fuels to be used in passenger cars beginning in the late 1990's.
Congress must look beyond the auto and oil industries' preoccupation with the next quarter's profits. The Senate cannot afford to squander this opportunity.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Cheney vs. Webster

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
Does the right hand of the Bush Administration know what the left hand is doing? Not, apparently, on the crucial questions of what's happening, and likely to happen, in the Communist world, and therefore on how the U.S. should respond.
William Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence, told the House Armed Services Committee last week that the startling political upheavals in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ''are probably already irreversible in several critical respects.''
Even if reactionary forces within the Soviet Union should overthrow Mikhail Gorbachev, Mr. Webster asserted, the new regime would be preoccupied with the same internal economic and political problems that face Mr. Gorbachev. Thus, it ''would have little incentive to engage in major confrontations'' with the U.S.
These welcome words - unclassified and offered in public testimony - were hardly out of the Director's mouth before Dick Cheney, the self-described ''hard-liner'' who is Secretary of Defense, offered a diametrically opposite view. Testifying on the same day to another committee, he said that the changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union could be quickly reversed, whether or not Mr. Gorbachev survived. 
Mr. Webster's testimony - in the opinion of Les Aspin, chairman of the Armed Services Committee - ''fundamentally altered'' debate on the 1991 defense budget by supporting the view that ''a new day is here requiring new thinking about defense.''
Mr. Cheney, however, holds strongly to the belief stated in his budget proposal that the Soviet military threat could be revived quickly, and therefore the U.S. ''must be prepared to remain in long-term competition.''
The difference, in the largest sense, may be immeasurable. Immediately, and in dollars, it lies between the Administration's proposed $303 billion military budget for 1991, a $293 billion counterproposal that represents the views of Mr. Aspin and Speaker Thomas Foley, and a $289 billion plan backed by liberal members of the Armed Services Committee.
Mr. Cheney's objection appeared to be less to the substance of Mr. Webster's argument than to his open statement of it. Asked in a television interview if the C.I.A. Director was wrong, Mr. Cheney said: ''I think so, but of course you don't know.'' But he added that ''there's no question but what it would be easier for me, in terms of getting Congressional approval of the budget that the President sent up [if] there were a little more restraint in [Mr. Webster's] statements.''
The Defense Secretary is on dubious ground if, as it appears, he wants the Director of Central Intelligence to tailor his views to the political needs of the Bush military budget, or even to keep silent when to speak might be damaging. The Director's writ is to develop accurate and unbiased information to present to the Administration's policy makers - not to shape or suppress intelligence to support policy, much less politics.
That's why it often has been argued in this space and elsewhere that the C.I.A. director ought to have a specific term of office, rather than serving at the pleasure of the President. That's also why covert operations, if any, ought not to be conducted by the intelligence-gathering agency since covert operations are efforts -rarely successful - to carry out a President's policy.
In the Webster-Cheney conflict, what's of more immediate concern is the suggestion that the Bush Administration has no clear attitude on which to base policy about what may be the most important question facing it; or - worse - is unwilling honestly to face the consequences of its judgment.
Mr. Cheney said that ''I accurately reflect the President's views'' on military spending, and surely Mr. Bush did approve his own military budget. Mr. Webster's statement, however, was cleared in advance by James Baker, the Secretary of State, and by the White House. Marlin Fitzwater, the President's press spokesman, contended that the opposing views were ''not mutually exclusive but indeed give us a good picture of the problem.''
That's all right for debate within the Cabinet or the National Security Council but not for two high officials testifying publicly before different Congressional committees. And it raises the question whether Mr. Bush has put up a budget that surrenders to pressures for jobs and defense spending, or one that reflects the international realities accepted by his Secretary of State and his primary intelligence adviser.

HEADLINE: Move Over Ivana And Don, Here's Ed and Felix

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
rrMoney. Power. A love-hate triangle. Angry recriminations over previous agreements on how to divide shared assets. Years of muffled resentment finally exploding into an unseemly public affair.
Felix G. Rohatyn and Edward I. Koch are becoming the Donald and Ivana Trump of municipal government. 
New Yorkers have been treated to a sideshow: seemingly, the chic shot vs. the cheap shot. Ostensibly the exchanges between Mr. Rohatyn, the investment banker and chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, and Mr. Koch, the former mayor, revived a debate over historical footnotes:
How instrumental was Mr. Koch in New York City's recovery from the fiscal crisis he inherited in 1978? Did Mr. Rohatyn, an appointee of the governor, usurp a prerogative of elected officials by denying them billions of dollars until they embraced his vision of how to spend it?
But the vehemence with which the debate has occurred reflects present realities as much as conflicting interpretations of the past.
New York's gloomy fiscal prognosis and the advent of a new administration - one that Mr. Rohatyn voted for and publicly helped into City Hall - herald his potential resurgence as an even more pivotal figure in public finance.
For Mr. Koch, his defeat by David N. Dinkins bestowed a freedom that means nothing left to lose, except his record as mayor. When aspects of that record were questioned again by Mr. Rohatyn in the magazine 7 Days, Mr. Koch became livid. After years of uncharacteristic restraint in responding to a man regarded by many as a sacred cow, an unfettered Mr. Koch finally demanded, where's the beef?
Mr. Koch, no longer cowed, branded Mr. Rohatyn an imperious ''Robert Moses of municipal finance'' who parlayed his reputation at the M.A.C., which was created to borrow in the city's behalf, into hefty fees.
So, who saved the city? Mr. Rohatyn credits former Gov.
Hugh L. Carey, but has always cited Mr. Koch's contribution. Mr. Koch describes himself as ''the orchestra leader while Felix was one of the violin players,'' (prompting Harrison J. Goldin, the former city comptroller to cast Mr. Rohatyn instead as lead baritone because ''one was not second fiddle to the other'').
Who controlled the M.A.C.'s surpluses? Mr. Rohatyn, in concert with the Governor - this time Mario M. Cuomo - and the acquiesence of Mr. Koch.
''It was perfectly obvious that politically we could not make any unilateral decisions,'' Mr. Rohatyn said.
''Felix couldn't do it without my consent,'' Mr. Koch recalled. ''I couldn't get the money without his agreement.''
Mr. Rohatyn's priorities were housing, mass transit and schools. Without denigrating those goals, city officials preferred to spend the money as they saw fit.
''It has the sound of populist rhetoric: 'Who needs these trustees? Let's get our hands on the money,' '' Mr. Rohatyn said. ''The repercussions for New York's credit rating could be disastrous.''
About half of nearly $2 billion disbursed so far was pumped into the city's operating budget and an economic development grab bag; much of the rest was invested in Mr. Rohatyn's agenda.
Did Mr. Koch's expansion of wages and the work force contribute to the latest crunch, as Mr. Rohatyn suggested? Hardly, Mr. Koch says. Meanwhile, he wonders why Mr. Rohatyn has not chided the Dinkins administration for its plan to use $150 million in one-time revenues from the sale of bonds by the Battery Park City Authority to meet current expenses. Mr. Rohatyn said he intends to; so does Edward V. Regan, the State Comptroller.
Did Mr. Rohatyn capitalize on his public position? He was a promiment investment banker before he volunteered to help the city. He declined profits from business his firm did with the city or state. But he bristled at Mr. Koch's suggestion that the firm reveal its municipal finance clients (among the clients Mr. Koch solicited for his new law firm was Mr. Rohatyn).
''The only difference between me and other public officials is that I don't take money and I'm independent,'' Mr. Rohatyn said. If the Governor or editorial writers no longer value his services, he said, ''I'm gone.''
By Tuesday, Mr. Koch invited Mr. Rohatyn to lunch. Mr. Rohatyn declined. Mr. Koch said he will not pursue the debate further.
''I'm a columnist, not a government official,'' he said. ''I raise the problems; I don't have to solve them.''
Nor does he have to stifle feelings about people who, by his standard, he treated gingerly as mayor. Are there others besides Mr. Rohatyn? Yes, Mr. Koch said, two: Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Trump.

HEADLINE: Tax Cuts for Corporations Burden a School System

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORTH TARRYTOWN, N.Y.

 BODY:
For much of this century, the General Motors factory here has been the bedrock of North Tarrytown's tax base. But now changes in the business world that have driven corporations to cut costs aggressively have come home to this Hudson River village.
Big tax cuts won by General Motors here and by two companies in neighboring Tarrytown are forcing residents to decide whether to make painful cuts in their joint school system, the Union Free School District of the Tarrytowns, or shoulder a sharp tax increase.
Towns and cities across the country have long pursued businesses as a way to expand their property-tax base and ease the burden on residents. But many communities, like Tarrytown and North Tarrytown, are now watching that base erode as corporations increasingly challenge their tax assessments in court. 
''Large companies had for a long time adopted a good-neighbor policy in which they looked the other way, knowing full well they were being overassessed,'' said Joseph T. Pierson, the director of public information for the State Division of Equalization and Assessment.
''Somewhere along the way the competition became so great that the bottom line is now more important than community spirit.''
Here, in successive legal challenges beginning in the early 1980's, G.M., the Technicon Instruments Corporation and, last month, the Consolidated Edison Company, emerged with their local tax burdens greatly reduced. In the largest case, G.M. cut its annual school tax by a third, or by about $1 million.
This year those tax reductions, combined with the loss of an additional $800,000 in state aid and other revenue, have led school officials to present residents with two unsavory prospects for a budget next year.
In one, spending would be frozen at this year's $21.7 million, more than a fifth of the staff would be laid off, many courses, clubs and athletic programs would be canceled, and school taxes would still rise by about 5 percent.
In the second, the district would keep all programs, but the tax increase would be 16 percent.
Last year, before a crisis developed, voters rejected a budget requiring a 5 percent tax increase. The same budget was adopted in a second referendum.
School officials hope to avoid most of the cuts and tax increase by asking G.M. for an advance on taxes that will come due later this decade.
 
Settlement in '85
''We're not asking for a handout or even a loan,'' said the Superintendent of Schools, H. Murray Blueglass. ''If G.M. gives us $2 million a year, we will credit that to their future tax payments. It's negotiable. We just want the opportunity to talk.''
Under a tax settlement reached by local officials and General Motors in 1985, the company is paying $1.9 million a year to the school district in lieu of taxes until 1995. G.M., which has a sprawling assembly plant on the Hudson River here, had been paying about $2.9 million a year in taxes.
When G.M. returns to the tax rolls, school officials estimate, the company will pay somewhere between $6 million and $10 million a year in school taxes. Their prediction is based on the steady rise in taxes and on two large additions to the G.M. plant: an elaborate paint shop and a railroad connection.
Mr. Blueglass has sent a three-page letter to the chairman of G.M., Roger B. Smith, outlining his idea for a tax advance and is asking Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to use his power of persuasion on Mr. Smith.
A spokeswoman for General Motors in Detroit, Paula Powell, said, ''We received the letter, and we are reviewing it.''
G.M., which has contested tax assessments on its plants across the country in recent years, brought its challenge against North Tarrytown in 1981. #4,000 Employees ''We feel it is our fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders to make sure that we're paying no more in taxes than we ought to be,'' Mrs. Powell said. ''We want to remain competitive.'' Local officials say they were pressured by the state to settle a pending tax claim to help keep open the G.M. plant, which employs 4,000 people. After months of negotiations with New York, the company agreed in 1985 to keep the plant in operation; the local tax reductions were an important part of a package of incentives.
''If we had said 'no' to the settlement and chose to go to court instead, we would have had the Governor and everybody else saying that we weren't being a good community member,'' Mr. Blueglass said. The tax reductions - both G.M.'s and more recent ones - have done the most damage to the 1,759-student district.
Other losses have come from a proposed cut of $200,000 in state aid for next year, in line with proposed cuts throughout Westchester County; the loss of about 15 students from outside the district who were paying about $8,500 a year in tuition, and the lack of a surplus. In previous years, surpluses of around $400,000 were used to offset tax increases.
Administrators must decide what to do before a May 9 budget referendum.
Last Wednesday at noon, dozens of students left Sleepy Hollow High School to run a relay to Albany to deliver a written plea for help to Mr. Cuomo the following morning.
 
Letters and Speeches
''A bunch of students are running 140 miles in the winter for their education,'' said Jim Harmon, the Student Council president. ''That should speak strongly.''
Parents have sent hundreds of letters to their legislators, asking for help. And they filled the high school auditorium one night last week for a school board meeting. Some made impassioned speeches about the need to preserve the school system, at whatever cost. Others appealed to the board to control taxes, regardless of the damage.
''With the proposed budget cuts as they now stand, we might as well rename our school district the Union Free Warehouse of the Tarrytowns, because that's what it will be,'' said Dr. Carin Rubenstein, a psychologist and a member of Save Our Schools, a parents group.
Another parent, Michael Arnold, a bank economist, said: ''I, for one, am for paying significantly higher taxes next year. I don't want to see a thing cut from the program, and I know that many of my neighbors feel the same way.''
 
'Sustain the System'
But Dr. Richard C. Sweet, a chemist from North Tarrytown with two grandchildren in the school district, urged the board to spare taxpayers.
''There will be a school system next year even if we take the most severe cuts,'' he said. ''The taxpayers have been hit with tax increases every year, and enough is enough. Let's return to the 3 R's and sustain the system with the resources we have.''
In addition to G.M.'s tax victory, Technicon Instruments went to court challenging its taxes, and last spring the State Court of Appeals ordered the school district to refund about $1.2 million in back taxes to the maker of medical equipment. The court also reduced the company's assessment, and the district's future revenues.
In January a state court approved a settlement between the State of New York and Consolidated Edison that reduces the state's assessment of special ''franchise'' property - mainly gas pipes and wires - in New York City and Westchester County. Con Edison's assessment in Tarrytown is to fall by $872,000; because the assessments in the village represent roughly 10 percent of full market value, that loss is equivalent to the loss of more than 20 $400,000 houses.
The budget crisis here comes after a decade of improvements to the school system, which is 40 percent Hispanic and 12 percent black, and many parents are afraid that the gains will be undermined. The dropout rate has fallen to 4.5 percent from 15 percent. Standardized test scores in math and English are up, along with student and staff morale.
''Here's an example of a district where public education is really working,'' said Julie Anello of North Tarrytown, an artist and mother of three, ''where kids who go to Ivy League schools and kids who go to vocational schools are all being educated together and very well. ''It's absurd that for lack of something as paltry as $2 million, this school system might go down the drain.''

HEADLINE: $445 Million Increase in Phone Rates Is Rejected

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 7

 BODY:
The Public Service Commission today rejected a $445 million request for higher telephone rates that had come under heavy political criticism because it was negotiated between the New York Telephone Company and the commission's staff rather than through the usual process of public hearings.
Although legislators and consumer advocates declared the decision a victory for customers, several commissioners on the panel predicted that the company would ultimately win a rate increase this year, perhaps even larger than the one negotiated.
''I'm far from sure that the outcome will be better for consumers,'' said Peter A. Bradford, the chairman of the commission.
Four of the commission's seven members, including Mr. Bradford, said they had rejected the settlement. Three said they had supported the agreement or a modified version of it. $900 Million Filing Planned A spokesman for New York Telephone, Peter Muller, said the company now planned to file a rate increase request for at least $900 million a year beginning in 1991, when a four-year moratorium on telephone rate increases expires. The increase rejected today also would have taken effect next January. 
The $445 million negotiated increase would have raised New York Telephone revenues by about 6 percent, and the average monthly bill for local telephone service would have increased to $34.56 from $30.90, Mr. Muller said.
A company statement expressed disappointment in today's ruling, saying ''the agreement would have provided economic certainty for the customer and the company, as well as certain other customer benefits, such as modernizing the network.''
The decision had repercussions on Wall Street, where the Nynex Corporation, New York Telephone's parent, saw its stock slip from an opening price of $83.75 a share to $80.50 at closing. The New York Stock Exchange suspended trading of the stock for 2 hours 40 minutes this morning as news of the decision arrived from Albany.
 
Settlement Process Questioned
The commission's ruling, like the heated debate that preceded it, had less to do with the size of the proposed rate increase than with the process by which it was reached.
In rejecting the settlement, which was negotiated in December, the commission followed the recommendations of an administrative law judge, the State Attorney General, the director of the State Consumer Protection Board and Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, who appointed a task force last month to investigate ''secret settlements'' in utility rate cases.
Those officials argued that it was improper for the P.S.C. to grant a large rate increase based on negotiations with a utility rather than on the full series of public hearings and investigations that normally accompany rate cases.
Mr. Bradford stressed that today's decision should not be interpreted as a signal that the commission will no longer approve negotiated settlements. He said the New York Telephone case was unique because of time pressure created by a strike last autumn by Nynex workers and because of questions about Nynex sales practices.
 
Nynex Under Investigation
The company has been investigated by state and Federal regulators for reaping large profits by using an unregulated subsidiary, the Materiel Enterprises Company, to sell a variety of goods and services to New York Telephone. The settlement negotiated between the commission and New York Telephone would have ended the commission's investigation of the sales practices while accounting for the reported overpayments by determining the size of the rate increase.
Attorney General Robert Abrams, who called the sales practices ''incredible financial chicanery,'' asked the commissioners during a hearing on Tuesday to ''send a signal that back-room bargaining will not be tolerated.''
The commissioners clearly chafed at the pressure from elected officials. Mr. Bradford called the lobbying efforts ''perilous and counterproductive'' and said a line should be drawn between the Legislature's right to oversee the commission's conduct and its responsibility to insulate the commission from politics.

HEADLINE: PARENT & CHILD

BYLINE: By Lawrence Kutner

 BODY:
STUDENTS who work a small number of hours during the school year or reasonable hours over the summer may show some academic and social gains, according to surveys of high school seniors conducted by the University of Michigan.
Through his first job last summer, when he was 15 years old, Owen Grover had the opportunity to supervise younger children as a counselor at a day camp run by the recreation department of his hometown, West Orange, N.J.
''It made him feel quite grown up and mature, and maybe a little powerful,'' said his mother, Andrea Grover. ''His older brother had worked for his father when he was 16, but Owen preferred to work for someone else. He didn't want to be dependent on his father to take him to work.''
Finding and getting that first job outside the home can be a landmark for adolescents. It is an event that clearly differentiates them from their younger siblings and schoolmates. It is often the first formal acknowledgement by adults outside their family and school that something they know or can do has value in the adult world. 
''For a child who's having difficulty in school, this may be an opportunity to succeed,'' said Dr. Charles L. Thompson, a professor of educational and counseling psychology at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. He said his youngest child, who has learning disabilities, felt much happier once she could hold a part-time job.
''It can help them feel good about themselves, perhaps for the first time in a long while,'' he said.
But the symbolic importance of this rite of passage, combined with teen-agers' inexperience with employers and job interviews, means that for many adolescents, finding a first job can be confusing or even frightening.
''It puts your child's self-esteem on the line,'' said Dr. Richard M. Ryan, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Rochester who studies how parents motivate their children. He said he had seen many adolescents who delay applying for jobs because they feel uncomfortable with the process and worry how they will be perceived.
In addition, many teen-agers have misconceptions about what prospective employers expect from them. Dr. Linda Dunlap, an assistant professor of psychology at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., recently spoke about jobs to a gathering of 15- and 16-year-old high school students.
''Some of them thought they had to show up for a job interview in a three-piece suit and carrying a briefcase for an entry-level job,'' she said. ''Another set of kids thought they could show up like they just walked in off the beach. Most of the kids were at one end of the continuum or the other.''
Although it may feel as if you are doing your child a favor by using your influence to arrange for a job, developmental psychologists caution against it. In many ways, the process of thinking about and searching for a job is at least as important to the child's self-concept as the work itself. The sometimes awkward attempts to figure out where to apply and the daydreaming about how they will spend the money from their paychecks help teen-agers try their new and more adult self-images on for size.
''The child who finds his own job will usually have a much greater sense of accomplishment,'' said Dr. Robert B. Brooks, the director of child psychology training at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., and an assistant professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School. In most cases, he said, parents should take a supporting role in the process.
''If the parent gets the job for the child, that denies the child's need to try out his new sense of independence and competence,'' Dr. Brooks said. One way for teen-agers to express their independence is the way they spend their paychecks. As with allowances, which many child development experts say should continue while children have part-time or summer jobs, a paycheck allows teen-agers to work on money-management skills under the guidance but not the control of their parents. For some teen-agers, the sudden influx of money from a job gives them a distorted sense of personal economics, which can have dire results once they can no longer count on their parents for room and board.
Long before a child begins to work, families should discuss the child's plans for spending and saving earnings. This is also a good time to discuss the family budget and whether a child will be expected to contribute toward living expenses or schooling.
The University of Michigan studies found that fewer than 10 percent contributed more than half their paycheck toward family living expenses. Fewer than 13 percent saved half their earnings toward their education. More than 60 percent spend most of their money on discretionary items like clothing, entertainment and eating out.
The same studies show that high school students who work more than 10 to 15 hours a week during the school year are prone to a variety of problems, including a decrease in their academic performance and an increased likelihood that they will use cigarettes, alcohol and other drugs. There is no single reason for the problems, but they often appear to be related to the increased stress that children feel trying to work many hours and go to school.
 
Helping, Not Hindering, the Hunt
ALTHOUGH it is not a good idea for parents to arrange for a part-time or summer job for their child, there are some things they can do to help in the job hunt that takes their child's emotional and developmental needs into account.
Talk about the idea of looking for a job well in advance.
Many teen-agers will judge a prospective job solely in terms of the hourly wage. ''Set the guidelines about hours, location and type of job ahead of time,'' advised Dr. Robert B. Brooks, the director of child psychology training at McLean Hospital in Belmond, Mass., and an assistant professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School. ''If you try to do it after the child gets a job, you'll have more difficulties setting limits.''
Expect your child to be nervous about the job search and the job interview.
The amount of anxiety that teen-agers show, especially if you have discussed looking for a job well in advance, will often let you know if they are ready.
''A certain amount of nervousness is normal,'' said Dr. Richard M. Ryan, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Rochester. ''If they seem paralyzed by anxiety, they're probably not emotionally ready for the experience.''
Review with your child what to expect during a job interview.
This phase of the job search causes teen-agers a great deal of anxiety. They are often extremely sensitive about how they come across to adults and worry that the slightest flaw will prevent their obtaining a job. But doing a ''pretend'' or mock job interview with your child in preparation for the real thing may do more harm than good.
''The child will be more nervous doing a mock job interview with his parents than doing an interview in the real world,'' Dr. Ryan said.
One alternative is to arrange other teen-agers who are looking for jobs to do mock interviews with other parents in the neighborhood.
Make sure your child considers the possibility that the job may not work out.
Job rejections can be particularly upsetting to teen-agers. Adolescents - especially those who have been very successful at school - sometimes view being rejected for a job as a general statement about their worth. They may show this directly or indirectly, perhaps by describing the prospective employer as stupid or incompetent.
Help them understand that everyone is turned down for jobs and that other employers won't know that they have been rejected.
Suggest volunteer work if your family does not need the extra income from your child's job.
Many jobs for adolescents, like those in fast-food restaurants, often involve unskilled, dead-end work in which they have little responsibility and in some cases ample time to socialize with other teen-agers. The major attraction is the paycheck.
But organizations that use volunteers are more likely to give adolescents work that involves responsibility and training. It also increases the odds that they will be working with adults and, therefore, treated more like adults.

HEADLINE: Liberals Starting a Journal As a Forum for New Ideas

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Nobody will accuse liberals of having led the political debate during the past decade or so. Indeed, many liberals themselves acknowledge, a bit ruefully, that the ideas that made a difference in the 1970's and 80's came more often than not from conservatives. But a small group of liberal writers and professors, many with national reputations, are starting a new journal, hoping it will become the focal point of a renewal.
The magazine, whose first quarterly issue will be published next month in Princeton, N.J., is called The American Prospect. It was created, its founders say, with the aim of bringing liberal ideas back to the top of the national agenda.
''This magazine will enable us to find out if it's true or false that liberals don't have any new ideas,'' said Hendrick Hertzberg, the editor of The New Republic and a friend of some of the new magazine's founders. ''I think it's false and I think when you get into one church these independent voices that have been singing in different places, they'll make a mighty chorus.'' 
The creation of the new magazine is an occasion for some reflection, by liberals and others, over the recent, rather poor history of a major trend in American life. There have been numerous discussions over the reasons for the relative decline of liberalism in recent years and what liberals must do to adapt to new circumstances.
 
Summoning the Zeitgeist
The writers and analysts who raised $500,000 to start the magazine - many of them concentrated in Ivy League academic centers - argue that The American Prospect is being started at a propitious moment, that is, they say, when there is a national swing in the zeitgeist, a cyclical move back to the bedrock liberalism abandoned and neglected in the Reagan years.
The conservatives have now had their chance, many liberals argue, and their program of reliance on the unrestricted market has failed to solve the nation's most pressing problems. The idea that the public may be ready for a liberal resurgence is not just a hopeful liberal idea. Kevin Phillips, a conservative political analyst, says much the same thing in ''The Politics of Rich and Poor,'' a book about to be published by Random House, and the editors of The American Prospect agree with him.
They believe, in addition, that the end of the cold war has removed a major source of contention among them, one that divided the liberal camp into those who supported conservative demands for more military spending and those who wanted to give priority to domestic programs.
''A lot of the antagonisms that arose in the 1960's have died out,'' said Paul Starr, a Princeton sociologist who will be one of the magazine's two editors. ''Now, with the end of the cold war, a lot of antagonisms on foreign policy are dying out as well.''
Robert Reich, a Harvard economist who is chairman of the magazine's editorial board, said that by this reasoning, ''we're on the cusp of a new era.''
''My simplistic vision,'' he went on, ''is of a great emerging army of liberal people who don't have anything to attach themselves to, no clear policy directions, no distinct public philosophy, certainly no leaders. So it's the perfect time to start the process of redefinition.''
 
Learning From the Opposition
Robert Kuttner, a writer on economic affairs who will edit the magazine with Mr. Starr, said that some of the inspiration for the new magazine had been provided by the model followed by conservatives when they seized the intellectual initiative during the past two decades.
''The long and the short of it is that no existing journal was doing what, say, Commentary or The Public Interest was doing in creating excitement on the conservative side,'' he said. ''Liberals have been defensive and have been trying to figure out what went wrong.''
The magazine's founders are aiming at a circulation of about 15,000 to 20,000; about 2,500 subscriptions have been received so far. Subscriptions can be bought by writing to P.O. Box 7645, Princeton, N.J., 08543-7645. Small sums were raised by sales of advertising, mostly to publishing companies, in the first issue.
Mr. Starr said most of the initial funds came from private donations. The largest single contribution, $50,000, was made by the Joyce Foundation in Chicago, an organization that has given money to a large array of causes, from hospitals and schools to theaters. Another large contributor, he said, is Max Palevsky, a California computer executive who, in years past, contributed heavily to the Presidential campaign of George McGovern and helped finance Rolling Stone magazine.
Any new magazine, but particularly one devoted to scholarly articles, is a financially risky venture, and many of them fail. Tikkun, a liberal Jewish monthly, has experienced financial difficulties throughout its short history. Recently, the American Jewish Committee announced that it was closing its liberal publication, Present Tense.
 
Scholarly, and Not Irreverent
The first issue of The American Prospect is scholarly in tone and devoid of any of the partisan irreverence and sauciness characteristic of such other magazines of opinion as The New Republic on the moderate left or National Review on the right.
The first issue also suggests a certain recourse to names and arguments already familiar to many readers. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the historian, outlines what he regards as the emerging new liberal opportunities of the 1990's. John Kenneth Galbraith, the economist, publishes an essay deploring the habit of liberal candidates, as he puts it, ''to desert their constituency and appear as poor imitations of the opposition.''
There are also articles by writers like Mr. Kuttner, Mr. Starr and Mr. Reich, a group of writers in their 40's, each of them already the author of several books on social trends or public policy whose articles have commonly appeared until now in The New Republic.
The three represent a particular strain in American intellectual life -those who came of age in the turbulent 1960's, opposed the Vietnam War, but did not adopt the radical, pro-revolutionary and often anti-American stances of other members of that generation. At the same time, they did not veer toward the neo-conservative right, as did many other one-time opponents of the war.
''The irony,'' Mr. Starr said, ''is that back in the 1960's, I was under assault from the left. Now, the attacks come from the right. Obviously, the world has changed, but we still think that liberalism is the best name for the tradition that we want to carry on.'' What Is Liberalism? Several of the feature articles in the first issue of The American Prospect suggest an answer to what might be the central question about the new magazine: What, in this last decade of the 20th century, is liberalism? How does it differ from conservatism? Do the liberals really have any new ideas or are they merely dusting off the notions of earlier times?
The founders of the new magazine answer those questions in part by exploring what happened to the old liberalism, or, put another way, how the liberal ''malaise'' of the 1970's and 80's came about. A major element, they say, was an overemphasis on the concept of redistribution of wealth. Another element was the common association of classic liberals with the radicals of the 1960's, a group associated in the public mind with a tendency to see the United States, not just as flawed, but as deeply villainous in its international behavior.
''This is not a radical publication,'' Mr. Starr said of The American Prospect.
The leading feature article in the new magazine is ''The Real Welfare Problem,'' by Christopher Jencks and Dathryn Edin. Based on new research and surveys, the article argues that welfare recipients generally work at unreported jobs to make ends meet. The authors' recommendation is for government to supplement low-wage jobs with publicly financed fringe benefits to increase incentives to work.
 
Back to Original Notions
Asked whether recommendations like this one did not amount to a more ''conservative'' form of liberalism, the editors of ''The New Prospect'' defined certain basic liberal notions, which they contrasted with conservatism.
Put most broadly, these principles amount to a distrust of the free market and a belief in enlightened government as the best - indeed, the only - mechanism available to address social problems and gross economic inequities.
Mr. Kuttner said: ''I believe that economies are not self-regulating, that the degree of inequality in our society is too great, and that we need a balance between market and nonmarket institutions to make society work.''
Mr. Starr said: ''We have a very positive view of the possibilities of government. We don't share the pessimism, the sense of futility, of the conservatives.''
