HEADLINE: Beijing Sees U.S. Moves As Plot to Thwart China

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 31

 BODY:
Many senior members of China's military and political establishment have come to believe in recent months that the United States is actively conspiring to undermine China politically, economically and militarily, Chinese officials and Western experts say.
In this view, ominous signs are everywhere: The United States is trying to split Taiwan from the mainland, it is blocking China's entry into the World Trade Organization, and it is sending spies like the American human rights advocate Harry Wu to collect evidence in order to fabricate stories about China's penal system. 
 As Secretary of State Warren Christopher prepares to meet Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China on Tuesday in the sultanate of Brunei, Chinese-American relations are at their worst since the 1989 massacre in Beijing. Although concessions are possible at the meeting, as are polite promises to be nicer to each other in the future, it will be as hard to allay Chinese fears as it will be to make Americans forget about human rights.
The inflexible view that has taken hold in Beijing leaves no easy answers for the Clinton Administration, still struggling to come up with a China policy: Efforts to engage China have arguably achieved little, while threatening diplomatic sanctions would only isolate it more.
With the Chinese Communist Party leadership in a precarious state of transition as Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader, nears death, analysts believe that President Jiang Zemin is unlikely to take any bold gestures necessary to achieve a breakthrough. Several military officers, a Chinese official said, complained recently that Mr. Jiang had responded too slowly to the American decision to allow President Lee Tung-hui of Taiwan to visit the United States in June.
To military officers, the Chinese official said, the United States is a wily and deceitful enemy that revealed its true nature when it approved Mr. Lee's visit, after promising it would not do so.
To this way of thinking, the United States has pretended for years to support China's aim of reunifying Taiwan with the mainland, but has now bared its true intention to help keep them apart by aiding Mr. Lee, whom the Chinese now accuse of secretly planning to declare independence for Taiwan.
"On Taiwan, there will be no concessions," a senior Foreign Ministry official said. "This is part of our national territory. It is like the American Civil War, when the U.S. Government took a very strong position against the British decision to sell arms to the South."
If this comparison sounds strained, it may be because the Chinese civil war ended 46 years ago. But the Chinese Defense Minister, Chi Haotian, reiterated today that China could use force to "settle the Taiwan issue," and criticized "foreign forces' attempts to interfere in China's internal affairs."
John W. Lewis, a professor at Stanford University, said he learned in recent meetings with Chinese military leaders in Beijing that they have ordered a comprehensive review of China's long dormant military contingency plans aimed at preventing Taiwan from declaring its independence.
"No one wants to go down this path," Mr. Lewis said. "But the United States is forcing them to consider for the first time in decades developing contingency plans for a possible crisis that not only involves Taiwan's independence but United States intervention in the relationship between Taiwan and the mainland."
David Shambaugh, professor of Chinese politics at the University of London, said the emerging hard-line view hangs on four points: The United States is trying to divide China territorially, subvert it politically, contain it strategically and frustrate it economically.
"This consensus is now shared across the spectrum," said Mr. Shambaugh, who added that he was surprised by the uniformity of views he found in meetings with officials and scholars in Beijing last week. "The military has the decisive voice."
This view has not been articulated publicly. Yet it was hinted at in a series of unusually vitriolic official People's Daily commentaries, which are typically issued after an internal consensus has been reached, and which this time accused the United States of colluding with President Lee to work toward a declaration of independence.
"Lee Tung-hui, in an attempt to win the support of the United States for his proposition on the independence of Taiwan, had done his utmost to drive a wedge in Chinese-American relations, and thus made himself a willing card in the hands of the United States," one commentary said. "In the United States there are indeed some people who always follow a policy of opposing and splitting China."
The senior Foreign Ministry official said that "we have received many views" from Chinese officials who see the United States as trying to undermine China.
If it seems obvious to anyone in Washington that the Clinton Administration has no coordinated China policy, Mr. Shambaugh added, China's military sees a clear plan.
"They now see a broad-gauged attack on China," Mr. Shambaugh said. "They're prepared to hunker down and resist the assault, and they frequently compare it with the 1950's, when Mao called the United States its principal enemy."

HEADLINE: White House Lowers Estimate of Budget Deficit for Current Year

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
The White House said today that revised projections showed that the Federal budget deficit for the current fiscal year would now be $160 billion -- or $33 billion lower than previously estimated -- and that President Clinton's plan for balancing the budget in 10 years could probably succeed in 9.
Mr. Clinton pronounced the latest figures good news, and his top aides acknowledged that the revised estimates might help to foster a compromise with the Republicans, who want to balance the budget in seven years with spending cuts that the Administration contends are unrealistically large. 
 "I'm sure somebody will suggest that," the White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, said of a possible compromise as Mr. Clinton flew aboard Air Force One to the National Governors' Association meeting in Burlington, Vt.
But the budget director, Alice M. Rivlin, in a briefing at the White House, repeated the Administration's longstanding view that balancing the budget by a certain date was less important than balancing it without damaging programs in areas the President considers most important, like education.
"We are arguing for a specific set of policies, not for a specific date on which to get to balance," Ms. Rivlin said. Among other points, she noted, the Republicans favor far bigger cuts in growth of Medicare spending than Mr. Clinton has been willing to accept and at the same time they want steep tax cuts.
Mr. Panetta attributed the decline in the projected deficit for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, to better-than-expected growth in the economy and a spending cut bill signed last week by Mr. Clinton that trimmed $9 billion from current spending.
Officials said they now projected that Mr. Clinton's proposal for balancing the budget would produce a modest surplus by 2004, one year sooner than expected because the effort to balance the budget would prompt lower interest rates than previously anticipated.
For example, by 2005, the rate on 91-day Treasury bills would be 4.4 percent, compared with 5.5 percent without the effects of the President's plan, according to the Administration's budget review. Officials said that drop was comparable to the one projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. Clinton, speaking to reporters in Vermont, said of the new deficit estimate: "I thought they were a little high before. I feel good about it."
Last month, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that far from balancing the budget, Mr. Clinton's proposals would prompt continued deficits in the $200-billion-a-year range into the next century. Ms. Rivlin acknowledged those differences today, but said they were a result of relatively small differences in assumptions about how the economy would perform, multiplied over the next decade.
"When you compound those differences over 10 years, you get large differences," she said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Vows to Veto Bill on Telecommunications Decontrol

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
President Clinton threatened this evening to veto the bill sponsored by House Republicans to deregulate the nation's telecommunications industries, saying that it would discourage competition.
The bill is aimed at dismantling the regulatory barriers that separate long-distance telephone, local telephone and cable television companies. The bill's Republican backers, Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia and Representative Jack Fields of Texas, contend that deregulation would foster competition. 
 In a statement this evening, President Clinton ran through a long list of objections to the bill. "Instead of promoting investment and competition, it promotes mergers and concentration of power," he said. "Instead of promoting open access and diversity of content and viewpoints, it would allow fewer people to control greater numbers of television, radio and newspaper outlets in every community."
If the bill "is sent to me without a deletion or revision of a significant number of these provisions, I will be compelled to veto it in the best interests of the public and our national economic well-being," he added.
An Administration official said that it was a coincidence that the veto threat came hours after the Walt Disney Company announced plans to take over Capital Cities/ABC. The veto threat "has been in the works for several days, and that was a total surprise to us as it was to anybody else," said the official, who did not wish to be identified.
The House is expected to vote on the bill later this week. Vice President Al Gore is scheduled to address a caucus of House Democrats early Tuesday afternoon to urge them to oppose the bill.
Republicans responded angrily to the President's threat, while denying the President's contention that the bill would foster monopolies. "If President Clinton were to follow through on his threat, he would be vetoing the single biggest job-creation bill of his Presidency, one that will break up the monopolies in local telephone and cable service and unleash the competitive forces that will truly bring the United States into the Information Age," said Mr. Bliley, the chairman of the Commerce Committee.
Mr. Fields is the chairman of the committee's panel on telecommunications and finance issues.
While Administration officials had previously expressed unhappiness with some features of the House Republican bill, President Clinton's statement marks the first time the White House has promised a veto if the bill is not changed. While President Clinton was reluctant to threaten vetoes in the months immediately following the Republicans' overwhelming victory in Congressional elections last November, he has changed tack in the last couple of months and threatened to stop half of the Republicans' spending bills and several other bills.
The current House bill would loosen restrictions on the number of television stations that an individual can acquire, and eliminate restrictions on radio purchases. It would deregulate cable television rates and allow local phone companies to offer long-distance service soon.
Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation controls the Fox television network, could be the biggest beneficiary of the House Republican bill because it would allow him to control more television stations.
Administration officials are trying to focus attention on the bill now in part because Mr. Murdoch is scheduled to testify on Tuesday before the House Ethics Committee. Mr. Murdoch will be questioned Tuesday about the $4.5 million advance initially offered to Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia by one of Mr. Murdoch's publishing companies. Under pressure, Mr. Gingrich gave up the advance.
The bill's telephone provisions have been heavily criticized by long-distance companies, which contend they would unfairly allow local phone companies to offer long-distance service long before long-distance companies could challenge the local monopolies. Long-distance phone company lobbyists contend that local phone companies will raise rates for consumers who have no alternative and use the profits to subsidize their new long-distance service.

HEADLINE: CLINTON AND DOLE PRESENT PROGRAMS TO ALTER WELFARE

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: BURLINGTON, Vt., July 31

 BODY:
President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole, his leading Republican rival for next year's Presidential race, presented competing visions of welfare reform to the nation's governors today.
Playing both to the governors and to a broader public widely disillusioned with current welfare programs, Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton each said welfare must be changed, but they disagreed about the role the central Government should play in fashioning assistance to the poor. 
 Mr. Clinton, seeking to reclaim the initiative on an issue he capitalized on in the 1992 campaign, told the governors that his Administration had just taken action to move more quickly in approving state programs to put welfare recipients to work and would allow states to deny food stamp increases to people who lose welfare benefits for refusing to take jobs.
Mr. Clinton outlined his new executive actions just hours after Mr. Dole described to the National Governors' Association here his own efforts to break a Senate impasse among Republicans over welfare and to build a consensus around legislation that would give each state a lump sum of Federal money known as a block grant to assist poor people.
The reaction among the governors was predictably partisan. Republican governors endorsed Senator Dole's plan and criticized Mr. Clinton for not supporting a complete turnover of control to the states. Democrats said Mr. Dole was advocating a "cut and run" strategy in which the Federal Government cuts benefits and runs from its fundamental responsibility to poor children.
But both men came here to display their concern about welfare to the public, as well as to the governors. Just as Mr. Clinton often promised in 1992 to "end welfare as we know it," Republicans gearing up for 1996 have seized on widespread dissatisfaction with the system as a potent vote-getting weapon.
Mr. Dole, saying that the Great Society programs had failed, announced that the core of his approach was the principle that welfare should be controlled by the states without having to seek approval from the Federal Government. "Governors should not have to play a game of Mother May I," he said, ridiculing the current system under which governors must receive Federal permission, or waivers, to experiment with work programs. "Waivers have led us in the right direction," he said. "Now, let's finish the job. Real change will only occur when you are released from the burden of Federal rules and regulations."
Hours later, Mr. Clinton, in conciliatory remarks, praised Mr. Dole for breaking with conservatives in the Senate who want to require the states to deny cash assistance to unwed mothers and said that was "a very good start for us to work together."
But Mr. Clinton also expressed concerns about flat block grants for welfare with no requirements that states maintain current levels of spending on the poor, asking what would happen in a recession when more people would be seek assistance. If states have to trim benefits, he said, "I do honestly believe that there is a danger that some states will get involved in a race to the bottom," he said. "This program after all is called Aid to Families with Dependent Children not aid to states with terrible budget problems caused by Congress." The governors responded with laughter and applause.
Mr. Dole accused the White House of standing idly by while Senate Republicans debated welfare proposals. But today Mr. Clinton chose the governors' meeting to showcase the power of the President to act even as the Congress remains deadlocked. Mr. Clinton said, "We don't have to wait for Congress to go a long way toward ending welfare as we know it."
Mr. Clinton announced he was directing the Health and Human Services Department to take no more than 30 days to approve state welfare experiments following any of five strategies:
* Require recipients to work but provide adequate child care.
* Limit the amount of time people can collect welfare, provided that jobs are available to those willing to work.
* Require minor mothers to live at home and stay in school.
* Force fathers to either pay child support immediately or go to work to pay it if they are broke.
* Use welfare benefits and food stamp grants as cash subsidies to private employers who hire welfare recipients.
The waiver process now takes 120 days.
Mr. Clinton said he was also ordering the Office of Management and Budget to approve a change in regulations so that food stamp benefits do not automatically rise when a state reduces a welfare grant for someone who refuses to go to work. "If your welfare check goes down for refusal to work, you food stamp payments won't go up anymore," Mr. Clinton said.
And the President announced that he was approving four new state welfare experiments -- in California, Texas, Utah and West Virginia -- bringing to 32 the number of states that have Federal waivers to create their own welfare programs.
The state programs range from California's efforts to establish a cap on welfare benefits for each family so that there is no increase with the birth of a child, to Texas's plan to require parents to prove their children have been immunized or face reductions in benefits.
Mr. Clinton vowed during the 1992 Presidential campaign to "end welfare as we know it" and today he called the issue a "symbol of what divides us." But as President, Mr. Clinton put health care reform ahead of welfare and Republicans claimed the welfare issue as their own after they took control of Congress in the 1994 elections.
Although Republicans and most Democrats favor tying welfare to work requirements, legislative progress on the issue has been stalled for months by a dispute among Republicans, even though legislation approved by the House of Representatives and by the Senate Finance Committee are both tougher than Mr. Clinton's proposals and would set more stringent work requirements.
Mr. Dole has been working to broker a compromise around a measure that would change most welfare programs to block grants. State officials would have more discretion than they have now in decide how to use the money. But poor people would no longer have a legal right, or entitlement, to assistance and the Federal Government would put a cap on total spending regardless of economic need.
But one of Mr. Dole's rival in the Republican race, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, and 23 other conservative Republican senators want provisions to cut off cash benefits to unmarried teen-age mothers and deny additional benefits to welfare mothers who have babies.
Mr. Dole, in an indirect swipe at Mr. Gramm's plan, said, "I will do all in my power to insure that our reforms will not increase he tragedy of abortion in America."
Mr. Clinton similarly noted that abortion rates had been declining and "might turn around and go up again at least among some classes of people, if we pass that kind of rule everywhere in the country."
Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, the Democrat who heads the governors' association said Mr. Dole's speech was conciliatory in tone, but said nevertheless block grants, because of their inflexibility, "are a terrible threat to the states' taxpayers."
And Mr. Chiles said that the assumption that states would take over welfare programs overlooked the fact that "these programs were started by the Federal Government because children weren't being taken care of."
Several Republicans bristled at Mr. Clinton's support for requirements that would keep states from cutting their own welfare expenditures, as Mr. Chiles predicted some would.
Gov. Fife Symington of Arizona said such requirements would curtail the states' abilities to experiment." He also was skeptical of Mr. Clinton's promise that waiver applications would be handled in 30 days, saying one from his state had recently taken a year. "If you were in my shoes," he said, "you would want to get Washington out of your life as much as possible."
Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, called Mr. Clinton's speech "the same old thing." He added: "He is talking about more waivers. I remember when he was a governor -- when he was with us."
Governor George E. Pataki of New York, while saying he found Mr. Clinton's welfare goals acceptable, complained about his way of reaching them. "The premise of this Administration is you achieve it by going to Washington." He asked, "Why should we need applications to Washington?"
Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah added the complaint that Mr. Clinton's approach "won't move toward a balanced budget."

HEADLINE: For Stocks, a Dull Session Despite the Disney Excitement

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The stock market muddled through a humdrum session yesterday as concern over economic conditions neutralized excitement over Walt Disney's plans to acquire Capital Cities/ABC in a $19 billion deal.
Popular Wall Street indicators registered minor losses. The Dow Jones industrial average, after drifting at slightly depressed levels for much of the day, ended with a deficit of 7.04 at 4,708.47 despite a solid gain by Disney. 
 Disney was the New York Stock Exchange's volume leader and spurted 1 1/4, to 58 5/8, while Capital Cities/ABC soared 20 1/8, to 116 1/4, also in brisk Big Board trading. A buying frenzy ensued in the entertainment sector; CBS surged 1 7/8, to 77 3/4.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index finished almost unchanged at 301.32, off 0.06, while Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.87, to 562.06, and the Nasdaq stock market composite shed 4.07, to 1,001.21. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.17, to 523.24.
Gainers squeaked past decliners on the Big Board, with a closing tally showing 1,159 stocks up, 1,059 down and 793 unchanged. Big Board volume eased to 289.9 million shares as of 4 P.M. from 311.6 million Friday.
In another takeover development, Wallace Computer Services rose 14 3/8, to 58 3/8 in heavy Big Board volume of more than 2.9 million shares in response to news that it was the target of a hostile takeover bid by the Moore Corporation for $1.3 billion, or $56 a share. Moore fell 7/8, to 22.
USAir was down 1 5/8, to 9 1/2, in heavy Big Board volume of more than 3.8 million shares. The carrier ended talks with its unions on a wage concession and restructuring package and said it would focus on labor cost reductions in collective bargaining.
James River gained 3/8, to 33 3/8, in heavy Big Board volume of more than 3.3 million shares. The company announced last week that it planned to cut 4,400 jobs in North America and Europe to generate savings up to $640 million.
ICN Pharmaceuticals, was up 2 3/4, to 19 5/8, in response to its agreement with Schering-Plough. ICN will receive a $23 million licensing fee from Schering-Plough in a deal that could ultimately lead to $42 million in ICN stock purchases if certain milestones are met. Schering-Plough rose 3/8, to 46 1/2.
Chipcom fell 2 7/8, to 41, in heavy Nasdaq volume of more than 2.7 million shares. Traders were not impressed with the possible bidding war for the computer network equipment maker. Cabletron Systems plans to buy more than $15 million of Chipcom stock, girding for a possible takeveor battle with 3Com, which has offered $39 a share, or about $775 million for Chipcom. 3Com fell 23/16 , to 741/16 .
Lechters was down 19/16 , to 135/16 . The Harrison, N.J., retailer of houseware products said it expected to report a loss of $1.9 million for the quarter ended July 29. That is less than a loss of $7 million a year earlier but still larger than expected.
John H. Shaughnessy, director of research at Advest Inc., said the Disney news reminded investors of "the impressive values in this market," despite the year's steady advance.
Interest rates were also on the minds of investors following release of mixed economic figures. The impact of unexpectedly sluggish data on income and spending was offset by a report on manufacturing activity in the Chicago area, considered a bellwether for the country.
The Commerce Department reported Americans' personal income rose four-tenths of 1 percent in June while spending increased an anemic two-tenths of1 percent last month after advancing nine-tenths of 1 percent in May.
Coming on top of news Friday that the economy barely expanded in the second quarter of 1995 -- turning in its weakest performance in nearly four years -- the income and spending data renewed hopes for interest rate cuts.
But the hopes were tempered by the report from Chicago-area purchasing managers, which showed pockets of strength.

HEADLINE: E. F. Johnson, Retail Analyst, Is Dead at 73

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Edward F. Johnson, the founder and director of the Johnson Redbook Service, which had grown from a typical brokerage firm analyst's report into an influential retailing research publication, died on Saturday in Brick Township, N.J. He was 73 and was also the Mayor of Bay Head, N.J.
The cause of death was complications related to a brain aneurysm, a spokesman for Johnson Redbook, a division of Lynch Jones & Ryan, a New York brokerage firm, said yesterday. 
 Johnson Redbook provides weekly statistics on retail sales that are widely followed by Wall Street bond traders far beyond Mr. Johnson's own firm as an important economic indicator. Mr. Johnson was known for his blunt and straightforward opinions about trends in retailing, and his service was the only one that provided confidential industrywide statistics. For this reason, Mr. Johnson's weekly reports were viewed as an important sign of the future health of the nation's economy.
Mr. Johnson's service, which got its name from a red notebook that he used to collect data, was founded in 1970. He joined Lynch Jones & Ryan in 1991 and, before that, worked at Prescott, Ball & Turben for more than 20 years. Mr. Johnson's views about retailing trends and about specific companies in the apparel, retail and textile industries were considered influential on Wall Street. As an analyst, he was frequently quoted, especially as the retailing industry was buffeted in the last decade by mergers and bankruptcies.
Mr. Johnson graduated from the Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, N.J., and Cornell University. He was an officer in World War II, serving as captain of a B-24 bomber, based in Italy, and an officer of the Korean War. In 1952, he joined the Van Alstyne Noel Company, a brokerage firm, as a partner and later spent more than 40 years as a retailing analyst. He also followed the chemical industry throughout his career.
Mr. Johnson is survived by his wife, Janet Shearer Johnson; six children, Susan Johnson of Ridgefield, N.J.; Keats Landis of Piedmont, Calif.; Kate Johnson of Oakland, Calif.; Kimball Johnson of Denver; David Johnson of Phippsburgh, Me., and Edward, Jr., of Peru, Vt.; four stepchildren, Bari Edwards of Short Hills, N.J.; Gail Shearer of Bethesda, Md.; Mark Shearer of Tokyo, Japan, and Suzanne Whitehorn of Chatham, N.J.; two brothers, Tristam Johnson of Princeton, N.J. and Burgess Johnson, and seven grandchildren.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
The New Negotiations Are Still Languishing In the On-Deck Circle

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
If anyone thought the past four months of time off from labor negotiations would have changed the climate, nah.
It was four months ago yesterday that Federal Judge Sonia Sotomayor issued the injunction that prompted the players to end their strike and return to work. Negotiators for the players and the owners have not conducted meaningful talks toward a new agreement since, not since the day before Sotomayor's order. 
 In the absence of labor developments, there has been baseball:
Division races, wild-card races; the emergence of the Cleveland Indians, after a four-decade drought, as the premier team in the American League, if not the major leagues; the awesome offense of the California Angels putting Gene Autry back in the saddle again, and the genuine threat of the Colorado Rockies winning a division championship in only their third year of existence.
Then there's the captivating performance of Hideo Nomo, who rivals Toyotas as the most popular Japanese import; the resuscitation of Tim Wakefield and his dancing, darting knuckleballs; the methodically marvelous talent of Greg Maddux; the trades of David Cone, Bobby Bonilla, Jim Abbott and others as contenders bolster themselves for the final two months.
So who needs labor negotiations? The players, the owners and the fans, that's who.
The players and the owners need them to get a deal and assure the fans peace in our time. The fans need that assurance to begin renewing their faith in the game they don't really want to abandon but feel they have to boycott to make some sort of protest or statement.
But the two sides have not met for four months, or more than half the length of the strike. During a hearing on the owners' appeal of the injunction, one of the judges noted that the union had tried to get a meeting scheduled, but to no avail.
Since then, lawyers for the owners and the players have met several times, but they have basically been trying to clean up the National Labor Relations Board charges against the owners, not negotiate a new agreement.
When it was written last week that the owners were not trying to get a new agreement, one of them objected, saying management had been the "aggressors" in trying to set up a meeting. Further, the owner said, union lawyers have told management lawyers they were not ready to make a deal.
Union people who were asked about those claims yesterday quickly disputed the ideas.
"We've been ready to sit down on a full basis since March 30, and they've said the owners don't want to come," one union person said.
As for the suggestion that the union is not prepared to make a deal, the person said: "We'll be glad to hear if they have any ideas. We're still waiting for a response to our proposal from last March."
The owners have decided that when talks resume, only lawyers will attend bargaining sessions. Owners became involved last August and remained in the talks until they broke off March 30. But now the owners themselves don't want to return to the table, even though they are the ones who will dictate management's bargaining position.
Each side, of course, has the right to designate its representatives, but before scheduling a meeting, union representatives said they wanted to discuss the format -- who would attend and how they would proceed with the talks.
Whatever has been resolved or left unresolved, the two sides are scheduled to revisit the critical economic matters soon (remember salary caps and luxury taxes?). "We're going to start talking economic issues with them as early as this week or next week," the owner said.
As of now, the lawyer lineup will be Stanley Jaspan of Milwaukee and Rob Manfred and Frank Coonelly of Washington for the owners and Lauren Rich of New York, Michael Weiner of Hackettstown, N.J., and Steve Fehr of Kansas City, Mo., for the players.
Bud Selig, the No. 1 management man, has talked of adding a new lawyer to the team, and the newest name to surface as a possibility is Randy Levine, who currently is New York City's commissioner of labor relations. When he was in private practice, Levine represented George Steinbrenner and the Yankees, often attending owners' meetings for the club.
If Levine is hired, given his present position, it would possibly not be as just another lawyer but as head of the owners' labor committee, last headed by Richard Ravitch.
A new person joining the talks in a critical position would need time to catch up, but if the rumors players hear are true, Levine or any new person would have more than enough time.
Players hear that the owners don't want a deal before the season ends. Considering their economic state and the ready-made excuse for lowering salaries, the idea goes, the owners don't need an artificial salary inhibitor. They could pay players as little as they want in many cases and use that strategy to force the players to accept whatever position they adopt.
If the owners were to pursue that strategy, they would do so with the belief that the players would not strike again. Indeed, the players prefer a new agreement to a new work stoppage, but they are unlikely to accept a deal at any cost.
Better to go back to the division races. They offer a much brighter outlook.

HEADLINE: Squaring Off on Welfare

 BODY:
Two clever politicians, anticipating next year's Presidential election, addressed the nation's governors yesterday on a subject of sure-fire appeal -- welfare reform. Both Senator Bob Dole and President Clinton called for more work and less welfare. But only Mr. Clinton addressed the needs of the poor.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole, the Senate majority leader, tried deftly to navigate the tricky political challenges they face inside their parties. Mr. Dole's proposals seemed tough enough to win the support of Congressional Republicans, yet were not nearly as punitive as those advanced by Senator Phil Gramm, a rival Presidential candidate. Mr. Clinton also offered stiffer welfare rules. But he pledged to help liberal Democrats preserve the safety net that guarantees Federal help to every poor family. 
 Speaking first, Mr. Dole said he would turn the money that Congress now spends on cash assistance, child care and job training over to the states in block grants with virtually no Federal strings. States could even choose to run the food stamp program themselves. In a stroke, he would gut a 60-year-old pledge that Washington will assist poor families no matter where they live.
Meantime, he cleverly countered Mr. Gramm's challenge from the right. Mr. Gramm and others have proposed Federal rules that would prohibit states from paying benefits to unwed teen-agers or raising benefits to parents who give birth while on welfare. Mr. Dole doubts he can win majority support for either idea. He therefore opposed them with the tactically clever argument that Mr. Gramm's restrictive rules could compel teen-agers to seek abortions.
Mr. Dole's attempt to solve another intra-party fight over spending formulas might also work. Northern states want block grants to mirror current formulas favoring high-income states. Southern states want block grants that would send extra money to states with rising populations. Mr. Dole proposes to preserve current spending patterns in the short term, but spend almost $1 billion more over the next seven years to help fast-growing states.
Mr. Clinton criticized Mr. Dole's block-grant proposal because it would lead to a "race to the bottom" as states, freed from Federal requirements, slashed benefits and services. Mr. Dole suggested that states could be trusted to protect the poor. He is wrong. Over the past 20 years, cash assistance, which is set by the states, has fallen by about 40 percent, after accounting for inflation. Food stamps, whose value is set by Congress, did not fall.
Mr. Clinton outlined an attractive fallback if the Republicans fail to pass comprehensive reform. He vowed quick administrative approval of state experiments that, for example, require recipients to work or limit how long they can collect benefits. But he insisted that to win Federal approval for such welfare-to-work proposals, states would have to help parents find affordable day care and, if necessary, jobs. He also vowed to help states enforce tougher standards by eliminating automatic increases in food stamps for recipients whose cash benefits have been reduced because they violated state rules. That may not sit well with liberals, but the proposal is true to Mr. Clinton's pledge to back state experiments.
The President's incremental ideas might be the best option in sight. His proposals would preserve the Federal entitlement of cash assistance and food stamps. They also provide time for the states to figure out how to institute time limits and other welfare-to-work reforms. Recent studies show that well-run experiments in Michigan, California and Atlanta have cut welfare costs by more than 20 percent and welfare rolls by more than 15 percent.
That may not be ending welfare as we know it. But it puts more parents to work and costs taxpayers less -- without removing the Federal safety net and thereby punishing children on the backs of ideological fervor and Presidential campaigning.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Victory Over the Stupids

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
The commandants of the gulags of the world and their security-ministry masters have two things in common, in whatever country they operate. They have a taste for torture, and they are very stupid.
Perhaps part of the combination comes from genetics. Some people seem to be born to fight for freedom and others to draw blood from them. 
 But the stupidity comes from a particular environment -- the totalitarian environment. The guardians of the gulags never have to test their minds against those of free men and women. So, in time, they move from the mental inferiority that drew them to their line of work to becoming truly mentally handicapped -- unable to understand that to free, inquiring minds they are panes of glass revealing instantly all their actions, motives and maneuvers. Their stupidity is the belief of the gravely dim-witted that they can manipulate and fool their intellectual betters.
The first such individual I encountered was a Governor of Goa when it was a Portuguese colony in India. He gave me permission to tour his prison to show me that the people for whom I was searching -- Indian Socialists who had crossed the border carrying freedom flags -- were not in his custody. He led me down a cell row leading left from a main corridor; large, sparsely occupied cells, Socialist-free.
As he showed me out, of course I walked to the right. The cells were packed with prisoners who had just been jammed into them, my Socialists. They held up arms livid with cigarette burns. The Governor looked at me in astonishment that anyone would ever think of turning in an unauthorized direction.
In the Soviet gulag a commandant was stunned that a visitor shown an isolation cell glistening clean white would smell the walls and discover they were damp with fresh paint.
Lord, Lord, how dull these people are. But for impenetrable stupidity I have rarely known anything like the film the Chinese made and sold to Western news organizations. This film is supposed to show that Harry Wu confessed that his reports are false.
My Harry, your Harry, the Harry of all who admire those who put their lives on the line for freedom. Harry Wu spent 19 years in Chinese slave-labor camps. After he was freed he made his way to America. But he kept returning to China to get even more information to spread before the world about slave-labor exports that support China's military establishment. And he has reported about organs taken from executed Chinese prisoners, then sold to sick, rich Chinese and foreigners who do not inquire whether the prisoners are guilty or of what.
Of course, Harry Wu was heard confessing to nothing except maybe some editing errors by a BBC editor of his own organ documentary. The gulag film really shows how hard Mr. Wu resisted, not that they had broken him.
The U.S. hopes that the film means the Communists are getting ready to release Mr. Wu. But there is as good a chance that the police apparatus will demand continued imprisonment.
American diplomats are doing their personal best to help Mr. Wu. But if he is released it will not be because of irresistible U.S. Government pressure.
There has been none applied that Beijing would recognize -- raising of tariffs, barring China from the World Trade Organization or blocking a World Bank loan. By breaking his promise to apply pressure for human rights in China and Tibet, President Clinton made himself the prisoner of Beijing.
Political apologias will not work, nor will the journalistic variety. I am thinking of the fellow on The New Republic who wrote a nasty little piece about how snatching salable organs from executed criminals was really not that bad. And I am thinking of the house liberal on the McLaughlin show who revealed much too much about herself by saying that after all we had to understand that the Chinese regarded Mr. Wu as a spy.
The only realistic hope is that some Chinese foreign-service officers who are not brain-dead will be able to overrule the security police, who gave Mr. Wu and his fully documented reports world recognition by arresting him instead of stopping him at the border and sending him back.
Harry Wu has won his victory. The only way China can now cut its losses and save face is to set him free. May God bless Harry Wu.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities In Price Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were higher in modest trading yesterday as the market awaited new supply and an important economic report.
As many traders stayed on the sidelines, waiting for Friday's report on employment in July, data released yesterday were mixed. Personal income and spending showed gains that were lower than expected, and a manufacturing report was stronger than expected. 
 The Commerce Department said June income was up four-tenths of 1 percent, compared with estimates of as much as six-tenths of 1 percent. Spending rose two-tenths of 1 percent, compared with estimates of as much as five-tenths of 1 percent.
While the increases were less than expected, the report also suggested that the economy was recovering at a pace fast enough to dissuade the Federal Reserve from lowering short-term interest rates anytime soon.
"The gap between personal income and personal spending does not suggest that there exists more room for consumption in the second half of the year," said Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio. "Given the fact that consumption grew by a fairly robust 2.5 percent in the second quarter, any acceleration beyond this growth rate is bound to cause some concern for credit markets and present a potential stumbling block."
Bond yields, which mirror expectations for inflation and the demand for loans, could be as high as 7.25 percent by Labor Day, Mr. Chan said.
Signs of resilient strength in the economy were also seen in the July report of the Chicago purchasing managers. The managers' index of business activity rose to 49.7 percent, from 47.6 in June. The forecast had called for a rise to 47.5 versus 47.6 percent in June.
"Much of the inventory correction that was long awaited may have taken place a lot sooner than expected," Mr. Chan said.
Mr. Chan said a jump the new orders component of the index suggested that the manufacturing sector was moving toward an expansion. "Such a development, if it persists, may very well push long-term Treasury rates into a new trading range of 7 percent to 7.25 percent within the next two or three months," he said.
The market typically pays attention to the Chicago purchasing managers' report because it is considered as a precursor to the broader report by the National Association of Purchasing Management, which is scheduled to be released today.
Yesterday, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond gained 24/32 , to 10928/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.84 percent from 6.90 percent.
The Treasury's regular weekly bill auction yesterday was solid all around, traders said. The average rate for a three-month bill was down 3 basis points from last week's auction, to 5.44 percent, while the six-month was down 7 basis points, to 5.39 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Market analysts expect that a supply of new securities in the coming weeks will likely limit any gains for the week. The Treasury will announce its quarterly borrowing requirements tomorrow. Corporate issues are expected to remain light as a result of the heavy economic calendar that will keep buyers somewhat at bay.
"A record $46 billion in municipal coupon and redemption proceeds are schedule to roll in this month," said Michael S. Appelbaum, senior vice president of investments at Paine Webber Inc. He said investors seeking reinvestment strategies should note the attractive municipal to Treasury yield ratios prevailing in today's fixed-income markets.
"Certain technical factors show the muni market in a slightly oversold condition," Mr. Appelbaum said, "and while it's not posible to predict whether municipal securities will be less expensive in the near future, the current attractive relationships should not be overlooked."
Municipal bonds were steady yesterday as investors focused on today's $1 billion sale of New York City bonds. According to Bloomberg Fair Value analytics, the bonds are expected to yield as much as 6.55 percent for a 30-year bond, or 17 basis points higher than similarly rated city bonds.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about Monday's trading in the credit market misstated an economist's assessment of a Commerce Department report on personal income and spending that affected the market. The economist, Anthony Chan of the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said the gap between personal income and spending suggested that consumption would indeed grow, in the second half of the year.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Steady as Traders Assess Credit Union Problems in Japan

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed in lackluster, thin trading yesterday as traders sorted through the suspension of operations at a large Japanese credit union and fresh signs of a revival of the American economy.
The dollar spent the day trading in a tight range, a condition likely to remain "until we see something to focus on," said Lynn Tierney, a foreign-exchange vice president at Shawmut Bank in Boston. She said many traders were awaiting the report Friday on July employment in the United States. 
 In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar slipped to 1.3845 German marks from 1.3856 marks on Friday. The dollar edged up to 88.32 Japanese yen from 88.11 yen. The British pound rose to $1.5975 from $1.5960.
In Asian trading, the dollar surged against the yen after anxious investors of Cosmo Shinyo Kumiai, the largest credit union in Tokyo, withdrew about 60 billion yen, or $680 million, 14 percent of its 439 billion yen in deposits.
The credit union was closed and the Bank of Japan poured several billion yen into the institution in hopes that foreign investors would be reassured to see a swift Government response to a financial crisis.
The quickness of the response led some traders to speculate that Japan might become more aggressive in its monetary policy, perhaps by lowering interest rates.
"I think the market was trying to figure it out," whether the Bank of Japan would ease, Ms. Tierney of Shawmut Bank said.
A Bank of Japan governor, Yasuo Matsushita, however, later ruled out the possibility of an immediate cut in rates.
The dollar was also supported yesterday by a report that showed strength in American manufacturing. The Chicago Purchasing Management Association said its index of area business activity rose to 49.7 percent in July from 47.6 percent in June. The increase was greater than expected.
The report helped the dollar because it showed the economy was more robust than previously thought, reducing the prospects that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates, said Kevin Lawrie, foreign-exchange manager at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
Lower rates would make American assets less attractive to investors and create less demand for dollars.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
For one mutual fund company, memorable mayhem replaces more mundane images.

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez 

 BODY:
MOST advertising for giant mutual funds is baby-boomer pabulum: generic displays of Frisbee-catching dogs, handsome couples and grinning college graduates. As mutual funds proliferate -- there were more than 6,000 at last count, more than double the number of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange -- their advertising seems to appear more and more alike.
But not at Alliance Capital Management, one of the largest American mutual fund companies, with more assets under management than the gross domestic products of Greece and Ireland combined. 
 With the help of Gary Weis, the cult documentary director who made quirky short films for "Saturday Night Live" in the 1970's, Alliance has put together a startlingly tongue-in-cheek series of new TV commercials that say, in effect, investing in stocks is complicated, so don't try this at home.
"The thing that rankled us was all these no-load mutual fund ads that said it was dumb to hire a professional," said John Carifa, president of Alliance Capital Management, a New York-based unit of the Equitable Companies unit of AXA S.A. of Paris. Alliance funds have $136 billion in assets under management and charge a sales fee, or load.
In the commercials, three cocksure Everymen plunge into ever more complicated tasks, certain they can cut hair, pull teeth and, most startlingly, perform do-it-yourself brain surgery. The ads run on such cable-television shows as "Crossfire" on the Cable News Network and "Biography" on the Arts & Entertainment network.
The new ads, which began last month, grew out of the "Mutual Funds Without the Mystery" theme that was developed in 1994 by Ferrell Calvillo Communications Inc. of New York, which is directing the $5 million ad campaign. Curiously, the new ads seem to contradict Alliance's ads from last year.
Last year's commercials poked fun at stock experts. In one commercial, for example, an increasingly confused man is sandwiched between two other subway riders discussing mutual funds in jaw-breaking jargon. In another, a Gypsy fortune teller spouts the similarly impenetrable babble of stock-market technical analysts.
Neither John Ferrell, president of Ferrell Calvillo, nor Mr. Carifa of Alliance sees much contradiction in the approaches. Picking the right experts is the key, they say.
The new Alliance commercials get much of their deadpan comic sensibility from Mr. Weis. ("Yeah, yeah, it's one S," was the first thing he said upon picking up the phone.) Mr. Weis, who also created the wry, slice-of-life commercials for the Ikea furniture chain, is one of the busiest commercial directors around and one of a small group that specializes in comedy.
"What we like about Gary is that his characters are funny, but still recognizably real people," said Mr. Ferrell, who hired Mr. Weis as the commercials' director.
Despite the Alliance commercials' hilarity, Mr. Weis likes to exercise his own sense of self-restraint. "You don't joke the joke," he says frequently.
But in one critical respect, he did turn up the volume. When Ferrell Calvillo hired Mr. Weis, the agency gave him two situations: a man giving himself a haircut and another man performing do-it-yourself dentistry in his den.
"They were funny," Mr. Weis said from his Santa Monica, Calif. production company, 1/33 Productions Inc. "But if that's the idea, maybe the darker, the funnier."
Mr. Weis suggested a third commercial to Ferrell Calvillo, who agreed to it as long as it didn't cost too much.
Not to worry. Rocket science might require too many effects, so why not brain surgery? Mr. Weis hired a friend, a stand-up comic, Wayne Federman, dressed him in pajamas and had him lie on his back on a table. The camera, which did not move, shot from overhead.
The first image of the commercial is an X-ray of a skull held up against a desk lamp. "Oh yeah! This is not a problem," says Mr. Federman, off screen.
The next shot is of Mr. Federman, a tape measure around his head and dishwashing gloves on his hands, as he lies next to a tray with a pizza slicer, a gavel, a hand drill and calipers. Mr. Federman holds up a book titled "Brain Surgery Made Easy."
"In mutual funds, as in life, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing," intones the disapproving announcer.
A blithe Mr. Federman measures his forehead with the calipers and says, "Well, that's close enough."
The announcer continues, "And while investing isn't brain surgery, a professional could help avoid complications."
Then, a puzzled Mr. Federman switches a mallet from his left to his right hand. "Ah! It's this hand!"
Mr. Federman next puzzles over a picture of a baboon, fiddles with an old-fashioned, hand-cranking drill and then practices moving a hacksaw across his forehead. "Too medieval," he says, with a shudder.
The last image is of a chain saw, shot from the patient's point of view. "All right, it's show time!" Then the roar of the chain saw.
The only production dilemma in the commercial, Mr. Weis said, was whether Mr. Federman should be seen starting the chain saw. "But, oh boy, I had nightmares about safety on that, so we decided no," Mr. Weis said. "Unseen is funny. Noise is funny."

HEADLINE: Report Says American Incomes Rose in June

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
Helped by higher wages, the incomes of Americans grew modestly in June, rebounding from a decline in the previous month, the Commerce Department said today. Consumer spending rose slightly.
The Commerce Department said income increased four-tenths of 1 percent in June after having fallen two-tenths of 1 percent in May, the first decline since January 1994. 
 Consumer spending increased two-tenths of 1 percent in June, slowing from May's increase of nine-tenths of 1 percent, the biggest gain in nine months. May's increase was revised upward from the gain of seven-tenths of 1 percent reported originally.
Consumer spending represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, and analysts said the figures were consistent with an economy that seemed to have hit bottom in the spring and might already be moderately reviving.
"I think we were heading into the third quarter with a little more momentum than we thought," said Joel Prakken, an economist at Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a St. Louis forecasting firm.
On Friday, the Government reported that the economy expanded at an annual rate of only half a percentage point in the second quarter, the weakest performance in nearly four years. Given that, today's figures were not a great surprise.
Analysts said some parts of today's economic report were encouraging. Private wages and salaries increased in all major parts of the economy. Spending on costly durable goods, an indicator of consumer confidence, was relatively strong.
Outlays for big-ticket durable goods like cars and appliances rose 2.6 percent in June, in contrast to increases of two-tenths of 1 percent for both services and nondurable goods like food and fuel.
"The underlying level on the demand side is pretty good," said Raymond Worseck of A. G. Edwards & Sons Inc., an investment firm in St. Louis.
The Commerce Department said that disposable income -- income after taxes -- rose just three-tenths of 1 percent in June following a gain of eight-tenths of 1 percent the previous month. Higher tax payments in April, required by a 1993 law, followed by smaller payments in May explained the increase in disposable income in the latter month despite the overall drop in pay.
The combination of incomes and spending meant the savings rate, or savings as a percentage of disposable income, remained at 4.1 percent in June. Before May, the savings rate had not been that low since November, when it was also 4.1 percent.
Private wages and salaries, the most closely watched component of income, increased at a $19.6 billion annual rate in June, in contrast to a $23 billion decline in May. Personal income also includes income from such sources as dividends, interest and businesses.

U.S. Trade Negotiator Urges Shift in Approach on Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 31

 BODY:
In a sign that the United States might be seeking a new approach to trade relations with Japan, a senior Clinton Administration official repudiated the confrontational tactics employed by the two nations and called instead today for a new framework based on cooperation.
"A relationship between the world's two biggest trading nations that is characterized by one trade confrontation after another seems as anachronistic as the old gunboat diplomacy," Jeffrey E. Garten, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, said in a speech here. 
 Mr. Garten's speech came only a month after Washington and Tokyo reached an agreement on trade in automobiles and auto parts, ending one of the nastiest disputes between the two nations after two years of negotiations.
The Clinton Administration has hammered hard at what it sees as Japanese trade barriers. The new call for peace could reflect frustration with the auto talks, especially because the resulting agreement did not yield what Washington wanted in terms of quantifiable commitments by Japanese car manufacturers to purchase more American parts.
Mr. Garten, who was one of Washington's two lead negotiators in the auto talks, said the trade framework signed by the two countries in 1993 was fine for governing negotiations aimed at reaching specific trade agreements and would be maintained. But he said a much broader framework was needed to cover discussions about such issues as the role of the World Trade Organization and different systems of business competition in each country, which is becoming a major trade issue.
"Amazingly enough, these kinds of 'policy planning' discussions almost never happen now," he said in his speech to foreign correspondents. "Virtually all of our time is spent in contentious negotiations."
Mr. Garten said his proposal "isn't meant to be a policy announcement as such, but certainly we in the Administration would like to see a new environment in our relationship with Japan."
A Japanese Government official who has been involved in trade talks with the United States reacted with caution to Mr. Garten's proposals, but he was mildly positive.
"Basically, I think it's a relubrication of the dialogue mechanism," the official said. "I don't sense he has anything very concrete in mind." He added, "I don't think this is official U.S. policy."
But the Japanese official, who spoke on the condition he not be identified, said Tokyo also believed that there should be more discussions about trade that were not aimed solely at negotiating the latest agreement. "It's a shared kind of sense that we should talk to each other more," he said.
Mr. Garten, who is in Japan on what is seen as a fence-mending mission after the combative auto talks, said that forging a new cooperative relationship would not be easy and that the old pattern of confrontation might continue.
For a cooperative approach to work, he said, Japan must vigorously deregulate its economy and both countries must strive to make existing agreements work. In addition, business executives in the two nations must take a more active role in resolving problems, he said.
Mr. Garten's proposals were not all new. Groups of Japanese and American executives have already been established to try to solve trade problems. The United States has also long pressed Japan on the issue of competition policy, urging, for instance, that Japan's Government be more assertive in enforcing antitrust laws against such practices as bid rigging and exclusionary relationships between Japanese distributors and manufacturers.
While Mr. Garten said the 1993 trade framework was too narrow, it was proclaimed to be very broad on the day it was signed. It was also intended, as President Clinton said at the time, to put the trade relationship "on a footing of mutual respect and mutual responsibility," and to end fruitless confrontations.

HEADLINE: We're Creating Jobs In the Third World

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Bob Herbert's "Sweatshop Beneficiaries" (column, July 24) misses the mark on the beneficiaries of United States companies sewing clothing in the Caribbean and Central America. Our company, like many of our competitors, has been manufacturing brassieres in the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti and Colombia for the past 25 years. 
 Our wages are comparable to the other sewing factories in these areas, and like many of them, we provide breakfast and medical care for our employees. In addition to the sewers who earn between 75 cents and $1.25 an hour, these factories have local supervisors, who earn between $100 and $400 a week.
The real unemployment rate in these countries approaches 50 percent and these jobs are eagerly sought. In addition, the United States imposes a duty that amounts to a dollar on every dollar we pay the sewing operators in these countries. In this competitive environment we would not sell a single bra if our price was not reflective of labor cost.
The presidents of the Gap and J. C. Penney do not earn their large salaries because they promote bras made with what Mr. Herbert calls exploited labor. They earn them because they are good merchants. There are plenty of retailers who have gone bankrupt and who are now out of business even though they carried these same garments made in the same factories. Until Mr. Herbert can find a better income source for these people, he should not criticize those who provide these jobs.

HEADLINE: We're Creating Jobs In the Third World;
A.I.D.'s Role

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Sweatshop Beneficiaries" (column, July 24) outlines difficult worker conditions and low wages in several developing countries. The Clinton Administration has taken an active role in addressing the issues Bob Herbert raises, insuring that taxpayer dollars go to develop new markets for United States products while creating jobs in the United States. 
 The Free Trade Zone program has not been funded since 1992, and no taxpayer dollars have gone to support such trade zones since that time. Under a law passed in 1992, the financing of these trade zones was prohibited in the Foreign Assistance Appropriations Act of 1993.
Brian Atwood, Agency for International Development Administrator, took this further in 1993 by issuing stronger guidelines prohibiting the use of all A.I.D. funds, regardless of the year appropriated, that might promote the "export of U.S. jobs."
A.I.D. works in developing countries around the world to insure that worker rights are protected. In El Salvador it has worked with the Government to bring labor codes in conformity with internationally recognized standards of workers rights. A.I.D. has maintained dialogue with the Salvadoran Government and with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to institute proper enforcement mechanisms for these newly established codes.
As Mr. Atwood said to Congress last year: "We feel very strongly that we should not be exporting American jobs, period. We ought to be exporting American goods."
The policies we have established promote this, while working to protect worker rights in these countries.

Declaring that "this Congress is on the wrong track," President Clinton lashed out today at the 104th Congress as the captive of polluters and gun lobbyists. And he threatened to veto the bill that pays Congress's administrative expenses unless it makes faster progress in passing Federal spending bills to his liking.
At the same time, Mr. Clinton repeated his hope that he can yet find "common ground" with the Republican majority on Capitol Hill on welfare overhaul, campaign finance reform and a balanced budget, and said that the challenge of doing so has "not been debilitating, it's been invigorating." [Excerpts, page A12.] 
The President delivered his mixed message in an informal news conference called to denounce the House's passage on Monday of a bill that would limit the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to enforce pollution laws -- a measure the President derided today as a "polluter's protection act."
But Mr. Clinton quickly broadened his attack, raising or renewing veto threats against a handful of other bills working their way through Congress on issues from telecommunications to ending American participation in the United Nations arms embargo on Bosnia. He noted that the limits on environmental regulation were restored to a spending bill just days after a bipartisan coalition had voted to block them on the ground that they would allow increased pollution, and he said the turnabout came because an army of lobbyists had gone to work.
"You can see who's in control in this Congress," the President said, citing the environmental bill, as well as Speaker Newt Gingrich's pledge to the National Rifle Association earlier this year, reported today in The Washington Post, that no gun-control legislation would come out of committee in his tenure. "And it's not good."
Aides said Mr. Clinton's threat was intended to show that while he wanted cooperation with Congress, he would not accept it at any price.
"Part of encouraging cooperation is holding out your hand," one senior White House aide said. "But there are times when a rolled up newspaper on the nose has its uses." Another aide described the President's remarks as "a 2-by-4 across the eyes."
Predictably, Tony Blankley, the spokesman for Mr. Gingrich, had another view.
"Having read the President's screed, I am struck by the fact that he now seems to be intoxicated with his own political impotence," Mr. Blankley said. "He seems freed from any sense that his words have any meaning whatsoever, and he roams around the landscape saying things he knows are not true." Mr. Blankley was referring to the effects of the environmental bill.
"I think he's trying to get attention," Mr. Blankley added. "It's what minority parties who don't have any power often do."
Mr. Clinton's latest threat -- to veto the bill that pays the costs of running Congress and entities under its control, like the Library of Congress and Congressional Budget Office -- amounted to a virtual declaration of war with the legislative branch. Not since Woodrow Wilson in 1920 has a President vetoed an appropriation for the legislature's workings, and only then as part of a broader veto of spending for all three branches of Government, according to the Senate Appropriations Committee's staff director, J. Keith Kennedy.
"I don't think Congress should take care of its own business before it takes care of the people's business," Mr. Clinton said, complaining that House and Senate negotiators had agreed on the terms of their own appropriations while continuing to wrangle over most of the rest of Government spending. "If the Congressional leadership follows through on its plan to send me its own funding bill before it finishes work on the rest of the budget, I will be compelled to veto it."
But House and Senate aides noted that the administrative appropriation to run Congress is always among the first spending bills passed, precisely because it does not involve controversial policy questions or programs dear to constituents, and that Mr. Clinton signed it promptly last year. The bill for the fiscal year that starts on Oct. 1 would cut spending by about $200 million, to $2.1 billion from $2.3 billion.
"There is nothing controversial about the legislative appropriations bill," said Representative Robert L. Livingston, the Louisiana Republican who heads the House Appropriations Committe. "It shows that Congress is committed to cutting itself first. The President has no substantive grounds for a veto."
A veto would have little immediate effect, because the legislative appropriation would not take effect until the new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1, and it would ultimately get caught up in the dispute over the other spending bills, anyway.
White House aides said the Republicans had abrograted the genteel non-aggression pact that has traditionally prevailed between both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue on such matters by threatening to shrink or abolish White House agencies like the Council of Economic Advisers or the Office of Drug Control Policy.
"The point the President is making is that this is an important point of leverage in getting them to think more seriously about the larger budget issues," said the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry.
It now appears possible that the legislative appropriation may be the only spending bill to reach Mr. Clinton's desk before the vacation recess later this month. Vetoing it would let the President make the point that he is pressing for agreement on other spending bills, while accusing Congress of trying to force him to accept its priorities or risk shutting down the Government when the fiscal year ends.
Despite Mr. Clinton's repeated vows to veto legislation like the E.P.A. spending bill, the leaders of several major environmental groups said today that they did not trust him to follow through.
At a breakfast with reporters, the environmentalists condemned Mr. Clinton for signing a spending bill this week that contained a provision overriding all existing environmental laws in order to encourage increased logging on Federal lands when they are endangered by fire, pests or drought.
"His moral compass is swinging so wildly that it is impossible to know where the Administration will end up," said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club.

HEADLINE: ALLIES EXTENDING SHIELD TO PROTECT ALL BOSNIA HAVENS

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 1

 BODY:
The NATO allies today extended the protection of Western air power to all the so-called safe areas in Bosnia, including Sarajevo, warning that attacks on the enclaves would meet a "firm and rapid" bombing campaign.
The decision to broaden the Western threat against rebel Serbs' aggression reflected a growing sense among the allies that the recent show of Western resolve may be succeeding. 
 Since NATO agreed on July 21 that it would send warplanes if the Bosnian Serbs persisted in their threat to one protected area, Gorazde, Bosnian Serb forces have halted their advance against that enclave and directed their soldiers elsewhere.
Under today's agreement, United Nations military commanders in Bosnia could call in air attacks in case of a concerted assault on Tuzla in eastern Bosnia, on the capital, Sarajevo, or on Bihac, to the west, without having to seek approval from United Nations civilian authorities in New York or Zagreb, diplomats in Brussels said.
"Military preparations which are judged to represent a direct threat to the U.N. safe areas or direct attacks upon them will be met with the firm and rapid response of NATO air power," said NATO's Secretary General, Willy Claes.
The allies also threatened a countrywide campaign of air strikes against Bosnian Serb air defenses and other military targets if the Serbs pressed attacks on the protected enclaves, but such a broad campaign would require the approval of the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
After many weeks in which the allies seemed plagued by indecision and disarray, they have now united in a gamble: Any further attack on the safe areas will oblige NATO to make good on its threat to bomb the attackers or suffer one of the worst ever setbacks to its credibility.
NATO did not publicly spell out what would constitute an "attack," but the allies appear to mean a massing of forces or a frontal assault like the ones the Bosnian Serbs used to seize Srebrenica and Zepa last month. The threat would have to go beyond the shelling and sniper fire that are daily miseries in Sarajevo, or the fierce skirmishing that has swirled around the Bihac region without directly menacing the safe area.
Explaining that NATO's initial warning against an attack on Gorazde had been heeded, Mr. Claes said the intention now was to "underpin the search for a political settlement."
"We urge all parties both in Croatia and in Bosnia to exercise restraint and to desist from military action," he said after a three-hour meeting of alliance ambassadors today. "We call on them to enter into serious negotiations to achieve a lasting peace throughout the former Yugoslavia."
But while recent military offensives by Bosnian Serbs -- and by neighboring Croatia, which has joined the fight against Serbs near the Bihac enclave -- have drastically changed the situation on the ground this summer, the prospects for a negotiated solution to keep war from spreading are still clouded by disagreements among the major powers.
All parties to the conflict have different reasons to think that they have more to gain on the battlefield than at the negotiating table in the next month or two, these diplomats say, and disunity among the Western allies and Russia about what a negotiated outcome should look like has undermined the effectiveness of diplomacy.
"The Muslims in the Government won't negotiate seriously as long as they think they can still get NATO and the Americans involved on their side," a European diplomat said. Today's vote in the United States House of Representatives in favor of breaking the arms embargo on Bosnia would encourage such a view in Sarajevo, the diplomat indicated.
The current basis for peace negotiations is a plan backed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia last year that would give the Bosnian Muslims and Croats 51 percent of Bosnian territory and the Serbs 49 percent, as opposed to the more than 70 percent the Serbs now hold. Despite pressure from Serbia to accept the plan, the Bosnian Serbs were the only party to the conflict to reject it last winter.
That plan, by the countries referred to as the contact group, envisioned an eastern corridor for the Muslim Government from Sarajevo through Gorazde to the Muslim enclaves of Zepa and Srebrenica. The Bosnian Serbs took the last two enclaves by force last month, and NATO and the United Nations have threatened them with intense bombing if they attack Gorazde.
France's Prime Minister, Alain Juppe, and its Defense Minister, Charles Millon, are now openly suggesting that the peace plan's map should be revised to reflect changes in the situation on the ground.
"The French, the British and the Russians would be only too happy to accept the Serbs' redrawing of the map in the eastern half of the country and press for a realistic settlement that would leave Sarajevo and central Bosnia in Bosnian Government hands, but the United States and Germany won't accept it," a European diplomat with negotiating experience in the conflict said.
Dr. Philip H. Gordon, a senior research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, said, "The contact group plan obviously has been rendered out of date by events."
"You can still imagine a diplomatic deal being done to trade off Gorazde to the Serbs and leave the Government with Sarajevo, as part of an overall settlement," Dr. Gordon said in a telephone interview. "But it's much harder to see the tradeoff in Bihac."
One contact group official said today: "The eastern enclaves were always just bargaining chips for Sarajevo, though we could never say so. But last month they became pawn sacrifices without anything in return."
The European Union's peace negotiator, former Prime Minister Carl Bildt of Sweden, flew to Washington today for meetings with American officials on Wednesday after consulting with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and President Jacques Chirac of France this week.
Diplomats said they expected Mr. Bildt to argue for American acceptance of a long-sought deal under which the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, would recognize Bosnia and Croatia within their existing borders in exchange for lifting economic sanctions.
"We think that Carl Bildt has made some progress, and we continue to support his negotiating efforts, but they have not yet reached the point where we see an equitable solution," Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. Holbrooke said in a telephone interview from Washington.
American officials said the United States wanted the agreement to provide for strong international monitoring of the Serbian-Bosnian border to insure that Serbia is true to the commitment it made not to supply the Bosnian Serbs with weapons and soldiers to carry on the fighting.
After the Muslim Government called on Croatia for help in Bihac, Croats advanced a good part of the way over the weekend toward creating the enlarged Government-controlled enclave at the western tip of the country that the contact group's plan envisions.
Many Europeans believe that the security of both Sarajevo and Bihac would have to be guaranteed by a United Nations force even after a settlement, Mr. Gordon said.
But first the Muslims, Croats and Serbs would have to agree to one. The last time their representatives talked together was Feb. 12, 1994.
Some international experts on the war say recent fighting, including attempts by Croatia to reclaim its Krajina region from Croatian Serbs, have only complicated prospects for peace.
Croatian Government and rebel Serb negotiators agreed, however, to meet in Geneva on Thursday, according to the United Nations, but the United Nations envoy, Yasushi Akashi, warned, "The danger of a full-scale war is increasing."

Westinghouse and CBS Agree to $5.4 Billion Deal
Westinghouse has agreed to pay $5.4 billion, or $81 a share, for CBS, the last independent television network and once the crown jewel of broadcasting.
Westinghouse has decided to borrow heavily to bet on broadcasting, its most profitable operation. The deal would create a company with 15 television stations and 39 radio stations, with access to more than a third of the nation's households. [Page A1.]
 
Laurence A. Tisch's venture into media ended up tarnishing his reputation. That, according to many of his friends, is a bitter pill for a man who took the top job at CBS to enhance his power and broaden his legacy. [A1.]
 
Roger C. Altman, the investment banker turned Deputy Treasury Secretary whose Washington career fizzled last year, is the lead adviser to Westinghouse, and that has Wall Street buzzing. [D7.]
 
Conventional media companies, though in demand now, still face a challenge from new media technologies, analysts say. But it may take longer than once expected. [D5.]
 
Auto Sales Edged Up in July
Sales of cars and light trucks in July drifted below June's moderate pace, but appeared narrowly to beat the results of July 1994 because of hefty rebates. [D3.]
 
Economic Reports Show Strength
The National Association of Purchasing Management index rose more than expected in July, to 50.5, while construction spending increased nine-tenths of 1 percent in June, the largest increase in nine months. [D2.]
 
The strong reports showed a rebounding economy and pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond up to 6.90 percent. [D18.]
 
Digital in a Profitable Year
Digital Equipment posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $159.8 million, or $1.01 a share, its third consecutive profitable quarter. The company also reported its first annual profit since 1990. [D8.]
 
Analysts' Files Subpoenaed
The records, files and personal notes of five securities analysts who specialize in tobacco stocks were subpoenaed by a consortium of law firms as part of a giant class-action against tobacco companies. [D2.]
 
Banking Legislation Delayed
House Republican leaders have agreed to postpone any banking legislation until at least late September or October. [D2.]
 
Tokyo Credit Union Gets Loans
The Bank of Japan issued special loans to rescue Tokyo's largest credit union. Its troubles had threatened to spark turmoil in the nation's banking system. [D4.]
 
Official's Trade Speech Disavowed
The Administration disavowed a Commerce Department official's call on Monday for a less confrontational and more cooperative trade relationship with Japan. [D4.]
 
Interim Head for Labor Group
Thomas R. Donahue became the interim president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., but whether he can keep the job depends on how rapidly he can bring change to the shrinking federation before the election of a permanent president in October. He promised to begin pouring millions of dollars immediately into helping unions enroll new members. [A9.]
 
F.T.C. Accuses Car Dealers
The Federal Trade Commission accused the a California car dealers Association of conspiring to restrain trade and deprive "consumers of truthful information" by withdrawing advertising from The San Jose Mercury News. Advertising. [D3.]

HEADLINE: Monday's Speed Demon Is Tuesday's Law Abider

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: SUFFERN, N.Y., Aug. 1

 BODY:
Kevin Carrol was plodding along the highway at 55 miles per hour in his Jeep this morning when he came upon a road sign that shook him up just a bit.
"It said 65 miles per hour!" said Mr. Carrol, marveling at his discovery on Interstate 84. "As soon as I saw it, I just hit the gas, boom, and passed a bunch of cars." 
 Thousands of drivers across New York State were free to burn a little more rubber -- an additional 10 miles per hour, to be exact -- today after the new speed limit of 65 m.p.h. took effect on 1,100 miles of highway in the less populated areas north of New York City.
The switch, which makes New York the 46th state to raise its speed limit above 55, came with little fanfare or celebration. Most people greeted it with the same sort of silent pleasure that they experience over the extra hour of sleep that comes each fall when clocks are set back.
"It's nice to have the ability to get somewhere a little quicker without worrying about getting a ticket," said Mr. Carrol, a business consultant who drives up to six hours a day to visit clients around the state. "I took advantage of it right away."
Motorists seemed to be complying with the new limit. By late yesterday afternoon, the state police reported no speed-related accidents on highways where the change took effect.
"From outward appearances, we've had a positive response from the public," said Maj. Gregory Sitler, who heads the Division of Traffic Services for the state police. "I wouldn't anticipate anything out of the ordinary today."
Under the old law, most drivers understood that troopers would rarely make a speeding arrest for anyone driving under 70. But the state police have vowed to vigorously enforce the new limit.
Still, the switch did not suit everyone, and the cautious were wary. John McFeeley of Staten Island refused to drive his van faster than 55, even though he was holding up his two-van caravan on the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway.
"I'm happy with the 55 miles per hour," Mr. McFeeley said as he and his companions stopped at a service station here on their way to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.
"It's a safe speed," continued Mr. McFeeley, who would feel at home in the four states -- Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware and Hawaii -- that have not raised their limits to 65 m.p.h. "It's a speed limit that you can still control the car if, God forbid, something goes wrong."
The driver of the other van, Tony Diprima of Brooklyn, did not see it that way. "I figured with the new speed limit, we could have cut at least a half hour out of our trip," he said. "But he's driving a half hour behind me. I had to tell him to speed it up."
John Tomasulo, who drives a bus that shuttles people from New York City to a Sullivan County resort, felt the switch was overdue because many drivers had long ignored the 55-m.p.h. limit.
It was a situation that he found particularly frustrating, because he usually observed the old speed limit, given the harsh penalties bus drivers can face if they start accumulating speeding tickets.
"I was afraid of losing my license," said Mr. Tomasulo, saying that bus driving was his sole means of income. "But it was a real problem to be blocking the flow of traffic on the road all the time. I almost always had to stay in the right lane."
More than a few people figured the change would spare them time on the road, only to have their hopes dashed by -- what else? -- traffic.
Jimmy Davis said he was making great time at 65 m.p.h. on his drive back home to Tarrytown after spending a few days in the Catskills.
Then road construction funneled cars, buses and trucks into a single lane of crawling traffic. Once that cleared up, the highway clogged up again, this time because of a tractor-trailer accident.
"I thought I was going to save at least a half hour off my total trip," Mr. Davis said, who had no such luck.
Most people considered the new speed limit in terms of their own narrow interests. But at a ceremony today in Clifton Park, Gov. George E. Pataki looked at the bigger picture. He said the change should help the state's economy, making it more attractive to the trucking industry.
News of the change had not reached everyone.
Vienna Anderson, driving on Interstate 87, began to panic the moment she spotted a police cruiser in her rear-view mirror and realized she was traveling well above 55.
"I saw the policeman behind me," she said. "I said, 'Oh, no. I hope he's not coming after me.' I thought he caught me."
Ms. Anderson, who was on her way to Washington, added: "Isn't that silly. I didn't even know they had raised the speed limit."
Kurt Sachno, a truck driver, had heard all about the change. But his company, Baxter Healthcare Corporation in Montgomery, N.Y., has not lifted the 55 m.p.h. restriction it keeps on its drivers.
The company keeps track of the drivers' speed by equipping each truck with a computer. "There's talk that they'll change the policy now that there's a new speed limit," Mr. Sachno said. "I hope they do, because it's a hazard to be driving 55 when everyone else is flying by you."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From President's News Conference at White House

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the question-and-answer portion of President Clinton's news conference at the White House today, as recorded by Reuters and the Federal Information Systems Corporation, a private transcription service:
 
Opening Statement
 Looking over the last few days, it is clear that this Congress is on the wrong track. I began the year hoping to make bipartisan progress on balancing the budget, on reducing paperwork, reforming regulations and welfare. And therefore, I was very pleased last week when a bipartisan majority voted to reject the extreme anti-environment provisions adopted in the House committee. That was the right thing to do.
But then the lobbyists for the polluters went to work. They got the leadership of the House of Representatives to call the bill back up, and last night in a remarkable exercise of special interest power, the House voted to gut environmental and public health protections. It was a stealth attack on our environment in the guise of a budget bill.
The bill would effectively end Federal enforcement of the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act, a bill that my Republican predecessor said was his proudest legislative achievement. It allows poisons in our drinking water, raw sewage on our beaches, oil refineries to pollute, and limits a community's right to know what chemicals are toxic which are released in their neighborhoods. It would be bad for our children, our health and our environment.
This is Washington's special interest politics at its most effective and at its worst. Even before these 17 special interest provisions were added, the bill had already dramatically undercut environmental protection by cutting environmental enforcement in half.
You don't need to damage the environment to balance the budget. Our budget demonstrates that, and the budget the American people get out of this session of Congress ought to demonstrate that.
In the past few days, a battalion of lobbyists has swarmed Capitol Hill, exerting enormous pressure to save these loopholes. I said I would use the power of my office to help people, not polluters. I believe we can protect the environment and grow the economy.
So on this so-called environmental bill, my message to the American people should be very, very clear. Don't worry. We'll make common sense reforms, but the minute this polluter's protection act hits my desk, I will veto it.
One of the most interesting things that has received not too much notice in the last few days is that while Congress has been taking care of the special interests, it's also taking care of itself. It is way behind schedule on virtually every budget bill in the hope, apparently, of enforcing a choice at the end of this fiscal year, between shutting the Government down and adopting extreme budget cuts, which will be bad for our country, bad for our economy, and bad for our future.
Apparently they don't even plan on letting the American people see their planned Medicare cuts until the last possible minute. But one bill, wouldn't you know it, is right on schedule. The bill that funds the Congress, its staff and its operations. I don't think Congress should take care of its own business before it takes care of the people's business.
If the Congressional leadership follows through on its plan to send me its own funding bill before it finishes work on the rest of the budget, I will be compelled to veto it. I want to work with Congress to pass a balanced budget to protect the health and security of the American people. A balanced budget that strengthens our economy and raises the incomes of our people and the future prospects of our children. . . .
 
Q. Mr. President, your policies and your judgment calls appear to be under siege on Capitol Hill; Waco, Whitewater, Bosnia, social programs, and so forth. How debilitating has this been on you personally, on your administration, on the country? And obviously you're whistling in the dark if you think you're going to have common ground.
 
A. I disagree. It's not been debilitating, it's been invigorating. And I wouldn't be so surprised. There are two significant things that I would say, big issues that have become clear in the last few days. One is, you can see who's in control in this Congress. Who's in control of the people that compel this unusual revote on the environmental issues.
You see the story on the N.R.A. today. No gun control will be voted out of committee or on the floor of the House. I'm sure glad we got the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban first. And I still think we ought to have a ban on the cop-killer bullets. You see, we're investigating -- this Congress -- is investigating the A.A.R.P. and letting the N.R.A. run one of its own investigations. So you see who's in control. That's the first thing you see.
The second thing you see is more hopeful. There were, after all, 50 Republicans who broke ranks in the House and said that they would put the environment ahead of party. Senator Dole, yesterday, said that in Vermont at the Governor's Conference that he wanted to pass a welfare reform bill free of the extremist provisions which the members of his caucus, some of them, had demanded that he put on a welfare reform bill. And so we may be moving toward finding common ground in welfare reform.
So you see two things: you see who's in control, and it's not good. You see some people feeling uncomfortable about it and we may be able to make some progress. . . .
 
Q. Speaking of special interest, do you feel that the Speaker is dragging his feet on the bipartisan campaign finance reform commission, and what else are you willing to do to make sure that that happens?
 
A. Dragging his feet is an apt but inadequate description of what has happened. I mean, we shook hands on that in New Hampshire. I thought it was a fairly simple deal. The man said that the gentleman asked this question. He said, why don't you guys do a base closing commission? We said O.K. Five days later I wrote a letter to the Speaker, I didn't get an answer. Five weeks later, I wrote, I said again, O.K., here are two people that are the counter people that I would put on this commission and I would like for them to get with someone you designate and we'll set it up. . . .
 
Q. Mr. President, we know that you have just met with the leadership to try and make your, your veto of the Bosnia arms embargo lifting stick. But in the event that it doesn't and not knowing as we speak what the size of the margin is going to be, what is the next step? What else would you look to do?
 
A. Whatever the vote is, we still might sustain a veto. But I was encouraged by a few people who told me that they had decided on reflection that it was not the thing to do now. The Rapid Reaction Force, after all, is showing some strength there. And I would remind you that the only thing that has ever worked in the last two and a half years is when the Bosnian Serbs thought the United Nations would permit NATO and the Americans who are working with NATO, to use air power to stop the aggression so that there would have to be a negotiated settlement.
And in the last several days, the last couple weeks in Gorazde, you know we've gotten five convoys through, there has been no assault on it. And I think that this new strategy will work if we can hammer out a negotiated settlement and there is a new effort there. . . .
 
Q. Can you tell us, first of all, why you want to veto the telecommunications bill? I understand that you're concerned about concentration of media power. And in regard to that, can you comment on the merger yesterday between ABC and Walt Disney and the proposed merger, it may happen today, between CBS and Westinghouse, and whether you see this concentration of power happen?
 
A. Well, I think first of all, you have to take on these mergers under our law, and as a matter of economics, you have to take them case-by-case and analyze them. And all I know about the proposed mergers is what I read this morning when I woke up. So I can't comment on that. I do think it would be an error to set up a situation in the United States where one person could own half the television stations in the country or half of any of the media outlets and we don't have a Fairness Doctrine anymore and we don't have----.
Particularly if we took the Federal Government out of, all the Federal agencies out of any kind of maintenance of competition, or maintenance of competitive environment, taking the Justice Department out of it, for example.
I would remind you that we have the most successful telecommunications operations in the world, partly because we have had the proper balance between a highly competitive environment and an openness to new forces and new technologies and new entries in it from all around the world. I want very badly to sign the telecommunications bill. We tried to pass one, this Administration did during the last session of Congress. . . .

HEADLINE: Grand Opening in Texas: The First Edison School

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SHERMAN, Tex., Aug. 1

 BODY:
An Apple computer for every child to take home. An E-mail system and a computer "chat room" allowing schoolchildren, their parents and their teachers to communicate at any time of day. A school day that is an hour and a half longer than the national average, and a school year that is 30 days longer. Special classes in everything from dance to personal finance to character and ethics. Spanish for everyone.
These were just a few of the things offered when pupils arrived at George Washington Elementary School today for the first day of classes. George Washington is the first school in the nation to open in partnership with the Edison Project, an ambitious venture whose mission is to provide a superior education at prevailing public-school costs and make money for its investors at the same time. 
 The opening of Washington today and of three other Edison-run schools in the coming weeks, in Kansas, Michigan and Massachusetts, is a far cry from the original vision of Edison's founder, Christopher Whittle, who once talked of raising $2.3 billion to build hundreds of new profit-making schools from scratch.
Nonetheless, Edison officials, including the venture's president, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., former president of Yale University, suggested that the partnership here and with other existing public schools could yet become a touchstone in a transformation of how Americans think about the estimated $280 billion spent yearly on American public education.
And educators in this manufacturing city near the Oklahoma border were clearly dazzled, especially by Edison's promise to speed George Washington's pupils (kindergartners through fourth graders) -- and their parents -- into the high-technology age.
"Can you imagine what this means if you're home sick?" said a beaming Sherman School Superintendent, Dr. Bob Denton. "The teacher can just put stuff in the student's E-mail, and that afternoon, if you're feeling better, you can call up your homework and do it. There's no place to hide anymore!"
In truth, opening day of the new school year at the two-story beige-brick school was little different in many respects from that in any other American public school. Most of the computers remained packed in boxes for now -- pupils will not get to take them home until they complete a training course -- and some teachers said that even they did not yet have a password with which to log on.
But within weeks, George Washington will become "the most high-tech school in America," Mr. Schmidt pledged in an interview.
Every teacher will have an Apple laptop to use throughout the day. And Dr. Denton said parents would be encouraged to use the computers as well, to communicate messages to teachers and to call up, say, announcements about coming meetings or tips on parenting.
Many parents seemed perhaps even more thrilled than their children at the prospect of becoming computer-literate.
"Definitely in our world, you've got to get into computers if you're going to go anywhere," said Reatha Abshire, the mother of Spencer West, a third grader.
The opening of the partnership school was preceded by a deluge of applications from outside the immediate neighborhood; 140 children transferred in and swelled George Washington's enrollment to about 500. Only 15 or so pupils asked to be transferred out, Dr. Denton said.
For the standard per-pupil cost of a given school district -- around $4,500 annually at the elementary school here -- Edison pledges to dramatically improve education and test scores, in part by providing a computer in every home, lengthening the school day (to eight hours for elementary students), extending the school year (to 205 school days) and giving teachers monthlong training sessions, or "institutes," in the summer.
What remains utterly unclear is just whether the Edison Project can make money. Mr. Whittle, the maverick entrepreneur whose extravagant personal spending habits and mixed financial success in several other projects have generated devastating publicity in the last year or so, unabashedly insists that the venture will prove profitable.
Edison has spent about $45 million on research and development of a curriculum and school model, and earlier this year obtained $30 million more from investors, including Mr. Whittle, money that is allowing it to open schools here and in Mount Clemens, Mich., Boston and Wichita, Kan., this year and 7 to 10 more schools next fall.
"We're not making money right now, and we won't for another two to three years," Mr. Whittle said. "We will begin making money when we have a relatively large system."
The average American school district operates just six schools; operating hundreds will allow Edison to achieve economies of scale that will both pay for the educational extras and generate profits, said Mr. Whittle, who has spoken of investment returns ultimately reaching 10 percent.
That is Mr. Whittle's theory, anyway. Some educators have dismissed it out of hand. "It's la-la land," Sandra Feldman, the president of the United Federation of Teachers in New York City, told a conference on privatization of the schools last year.
But some experts are not skeptical at all. One who thinks Edison could ultimately prove profitable is Michael Moe, an analyst with Lehman Brothers who tracks the venture and the handful of other private companies trying to run public schools for profit.
"I think clearly when you look at the amount of money that is spent on public education in this country, the possibility of bringing some rationalization to the services provided and still enhancing the quality of the services is very, very real," Mr. Moe said in a telephone interview today. Mr. Moe noted that half the money spent on education went to purposes outside the classroom. "There is not another service business in the world," he said, "where 50 percent of the money is allocated outside of where the service is rendered."
At the ribbon cutting today, in front of a huge sign that read, "Welcome to an Awesome Learning Adventure," Mr. Whittle and Mr. Schmidt were given a hero's welcome, and Sherman's Mayor, Julie Ellis Starr, gave them keys to the city. Rick Tichenor, the vice president of the school board, said, "In Texas, I think we hit the Lotto jackpot winner."
While the computers generated by far the most attention, Mr. Whittle urged teachers, parents, and schoolchildren to focus on other aspects of the curriculum as well. He cited the longer day and year, the immersion in foreign languages and the character-and-ethics component, in which, among other things, students are urged to make their own trading cards depicting their personal heroes and including vital statistics and history.
"The computers are only 10 to 15 percent of what we're doing here," Mr. Whittle said in an interview. "There are much more important things going on that you don't see right now."

HEADLINE: Thomas E. Morgan Dies at 88; Was Congressman for 32 Years

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Dr. Thomas E. Morgan, a longtime Democratic member of Congress who had championed bipartisanship as head of the House Committee on International Relations for 18 years, died on Monday in Greene County Memorial Hospital in Waynesburg, Pa. He was 88 and lived in Fredericktown, Pa.
For much of his 32-year tenure, Dr. Morgan was the only practicing physician in Congress. His medical skills came into play on March 1, 1954, when four Puerto Rican nationalists, firing from a spectators' gallery, sprayed the House chamber with bullets, wounding five members. "Doc" Morgan, as he was affectionately known, applied bandages and in one case a tourniquet to the victims. 
 An imposing figure, he was 6 feet 4 inches tall and weighed 240 pounds. After retiring from politics in 1976, he continued to practice medicine until he was 80 in Fredericktown, a community of 1,237 people in southwestern Pennsylvania, where he maintained a large house "with 67 doors" overlooking the Monongahela River.
Dr. Morgan became interested in politics when he was a youth. He served on the Fredericktown City Council in the 1930's but quit when it interfered with his medical practice. When the Democratic leadership for Pennsylvania's 24th Congressional District asked him to run for Congress in 1944, he accepted and won handily; he was re-elected to each succeeding Congress until he retired.
Dr. Morgan was named chairman of what was then called the House Foreign Affairs Committee in 1958 at a time when that committee was overshadowed by its Senate counterpart, the Foreign Relations Committee. He had a reputation of supporting the Administration's foreign policy, whether the President was a Democrat or a Republican. But in his latter years he opposed President Richard M. Nixon's policy of involvement in Vietnam and President Gerald R. Ford's intention to provide assistance to anti-Communist forces in Angola.
Thomas Ellsworth Morgan was born on Oct. 13, 1906, in the small Pennsylvania mining town of Ellsworth, one of eight children of William and Mary Morgan. His father, an immigrant from Wales, was a coal miner. As a boy he worked in the mines, cleaning lamps and picking slate.
The lessons of this heritage were reflected decades later in his Congressional career, when he promoted legislation to grant Federal assistance for the retraining of thousands of unemployed miners and to sustain President Harry S. Truman's stance on maintaining liberal immigration policies.
He received a bachelor of science degree from Waynesburg College in Pennsylvania in 1930 and a medical degree from Wayne University in Detroit in 1934.
He met his future wife, the former Winifred Strait, while interning at Grace Hospital in Detroit, where she was a nurse. They married in 1937.
Besides his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Mary Ann Youngwood of Potomac, Md., two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Reclaiming A Lost Zone;
One-Man Drive Helps Tenants Battle Drugs

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC 

 BODY:
Lee Morgan, a 58-year-old woman living in one of Brooklyn's most crime-wracked neighborhoods, scoffed at the young man with the leather eye patch and the tinted-blond braids when he made his pitch about restoring decency to the building she calls home.
"I wasn't interested in anything he was going to do with this building," said Ms. Morgan, describing her view of Lyndrew Nesmith. To her, he was just another tenant-organizing quack talking as if he could summon Jesus himself to cast out the drug addicts infesting the hallway of her four-story East New York walk-up, wash away the urine and graffiti and sweep up the empty crack vials that crunched underfoot in the stairwells every morning. 
 Now, 10 months later, the crack vials, the graffiti and the urine stench are gone. A new outside door with a $1,500 magnetic lock keeps the drug rabble out. And members of the tenant association that Mr. Nesmith formed in the building argue over elementary buzzer tactics aimed at keeping things that way.
The city-owned building, at 673-675 Miller Avenue, at Riverdale Avenue, is just one of 20 in the neighborhood in which Mr. Nesmith, 35, has persuaded tenants to form associations over the last year, creating a sense of community among apartment dwellers who barely exchanged hellos before locking their deadbolts.
With the charm of a preacher and the tactics of a military campaigner, he has spearheaded an alliance of police officers, housing workers and two nonprofit groups -- the East New York Urban Youth Corps and the Cypress Hills Local Development Corporation -- that has reversed, at least temporarily, the buildings' downward slide. Mr. Nesmith receives a $24,000 salary from the two nonprofit groups, which are government-financed. The 20 buildings were considered among New York City's worst, abandoned by their owners to crack and decay before the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development took them over in foreclosure proceedings.
Eleven of the buildings have been rid of the dealers and addicts who haunted the hallways and the abandoned apartments and often preyed on passers-by, Mr. Nesmith said. Residents of the other buildings, including Ms. Morgan's, are still trying, pressing in some cases for eviction of tenants who feign cooperation but use their apartments for drug playgrounds.
"They used to call this the dead zone," said Mr. Nesmith, referring to East New York's murder rate, for years the city's highest. "Now we call it the resurrection zone. Our goal is to take back the neighborhood, building by building, street by street."
Martin Dunn, executive director of the East New York Urban Youth Corps, said his organization invests $150,000 of its $1.8 million budget on tenant organizers like Mr. Nesmith.
"Its just a small slice of the budget," Mr. Dunn said, "but it makes a lot more sense to be out there organizing buildings to save them from deteriorating than to have the places torn down and their residents put in shelters."
The organizing effort in city-owned buildings, which officials say is being carried out by 109 nonprofit organizations citywide, has coincided with a police campaign to combat the drug trade by having officers arrest suspected dealers for loitering, consuming alcohol in public and other once-ignored "quality of life" peccadilloes.
Both campaigns have coincided with a citywide decline in crime. In 1993, East New York's precinct, the 75th, recorded 126 murders, a city record, said the former commander, Inspector Joseph P. Dunne. The toll dropped to 87 in 1994, but the precinct still ranked worst in the city. By mid-July, there had been 27 slayings this year.
"Without community involvement we have nothing," said the present commander, Deputy Inspector Edward Mezzadri. "We've always had some cooperation. But when people start seeing results, they thrive on it. And it turns around an area that is barren."
The police concede that the drug trade in East New York has by no means been eradicated. In some cases, officials say, drug dealers have simply moved to other locations. "We make arrests over there all the time," said Officer Robert Hockenjos. "It keeps on rolling."
But the officer also echoed the thoughts of many residents, who said Mr. Nesmith and his organization have helped make a difference on some of the city's worst streets.
As an organizer, Mr. Nesmith uses direct tactics. He infiltrates a drug-infested building, recruiting collaborators willing to risk joining a patrol to stop trespassers from using front entrances that often have been stripped of their doors. Second, he warns street dealers that the tenants are banding together and advises them to move on.
"The next step is to establish a secure perimeter with new doors and locks," said Mr. Nesmith, who learned tenant organizing in his native Philadelphia before moving to New York in 1991. In some cases, the perimeter includes locked metal cages that city housing workers put on the entrances to basement passageways used by drug dealers.
Residents are urged to provide the police and housing officials intelligence to support evictions of neighbors who deal in drugs or who might allow drug users and sellers to use their apartments.
The final element is perseverance, Mr. Nesmith said. "If I'm not there often, there can be problems," he said. "They have in-house fights, maybe someone says something bad, maybe someone spits on someone, little things that just escalate. Then I have to let them know what the ultimate consequences will be: that the city agency won't invest in rehabilitation."
In that sense, Mr. Nesmith comes well prepared for the job. Living with his mother and brother in the projects of Philadelphia, Mr. Nesmith said he sometimes tried to mediate gang fights.
"I once stepped out in between two gangs and started giving a speech about brotherhood, and they stopped fighting," he said. "That experience with the gangs helped me with what I do now. It made me not afraid. Most people are afraid to go into these buildings."
The East New York tenements on Williams Avenue between Riverdale and Livonia Avenues were once one of the city's bloodiest drug bazaars; now they have been cleaned up and the addicts locked out. Daily sidewalk gatherings of dozens of pushers have dwindled to a few stragglers as police informers recruited from among the tenant associations created by Mr. Nesmith have helped city housing officials evict traffickers.
"The next block used to be a supermarket for heroin, and you were hearing bullets coming out of nowhere for anything," said 37-year-old Larry Wilkerson, who said he helped run a Williams Avenue drug ring before going to jail on a weapons charge. "I haven't heard a gunshot in months, and the drugs aren't being sold on the block anymore."
The drop in crime has stunned the officers of the 75th Precinct and residents, who caution that the area's social and economic weaknesses make reconquered buildings susceptible.
Once the home of German, Jewish and Irish immigrants, East New York suffered from the white flight of the 1960's and the drug contagion of the 70's and 80's, which wiped out 20 percent of the housing stock and left many of its 170,000 people in poverty. A quarter of the current households earn less than $10,000 a year, and half of the adults failed to finish high school.
Ms. Morgan's walk-up is typical of the buildings that could easily decline again if tenant unity collapses in petty quarrels and renewed apathy. The building is at a crossroads exploited by drug dealers for its convenient access by customers from outside the neighborhood and easy escape routes.
The building at 673-675 Miller Avenue, opposite a house that officers called a drug outlet store, has seen more than its share of drug-related deaths. Last September, a woman with stab wounds to the chest and duct tape over her mouth was tossed to her death from the roof. Three months later, a wealthy suburbanite, Barry Bernstein, was found dead of an apparent drug overdose, his head resting on the baseboard of the fourth-floor landing.
After another killing this spring, Inspector Mezzadri said: "I went there myself and told people on the stoop that we weren't going to put up with it. They don't want people hanging around selling drugs and wreaking havoc in the community. I got very good info."

Signs of Economic Strength Send Treasury Prices Down

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities tumbled yesterday after stronger-than-expected reports on manufacturing and construction showed a rebounding economy.
The reports bolstered the market's view that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to reduce short-term interest rates soon. The data also revived fears that inflation could creep up if the economy continued to accelerate. 
 The slide in Treasury prices, while sharp, could have been worse had it not been for the reluctance of traders to sell too heavily in advance of the report on employment to be released Friday.
Woodrow Wilson once said, "The man who is swimming against the stream knows the strength of it." That was more or less how some traders described the plight of buyers in yesterday's market.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 26/32 , to 109 3/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction to the price, rose to 6.90 percent, from 6.84 percent on Monday, returning it to Friday's levels.
Buying was restricted further by investor concern about an overabundant supply ahead of the Treasury's quarterly refunding of its borrowing needs next week. The Government will announce today the size of the refunding package. Carroll J. Delaney, director of research for Stires, O'Donnell & Company, said there was growing speculation that the Treasury would reopen for sale the current 6.50 percent 10-year notes to relieve their scarcity value in the so-called repo market, where investors sell securities, agreeing to buy them back at a specified price on a given date. He also said he thought the Treasury might announce an odd-date maturity for the long bond, like 30 1/4 years.
"It's too early to hypothesize auction yield levels at this point, but this week's substantial dose of economic news will be critical to the process," Mr. Delaney said.
Bond prices fell after a report that the National Association of Purchasing Management index showed a stronger-than-expected reading of 50.5 points for July, up from 45.7 in June. Some analysts had expected a reading of 48. The strength in the manufacturing part of the survey easily overrode the positive impact of a sharp drop in the price components to 58.3 points from 65.6 in June.
A separate report, on construction spending in June, was also stronger than expected. The Commerce Department said construction spending rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in June, to an annual rate of $520.4 billion, driven by building of factories and highways.
Anthony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Josephthal Lyon & Ross, said evidence was mounting that the economy was no longer slowing as sharply as it was in the second quarter. "Therefore, the hope for another Fed easing over the short term is diminishing," he said. In the municipal bond market, prices followed Treasury securities lower. New York City sold $972 million in nontaxable debt at higher-than-expected yields, traders said. The city still has not priced $260 million in taxable, variable-rate debt, which will probably be sold with very low yields, close to rates for commercial paper. The issue will probably be priced around mid-August.
The yields on the nontaxable debt were as much as 10 basis points higher than those on existing, similarly rated bonds. A basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Analysts said money managers demanded higher compensation for the bonds amid concern that the city's finances were not improving. On July 10, the Standard & Poor's Corporation cut the city's long-term debt rating to BBB+ from A-. Drew McCullagh, who manages about $1 billion at Voyageur Asset Management, told Bloomberg Business News that if the credit rating had not been cut, the bond price might have been at least 10 basis points lower.
J. P. Morgan Securities, a unit of J. P. Morgan & Company, tentatively priced the bonds, consisting of serial bonds whose maturities run from 1996 through 2025, to yield a maximum of 6.65 percent for an issue due in 30 years. Shorter maturities were priced to yield from 4.25 percent in 1996 to 5.30 percent in 2000, 6.15 percent in 2005, 6.50 percent in 2010, 6.60 percent in 2015 and 6.625 percent in 2019.

Bank of Japan Rescues Troubled Cosmo Credit Union

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Breaking a longstanding taboo, financial authorities rushed in with funds today to rescue a Japanese credit union whose troubles had threatened to spark turmoil in the nation's banking system.
It was the first time in three decades that the central bank, the Bank of Japan, had issued special loans, this time to prevent a run on Tokyo's largest credit association, the Cosmo Credit Corporation, from alarming jittery depositors at other financial institutions. 
 The scare, which developed suddenly over the weekend, has become a test for Japanese regulators and bankers who are eager to demonstrate to investors and financiers around the world that Japan can manage a crisis and prevent it from spilling over into the global financial system. Just last week, Robert E. Rubin, the United States Treasury Secretary, expressed concern about Japan's banking crisis.
The nation's banks are saddled with at least $570 billion in bad loans, and many financial experts say the debt load is hobbling the economy and roiling the stock and property markets.
Cosmo's depositors have withdrawn about $915 million in cash, or nearly one-fifth of total deposits, over the last two days. Today, officials at the credit union prominently displayed cartloads of money to assure depositors that cash supplies were ample.
There appeared to be little risk that the credit union's troubles would have an impact abroad because Cosmo turned to depositors, rather than the money market, to finance its lending activities. Analysts have expressed concern that if a full-blown banking crisis did develop in Japan, some of the nation's banks would be unable to meet commitments on the international money markets.
Still, Tokyo share prices fell today, with the Nikkei index of 225 stocks declining 318.96 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 16,358.57. Shares of financial institutions led today's retreat.
Government officials were coy about saying whether the special loans from the central bank represented a use of public funds. That is a sensitive issue because many in Japan hold the nation's wealthy bankers responsible for creating a speculative economic bubble that has burst, producing the country's worst economic problems in decades.
Nonetheless, if today's measures did not actually presage the use of public funds to aid banks, they did at least elevate the public debate about pouring such money into failing institutions. Financial regulators and Government authorities have said they do not want public funds to go into saving poorly managed, bankrupt institutions, but they also recognize that taxpayer money may be necessary at times to prevent bank runs from exploding into a nationwide panic.
Officials at the Ministry of Finance and central bankers tried to distinguish today's loans from public funds.
"It is funding from the Bank of Japan, and not normal lending by the bank," said Yukio Yoshimura, a spokesman for the ministry. "There is no strict definition of public funds." An official at the Bank of Japan said the loans were "different" from public funds.
The central bank declined to disclose precisely the amount of today's loans, but various financial officials suggested that the amount was between $170 million and $215 million. On Monday, the National Federation of Credit Cooperatives, an industry association, lent about $700 million to Cosmo.
Runs on banks in Japan are extremely rare, and the Government almost never lets lending institutions go bankrupt. Even today, lines at Cosmo were orderly and people waited patiently to withdraw their deposits.
Sampachi Taido, Cosmo's president, resigned, and authorities said that Cosmo probably would be merged into another bank. Authorities suspended Cosmo's operations on Monday, forbidding it from taking any new deposits and making any new loans, but depositors are still allowed to withdraw funds up to a limit of about $1.1 million, regulators said.
Cosmo lent heavily to real estate speculators during the bubble economy of the 1980's and now is saddled with a large bundle of bad debts. Ministry officials said Cosmo had nearly $2 billion in bad loans, representing about 35 percent of its loan portfolio.

U.S. Not Embracing Call for a Shift on Japan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said today that one of his top aides was not speaking for the Administration when the aide called for a less confrontational and more cooperative trade relationship with Japan.
The aide, Jeffrey E. Garten, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, did not put his speech, given Monday in Tokyo, through the interagency review process and was expressing his personal views, Mr. Brown said in a telephone interview this afternoon. 
 The speech angered some senior Administration officials, who worried that it eroded the White House's carefully cultivated and politically advantageous image of being tough on Japan.
While Mr. Brown said that he retained confidence in Mr. Garten, the incident appeared today to have weakened Mr. Garten's standing within the Administration while strengthening his rivals at the Office of the United States Trade Representative, a separate agency.
Mr. Brown said that Mr. Garten had long advocated tough action toward Japan and that his speech simply indicated a hope that the relationship could be more cordial even as the United States continued to try to open the Japanese market. "All of us at the Commerce Department, Jeff included, ought to have absolutely unassailable credibility on the Japan issue; we were the tough guys," he said.
Mr. Brown also contended that Mr. Garten had indicated that his views did not represent a shift in Administration policy. "Clearly, he was not speaking for the Administration, as he acknowledged," Mr. Brown said.
Mr. Garten said that his proposal was not "meant to be a policy announcement as such, but certainly we in the Administration would like to see a new environment in our relationship with Japan."
But Mr. Garten made the speech as a senior Commerce Department official, and the department had distributed his speech widely to reporters. In it, he took a much less aggressive tone than other American officials in discussing efforts to open the Japanese market.
"We have a good opportunity now to initiate a more positive phase in the trade and economic relations between the U.S. and Japan, one in which the tone becomes more cooperative and more oriented towards the common goal of building a world economy in which our two countries are not pictured as antagonists but as close partners," Mr. Garten said, according to a text of the speech released by his office.
He went on: "Such an environment will not evolve from soothing words, but from some very hard work on both sides of the Pacific. Achieving it will be a difficult challenge for both Washington and Tokyo. I believe it can be done, however."
The speech gave the appearance of undermining Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative. Mr. Kantor took a very confrontational approach in auto trade talks with Tokyo a month ago, only to forgo trade sanctions at the last moment and strike a deal that some American critics of Japan have labeled as inadequate.

HEADLINE: Activity Rises In Construction And Industry

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Two reports released yesterday signaled renewed strength in the economy, as an index of manufacturing activity rose more than expected in July while construction spending increased in June by the largest amount in nine months.
The statistics helped send stock and bond prices lower because investors believed that the numbers would make it less likely that the Federal Reserve would act soon to cut interest rates. 
 Yesterday's figures indicated that the threat of a recession has receded "further and further into the background, and a soft landing is becoming the dominant theme," said Robert Dederick, an economic consultant at the Northern Trust Corporation in Chicago.
In one of yesterday's reports, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its manufacturing index rose to 50.5 last month from 45.7 in June. Before declining in May and June, the index had increased for 20 consecutive months. An index reading of 50 or more means manufacturing is expanding, while a reading below 50 signals a slowdown.
Economists had expected the index to rise to only 46.5, according to a Bloomberg Business News survey. The July reading of 50.5 may indicate that the economy has recovered from the weakness of the spring and early summer.
"It looks like the economy is rebounding much more quickly and with more vigor than people thought," said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa.
As for construction spending, the Commerce Department said yesterday that it rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in June, to an annual rate of $520.4 billion, driven by building of new factories and highways. The increase was the first in three months; in May, spending fell 1.5 percent.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg Business News had expected a June increase of one-tenth of 1 percent.
The numbers could remain strong in the months ahead as "nonresidential building permits continue to be strong," analysts at Mitsubishi Bank said before yesterday's report was released. Permits for new projects are considered a gauge of future construction starts.
Spending on commercial projects like factories, warehouses and motels rose 3.5 percent in June. Spending on plant and equipment has been a source of strength for the economy and is likely to remain healthy for the rest of the year, the National Association of Business Economists said last week.

HEADLINE: Keeping Wages Down

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Can Merger Save the Unions?" by Michael Weinstein (Editorial Notebook, July 31): When Mr. Weinstein writes, "Competition from abroad and a 20-year slowdown in productivity have stripped unions of their power to raise wages," he couldn't be more wrong. 
 Productivity per labor-hour in the sector embracing the three unions in question, auto workers, steel workers and machinists, has risen at least 40 percent in the past 20 years.
Wages have stagnated because the huge overhang of unemployed and underemployed workers deprives all workers, not just the unions, of bargaining power.
The unions have no hope of reducing that overhang unless they attack the source: the Federal Reserve Board's paranoid delusion that the economy cannot grow faster than 2.5 percent a year without serious inflation.

State Department Plan Is Put on Hold in Senate

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
A Republican plan to reorganize the State Department, already facing a veto threat, was put on hold in the Senate today when solid Democratic opposition kept backers from bringing it to a vote.
The author of the bill, Jesse Helms, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and a Republican of North Carolina, reacted angrily to the defeat, saying that "if the Administration wants to play hard ball," he will make sure that no ambassador nominations or treaties get through his committee. 
 The delay also puts in limbo an attempt by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, to link American participation in a United Nations women's conference in Beijing in September with China's release of Harry Wu, a Chinese-American human rights advocate.
Senator Dole, Republican of Kansas, pulled the bill and moved to other legislation after failing twice to get the 60 votes needed to end debate and set a timetable for final action. Both votes were 55-45, with all but one Democrat, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, opposing cloture.
The bill would eliminate three major agencies -- the United States Information Agency, the Agency for International Development and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency -- and cut 10,000 employees by the end of the decade. It would also make changes in aspects of American foreign policy, including requiring the President to notify Congress 15 days before casting a vote on peacekeeping operations in the United Nations Security Council.

HEADLINE: Mayor Gives Final Approval For East Harlem Supermarket

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
After months of bitter debate over a proposal to build a Pathmark supermarket in East Harlem, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that he had given final approval to the project, clearing away the last obstacle to building the store.
The $13 million supermarket has been planned since 1991 for a desolate lot on 125th Street, but construction has been held up because of opposition from Hispanic merchants in the neighborhood. Construction could start next spring, Mr. Giuliani said. 
 To appease the opponents, the Mayor said the city would become a partner in the deal and would hold a minority stake in the enterprise until a Hispanic partner could be found to take it over.
In exchange for providing the land on which the store will be built, the city's Economic Development Corporation, the nonprofit agency responsible for development projects, will get a 49 percent stake in the project. Mr. Giuliani said the city would later transfer that ownership to "an appropriate community group that would reflect the community in which the supermarket is being located." No group has been selected yet to assume the city's share in the plan.
The majority stake will be held by the original developer, a consortium of nonprofit groups known as the East Harlem Abyssinian Triangle, which includes the nonprofit development arm of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, Harlem's best known black congregation.
Under the plan, Pathmark, after paying off any debts, will pay rent to the Abyssinian group and the city; later, the Hispanic group selected will take over the city's share of that money. The money Pathmark pays to the city and the Hispanic group would be used for new housing and other neighborhood projects. The Abyssinian group also plans to use its share of the money for community development.
Pathmark is expected to pay about $50,000 a year for the first 10 years. That amount is expected to rise as debts are retired.
The Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church and one of the original developers, said: "I'm happy that the Mayor has finally seen the benefits of this project, even though it has taken him a long time to deal with this matter. I'm glad the project is going through, and Harlem will have a new supermarket.
Originally planned as a straightforward development measure for an economically depressed area, the East Harlem Pathmark project became embroiled in bitter political and ethnic passions. East Harlem small-market owners, most of them Hispanic, denounced the 53,000-square-foot project, complaining that it involved no Hispanic community groups and that the large supermarket would hurt their business.
At the same time, however, surveys suggested that a majority of residents, both black and Hispanic, wanted to see the store built, both for the shopping convenience and for the 200 jobs the supermarket is expected to generate.
For Mr. Giuliani, the project presented delicate political problems because Hispanic small-business owners have been important supporters of the Mayor. Even after the project received the other necessary government approvals, the Mayor gave no indication of his position for many weeks.
When Mr. Giuliani finally announced his decision today to reporters in City Hall, he was flanked by three of the four deputy mayors who had helped restructure the plan.
Mr. Giuliani said: "The deal that was worked out will benefit everyone: local businesses, members of the communities, shoppers, workers and the city of New York. East Harlem. I think East Harlem takes a giant step forward today."
Not everyone agreed. Adam Clayton Powell 4th and Antonio Pagan, the councilmen from Manhattan who have opposed the plan because of its potentially negative impact on small merchants, said they still objected because the project's developers will receive $1.1 million in Federal and state grants, a low-interest mortgage loan and tax abatements.
"This is corporate welfare of the worst kind," Mr. Powell said.
Mr. Pagan said he also objected because the project still had no Hispanic group involved. "The original sponsors are still in control," he complained. "This was supposed to be a compromise. But who compromised? There's been no communication between the Mayor and the opponents."
Mr. Giuliani has long vowed to make economic development more attractive to corporations. Administration officials acknowledged that the Pathmark debate was being watched by other corporations as a indication of the difficulty involved in doing business in New York City.
In April, Pathmark had tried to placate the opposition by pledging $25,000 a year, in addition to the money the Abyssinian group had expected to receive, for a minimum of five years, to create an economic development fund for East Harlem, presumedly to assist Hispanic-owned businesses. The company, based in Woodbridge, N.J., said the money would be held in escrow in an East Harlem bank and administered by a community-based organization.
But Mr. Giuliani, suggesting that such an agreement would have a chilling effect on any company seeking to do business in New York, strongly asserted yesterday that the earlier offer was null and void. "No such payment will take place," he said, "and that will be set forth in writing."
"That's inappropriate," Mr. Giuliani said. "There's no reason to exact additional taxes from businesses that want to do business in this city. That's a way to discourage business."
That seemed to be a reference to an arrangement struck between Pathmark and Councilwoman Juanita Watkins on a proposed Pathmark store planned for the Springfield Gardens section of Queens. Under that plan, the company will donate more than $400,000 during the next 20 years to other merchants in the area. The money will be dispersed by a seven-member advisory panel chosen by Ms. Watkins.
Mr. Giuliani declined to discuss his position on the Springfield Gardens supermarket project directly. But he said arrangements like that "should be part of the past of New York City, not the future, where businesses are expected to make side payments and side deals."
Administration officials said the biggest problem in arriving at the current plan had been the search for a Hispanic developer to become a partner. In the end, they could not find one they judged suitable.
The Mayor said, "Just because one doesn't exist now, doesn't mean that one won't exist a year, two or three years from now, until that community group is developed."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 3, 1995, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about mayoral approval of a plan to build a Pathmark supermarket in East Harlem misstated the terms of the deal. The city's Economic Development Corporation and a private investment group will build the supermarket, rent it to Pathmark and use the profits from this arrangement -- estimated at $50,000 a year for the first 10 years -- for community development projects. The $50,000 does not represent Pathmark's total annual rent, which will actually be about $1 million.

HEADLINE: Plunging Life Expectancy Puzzles Russia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Life expectancy in Russia, already lower than in any other developed country, has plummeted again this year, and scientists and public health officials say they cannot explain the continuing steep decline.
For the last several years health statistics here have been hard to believe: no country that reports to the World Heath Organization has a life expectancy as low. Life expectancy for men born in Russia this year is lower than in India, Egypt or Bolivia. 
 Epidemic rates of heart disease, cancer and accidents account for much of the problem, which has caused death rates to more than double in the last decade. But none of that explains why Russia has become the first country in history to experience such sustained reversals in its health statistics.
"There is no historical precedent for this anywhere in the world," said Judith Shapiro, an economist who specializes in health demographics at the University of London, referring to the drop in Russian male life expectancy from 64 to 57 in the last four years. "Obviously nobody can quite figure it out. But it is a mystery that needs to be solved soon."
It is also a mystery that has profound implications for a country trying to restructure its society and economy after years of despotic rule. Despite the common belief that the world is overpopulated and that fewer people are usually better, no country can afford a trend in which its most productive citizens die in huge numbers while they are in their prime.
But that is just what is happening here. Deaths are now almost twice as common in Russia as births, while infant mortality has risen 15 percent in each of the last two years.
While the numbers are bleak, nobody attributes the change to inaccurate or incomplete statistics. Instead, experts here and in the West have in the past routinely written it all off to the fragile state of Russia itself: economically stressed, psychologically damaged, its health care system in ruins.
All of that makes sense. But it is not enough, specialists now acknowledge, to explain the demographic catastrophe spreading across the nation. Mortality figures released by the Labor Ministry here last week showed that if current conditions persist, nearly 50 percent of today's Russian youth will not even make it to the retirement age of 55 for women and 60 for men.
Last year the death rate reached 15.6 for every 1,000 people, an increase of nearly 10 percent over the previous year and nearly 30 percent since 1992. By contrast the birth rate fell to 9.0 per thousand from 9.4 the year before. In the United States last year the birth rate was 16.1 and the death rate was 9.0. Life expectancy for American men is 72 and for women 79. It is 71 for Russian women.
While death rates soar, birth rates here are lower than in any other country. Only 1.4 million children were born in Russia last year, less than half the number of recorded abortions. For the first time last year the population shrank in every one of Russia's 79 regional districts. But what frightens researchers here most is the condition of those children who are born. More than 10 percent have serious birth defects, 50 percent of all school children suffer from chronic illnesses, and these rates are growing every year.
Frustrated by explanations that don't quite add up, scientists are looking more closely at the history of Soviet ecological abuse for answers -- decades of open testing of nuclear weapons, chemical plants spewing deadly toxic materials into the country's most important rivers, generations of factory workers and farmers exposed to huge doses of dangerous pesticides and harmful chemicals.
What they are finding -- tentative and preliminary though it may be -- is not reassuring. Congenital abnormalities among children are among the most vivid examples of the impact of pollution. In 1990, 388 of every 10,000 children born died in their first year of life as a result of serious birth defects, more than four times the rate of the United States. In 1993, the figure was 407 per 10,000 children. And last year, according to the Ministry of Health, the rate reached 436. Those are just numbers for defects serious enough to kill.
"What we have here is a disaster," said Dr. Aleksandr Chuchalin, a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, who has been researching the link between the health of children and the state of the environment. "But the reasons are just incredibly hard to pin down. Obviously, it's is not enough any more to say that our life style accounts for these numbers. No life style could account for all of this."
Dr. Chuchalin and colleagues are beginning to examine the hypothesis that radiation produced by decades of nuclear irresponsibility -- at places like the Chernobyl power station but also at waste dumps and test sites across the country -- is a major factor in the surge in illnesses and birth defects. But such links are never easy to demonstrate.
"It was surprising that we could not seem to observe the genetic effects of what happened there," said Dr. David Hoel, chairman of the department of biometry and epidemiology at the Medical University of South Carolina, and an expert on the effects of radiation in populations. "Everyone assumes the connection. But it takes many years of careful study to be sure."
Whatever the cause, it is frequently asserted that the nation's genetic heritage could be in danger.
"Back in the early 1960's our eminent geneticists warned about the genetic damage to the Russian population," Aleksei V. Yablokov, chairman of the National Security Council's committee on ecological health and safety said in a well-publicized speech earlier this year. "No one believed them. Now congenital deformities are increasing faster than any other health problem. As a biologist I think we have to look not so much at the conception of children by drunken couples, but at the chemical and radioactive contamination of the environment."
He may be right. But there are other more obvious causes, like failure to vaccinate the population against preventable illnesses. Some illnesses, such as rubella, can lead to the passing of genetic mutations from mother to child. The relationship between potential birth defects and women who become ill with rubella during pregnancy is well known throughout the world, as the Georgetown University demographer Murray Feshbach has pointed out in his recently released "Environmental and Health Atlas of Russia."
In the years between 1985 and 1989, the United States -- where rubella vaccinations are common -- averaged 427 cases a year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. During the same period, the former Soviet Union, with about 15 percent more people, averaged 564,000 cases a year. In 1993, in Russia alone the figure was 128,000. Last year it almost tripled to 360,470. If half of those people are women, and only 5 percent of them are fertile women that means more than 25,000 potential infections for pregnant mothers.
"The question is how long are we going to accept these numbers," said Marina Cherkasova, director of the Russian Socio-Ecological Union, an advocacy group that works mostly on health issues. "Are we going to sit here for another 50 years and wonder whether the incredible rates of disease we have can be prevented, or are we just going to keep moving backward in time?"

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about plunging life expectancy in Russia referred imprecisely to a remark by Dr. David Hoel, an American expert on the effects of radiation in populations. When he said, "We could not seem to observe the genetic effects of what happened there," he was referring specifically to radiation's effects on Hiroshima, not to Russia.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: THE BUSINESS -- Broadcast Networks Come Back Strong;
An Old Medium Holds New Luster for Buyers

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
Only a short time removed from persistent predictions of their imminent demise, the broadcast networks have become the hottest properties in the media marketplace.
Many analysts predicted that yesterday's $5.4 billion deal by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation for CBS Inc. was only a prelude to a bidding war for that network. And coming just a day after the Walt Disney Company agreed to take over Capital Cities/ABC for $19 billion, the Westinghouse move was widely interpreted as part of a sudden hunger for network acquisition. 
 "There is a frenzy going on in this business," John Reidy, a media analyst for Smith Barney, said.
Analysts and network executives cited numerous reasons:
*The elimination or reduction of Government regulations that have hampered networks in producing and owning programs and limited the number of stations they could own.
*The increased desire for program producers to control systems of distribution, the better to create value for the programs they generate.
*A boom in advertising revenues for traditional network television.
*The still murky possibility that coming changes in the way television signals are delivered may greatly increase the number of channels a broadcaster can transmit into American homes.
Another factor, of course, is the consolidation of power in the entertainment industry among a few big cost-conscious companies. "The reason it is all happening now is the rise of corporate conglomerates, coupled with rising program costs and the end of Government regulations," said Larry Gerbrandt, senior partner of Paul Kagan Associates, a firm that tracks media companies. "The Disney deal was made for program distribution and the Westinghouse deal for station market share, but both deals are about economies of scale."
Indeed, Disney executives emphasized on Monday that owning ABC meant the company's programs would have a reliable distribution base, and Westinghouse executives said yesterday that a merger with CBS would give the new company the strongest lineup of television stations in the country.
The Disney deal for ABC is widely considered to be far superior to Westinghouse's for CBS, both because of ABC's far more valuable assets and because that network recently has had much better ratings and owns far more profitable stations than CBS.
Still, analysts said the two deals were part of a larger reassessment of the value of broadcast networks. "There's a re-recognition of the different things you can do with a network," Mr. Reidy said.
But one senior executive with long network experience said that at least part of the reason for the network fire sale was purely emotional: "There's a nervous frenzy among a lot of these guys running these big companies. They don't want to be left out of what's going on."
The same executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that only five years ago Michael D. Eisner, the Disney chairman, disdained networks, saying he not only didn't want to buy one, he was glad he didn't own one.
That was at a time when the broadcast networks were being widely written off as yesterday's medium. Cable channels talked of expanding to 500 channels. There was the prospect of video-on-demand, where viewers could choose to watch what they wanted when they wanted. The idea of delivering shows by a single channel on a rigid weekly schedule was being described as the TV equivalent of the icebox facing off with a Frigidaire.
At the same time the advertising market for television had gone so soft that many industry executives predicted there would not be enough revenue to support much more than two networks.
NBC, the network with the most programming woes at the time, was so unwanted that its parent, the General Electric Company, was said to keep it only because no buyer would pay enough to insure that G.E. would not incur a severe loss.
In the years since, the Government has removed restrictions that kept the networks from taking a financial interest in shows they broadcast; has allowed the networks to syndicate shows, and is considering raising the percentage of the nation's television households a network can reach with the stations it owns, from 25 percent to 35 percent.
Thus, the business climate has changed from one in which networks were of little interest to buyers because they were shackled with regulations for being too powerful to one in which the networks -- now unshackled because their competitive power was waning -- are very desirable.
Mr. Reidy said that Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation and its Fox broadcasting network, had set the standard that other studios now seek by using his network to create value for shows Fox owned.
"The networks are becoming program owners and not just mere conduits," Mr. Reidy said. "Only a network can create value by making a program a hit. Even if you don't have very good ratings, you can still showcase a program and then sell it in Bulgaria or some place."
The international market is becoming increasingly lucrative for American program producers, and Mr. Eisner cited it as an area where the new Disney/ABC would look for extra revenue.
Mr. Reidy also said that the boom in advertising sales for all the networks was making them more attractive to bidders.
CBS, he said, "lost their president, Howard Stringer, they've had all this slippage in ratings, yet the advertising market is so frenzied that CBS is going to see an upswing in cash flow in the fourth quarter."
In going billions of dollars into debt for the honor of owning a network, neither new prospective owner cited the possibility that some time in the next decade they may be able to expand their channel capacity without having to make deals with the cable industry.
In the fall, the Federal Communications Commission will begin considering plans to change the system of delivering television signals. Under a new digital system, stations with one channel may eventually be able to deliver five or six into each home in their viewing area.
The plan faces enormous technological complications and political maneuvering. But Mr. Gerbrandt said that any expansion of channel capacity would help the networks.

HEADLINE: Stock Prices in Retreat, With Dow Dropping 8.10

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Stocks stumbled yesterday after a sharp decline in bond prices raised concern that interest rates, and corporate borrowing costs, were headed higher.
The selloff in bonds followed the release of two unexpectedly strong economic reports. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 26/32 , driving its yield up to 6.98 percent, from 6.84 percent on Monday. Higher rates threatened to hamper corporate earnings growth, which has driven the market's recent rally. 
 All three major averages were down yesterday. The Dow Jones industrial index closed at 4,700.37, off 8.10 points. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 559.64, off 2.42 points, and the Nasdaq composite index closed at 991.11, off 10.10 points.
"The stock market appears to be settling into a tight trading range," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president of Fahnestock & Company. "There is no breakout at hand, nor does it appear that a breakdown is in process."
Still, the reports that spooked the bond market pointed to an economy that could now be rebounding. The manufacturing index of the National Association of Purchasing Management rose in July for the first time in three months. And the Commerce Department reported that June construction spending, led by starts of new factories and highways, notched its largest advance in nine months.
Declines on the New York Stock Exchange exceeded advances by 1,290 to 969. Big Board volume increased to 332.9 million shares, from 289.9 million shares Monday.
The decline in the market was tempered by a surge in takeover activity. Shares of Disney rose 2 7/8, to 61 1/2, a day after announcing its $19 billion deal to acquire Capital Cities/ ABC. Shares of Capital Cities climbed 3 1/4, to 119 1/2, after jumping 20 1/8 on Monday.
Yesterday's announcement that Westinghouse Electric planned to purchase CBS lifted Westinghouse shares by 1 1/4, to 14 7/8. But CBS was unchanged at 77 3/4.
Profit taking weakened many technology issues, particularly the semiconductor stocks. dropped 5, to 151 1/4; Micron 2 1/8, to 60 1/4, and Cyprus Semiconductor, 2, to 50 3/4.
Airlines also wound up on the down side, as traders showed concern about higher oil prices for much of the day. AMR, the parent of American Airlines, closed at 74 3/4, off 1/4; , the parent of United Airlines, closed at 48 1/2,, off 7/8, and Delta Air Lines closed at 78 7/8, off 3/8.
Georgia-Pacific spurted 1 7/8, to 88 1/8, after stating that it would begin a stock repurchase plan. I.B.M. finished on the plus side in a weak technology sector, rising 3/4, to 109 5/8, following a meeting that its management held with security analysts on Monday. And SunAmerica, which has been enjoying strong sales of annuities, jumped 2 3/4, to 60.

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
In downtown Los Angeles, a former department store will have new life as state offices.

BYLINE: By Morris Newman 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
A GOVERNMENT partnership is buying a historic department store building in a neglected section of the downtown here as part of a larger effort to revive the area.
The building, the 450,000-square-foot former Broadway Department Store, will house state offices. It was purchased for only $1.8 million by the Los Angeles State Building Authority, a partnership of the State of California and the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency. The seller was the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency entrusted with selling the assets of insolvent savings and loan associations. 
 The partnership agreed to buy the property in June and expects to complete the purchase in October.
The state plans to spend an additional $61.5 million on the building, a 10-story structure built in 1918. Much of the money will go toward reinforcements against earthquakes, as well as other safety features to help the building meet current city codes.
The building, which is expected to reopen in 1999, will gather 1,700 state employees from 41 sites in the Los Angeles area.
The purchase is a "major set piece in the revitalization of the Broadway-Spring Street area" of downtown Los Angeles, said Daniel Garcia, chairman of the redevelopment agency's board of commissioners. The area, also called the historic core, is just east of the new high-rise financial district.
The deal stems from an executive order from Gov. Pete Wilson to consolidate state office uses in downtown areas of Los Angeles and other cities, including Oakland and San Bernardino. The Broadway store project will help the state meet a goal of consolidating 750,000 square feet of government office space in the historic core.
In addition to being a partner in the purchase, the redevelopment agency assisted in the deal by forgiving part of the building's property taxes, so the money could be reinvested in the structure.
"The old Broadway building was a critical issue for us, as a means to shore up the public investment the state already had in the area," said Kevin Eckery, Deputy Secretary of the State and Consumer Services Agency.
Chief among the state's assets in the historic core is the 825,000-square-foot Ronald Reagan Building, a state office building built in 1989 two blocks south of the Broadway building, amid dilapidated buildings at the edge of the city's Skid Row section.
The former Broadway store, with 45,000 square feet of space on each floor, is well suited to office use, Mr. Eckery said. He added that the building would encourage the use of mass transit; a station of the city's new Metro Rail subway system is a block west of the building.
The purchase also meshes with ambitions of the city's redevelopment agency to introduce new uses and new tenants into empty buildings of the historic core, which was the city's financial center from the turn of the century until the 1960's. The area is prized by preservationists as a collection of handsome old office buildings, banks and a group of flamboyant movie palaces. But many of the buildings are considered obsolete for modern office use. Since the 1960's, most downtown office tenants have moved to newer towers.
The void left by big companies in the historic core was quickly filled by retail businesses, created largely by immigrants from Mexico and Central America. Broadway has become an intensely busy shopping street for the Hispanic community, and storefront properties command some of the highest retail rents in the city. In many buildings, however, the upper floors sit empty.
But after years of failed and struggling projects, investment is focusing again on the historic core. Mr. Garcia, the redevelopment agency chairman, cited several projects for the area, including the renovation of the upper stories of the Million Dollar Theater and the Grand Central Market, both on Broadway, into apartments and office space.
The agency has approved a plan to renovate the Broadway Spring Arcade, a retail and office building. The Archdiocese of Los Angeles is planning a $150 million complex, including a new cathedral, on the site of the existing St. Vibiana's Cathedral.
"The area is showing a spark," Mr. Garcia said. "Three or four of the big pieces are falling into place."

HEADLINE: A 'Frontier' Land of Ancient Rivalry

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Aug. 2

 BODY:
The mood of diplomats and United Nations officials here trying to avert a wider war between Croatia and rebel Serbs ranges from "not optimistic" to "very pessimistic." Should their fears become reality -- which may be known within the next few days -- the conflagration over a crescent of territory called Krajina will not be a new one.
On the contrary, it will be a resumption of a brutal war that was begun in 1991 and was largely over before the siege of Sarajevo and the horrors and ethnic cleansing in neighboring Bosnia began in 1992. And the history of struggles for the land stretches back centuries. 
 Fearing, with good reason, that renewed fighting between Croatian Government troops and the rebel Serbs will lead to a even broader Balkan war, Washington and other Western Governments, and the United Nations, are trying to broker a peaceful resolution. Representatives of the parties are to meet in Geneva on Thursday, but it is hard to find a diplomat who thinks either side is willing to engage in serious negotiations.
The signs that compromise is a hopeless notion continued to pile up.
Croatia, which has an estimated 100,000 troops ready for war, warned the Serbs in a letter today to give up or be attacked. Croats assaulted Serb-populated villages along the border with Bosnia today, closed main roads that the military might need and sent out broadcasts to the Serbs to overthrow their leaders.
Responding to the threats of violence, Lufthansa canceled all flights into Croatia.
Both the Government and the rebels have legitimate grievances and claims, diplomats say. The Government invokes the principle of territorial integrity and the economic imperative to integrate the Krajina, which sits astride vital oil, rail and road networks. The Krajina Serbs talk about protecting the right to self-determination and the rights of a minority.
Whose land the Krajina is depends on how far back in history one goes and who the historian is.
"It is our land," one Croatian woman said adamantly, explaining why she wanted her Government to go to war to take it back.
Knin, for instance, is claimed by the rebel Serbs today as the capital of an independent republic. But a Croatian King, Tomislav, was crowned in Knin in the 10th century, and for the next several centuries Croatia and neighboring kingdoms were carved up by the various empires of the day.
By the end of the 17th century, Serbs dominated the region. The Hapsburgs and Hungarians moved in vast numbers of Serbs because they wanted the Orthodox Christians to serve as buffers against the Ottoman Turks. The word "krajina" means "frontier" or "border lands."
By race and language, Serbs and Croats are one ethnic group, according to most anthropologists. What divides them is religion: the Croats are Roman Catholics, the Serbs Eastern Orthodox.
Still, Serbs and Croats "lived together in relative contentment," and they would not have "dreamed it possible that Croatian soldiers would massacre innocent Serbs, while Serbian fighters would mutilate innocent Croats," Misha Glenny, a journalist-historian who has chronicled the disintegration of Yugoslavia, has written.
But that is precisely what happened once strident nationalists gained ascendancy.
In Belgrade, President Slobodan Milosevic, a Serbian hard-liner, had designs for a "Greater Serbia" that would include the "krajinas" in Croatia. Croatian nationalists had dreams of a greater Croatia, which would include Croat-populated regions of Bosnia.
The Croats voted overwhelmingly for independence in May 1991 in a referendum boycotted by most of Croatia's Serbs. Civil war erupted between the Yugoslav Army and the fledgling Croatian military. It was a war in which neither side gave any quarter, villages were "ethnically cleansed" by both sides and some 10,000 civilians were killed.
In early 1992, the United Nations negotiated a cease-fire, and the first peacekeepers arrived in the Balkans to supervise the withdrawal of the Yugoslav Army and the demilitarization of the Krajina.
But the area's political status was left unresolved.
The Krajina Serbs were adamantly against being part of Croatia. Part of their fears went back to World War II, when Croatia was ruled by the Ustashe Government, which supported the Nazis and killed thousands of Serbs. In 1991, when Croatia gained its independence from Yugoslavia, the Government fueled the Serbs' fears by adopting traditional Croatian symbols that had also been used by the Ustashe.
Nationalists from Serbia proper also came around to stir up trouble.
For the most part, the cease-fire held, and after months of strenuous efforts, in January of this year, the American Ambassador here, Peter W. Galbraith, working with his Russian counterpart and United Nations negotiators, came up with a proposal on the Krajina's political status. It would remain part of Croatia, but it would have considerable autonomy, including its own flag, parliament, police force and even currency.
The Krajina Serbs refused to even look at the proposal, sparing the Croatian Government from rejecting it, which diplomats say it surely would have done, for it had no intention of granting autonomy.
Though there have been changes in the Krajina Serb government and some moderates, thought to be willing to negotiate, are in key positions, the self-proclaimed republic is headed by Milan Martic, who was indicted last month by the international criminal tribunal in The Hague for crimes against humanity.
Currently, the estimated population of the Krajina is 150,000 Serbs; the Croats have been driven out. There are about twice that many Serbs in the rest of Croatia, most of them living peacefully, telling evidence that not all Croatian Serbs side with the rebels.
On the Croatian side, the strategic determination not to allow the Krajina to secede is driven by economics as well as nationalism. Tourism is the backbone of the Croatian economy, and the best routes to popular tourist spots on the Adriatic like Split and Dubrovnik run through the Krajina.
Before the war, tourism brought in about $10 billion a year; last year revenues were down to $2 billion, and this year, the fear of war has reduced it to less than $500 million.
One of the great unknowns now is what Mr. Milosevic will do for the Krajina Serbs in the event of war. He will be under pressure from Serbian nationalists to come to their aid. At the same time, however, he is desperate to have economic sanctions lifted, and Western diplomats here believe that he may be willing to sacrifice the Krajina.
The land itself is of marginal value. But in the Balkans today, where irrational nationalism reigns and bitterness has destroyed brotherhood, the Krajina Serbs and the Croatian Government are ready to fight over it.


GRAPHIC: The Balkan wars have embroiled three of the countries involved in the split-up of the old Yugoslav Federation. Fighting first flared in 1991, after Slovenia and Croatia, two of the republics in the six-member federation, declared independence.
Chart/Map: "The Balkan Conflict: Where Things Stand"
The Yugoslav Government , which had come under the domination of nationalist elements of the federation's largest ethnic group, the Serbs, allowed Slovenia to leave without serious opposition. But Serbs living in Croatia, a large minority fearful of the Croatian nationalists, rejected secession and, with military support from the Serbs of Yugoslavia, seized control of its homeland region. Fighting was halted by a United Nations-monitored cease-fire in early 1992, but flareups continue, and many see an imminent Croatian offensive to regain control of its Serb-held territories.
Fighting in Bosnia began in 1992, following the Croatian model: the election of a nationalist Government (this time Muslim-dominated, not Croatian), its rejection by a strong Serbian minority, a declaration of independence from Yugoslavia, a Serbian revolt backed by the arms and men of the Yugoslav Government, and the Serbian seizure of large swaths of territory. Three years of fighting has produced an estimated 200,000 deaths, more than a million refugees and a military stalemate.
 
WHO THEY ARE
 MUSLIMS -- Mostly Slavic, Serbo-Croatian speakers who adopted Islam under Ottoman rule. Some families have some Turkish or Arabic ancestry.
 CROATS -- Slavic, Serbo-Croatian speakers of the Roman Catholic faith whose ancestral lands were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
 SERBS -- Slavic, Serbo-Croatian speakers of the Orthodox Christian faith whose ancestral lands were part of the Ottoman Turkish Empire.
 
WHERE THEY LIVE
 BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
 Capital: Sarajevo.
 Population: 4.6 million.
 Ethnic profile: Muslims nearly half, Serbs one third, Croats one fifth.
 President: Alija Izetbegovic, who heads a Muslim nationalist party but professes a commitment to an multiethnic country. Receiving Croatian military support, and benefits somewhat from the presence of United Nations peacekeepers.
 CROATIA
 Capital: Zagreb.
 Population: 4.8 million.
 Ethnic profile: Croatian majority; Serbs one eighth.
 President: Franjo Tudjman. Despite its nationalist leanings it has forged close ties with the West, especially the United States and Germany. Uneasily allied with Bosnia against the Serbs.
 SERBIA
 Capital: Belgrade.
 Population: 9.8 million.
 Ethnic profile: Serbian majority; Albanian and Hungarian minorities.
 President: Slobodan Milosevic. Technically part of Yugoslavia, which includes Serbia and Montenegro, but the Milosevic Government thoroughly eclipses that of the Yugoslav Federation. Milosevic once championed the notion of gathering all Serbs into one political entity. But after the United Nations slapped an economic embargo on his country, Milosevic ended assistance, overtly at least, to the Serbian militants in Croatia and Bosnia.
 
THE UNITED NATIONS
 Originally, U.N. peacekeepers were to go to former Yugoslavia to patrol the truce in Croatia. By summer 1992, their roll had broadened to include insuring aid deliveries to millions of needy, especially in Bosnia. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has been the principal deliverer of aid on which millions depend in Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.
 Peacekeepers -- There are approximately 23,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia, and just over 12,000 in Croatia. There are another 12,000 people at Zagreb headquarters and scattered through the mission area, and some 1,000 peacekeepers in Macedonia.
 The Arms Embargo -- The embargo was imposed on all of former Yugoslavia in September 1991. Despite the ban on trading arms, Croatia and, to a lesser extent, the Bosnian Government have acquired arms that they say help redress the Serbs' advantage in heavy arms, inherited from the Yugoslav Army.
 U.N.-Designated "Safe Areas" -- Six Muslim enclaves have been designated for protection by the United Nations. Sarajevo, the capital; Tuzla in north central Bosnia; Bihac in northwestern Bosnia; and the eastern enclaves of Gorazde, Zepa and Srebrenica. Zepa and Srebrenica both have fallen.
 
NATO
 By agreement with the United Nations, NATO is responsible for patrolling a U.N.-declared no-flights zone over Bosnia. NATO air strikes have been called when U.N. commander on the ground, their civilain chief and NATO commander agree on them.
 Last month, U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali delegated his authority to the U.N. commander in former Yugoslavia, meaning military men will now decide whether to engage in more vigorous air strikes.
 
Map shows the current areas of control in and surrounding Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 
Chronology: "Recent Developments"
 May 24 -- U.N. orders Serbs to return heavy weapons to U.N. control and remove all heavy weapons around Sarajevo.
 May 25 -- Serbs ignore U.N. order. NATO attacks Serb ammunition depot. Serbs respond by shelling "safe areas."
 May 26 -- Serbs take U.N. peacekeepers hostage. Eventually more than 370 seized.
 June 8 -- NATO approves new rapid reaction force to bolster U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia.
June 15 -- Bosnian Government launches offensive to break seige of Sarajevo. Serbs step up shelling of Sarajevo and other "safe areas."
 June 18 -- Last of U.N. hostages released.
 July 11 -- Serbs overrun Srebrenica "safe area" and seize more U.N. hostages; Muslim refugees and peacekeepers tell of Serbian atrocities. The "safe area" of Zepa is overrun over the following two weeks.
 July 21 -- NATO threatens air strikes if the nearby Gorazde "safe area" is attacked.
 July 28 -- Croatia sends thousands of troops across the border into Bosnia, where they cut Serbian supply lines and threaten a widening of the war.
 Aug. 1 -- NATO extends its threat of air strikes against rebel Serbs to protect all remaining "safe areas" in Bosnia -- Sarajevo, Gorazde, Tuzla and Bihac. House of Representatives follows Senate on defying arms embargo, sending measure to a certain Presidential veto.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Tokyo Acts in Unusually Direct Manner

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 2

 BODY:
The Japanese Government took the financial markets by storm today, introducing a package of measures meant to bolster the dollar and backing up its words with cash.
The Government's actions -- announcing the measures, which were aimed at increasing Japanese investment abroad; intervening in the currency market during the Japanese trading day, and then intervening again when trading began in the United States -- were part of a cooperative effort with the United States, and the dollar rallied. 
 But economists and analysts in Tokyo were skeptical that the euphoria would last. Still, the move also comes a day after Government officials reacted quickly to a run on a large credit union.
And in contrast to their usual style of leaking bits of a plan before an announcement, the authorities today surprised the markets with their detailed package, which was buttressed by the interventions.
"Japan needs to invest and lend more abroad to reverse the strong yen," Masayoshi Takemura, the Finance Minister, said at a hastily called news conference. When Japanese institutions invest in foreign securities and assets, they must sell yen and buy dollars and other currencies, weakening the Japanese currency. So by making foreign investment easier, the ministry hopes to push down the yen.
The strong yen has battered the Japanese economy because it makes Japanese exports more expensive in terms of other currencies and reduces the amount of Japanese currency produced by transactions denominated in other currencies.
In recent months, economists and analysts have criticized the authorities for introducing economic measures that lacked substance. Today, however, the text was quite specific.
"This package has more guts, more numbers, more targets than we've seen in previous packages, and that's helped to enamor people," said David Atkinson, a financial analyst at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd.
The plan loosened restrictions on some banks, allowing them to take more aggressive positions in foreign exchange trading. It also eased curbs on loans made by insurance companies that are denominated in yen and foreign currency.
Accounting rules covering foreign bonds held by Japanese companies were loosened, allowing the companies flexibility in stating the value of the bonds and in reporting losses caused by currency fluctuations. The Government hopes that with more choice in how to account for foreign bonds, companies will buy more. But analysts noted that accounting changes were unlikely to encourage large flows of capital.
The plan also removed restrictions on purchases of Euroyen bonds by Japanese institutions. However, Japanese investors have evaded such limits in the past, and in any case, Japan had already promised the United States that it would take the step next year. (A Euroyen investment is denominated in yen but held outside Japan.) The Government hopes that by promoting the Euroyen market, it will increase liquidity of the yen abroad -- in essence internationalizing the yen -- to ease demand for yen in Japan and thereby weaken it.
Finally, the Government said it would promote investment and lending abroad by its official institutions.
Buoyed by the package and the market intervention, in which the central banks of Japan and the United States sold yen and bought dollars, the dollar rose above 90 yen for the first time in about four months. Mostly because of the dollar's strength, Tokyo stocks rose, with the Nikkei average of 225 stocks closing with a gain of 362.18 points, or 2.2 percent, to 16,720.75.
Still, financial experts in Tokyo said the measures were unlikely to have a lasting effect because while they were specific, they were rather cosmetic. In some cases, the measures merely supported guidelines already in effect or accelerated deregulatory steps previously planned.
Most important, the analysts said they doubted that the measures would alter the basic sense of risk aversion that now shapes the outlook of Japanese institutions.
Japan's insurance companies, at which most of today's measures were aimed, were riding high in the 1980's, when soaring stock and real estate values gave them the confidence to invest in riskier assets abroad. Now, with Japan's stock and property markets depressed, the institutions are struggling, and some are not even able to pay dividends.
"Unless you change their risk aversion, they're not going to jump into investments abroad," said Rie Ota, a financial analyst at Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd. "They don't have as much of a cushion as they used to."
Moreover, Japanese institutions, which poured money into dollar-denominated assets in the last decade, are still smarting from the effects of the strong yen.

HEADLINE: Book War: Shops vs. Superstores;
As Chains Grow, Struggling Small Stores Stress Expertise

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
Like a captain going down with the ship, Encarnita Quinlan stood among the half-empty shelves of Endicott Booksellers and gazed bravely at the bargain hunters picking over the remains of her store, which is closing after 14 years in business on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. A sympathetic customer approached and asked, "Heartbroken?" Ms. Quinlan threw an arm across her chest, struggled for the right word, and settled for "yes."
There is quite a bit of heartbreak among New York City's independent booksellers these days. With the arrival of Barnes & Noble superstores, places like Endicott's are finding themselves up against the wall, unable to offer the discounts or carry the number of titles found at Barnes & Noble stores, or to serve caffe lattes and flavored iced teas in spiffy mezzanine cafes. 
 Up and down Manhattan, even in Brooklyn and the Bronx, which have no superstores yet, bookstore owners and some serious readers warn of an approaching intellectual ice age, when impersonal superstores will drive out the city's rich array of neighborhood bookstores.
Others, particularly the hordes of customers who pack the aisles of the Barnes & Noble stores, are not so sure. Fans of the stores, including publishing executives, say they have brought a breath of fresh air. The stores are prospering, they say, because they are well run and a pleasure to visit, with a wide selection of titles, many at discounts.
What the future promises, some publishing executives say, is a New York in which many general-interest independent bookstores will be crushed by the Barnes & Noble juggernaut, but the superstores will coexist with specialty bookstores and independents that can diversify or provide a high level of service and expertise.
"There's always a place for a neighborhood bookstore," said Lenny Golay, co-owner of the Corner Bookstore, on Madison Avenue near 93d Street. She plans to open a second store, Lenox Hill Books, in mid-September on Lexington Avenue between 72d and 73d Streets.
What the small store cannot offer are the discounts and the number of titles available at the superstores. Barnes & Noble stores, which carry as many as 150,000 titles (compared with 35,000 at Endicott's), offer 20 percent off all hard-cover titles, 30 percent off hardbacks on the New York Times best-seller list, and 20 percent off paperbacks on the list.
But discounts are only part of the story. With their wide aisles, clubby decorating schemes, lavishly stocked magazine racks and coffee bars, they have become retail destinations -- a place to hang out, meet people and attend readings, children's programs and even concerts.
"When I first walked in here, my impression was, 'This is a cool store,' " said Danessa Atkins, who had traveled from Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, to shop in Barnes & Noble's Chelsea store on Saturday. "You can read whatever you want because they have these lounging chairs and everyone's relaxed."
Uptown, Doris Ogel was shopping for vacation reading at Books & Company on Madison Avenue near 74th Street. She pronounced Barnes & Noble "sort of a hassle." Books & Company was more like it, she said.
"I come here for certain things," she said. "They have a wonderful classical library, and a lot of poetry. Barnes & Noble is trying, but the people who work there are not real book people."
Real book people or not, the company thinks it has found a winner with the superstore concept. Last year, Barnes & Noble recorded sales of $953 million from its 268 superstores across the country, up 32 percent from $614.6 million from 203 stores in 1993.
Nationwide, superstores operated by the four largest book chains accounted for 17 percent of the $9.55 billion in retail book sales last year, up from 11 percent in 1993. That figure is likely to rise as expansion continues. Barnes & Noble, whose first New York superstore opened in Rockefeller Center in 1977, has opened five more superstores in Manhattan, one in Queens and one in Hoboken, N.J., in the last five years. It plans to open three new stores in the city by the end of the year, on 17th Street across from Union Square, on Broadway at 67th Street, and on Austin Street in Forest Hills, Queens.
Forest Hills and Lincoln Center, which has a few performing-arts bookstores only, are more or less virgin territory. The Union Square store will test the downtown market since it is only a few blocks from the Barnes & Noble store on Fifth Avenue at 18th Street, which is itself within hailing distance of the chain's Chelsea superstore.
For independents, the success of the superstore formula means adapt or die. After Barnes & Noble opened a superstore at 86th Street and Lexington Avenue in January 1990, the Burlington Book Shop went out of business. So did Eeyore's and Storyland, children's bookstores that could not compete with the superstore's large children's annex. Eeyore's second store, on the Upper West Side, also closed.
After the Barnes & Noble superstore opened on upper Broadway in April 1993, Ms. Quinlan said, business immediately dropped 25 percent at Endicott's, at Columbus Avenue and 81st Street. That quickly fell to 45 percent and stayed there, even after she cut store hours and reduced the employees from 14, to 10. Before the superstore, she said, business had risen 5 to 7 percent annually. The store's official closing day is Labor Day, but if the stock sells out, it may shut its doors earlier.
"People tell me to add a cafe and sell coffee, but how many cups can you sell?" Ms. Quinlan said. "Besides, if I'd wanted to sell coffee and T-shirts, I would have gone into a different business."
A block down Broadway from Barnes & Noble, Shakespeare & Company carries on. The store, near 81st Street, has opened a second-floor used-book section. Customers who sell books to the store receive store credit. It has also begun selling rare books and remainders. Still, business is down, although management will not say how much. "They haven't done us in, but they're sure making life hard," said Felice Rose, the general manager.
Shakespeare, which has a store downtown on Astor Place, plans to open a third store on Lexington Avenue at 69th Street in the fall.
Many independents say Barnes & Noble is bent on total domination of the New York market. Barnes & Noble executives like to think they are creating new book buyers in a market with room for both superstores and book boutiques. "The overall market is expanding, and our company is in for a larger piece of a larger pie," said Stephen Riggio, chief operating officer of Barnes & Noble.
The big-pie argument has not done much to cheer up hard-pressed independents, however. "None of us see much of a future," said Jenny Feder, co-owner of Three Lives & Company Bookstore in the West Village. "We do special orders, we have a pared-down operation, we don't have high rent, but we're just eking it out."
David Ravel, manager of the Community Bookstore in Park Slope, Brooklyn, said the superstores have already affected buyer behavior in his store. Customers who cannot find a title no longer want to place a special order, he said. Instead, they head to Barnes & Noble. "What the superstores have done, brilliantly, is create the illusion that they have everything, and of course, no one can have everything," he said.
Owners and book buyers at independent stores say the loss of stores like Endicott will mean cultural impoverishment for the city. They say customers enticed by discounts will wake up one day to see they have traded away expertise, personal service and a commitment to small presses, university presses and quality books that require nurturing.
"E. Annie Proulx, who now wins prizes and sells widely, was supported by the independents for years before she made it to the chains," said Stuart Bernstein, the book buyer at Endicott's. "People are no longer going to find the depth of selection, the small-press book, or the odd university-press book. There are books I felt it was my responsibility to take a chance on."
Not everyone agrees. Susan Donnelly, the sales manager at the University of Chicago Press, said that about half of her sales now go through superstores, which have become more willing to stock not only the press's trade books but also its scholarly titles.
"Now at Barnes & Noble, they listen to our presentation of the most scholarly books at the back of the catalog," she said. "This isn't something that the independents particularly like to hear, but it's true."
Lisa Domitrovich, a consultant to and former executive director of Small Press Distribution, said the independents, under pressure from chains, have grown cautious in recent years. "They are no longer the major supporters of the small presses," she said. "The chains are."
Yes, for the moment, say the independents. But what happens when Barnes & Noble has established superstores all over the city?
"The big question is, if they are successful at eliminating the competition, what's their motivation to keep prices down, or to keep 'Epic of Gilgamesh' on the shelves, even if it only sells two copies a year?" Mr. Ravel said. Small-store owners like to point out that a year ago, Barnes & Noble quietly dropped its policy of discounting all paperbacks.
Mr. Riggio, who will not say how many stores Barnes & Noble plans to open, plays down the independents' fears. "Even with our big store opening in Chelsea, there has been an explosion of small bookstores in that area," he said.
St. Marks Books in the East Village is a stone's throw from Barnes & Noble on Astor Place and Tower Books on Lafayette Street. It has defined itself as an alternative by specializing in cultural theory and stocking a large number of poetry and fiction titles from small presses.
On East Seventh Street, See Hear, has carved a niche by carrying hundreds of fanzines -- magazines devoted to a single topic or obsession -- and related books. Ted Gottfried, the owner, is looking for a larger location so he can carry every fanzine being published. "It's the opposite of mass market," he said. "Anyone trying to play the general bookstore game is just going to die."

HEADLINE: Tiny Base May Give Clues to Saving Jobs

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: HEATH, Ohio

 BODY:
Newark Air Force base here is so small that it does not even have a runway, but President Clinton's top advisers are counting on it to solve a big political problem.
The little base amid the cornfields of central Ohio repairs guidance and navigation systems for nuclear missiles and fighter jets. But now it is enmeshed in Mr. Clinton's 1996 campaign hopes in California, where it is touted as a promising, though largely unproven, way of turning Government enterprise into private enterprise. 
 When the Pentagon decided in 1993 to close the Newark base, local residents and the Air Force came up with a plan to keep most of the 1,400 civilian jobs in the town. The idea was to have the workers become employees of a private company that would contract with the Government to do the work.
The military calls the concept privatization in place, and it would like to institute the process at some other bases to be closed to ease the impact on the local economy. This is how California came into the picture.
In theory, private contractors could do the same work with fewer people at lower costs than the Government. The shift would allow the Pentagon to reap the savings of closing the base, keep skilled workers together to perform essential military tasks and avoid the cost of moving equipment.
The Newark base, in this community of 7,500 people 35 miles east of Columbus, is the first where the military has tried to privatize an entire installation. So anxiety reigns at the 70-acre installation, the smallest in the Air Force.
The civilian employees are torn between staying on with a private employer next year or transferring to another Pentagon maintenance depot to keep their Federal benefits. "I'm 48 with 18 years in this man's Air Force," said one employee, John Crumpley, a product engineer who wants to move to a Navy depot in Florida, "and I'm not about to give that up to go work for a contractor who'll fire me after a year."
Several large contractors, including the Boeing Company and Rockwell, have bid on the Newark work and have promised to keep most of the jobs here. But the companies do not rule out eliminating some jobs.
One company, the Science Applications International Corporation of San Diego, pulled out of the bidding because of what it said were restrictive contract requirements.
"They were telling us the schedule to mop the floors," said David Berteau, a Science Applications International executive who is a former Pentagon official.
The General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, says contracting the work at Newark might actually cost $456 million more over the next five years than having the military do it. Even the Air Force says it does not know whether the plan will save money.
"We don't know what it will cost," Col. Joseph M. Renaud, the base commander, said in an interview. He said the winning bid would be announced on Dec. 5.
James F. Boatright, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for installations, said, "The only way to know for sure is to go through the process."
Despite the uncertainty, the Pentagon has said it will try to privatize most of the civilian work at two installations that are much larger and more diverse than Newark, McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento, Calif. and Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio. These are two bases the Air Force agreed to close on recommendations by the independent commission on base closings.
Citing Newark as a prototype, Deputy Defense Secretary John P. White said the Air Force would contract the work at McClellan and Kelly to local employers to keep thousands of jobs in the two cities. "We have in place in Ohio a real-live example," Mr. White told reporters. "We're doing this with the private sector."
Defense Department officials acknowledge that no one gave privatization at McClellan the slightest thought until July, when the commission recommended closing that installation, which employs 11,000 civilian and military workers. The Pentagon had recommended that the base remain open.
With all the jobs at stakes at McClellan, Mr. Clinton and his top aides faced a difficult political calculus: Reject the panel's findings and risk Republican accusations that the President was politicizing a nonpartisan process that had worked well since 1988, or do nothing and anger many voters in a state that is crucial to Mr. Clinton's re-election hopes.
"One cannot deny there was political pressure," a senior Defense Department official said. "The question was, What could you do to moderate it."
Enter Newark Air Force Base, which is so small that a visitor can easily walk from the front gate to the two main buildings: the administrative headquarters and the vast shop, where technicians repair F-16 gyroscopes, measure laser beams and wield 50-ton calibrators in subterranean chambers where temperatures are controlled to one-tenth of a degree.
Pentagon and White House aides express confidence that privatizing civilian jobs will work at the bases in Ohio and California, particularly since McClellan is not scheduled to close for five years. By that time, Administration officials say, they can apply to the larger base the lessons learned from Newark.
Under the Administration's plan, the Pentagon will employ 8,700 civilian workers at McClellan through the year 2000 and about 4,500 with a private contractor after that.
While Air Force officials are scrambling to work out the specific details of the McClellan plan, some experts say it is premature to use Newark as a model for the much larger bases in California and Texas.
"I hope the Newark example works out, but it's a minor effort compared to what's proposed at McClellan," said Paul Taibl, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who is director of economic programs for the Business Executives for National Security, a research organization in Washington. "If it's unsuccessful or rocky, it could sour Congress on trying it again."
Even commanders at Newark note the differences between their base and their much larger California cousin. Newark is a small, specialized installation. The Air Force estimated it would be cheaper by fivefold to leave the work in Newark than move it. McClellan, by contrast, is a sprawling complex base that performs a variety of aircraft maintenance work that could be done at other Air Force depots now operating well below capacity.
"They have a much larger operation then we have," said Colonel Renaud, who recently flew to McClellan to offer advice. "They face a challenge of trying to get their arms around this huge operation and decide how to make privatization work. It's going to be a monumental challenge."
California's members of Congress, who fought to keep McClellan open, express concern that the Pentagon may be applying an experimental idea to McClellan before the time is ripe. "Of course, I'm concerned," said Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California. "It's never been tested in a larger way."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
$207 Million Deal Is Near At WNYC-TV

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
The ITT Corporation and Dow Jones & Company have agreed to pay New York City $207 million to acquire the city-owned television station WNYC-TV, Channel 31, people involved in the negotiations said yesterday. The companies plan to transform the station into a 24-hour sports, financial news and entertainment service, they said.
The goal is to make what is now a public television station into a superstation, like WTBS in Atlanta and WGN in Chicago, that can be beamed by satellite to cable systems around the country. 
 The station would offer professional sports events including games of the Yankees, Knicks and Rangers, whose broadcast rights rest largely with the MSG cable network, which is owned by ITT and the Cablevision Systems Corporation. Cablevision's Sportschannel service has the rights to some Mets games, as well as those of the New Jersey Nets, the New York Islanders and the Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils, and the new station is expected to negotiate for the rights to some of those games -- giving it a potential lineup of seven major-league teams.
Dow Jones is expected to provide business and economic programming, including material from its Asian Business News and European Business News television operations.
The price tag is two to three times what New York City expected to reap when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced plans in March to sell the television station and to turn over the city's two radio stations to a nonprofit foundation. The foundation is to pay the city $20 million over six years, raising the money from listener pledges and other sources.
A sale price of $207 million for WNYC-TV would be a windfall for the Mayor's tightly stretched budget and a vindication for Mr. Giuliani, who was criticized when he first proposed to sell the city's television and radio stations.
"I figured $40 million to $70 million," said Thomas Morgan, who resigned as president of WNYC last year rather than be party to the sale. Even so, Mr. Morgan added, "If they'd waited a few more years they could have gotten more. It had developed into a great alternative TV public station."
When Mr. Giuliani, shortly after his inauguration, broached the idea of selling the city's stations, it was the listeners to public radio who protested the loudest. The deal to sell only the television station quieted many critics, though the foreign-language programmers who lease a large chunk of broadcast time on Channel 31 had appealed in June to retain their access, which they will lose under this deal. English-language programming for immigrants and financial news from Bloomberg Business News are also broadcast on leased time.
The ITT-Dow Jones purchase of WNYC requires approval of the Federal Communications Commission. The partners expect the deal to be cleared within six months.
The key to the ITT-Dow Jones plan is to use programming and resources already in place, rather than spend tens of millions of dollars to develop programming from scratch. Though the price is high for a UHF, or ultrahigh-frequency, station, the anticipated cost of programming is low.
In buying WNYC, the venture will have a local broadcast station that can transmit its signal to a satellite, from which it can be plucked by cable systems around the country. In this type of "superstation" arrangement, the station owner receives no fees from the cable systems but is able to sell a national audience to advertisers.
The alternate approach would have been to market the MSG network nationally, but this would have required the negotiation of thousands of contracts with cable systems.
One executive involved in the negotiations said MSG and WNYC would not show games simultaneously. Instead, the strategy will be to allow viewers without cable television to see some games of local teams on what is now WNYC. Knicks and Rangers games have only been available on cable television except for an occasional game of the week; only 50 Yankees games a year have appeared on broadcast television in recent years, with more games shown on cable.
WNYC is available to noncable viewers in the New York City market, but it can be difficult to pick up without a strong antenna. ITT and Dow Jones are planning to double the power of the station for easier reception.
ITT would also provide programming from its Caesars hotel-casino properties, including concerts, boxing and tennis matches.
Dow Jones would supply financial programming from midnight to 6 A.M., including reports from Asian and European markets that Dow Jones publishes each day in The Wall Street Journal. Domestic financial news and features broadcast from a New York studio would be featured from 6 A.M. to about 5 P.M..
"Dow Jones has a fairly substantial interest in business TV overseas," James Dougherty, a Dean Witter Reynolds analyst, told the Dow Jones News Service. "Owning TV stations is clearly in their future."
The executive involved in the talks said there was not a timetable yet for turning the station from local to national distribution as a superstation. He also said he did not expect that the Yankees, which are owned principally by George Steinbrenner, would be paid more to beam their games nationally.
ITT and Cablevision jointly own the Knicks and Rangers. In the past, Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association have been sharply critical of superstations like TBS and WGN, saying they reduce the value of the leagues' national TV contracts.
The N.B.A.'s attempt to eliminate Chicago Bulls' games on WGN led to a Federal antitrust lawsuit that eventually allowed WGN to continue to broadcast 30 games a season, though not the 41 games that the superstation wanted to show. The N.B.A. was also allowed by a Federal judge to impose a fee on WGN's telecasts.
The Giuliani administration, apparently annoyed that news of the sale had leaked out before an official announcement could be made, declined to comment yesterday.
"It's too early to talk about," said Colleen A. Roche, the Mayor's press secretary.
In March, city officials had estimated that WNYC would sell for $65 million to $75 million. As the bids came in, however, the increased interest in the station prompted speculation that it could sell for as much as $90 million. But no one at City Hall had predicted that it might sell for more than twice that amount.
WNYC broadcasts from the Municipal Building near City Hall. New York has been the only major American city to operate noncommercial stations, and Mr. Giuliani has said that with its fiscal problems the city has no business continuing to operate them.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Despite some problems, the news from Mexico is mostly good.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
REMEMBER the peso crisis in Mexico? No news, in this case, is largely good news. The much criticized "bailout" has allowed the Government to avoid default on its debts and even begin attracting foreign capital. "The White House should get high points" for preventing panic and helping to minimize the pain that followed the devaluation, concludes Jeffrey Sachs, director of Harvard's Institute for International Development.
But there is still plenty to worry about. For while Mexico's deep recession, engineered to permit exports to regain their competitiveness in world markets, has reshaped the economy faster than expected, Mexico's capacity to achieve Asian-style growth remains very much in doubt. "Financial stability," suggests Rudi Dornbusch, an economist at M.I.T., "has been given the upper hand over a sustainable development strategy." 
 Mexico's devaluation was virtually inevitable because the administration of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari allowed the peso to rise sharply in the 1990's relative to its purchasing power. Inexpensive imports, the reasoning went, would keep Mexican consumers happy and force long-protected Mexican industry to shape up or shut down.
But once foreigners got the message that Mexican exports were uncompetitive, the torrent of foreign investment that had sustained the overvalued peso stopped and Mexico could no longer pay its bills with borrowed dollars.
Unfortunately, the Government delayed the day of reckoning until after national elections by spending down its nest egg of foreign currency. Thus, when devaluation did come, those who had lent dollars to the Government quite reasonably worried that Mexico would be forced to renege. The "bailout," in the form of a $51 billion line of credit collateralized by Mexico's revenue from oil exports, prevented investor panic and the Government's default.
Lawrence Krohn, a senior economist for the Union Bank of Switzerland, argues that President Ernesto Zedillo then gambled that harsh belt-tightening would permit Mexico to put its financial mistakes behind it in a hurry. And thus far, the gamble seems to have paid off. Populist politicians have not been able to make inroads by promising an end the austerity. Indeed, Mr. Krohn says, "the left has gained no ground,"
Foreign investors, particularly direct investors in no rush to recoup dividends, are coming back. What is more, the overnight reduction in domestic spending has permitted exporters to divert billions of dollars of Mexican goods into world markets, transforming an $18.5 billion trade deficit in 1994 into a surplus estimated at $5.5 billion this year.
This turnaround is far faster than conventional economics would predict. But it does not surprise Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics. "Mexican industry has a tradition of looking abroad for markets when domestic demand is slack," he notes.
With any luck, Mexico's recession will end this year after a drop in economic output of between 3 percent and 4 percent. The Union Bank of Switzerland is forecasting 2 percent growth in 1996. And Mr. Krohn believes that Mexico is capable of achieving sustainable growth of 4 percent.
But don't crack that bottle of tequila just yet. For one thing, Mr. Dornbusch notes, deja vu could happen all over again. Once the economy is out of recession and foreign investors return in force, Mexico may well be tempted to let the peso creep back up to an exchange rate that inhibits export-led growth.
Besides, 4 percent growth (partly offset by 2 percent population growth) would hardly put Mexico in the big leagues with, say, Thailand or even Chile. Mexico and Chile, incidentally, had virtually the same per-capita income in 1986; this year, Chile's will be 80 percent higher.
The heart of the problem, Mr. Dornbusch argues, is Mexico's failure to save enough to finance its own growth. According to the International Monetary Fund, Mexico's savings have averaged just 14 percent of income in the last decade, compared with an average of 20 percent in countries at a similar stage of development. And because Mexico cannot rely on foreigners to make up the difference, growth is ultimately constrained by the willingness of affluent Mexicans to save more and spend less.
Mr. Dornbusch says that institutions are to blame, not the culture. "Mexico does suffer from proximity to the United States," the world's most profligate economy, he jokes. Nonetheless, he argues, public policy could make a big difference.
Mr. Dornbusch has in mind higher taxes that would allow the Government to run a permanent budget surplus. And he would like to see a Chilean-style system of forced savings for retirement, in which a portion of everyone's wages is assigned to the private mutual fund of the saver's choice.
The Zedillo administration has, in fact, acknowledged the savings problem. But with Mexico's decaying ruling party divided on how much and how fast it dares change, serious reform is no certainty.

HEADLINE: Murray H. Finley, Labor Leader For Textile Workers, Dies at 73

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Murray H. Finley, the labor leader who led the final, innovative campaign that forced the J. P. Stevens Company to accept union contracts in 1980, died on Monday at the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor.
Mr. Finley, who was 73, had moved to Ann Arbor after his retirement as president of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union in 1986. 
 His wife, Elaine, said the cause was leukemia.
A distinctly new-school labor leader who never stitched a seam, Mr. Finley was a lawyer who worked his way up through the administrative ranks of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union of America, which represented some 350,000 workers in the men's clothing field.
A year after becoming president of the union in 1972, Mr. Finley presided over what amounted to a dress rehearsal for the J. P. Stevens campaign, an effort orchestrated by a union strategist, Ray Rogers, who used consumer boycotts and corporate pressure to force Farah slacks to accept union contracts at its plants in El Paso.
The stage for the final battle against J. P. Stevens was set in 1976, when Mr. Finley helped negotiate a merger with the Textile Workers Union of America.
The textile workers had been struggling to organize Stevens factories in the South since 1963, but although workers at several factories had voted to make the union their bargaining agent, the company had steadfastly refused to bargain, engaging in blatant intimidation and other illegal tactics.
With Mr. Finley as president of the merged union, the company began to experience some intimidation of its own.
The union organized a nationwide consumer boycott, disrupted the company's annual meeting in New York, mounted noisy campaigns to induce corporate executives to resign from the Stevens board and put pressure on banks that dealt with Stevens to abandon the company.
The company capitulated in 1980, accepting union contracts calling for hefty raises at 10 of its 160 plants. But since then, an economic recession and rampant imports have taken their toll on both textile employment and union membership.
Amalgamated, which had 500,000 members after the 1976 merger, had only 200,000 a month ago, when it merged with the International Ladies Garment Workers Union to form Unite, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees.
Before he retired in 1986, Mr. Finney, who had begun his career denouncing corporate greed, was speaking out on trade issues in a vain effort to block low-cost imports.
Mr. Finley, whose father was an engineer, was born in Syracuse and grew up in Flint, Mich., where, his wife suggested yesterday, the struggles of the United Automobile Workers at the local General Motors plant helped make him a lifelong union man. He joined the U.A.W. when he worked at a machine gun factory before serving with the Army in World War II.
Mr. Finley graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in economics in 1946. Then, after receiving his law degree from Northwestern University in 1949, he went to work for the old Amalgamated, serving in various capacities in Detroit and Chicago, where he supervised the creation of a vast array of union social programs, from low-cost housing to day care and health clinics.
After his retirement Mr. Finley taught at Harvard University and the University of Virginia.
Besides his wife he is survived by two daughters, Sharon, of Exeter, N.H., and Susan, of Cortez, Colo.; his wife's niece, Jolynne Miller of Manhattan, whom the couple reared after her mother's death, and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Dollar Surges as U.S. and Japan Act Jointly in Markets

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
The dollar soared to its highest level against the yen in nearly five months today after the United States and Japan sold about $1 billion of yen and the Japanese Government moved to make it easier for institutions there to invest their yen abroad.
With international markets flooded with yen, the dollar rose 3.3 percent against the Japanese currency, standing at 90.96 yen in late New York trading, up from 88.04 yen on Tuesday. 
 Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said the moves by both nations were consistent with an agreement made by the Group of Seven leading industrial nations on April 25, which called for an "orderly reversal" of the plunge in the dollar that occurred in the winter. Many currency traders took Mr. Rubin's remark as suggesting that the United States would intervene in the currency markets again, a line of thinking that Administration officials did not discourage.
Economists said the dollar's rise might damp sales abroad of American goods but would still help the overall American economy. By making imported goods slightly less expensive, a stronger dollar could diminish fears of inflation here and make it slightly easier for the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy by cutting interest rates.
That possibility, as well as a belief that Japanese institutions would step up their investment in the United States, sent the stock and bond markets up sharply, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising as much as 55 points soon after the Fed began its intervention. Later, though, the Dow average gave up all of its gains when traders took profits. [Page D8.]
The stronger dollar and the Japanese Government's move to ease controls on overseas investments by financial institutions could also reduce the odds that Japan's banking crisis will spread elsewhere. Japan's ailing banks and insurance companies have invested huge sums in the United States, and a stronger dollar makes those investments worth more.
The changes in investment rules were announced today in Tokyo by the Ministry of Finance, Japan's bank regulator. The ministry is overseeing institutions with a total of at least $570 billion in bad debts and it witnessed a run this week on Tokyo's largest credit union. By giving Japanese banks and insurance companies more leeway to pursue higher yields abroad, the authorities hope to lower the yen's value; when Japanese institutions invest abroad, they sell yen and buy other currencies.
Mr. Rubin expressed concern last week about Japan's banking crisis and urged the Bank of Japan to do whatever was necessary. But in a statement today, he presented the joint intervention in the currency markets and the Ministry of Finance's policy changes as part of a continuing international effort to reverse the dollar's plunge.
"We welcome the actions taken by the Japanese authorities to remove impediments to capital movements," Mr. Rubin said. "These actions and our joint operations are consistent with the April 25 G-7 communique."
Mr. Rubin's statement left the impression with traders that the United States might take actions to push the dollar even higher. Administration officials nurtured that view today by sticking to their policy of refusing to speculate whether they would intervene again in the coming weeks.
Currency traders said that today's intervention, while not the biggest of this Administration, was particularly effective. They said it worked because it showed strong coordination between Tokyo and Washington and because Mr. Rubin again caught traders by surprise, making them reluctant to resist the Treasury by selling dollars.
"It's the most aggressive thing they've done so far, as far as trying to prevent the deterioration of the dollar against the yen," said David F. DeRosa, the director of foreign exchange trading in New York for the Swiss Bank Corporation.
Kevin J. Lawrie, a foreign exchange manager at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said that the intervention was successful because traders were partly taken by surprise and quickly joined the Federal Reserve in buying dollars. "This thing seems like a tidal wave; it probably seems like more than it is," he said.
After two unsuccessful interventions in the spring, Administration officials have concluded that the best way to influence currency markets is to ambush them. Today's intervention and two other successful interventions this summer have come when the dollar was already rising and when traders did not see an immediate need for the United States to support its currency.
While traders were applauding the skill of today's move, economists were divided on its wisdom. The dollar's rebound from a low of 79.80 yen on April 19 has made American goods slightly less competitive in foreign markets. But if the dollar's strength allows the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, most economists believe that will have a much greater effect on the economy than a modest change in exports, which account for only one-eighth of economic output in the United States. And with the Japanese economy stagnant for the fifth year, American companies have had particular trouble expanding sales there.
William R. Cline, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics here, wondered whether the dollar's rise would lead to a widening of the American trade deficit with Japan over the next couple of years and to worsening trade tensions. "It's a mistake," he said, adding, "I think the dollar is properly valued at 85 yen and if the dollar works its way back to 100 yen, then two years from now the United States Government is going to be complaining" that the trade imbalance with Japan is too large.
But Lawrence Chimerine, an economist at the Economic Strategy Institute here, said that a wide variety of business practices in Japan restricted the sale of American goods there and that the trade imbalance was not a reflection of currency movements. "We are so supercompetitive at 90 that you don't need 80" yen to the dollar, he said. "I think they want to send a message to the Fed: a strong dollar, lower import prices, all make it easier to lower interest rates."
Administration officials, following their policy, declined to comment on what the independent Federal Reserve should do about interest rates.
The Fed, acting on the Treasury Department's directions and possibly using money from the Bank of Japan, swapped as much as $1 billion of yen for dollars during four rounds of intervention in currency markets today, Mr. Lawrie said. The Bank of Japan also bought dollars during trading in Tokyo, traders said.
The dollar also gained against the German mark today, rising to 1.3976 marks in late New York trading from 1.3758 marks Tuesday.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Bonds Up on Outlook For More Japanese Buyers

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices surged yesterday in a rally fueled by the prospect of more Japanese investors entering the market to compete for Government securities.
Earlier, the Japanese Government surprised financial markets by announcing measures to ease controls on Japanese financial institutions to encourage overseas investments. The plan heartened traders in New York, who bet that it could mean increased Japanese investment in the Treasury market. 
 "The news added positive uncertainty, in that it created an environment where market participants are now concerned about a new set of buyers entering the market and competing for securities," said Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston.
Mr. Alexy attributed the buoyancy of the market yesterday in part to memories of the market in the 1980's, when Japanese investors were major buyers of Treasury securities.
Hopes of new buyers overcame concerns about new supply yesterday, as the Government plans to sell $42.5 billion of debt securities next week.
"Since Treasury securities yield higher than Japanese Government securities, Japanese investors might be interested in the quarterly refunding next week," said Waldo T. Best, an economist at Barclays De Zoete Wedd Securities.
Treasury prices were also bolstered by a sharp rise in the dollar, which gained after Japan and the United States sold about $1 billion of Japanese yen on foreign exchange markets. A stronger dollar makes American assets like bonds more attractive to foreign investors.
James Hale, a fixed-income analyst in the San Francisco office of MMS International, a market research and analysis firm, noted that as foreign central banks buy dollars "they typically use those dollars to buy Treasury securities."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond, which had gained more than a point during the session, was up 19/32 by late in the day, to 109 22/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.84 percent, from 6.90 percent on Tuesday.
Traders and analysts said the stronger dollar and the prospect of increased Japanese buying came at a good time as concerns had mounted over the market's ability to absorb a flood of new supply.
The Treasury announced the size of its quarterly auction yesterday, and it was bigger than expected -- or about $500 million more for each maturity. The Treasury said it was selling $42.5 billion of debt securities, including $18 billion of 3-year notes, $13 billion of 10-year notes and $11.5 billion of 30-year bonds. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the 3-year note was being offered at a price to yield 5.99 percent. The 10-year note was being offered at 6.43 percent, and the 30-year bond at 6.81 percent.
Traders were encouraged that the market did not become overly concerned about a report that showed a brisk pace in June home sales.
The Commerce Department reported yesterday that sales of new single-family homes rose 6.1 percent in June, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 728,000 from the revised May pace of 686,000.
While the report pointed to an economy recovering at a pace that makes it unlikely the Federal Reserve will lower short-term interest rates anytime soon, the market has already priced in expectations that the Fed will not cut rates.
"There was knee-jerk selling but experienced traders are not selling much based on the homes sales," said Mr. Best of Barclays De Zoete Wedd Securities.

Pair of Aces Has Become A Hot Hand

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

 BODY:
IT is premature, and much too muggy, to call this the pennant race just yet. First things first. Jack McDowell and David Cone need to get on a roll, begin their own friendly run to October within the Yankees' starting rotation. Their arms race will determine how the Yankees do in the divisional race.
"From my Mets' days, we sort of thrived on what we did as a staff," Cone said. "In the short term, we can push each other. Good pitching is contagious." 
 McDowell pitched well enough yesterday into the eighth inning. Then Kevin Seitzer doubled leading off, Buck Showalter yanked him for the struggling Steve Howe and Howe promptly blew up a tied game the Yankees eventually lost, 5-2, to Bud Selig's discounted Milwaukee Brewers. Cone goes tonight, another chance to counter a McDowell defeat with a victory, as he did in Minneapolis Saturday night. He is the early leader in the Yankees' arms race.
These expensive and occasionally weird and wired right-handers -- one clean-cut and cagey, the other scruffy and somewhat shy -- are here to carry a staff that is otherwise too banged up or baby-faced. In other words, the usual, around Yankee Stadium. At least George Steinbrenner, whose last homegrown starter who amounted to much was Ron Guidry almost 20 years ago, has this time gone out and rented as his twin aces the Cy Young Award winners for 1993 (McDowell) and 1994 (Cone).
"An ace is what Tom Seaver was," argued Cone, the one-time aspiring sportswriter and erstwhile tabloid playoff columnist. "That's an ace, not a guy who comes in and does it for two months."
Now that Steinbrenner has apparently abandoned the veneer of being among the budget impaired, maybe this doesn't have to be a one-season stop for McDowell and another brief layover for Cone. If they can carry the Yankees into the playoffs and beyond, there may be more inflationary money for McDowell and Cone, who happen to be working with no more years on their contracts.
"It depends on the direction the team goes," said McDowell, 8-8, a long way from his Cy Young year of 22-10. He shrugged: "Let's wait and see what it looks like at the end."
The word on McDowell, especially after his middle finger snapped to attention as he left the mound two Stadium starts ago, was that he would be gone the minute his guaranteed $5.4 million was paid in full. Not necessarily the case, he claimed.
He may be a West Coast rock guitarist whose favorite tabloid is the Village Voice, but McDowell said he likes the Yankees and New York, too. To prove it, he and his wife rent on the upper West Side. One year, with an option.
Across town, back in the pad he's been renting in absentia since 1992, Cone has no particular inclination, or plan. He has already changed teams five times in a decade, the rate picking up speed as baseball plunges deeper into economic instability. Cone has become so accustomed to his peripatetic life that he's developed a sweet little rationalization speech.
He wanted to know who, exactly, in contemporary sports isn't a hired gun. "Somebody wants you in a pennant race," he said. "That makes you feel good."
If McDowell believes New York overreacted to him last month, Cone will tell him some stories as they lounge in the bullpen some lazy August night. By the time Cone was finishing with the Mets in 1992, he was a regular in the gossip columns, renowned for, among other things, alleged sexcapades. Cone made mistakes, felt the wrath of the city's news media machine. He still didn't want to leave, and would've returned in a matter of months.
That's when Ewing Kaufman, the late Kansas City Royals' owner, won him back to his native state and original team. "He was dying of cancer and he looked me in the eye and said he wanted to rectify the worst trade he'd ever made," said Cone. That dramatic appeal, supplemented by a $9 million signing bonus, whisked Cone from Steinbrenner's grasp.
Back in Steinbrenner's New York, Cone, a loyal union supporter of Donald Fehr, said there is nothing to fear but fear itself. "Win, lose or draw, I'm not going to hide in the trainer's room," he said.
Give this hired gun the ball every fifth day. McDowell, too, has shown the potential to weather this sultry city as the race heats up. The Stadium fans have apparently forgotten his fickle finger. They cheered him again yesterday as he left the mound. The Yankees haven't made the playoffs since 1981. Finally, they appear armed, and ready.

HEADLINE: Forecasting Gauge and House Sales Show Gains

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
More evidence that the economy is perking up emerged today as the Government's main forecasting index posted its first gain of 1995 and sales of new houses were at the briskest pace since late 1993.
"The signs of rebound are there," said Darwin L. Beck, an economist at CS First Boston. "Lower interest rates help to sell houses," he added, and bode well for sales of cars and other big-ticket items in coming months. 
 Today's figures, analysts said, were the latest of several indicators suggesting that the economy's sharp deceleration during the first half of the year has stopped well shy of recession and that growth, though still restrained by a buildup in inventories, was reviving.
A third report today showed that by one measure the economy actually contracted during the April-June quarter, the first shrinkage since the end of the 1990-91 recession. When calculated according to the Commerce Department's chain-weight process, which considers how changes in prices affect what is produced, the decline was at a rate of two-tenths of 1 percent, following a 1.7 percent rate of expansion during the first three months of the year.
But it was the department's forward-looking index of leading indicators that captured much of the attention today, despite its undistinguished predictive record in recent years and the fact that most of its components have previously been published. The housing number took on less significance when what appeared at first glance to be a sharp jump in home sales in June turned out to mainly reflect a sharp downward revision for May.
The leading index edged up two-tenths of 1 percent in June, after four consecutive monthly declines. (January's reading was unchanged.)
Eight of the 11 components contributed to the increase, the largest being a jump in the M-2 money supply, which includes currency, checking accounts, some savings deposits and money market mutual funds.
The others, ranked by impact, were another surge in stock market prices, a rise in the University of Michigan's index of consumer expectations, lower first-time claims for unemployment insurance, an expansion of the factory workweek, increased issuance of building permits, higher contracts and orders for new plant and equipment, and more new orders to factories for consumer goods and materials.
The three negatives were a deceleration in prices for materials especially sensitive to the business cycle, a decline in backlogged orders for durable goods and a decrease in the proportion of companies reporting slower deliveries from suppliers.
June was the 10th consecutive month in which the prices component rose at a slower pace, according to Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C. J. Lawrence.
Two companion indexes also gained. The index of coincident indicators, whose components tend to move at the same time as the economy at large, rose three-tenths of 1 percent, after the first back-to-back declines since early 1991.
The index of lagging indicators, which includes the bank prime rate and the inflation rate for services, climbed seven-tenths of 1 percent, the biggest rise since February.
The report on sales of new single-family houses, also from the Commerce Department, showed sales at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 728,000 in June, 6.1 percent above the revised May pace of 686,000. May sales had been initially estimated at a considerably higher 722,000.
The median sales price eased to $132,000 from $133,900, while the stockpile of unsold houses remained at 347,000, a 5.8-month supply at the current sales pace.
The chain-weight measures of gross domestic product, which the department began publishing as an alternative gauge in 1992, will replace fixed-weight data as the featured gauge at the end of this year, when a comprehensive revision of national income and product accounts is scheduled.
The main goal is to correct for what economists call substitution bias, the shifting of demand, and hence output, in response to changes in relative prices.
The bias associated with fixed-weight measures, which assume no response to changing prices, was once considered small enough to ignore, but in the 1980's prices and quantities of the energy and food components began to swing significantly and computer prices fell rapidly while output of them surged.
Illustrating the tendency for output measures using fixed-price weights to produce higher current growth than chain-weight measures, the department reported last week that G.D.P. rose at a pace of five-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter. This compared with the decline of two-tenths of 1 percent calculated under the chain-weight alternative published today.

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO 

 BODY:
Stock car racing, which is being acclaimed as the new growth sport of the 1990's, faces a problem similar to that of a backwoods guitar picker who suddenly gets discovered by Nashville: how to remain true to those who loved you in obscurity while cashing in on the big time.
Nascar's Winston Cup series, which was featured on the cover of two major national magazines last month, is enjoying record attendance and television ratings as it approaches its new showpiece event, the $4.5 million Brickyard 400 this Saturday in Indianapolis. 
 According to Goodyear, Winston Cup attendance went from 3,127,130 in 1989 to 4,896,000 last year, an almost 64 percent jump. ESPN says ratings for its race broadcasts so far this year are up 27 percent from 1994.
Even so, the Winston Cup series is as geographically imbalanced as a pro football league without a Los Angeles franchise. Ten of its 31 races are at five tracks in a 140-mile stretch from southern Virginia to South Carolina.
A solution that could take the sport to the next level of national popularity appears near. By early 1997, there could be tracks that will eventually have 100,000 seats or more in such sponsor-lucrative markets as Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth, Las Vegas, Nev., and Miami. But to gain access to the bright lights, Nascar may have to pay less attention to the land that sustained it through hard times: the rural Southeast.
But the easiest way to solve the problem -- expanding the 31-event season -- would add too much pressure to the lives of mechanics and pit crews, everyone in the sport admits.
"It looks like we're maxed out on the number of race dates," said Bill France Jr., the president of Nascar.
At the moment, stock car racing's most important economic barometer -- the cost of running a team versus the amount sponsors will pay -- is in balance. But team owners say their expenses are rising, even as demands on sponsors cannot rise significantly.
"You've got places like North Wilkesboro, N.C., and Rockingham, N.C., that the sponsors couldn't care less if we raced there," said Felix Sabates, owner of Kyle Petty's car, which is sponsored by Coors beer. "Right now, I'd be afraid to go to Mr. Coors and say I need another $1 million next year. But I would not be afraid if we had some of these new markets."
Although Nascar tightly controls technology (Winston Cup cars still use carburetors), the creation of new teams has raised salaries for experienced personnel, and teams are free to use sophisticated equipment in private test sessions.
"Five years ago, there were teams operating with $2 million annual budgets," said Richard Childress, Dale Earnhardt's car owner. "Today, teams operate with $7 million to $8 million budgets."
The top 15 teams, Sabates said, get about $4.5 million to $6 million annually from sponsors. The rest must come from prize money, which owners split with drivers. The average Winston Cup race has a purse of between $900,000 and $1.4 million -- a range some car owners would like to see improved.
"I think at some point, you'll have to start setting a minimum purse of $1.5 million to $2 million a race," Childress said. "When they do that, and if some of these places can't bring in enough people to pay that much, then you'll have to start looking at some of these tracks like Texas and Las Vegas."
Most track owners are adding seats, to cash in on sellout crowds and also to meet Nascar's requests for fatter purses and better facilities. But as tracks expand, access roads and parking capacity are strained.
Larry Carrier, who built the half-mile oval in Bristol, Tenn., in 1961, then rescued it from bankruptcy after he had sold it to a new owner, has watched the track grow with the Winston Cup series until it has become a facility with about 75,000 seats today.
Carrier knows he must keep investing money in his track to justify Nascar's decision to give him two Winston Cup races annually.
"It's going to take two Winston Cup dates to survive," he said. "You can't do it with one to keep up with what Nascar wants."
But the way he sees it, Nascar owes him something, too. "It goes back to loyalty," Carrier said last week. "Nascar has always been loyal to us, and we've always done what Nascar wanted."
When the series struggled years ago, Carrier said, he helped buy cars for drivers so other races would have good starting fields. "We kept racing going when it wasn't anything," he said. "Those other people building tracks who want two races, that's their problem. They just got here too late."
O. Bruton Smith hopes he is not too late. Smith built Charlotte Motor Speedway -- with its six-figure trackside condominiums. Through his majority interest in Speedway Motorsports Inc., a publicly held company, he owns Charlotte and Atlanta Motor Speedways and began clearing ground last week for a $100 million speedway northwest of Fort Worth.
"We feel 100 percent confident that when we complete a 150,000-seat, one-and-a-half-mile speedway in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, Nascar won't have any choice but to come running there," said Eddie Gossage, who will run Smith's new Texas speedway. It is scheduled to be completed next July.
But will Nascar grant the two Winston Cup races each year that Smith says he needs to make the track viable?
"We feel we'll be able to get them," Gossage said.
To understand the depth of Gossage's confidence, consider the following:
*Nascar has already promised a 32d race in 1997 to Roger Penske's planned speedway in Fontana, Calif., about 45 miles east of Los Angeles.
*Homestead Motorsports Park, a 1.5-mile speedway about a half an hour south of Miami, opens this November.
*Work is under way at a 107,000-seat oval north of Las Vegas, with completion planned in May.
"I'm sure the traditionalists won't like it," Gossage said, referring to the possibility that some of the smaller tracks will lose one of their two Winston Cup dates to the Texas track. "But the N.F.L. doesn't have the Canton Bulldogs any longer."
An interesting analogy, considering that Gossage's boss, Smith, is half-owner of the Winston Cup version of Lambeau Field. In June, Smith, through Speedway Motorsports, bought 50 percent of the North Wilkesboro track. North Wilkesboro, which opened in 1947 and is the oldest track on the circuit, is also its biggest target for jokes.
As soon as Smith bought into the track, speculation started that he would ask France to transfer race dates to the Texas track. But Smith denied that he would seek a date shift, saying that he would improve North Wilkesboro and keep the two Winston Cup races there.
France, when asked last week whether he would allow a track owner to move Winston Cup dates between tracks, replied: "The dates aren't for sale, per se. But on the other hand, if an owner wants to shut one down and move it elsewhere, we'd be willing to look at something."
When the subject of shifting Winston Cup dates from an old track to a newer, better-located one comes up, the talk must include Bill France. But that's not just because France's father, William (Big Bill) France Sr., founded Nascar, the sanctioning body that the family still owns.
The family also owns 61 percent of the shares -- about a $265 million stake -- of International Speedway Corporation, which controls Daytona International Speedway, Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway and Darlington (S.C.) Raceway.
The company also has a half-interest in Watkins Glen (N.Y.) International race course, and Bill France Jr. owns a share of Martinsville (Va.) Speedway. Together, these tracks hold nine Winston Cup races a year. And since Smith's Speedway Motorsports Inc. stock came on the market on Feb. 24, France's I.S.C. stock has jumped about 45 percent, from $130 to $190 a share.
France is generally considered a wise and benevolent dictator, with the Winston Cup seen as the best-run, most competitive auto racing series in the world. "Anything we've asked the other tracks to do, such as repaving, or adding more prize money, our tracks have been as much a leader in this as anything," France said.
But none of this stopped Kyle Petty from suggesting, after the most recent event at Darlington, that its infield should be flooded and the track turned into a fish pond. No owners or drivers shouted him down.
There may be another way out for France and Nascar, a solution used by traditional pro leagues: expansion. "We may find one day in the near future we may have an Eastern Division and a Western Division," Smith said. That is, split the Winston Cup series into two divisions, each with 25 to 30 races.
Nascar is considering it, France said. Such a split, if it occurs, is several years away, he said. But it may be the least bloody way to keep the tracks that helped Nascar grow while adding the ones that will help it prosper.

HEADLINE: Gloria Chadwick, 63, Official In U.S. and International Skiing

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD 

 BODY:
Gloria Chadwick, an international ski racing administrator who was especially dedicated to furthering women's cross-country competition, died on Sunday at her home in Lake Placid, N.Y. She was 63.
Her brother, Norman Chadwick of Mount Vernon, Wash., said she died of cancer. 
 In her youth, Miss Chadwick was a downhill ski racer on the United States A team. She had wanted to compete at the Olympic level, but a skiing accident in which she broke her leg sidelined that ambition.
Undaunted, she went on to make her mark in the sport through administrative undertakings, and in 1986, was inducted into the United States National Ski Hall of Fame in Ishpeming, Mich.
She had been director of the United States Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid since 1985, and was executive director of the United States Ski Association from 1961-68. She was also the first national coordinator for Nastar, a racing program for recreational skiers.
For the last decade, she focused her efforts on behalf of women in skiing as chairman of the International Ski Federation Subcommittee on Women's Cross-Country.
Miss Chadwick was born in Philadelphia, but her family moved to Lowell, Mass., when she was a toddler. As a teen-ager from a modest home, Miss Chadwick honed her Alpine skills by skiing regularly at nearby Cannon Mountain, N.H.
She received a bachelor's and master's degree in business from the now-defunct Staley College in Brookline, Mass., and later studied management at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, Calif.
In a breakthrough for women in the ski industry, she was hired in 1971 by the Big Sky Resort near Bozeman, Mont., to be director of marketing, and later, a vice president.
From 1975 to 1983, she was president and general manager of Burke Mountain, Vt. In 1983, she became commissioner of economic development for the state of Vermont.
In 1985, Miss Chadwick opened the United States Olympic Education Center at Northern Michigan University in Marquette, Mich. Later that year, she also began supervising the $12 million modernization of the Lake Placid training center.
During the last two years, she was in charge of developing the ARCO United States Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, Calif.
Miss Chadwick is survived by her brother.

HEADLINE: Pathmark: The Right Move

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has now approved the construction of a Pathmark supermarket on a desolate city-owned lot in East Harlem. His decision removes the last obstacle to a store the neighborhood needs. It also means that Mr. Giuliani has chosen to set aside narrow political considerations that might have killed the project. It was the right choice, not least because it sends a reassuring message to other corporations that might want to do business in New York City.
The process has not been easy. Surveys suggest that a majority of the area's residents, both black and Hispanic, want the 53,000-square-foot supermarket and the 200 jobs it is expected to generate. But for months the project has been caught up in an emotional and sometimes nasty turf war that pitted East Harlem's small-market owners, most of them Hispanic, against the black-dominated nonprofit development consortium behind the deal. 
 The project raised delicate political problems for the Mayor. Even after it received the other necessary government approvals, Mr. Giuliani, a man known for strong opinions, delayed weeks in making known his position because he was clearly anxious not to offend Hispanic small-business owners who have been an important element of his political support.
He therefore devised a compromise that saves both the supermarket and, perhaps, his political base. As recast by the Mayor, the deal allows the city to keep a 49 percent stake in the enterprise (a group that includes the nonprofit development arm of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church will own the rest) until a suitable local group from largely Hispanic East Harlem can be found to take it over.
There is some irony in this compromise given the Mayor's disdain for basing any municipal decisions on race and ethnicity. Nevertheless, the city stands to benefit, especially if it helps encourage other development projects in East Harlem.
To his credit, Mr. Giuliani pointedly rejected Pathmark's attempt to defuse local opposition by pledging to contribute $25,000 a year, for a minimum of five years, to create an economic development fund for East Harlem, presumably to assist Hispanic-owned businesses. "There's no reason to exact additional taxes from businesses that want to do business in this city," he said. "That's a way to discourage business."
That is a sound principle on which the Mayor should now educate the City Council. A Council committee recently approved another Pathmark store, for the Springfield Gardens section of Queens, after the company agreed to donate more than $400,000 over 20 years to a slush fund controlled by the local Councilwoman, Juanita Watkins.
New Yorkers, especially poor New Yorkers, need more supermarkets, not more selfish politics as usual.

HEADLINE: Big Deals, With Journalism Thrown In

BYLINE: By Bill Kovach; Bill Kovach is curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard.

DATELINE: NANTUCKET, Mass.

 BODY:
As the news about the mergers that are reshaping the television news industry continues to tumble out, public affairs journalism seems to have been swept away by America's new mania for corporate bigness.
Few of the early accounts of Disney's deal with Capital Cities/ABC and the sale of CBS to Westinghouse Electric have made more than passing references to the implications for the future of independent news gathering. 
 But there are dangers. Among them is the degree to which the emerging corporate structures will smother what remains of a passion for public affairs coverage in the corporate news divisions.
 There was a breathtaking glimpse of the future on Monday when Charles Gibson, co-host of ABC-TV's "Good Morning America," interviewed Thomas S. Murphy, the chairman of Capital Cities/ABC, and Michael D. Eisner, the Walt Disney chairman -- his present and future bosses. Mr. Gibson tried to raise the question of the impact of the merger with the entertainment giant on the high-quality journalism at ABC-TV.
Mr. Murphy, without missing a beat, asked Mr. Gibson if he wasn't proud to be a member of the Disney family. Mr. Gibson struggled to keep the conversation on an objective level that might be of some real value to the viewers. Mr. Murphy noticed his discomfort with the question and joked about it with Mr. Eisner. Mr. Gibson may have thought his role was that of an objective journalist. His bosses made it clear that their interest tended more toward entertainment than information.
The trend is not new. For the past decade and a half, journalism has been slowly squeezed into a smaller and smaller corner of the expanding corporations that make up the communications industry. The values and norms of journalism have been steadily eroded as corporate managers order news divisions to produce more "infotainment" programs.
This leads to programs like the recent Diane Sawyer interview on ABC's "PrimeTime Live" with Michael Jackson that was tied to the release of a new video with which the network hoped to be associated in the minds of the elusive youth market. Such programming increasingly draws resources away from the discovery and pursuit of important material for the evening news broadcast.
Though the trend is not new, with the Disney-ABC merger the threat to a form of journalism that serves the interests of a self-governing people crosses a new threshold.
Even with the best of intentions, owners and managers are influenced by the fact that they now preside over a corporation that, by the simple act of merger, has drastically reduced the proportionate importance of the news department. An already diluted pool from which the values of journalism will be drawn has been reduced to peripheral importance in corporate decisions. ABC's news division will now have to compete with the enormous energy of Disney's entertainment productions in a company in which ABC's value as an outlet for entertainment is paramount.
One important advantage that television news departments have had is the relatively low cost of production of news compared with entertainment shows. But the marriage of Disney's entertainment production company with ABC's worldwide transmission system changes that relative position.
Because of the opportunity to cycle and recycle Disney's cartoons and movies worldwide, the per unit production costs of these entertainment packages will be substantially lowered. More important, news neither keeps nor travels particularly well, but Mickey Mouse goes on forever and is welcome everywhere.
And there is another force at work, best represented by the proposed merger of CBS and Westinghouse, that should cause worry. This rush to merge mainly entertainment organizations that have news operations with companies deeply involved in doing business with the Government raises ominous questions about the future of watchdog journalism.
Communications companies make up the fastest growing industry in the United States. They have now almost completely ingested the country's news organizations. Because these new communications corporations are so dependent on Government decisions, they are actively involved in lobbying for and buying Government favors.
According to the Center for Responsive Government, the communications industry was the sixth largest contributor to the candidates in the 1994 elections. The industry contributed nearly $10 million directly to political-action committees.
As they seek to buy favorable treatment in law, rules and regulations and to win Government contracts for their manufacturing divisions, these corporations have become supplicants of the very institutions whose behavior they must objectively monitor if their work is to be of any value to the public.
There is a basic fact about the free-market system. The market is governed by the logic of economic self-interest. Public affairs journalism is by definition concerned with the broader interests of a civic society. These latest mergers will drive two more press organizations deeper into a world dependent for its well-being upon the decisions of governments here and abroad. A passion for good old-fashioned journalism could hardly find a more discouraging atmosphere within which to try to survive.
 But in the end, the most important factor that can warm the passion for journalism is the commitment from the top of the news media corporations. The owners of The New York Times, Washington Post and Boston Globe risked Federal prosecution to provide readers with the analysis of the Vietnam War contained in the Pentagon Papers. And there is the example of a few Southern newspaper owners who, at great economic cost, encouraged full and objective coverage of the civil rights movement.
 That is certainly not the sort of message Charles Gibson got when he tried to interview the men at the top of America's biggest new media conglomerate.

HEADLINE: Californians Can Put Civil Rights Back on Track;
To Open Doors

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Glenn C. Loury (Op-Ed, July 26), who claims that the moral high ground on affirmative action is to ignore race and gender in recruiting job candidates and government contractors, suffers from an ivory tower understanding of the real world. 
 The programs subsidized by taxpayers to provide higher education, health care and new roads are dominated by an establishment controlled by white males. In this era of shrinking resources, the old-boy companies that have built costly staffs and facilities are under pressure to maximize every opportunity to maintain them. The single wedge that keeps the door open to those outside the network is affirmative action.
For prime contractors, who now have to share some publicly funded work with minority and women subcontractors, it would be more profitable to perform all the work in-house. But different faces often bring fresh ideas, highly motivated people and lower overhead rates.
Women-owned companies are hiring people of all types at twice the rate of white, male-owned companies. And when times get tough, owners who remain close to their origins are more likely than bottom-line managers to forgo their own benefits to keep staffs off unemployment.
President Clinton has it right when he says: "Affirmative action is good for America . . . Mend it, don't end it."

HEADLINE: Ailing Fishing Industry to Get $53 Million in Aid

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
President Clinton announced a $53 million disaster relief package today to combat emergency fishing problems and put unemployed fishermen to work in New England, the Northwest and Gulf of Mexico.
The biggest share of the money, about $25 million, will go to Northeastern states hit hard by declines in groundfish stocks. About $15 million will go to states along the Gulf of Mexico to assist the industry with uncharted seabed obstructions caused primarily by flooding. 
 About $12 million will go to the Pacific Northwest, extending programs started last year to buy back fishing permits as well as put fishermen to work restoring fisheries and counting fish for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
"I am taking this action today," Mr. Clinton said in a statement, "because fishermen in the Northeast, Northwest and Gulf of Mexico have suffered millions of dollars of losses because the source of their livelihood -- fisheries resources -- has been disappearing."
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, speaking at a Capitol news conference, said of efforts to buy back fishing permits, "One of the problems is there are too few fish and too many boats being used to catch them."
The money will come from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is part of the Commerce Department.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Iraq Still Violates U.N. Terms for Lifting Sanctions

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration disclosed new intelligence information today in an effort to persuade its allies not to lift economic sanctions against Iraq, asserting that Baghdad still uses terrorism to kill opponents abroad and had developed vast stocks of germ warfare agents.
In a hearing before a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee, Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate to the United Nations, took an unyielding attitude toward easing the sanctions, a move that France and Russia hope the Security Council will approve next month. 
 Sounding like a prosecutor, Ms. Albright ticked off point by point how Iraq continues to flout United Nations resolutions with which it is supposed to comply in order for sanctions to be lifted.
Iraq, she said, has failed to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction, failed to return property stolen from Kuwait, failed to stop supporting terrorism and failed to stop repressing the Kurds and minority groups.
To build her case against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, she showed aerial photographs of Kuwaiti military equipment that Iraq stole after invading Kuwait in 1990, but has not returned, as required by Security Council resolutions.
She also displayed photographs showing that Iraq has expanded a missile research and development installation and built a chlorine plant that she said could quickly be transformed to build chemical weapons.
Ms. Albright condemned Mr. Hussein's recent threats to unnerve the world and stop dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction if the United Nations Security Council does not ease the sanctions in September.
"Baghdad must understand that it is not involved in a negotiation," she said. "It is under an obligation brought on by its own transgressions."
She disclosed that the Administration had concluded that Iraqi security services were behind an automobile crash last summer that killed the son of the late spiritual leader of Iraq's Shiite minority group. She also said that last year, Iraqi intelligence officers killed Talib al-Suhayi, an Iraqi opposition leader in Beirut.
To show that Mr. Hussein and his closest supporters are living in luxury while the Iraqi masses are mired in poverty, she showed the Senators satellite photographs of some of the 50 palaces and luxury residences that she said the Iraqi Government is building at a cost of $1.5 billion.
In her testimony, she asserted that members of Mr. Hussein's family, especially his son Uday, were enriching themselves by importing goods, despite the embargo, and reselling those goods at exorbitant prices. She also said they were involved in exporting oil and using "the proceeds, in part, to line their pockets."
She said Mr. Hussein was so worried about a possible coup by Iraq's military and Republican Guard that he has established a new elite paramilitary group and has given more security responsibilities to Uday Hussein.
Eager to resume commerce with Iraq, both France and Russia have proposed removing the embargo on Iraqi oil once Baghdad provides full cooperation in dismantling and providing information on its weapons of mass destruction.
Ms. Albright said no sanctions should be eased until Iraq comes into full compliance. "Iraq will respond constructively only to a policy of firmness," she said, adding that its compliance "has been grudging, slow, sporadic and insufficient."

Time Warner Agrees To Cable Rate Plan

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Time Warner Cable said yesterday that it had reached an agreement with the Federal Communications Commission to lower basic cable rates, with offsetting increases in another tier of cable service, and to provide more than $5 million in refunds to customers.
Under the accord, the company will also upgrade its systems and offer free service to public schools. 
 Time Warner Cable will reduce the price of basic cable service by 10 percent. It said the cut would apply to all of its systems, which have a total of 9.7 million subscribers.
The price of this service will be capped, with adjustments permitted once a year for changes in external costs and inflation.
The company, based in Stamford, Conn., will offset the move on basic rates by raising the monthly charge on another tier of service by up to $1 each year. This tier includes some broadcast stations and channels like CNN, CNBC and ESPN.
Time Warner Cable said it would make refunds in the form of bill credits to customers in systems where its rates were subject to refund liability because of rate complaints that followed the re-regulation of the cable industry in 1993.
Refunds will be made in parts of New York City; Syracuse; St. Petersburg, Fla., and other cities.
A spokesman said the refunds would vary greatly, and declined to estimate how many subscribers would be affected by the rate moves.

India State Government Scraps $3 Billion Enron Project

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
A regional government in India has decided to scrap a $3 billion power plant being built by the Enron Corporation, in a move that threatens to derail the growth of foreign investment in that country.
The cancellation of the power contract was announced yesterday by the nationalist Hindu leaders of the state government of Maharashtra. They are opposed to the policies of the national Government, whose four-year-old commitment to economic change and a more open environment to foreign investors is being tested by the attack on the power project. 
 India is an important emerging market for American companies, one of the few in Asia where they have been able to steal a march on Japan. Clinton Administration officials have brought groups of executives there, and the Energy Secretary, Hazel R. O'Leary, won guarantees last year from Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao for the Enron project and several others.
In New Delhi, a spokesman at the United States Embassy said that diplomats would consult with the Indian Government. "We are deeply concerned," he said.
Enron, in a cautious statement from its Houston headquarters, invited further discussions but threatened to seek the legal enforcement of its contracts. The company has already spent more than $100 million on the project.
But an Enron executive in India, who asked not to be named, called the cancellation "a blow to the country."
After the regional government first proposed scrapping the project in the spring, Enron executives and American diplomats met with officials of the national Government, hoping that the Prime Minister would step in to rescue the project.
The electric power plant was to be India's largest single foreign investment. The project, on the rocky coast of the Arabian Sea 100 miles south of Bombay, was meant to supply more than 2,000 megawatts of power, a huge amount by any nation's standards. The first phase, to be completed in 1997 at a cost of $990 million, would be diesel-fueled. The next phase, costing $2 billion, would be fueled by natural gas.
Enron, the largest natural gas company in the United States, owns 80 percent of the project, with Bechtel Enterprises and GE Capital, the General Electric Company's finance arm, splitting the rest.
The recently elected leaders of Maharashtra have attacked the project, accusing the company of receiving favorable terms from Mr. Rao's Government.
"The project is against the interests of Maharashtra and its people," Manohar Joshi, chief minister of the Maharashtra state assembly in Bombay, told the legislature. "Whatever Enron asked for was granted." He has accused Enron of corrupting politicians to win favorable terms, including high electricity rates, without competitive bidding, an accusation that the company and Mr. Rao's Government deny.
Mr. Joshi and other Hindu nationalists have turned the Enron deal into a noisy national debate, appealing to fears of foreign exploitation that date to India's colonial past. His coalition won state elections in March, and his party is preparing to sound the same themes in a national election that Mr. Rao must call by next spring. Companies like Coca-Cola and I.B.M. were kicked out of India in the 1970's, but Mr. Rao has welcomed foreign investors back.
It remains unclear whether there is any room left for negotiations with Maharashtra's leaders. Having seized the political advantage, the Maharashtra government might still choose to renegotiate Enron's terms, said Marshall M. Bouton, executive vice president of the Asia Society in New York and a former United States diplomat in India.
And electric power is sorely needed in India. Chronic power shortages regularly paralyze factories, offices, hospitals and trains. The Enron plant was to be the centerpiece of India's plan to raise power output by a half by 2000, with 60 percent of the increase to come from foreign projects.
The attack on Enron is bound to frighten other companies, Mr. Bouton of the Asia Society said. "In the foreign investment community, this raises questions of whether deals once done in India will be carried through, and in general whether the forces of economic nationalism are counterattacking after four years of reform," he said.
The CMS Energy Corporation, the parent company of one of Michigan's largest utilities, has already threatened to pull out of two power projects, worth a total of $800 million, if politics kills the Enron plan. Last week, the company president, Victor J. Fryling, spent five days meeting Indian national and state officials to speed the necessary approvals and guarantees.
Although progress has been slow, Kelly M. Farr, a company spokesman, said yesterday, "We're optimistic that we have support from the state and central governments." CMS awaits the central Government's response to Enron, he said, noting that the CMS plants would be in different Indian states.

HEADLINE: Judges Use a New Weapon Against Driving Drunk

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
Some drunken drivers are facing a new obstacle: a dashboard computer that detects alcohol on the breath and prevents the car from starting when the driver's alcohol level is too high. As more judges order the devices installed, and the devices become more sophisticated, some traditional law-enforcement functions are being turned over to private contractors and even microchips.
"It's a Big Brother type of thing," said Michael L. Walton, the Court Administrator in Hamilton County, Ohio, where judges have flexibility in ordering the devices use. 
 But Mr. Walton and others say that without the devices, those convicted of drunken driving and put on probation might otherwise lose their licenses, which can be tantamount to a sentence of unemployment. Or they may drive without a license, and still drink, threatening others. Thus, some libertarians say they are not bothered by the basic idea.
"At some point, potential victims have a right to step in and say, 'I simply will not be exposed to this much risk,' " said Roger Pilon, director of the Center for Constitutional Studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian group in Washington.
One alcohol-detection device, the Sens-O-Lock, has a synthetic voice that demands a breath sample when the driver puts the key in the ignition. The computer then determines if the person is sober; if he or she determined not to be, a microchip wired to the car's electrical system keeps the car from starting. The computer will also note the failed test, and that information may be passed along to the authorities by a technician who periodically downloads the computer's memory.
Although the computers have been around for a decade, they have become more sophisticated: they now can tell whether a child or a balloon, hair dryer or other substitute is being used to give the breath sample in place of an adult, though they cannot tell the identity of the adult. With this new feature, cases like Gregory Cook's can be avoided.
Last September in San Marcos, Tex., Mr. Cook took his 8- and 10-year-old daughters to breakfast and drove drunk into a waste pond at a water-treatment plant. All three were killed. The car had an older alcohol-detection computer, and Mr. Cook regularly had one of his daughters blow into it.
The new computers also ask for a retest at odd intervals while the car is moving, to prevent a drinker from driving sober to a bar, leaving the engine running and going in to drink. If it does not get a retest, an alarm system will go off, usually flashing lights and beeping of the horn.
As computer prices have declined, so has the cost of alcohol detectors. The manufacturer of the Sens-O-Lock, Alcohol Sensors International, foresees a voluntary market for people who know they have an alcohol problem. The company, in Ronkonkoma, L.I., is planning to sell a campus model to nervous parents, for $400 to $425.
But most models now in use were ordered by a judge and lease for $60 or $70 a month, paid by the driver. There are 15,000 to 20,000 of the devices in court-ordered use in about 35 states, with at least seven New York counties using them. Gov. George E. Pataki is expected to sign legislation soon that would permit their use statewide. New Jersey and Connecticut do not have probation for drunken drivers and thus do not use the devices.
Texas, where judges have ordered many motorists to install alcohol-detection devices as a condition of probation for drunken driving, will bring them into a new era on Sept. 1. A law taking effect then will require the computers as a condition of bond for a driver arrested on a charge of drunken driving if he or she had a previous drunken-driving conviction.
Experts say Texas will become the first state to require them as a condition of bond as opposed to probation.
Jay Jacobson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, said that one open question was whether a recorded test failure was the breath of the probationer or someone else who had access to the car keys. Nonetheless, Mr. Jacobson said he did not object to the devices because "my knee-jerk predilection is to be very harsh" on drunken driving.
He said that Federal regulations "require employers to put in all sorts of safety devices." If a person has been known to drive drunk, he said, this device seems reasonable.
Experts say the availability of the computers makes some kind of punishment more likely because judges are often reluctant to suspend a driver's license, considering that sanction equivalent to a sentence of unemployment.
"This technology is an important development, because we lack options, otherwise, for dealing with this," said Dr. Jay Winsten, an associate dean of the Harvard School of Public Health and director of the Harvard University Alcohol Project. "This makes it easier for judges and juries to bring a guilty verdict."
It also prevents a person from driving drunk. As New York and other jurisdictions have discovered, lifting a license does not remove the physical ability to drive.
"Compared to license suspension, this probably reduces the recidivism rate by 90 percent," said Donald W. Collier, a chemist who developed the idea for the computer in 1970 while working for the Borg Warner Corporation.
"You're taking away his car if he's got alcohol in his system," said Dr. Collier, who is a trustee of the National Commission Against Drunk Driving in Washington.
But the technology can, in some cases, put extraordinary power in the hands of technicians. When a judge orders a probationer to get an alcohol detector, the installation is done by a private company; in Delaware, Virginia and West Virginia, for example, the company is a monopoly chosen by the state, while in California, most probationers have a choice of four or five companies.
The driver must return to the vendor at specified intervals, usually 30 to 60 days, so that a technician can plug a computer cable into the device to retrieve the record of the tests. In some states the data are transmitted to the authorities by computer modem, without the technician even knowing what they say. In others, the technician may evaluate the data and decide whether to send them on to the probation department.
For example, at Life Safer Interlock, an alcohol-detection leasing company in Cincinnati, Richard C. Freund, the marketing manager, considers his technicians "case managers." He cited a case in Columbus, Ohio, in which a man had one of the older computers. A girl who came in with her father on a regular trip to have the device calibrated and read, he said, "was remarking to provider about how neat a machine Daddy had, how she had to blow into it to open up his sun roof."
"We reported that to the probation department," Mr. Freund said.

HEADLINE: In Moscow Again, Clubs Cater to 'Members Only'

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Members of Grand Dynamo, a fancy private club in Moscow, have their own way of escaping the daily rat race. At night gamblers, with tumblers of Scotch and score cards in hand, place their bets ($10 minimum) on large trained rats that scurry through a neon-lit, glass-encased race course, prompted by a hand bell rung by a dwarf dressed as an 18th-century page.
"We've always had a lot of rats in Russia," Maksim Malkov, the manager, said with a smirk. "But this is the first time they've been organized." 
 Russia is once again becoming a members-only society. Cash, not Communism, is the criterion for admittance, and as the rich get richer, their tastes are growing less democratic and more decadent.
In a way, the private club scene is a bizarre, through-the-looking-glass reflection of how Soviet society was run in the days when local party bosses created their own lavish preserves, hidden behind iron walls. Only these days, bankers and mobsters pick up the tab for high-level Government officials to hobnob privately in sybaritic style.
"I think we can describe today's Russia as socialism for the elite and capitalism for the people," said Olga Kryshtanovskaya, director of the department of elite studies at the Moscow Institute of Sociology. She has just completed a confidential report on Russian elites in the provinces, ordered by President Boris N. Yeltsin's office. "The political elite gets economic privileges, and ordinary people are free to sell goods in kiosks," she said.
The wild, open-access night clubs and discotheques that mushroomed all across Moscow in the dawning days of capitalism are being replaced by members-only clubs. Mobsters, show business stars, politicians and businessmen all have their own places, though there is considerable crossover among the membership. Snobbery and networking play a role.
Safety is a constant preoccupation. At Grand Dynamo, an African security guard dressed to look like an American marine in helmet, fatigues and an M.P. armband, stiffly salutes arriving Mercedes-Benz and Volvo sedans.
Private clubs from Moscow to Yekaterinburg, Murmansk and Vladivostok offer the rich -- or politically powerful -- casino gambling, gourmet dining, cabaret shows, strippers and a cozy sense of exclusivity.
There are also more sedate establishments, with reading nooks and conference rooms, but even they are more Copacabana than Century Club. The stuffy, plutocratic Moscow Commercial Club, modeled on London's gentlemen's clubs along Pall Mall, also boasts its own casino.
Behind oak doors, there is a 1980's feel to Russia in the 1990's -- the ostentation and inflated egos of bankers and businessmen, the plunder of state industries, and glittery galas and fashion shows.
"Russia is the only place where even middle-aged mobsters take Ecstasy and dance to technopop," said Maximillian Friedman, a 20-year-old American nightclub consultant.
Major banks and former state-owned companies also have their own clubs. Logovaz, the country's largest car dealership and one of the most politically influential companies, spent $2 million to restore a turn-of-the-century merchant's mansion to entertain its top executives and guests.
Friends of the powerful Mayor of Moscow, Yuri M. Luzhkov, belong to Magisterium, a club that was hurriedly created for Mr. Luzhkov after he complained that he had no place to hang out after-hours.
Membership in Grand Dynamo, as in so many of the new, exclusive social clubs of Moscow, costs $3,000 a year. For that, its chosen mill around indigo-lit bars and pool tables, talk business in a foaming Jacuzzi or bet on rodents. All the waiters and waitresses are black, African graduate students from Patrice Lumumba University here.
"They steal less than our people, and they can say 'yes sir' with a respectful tone in their voices," said Boris Y. Mlinov, vice president of the club. "It gives the club some style."
Situated in a secluded corner of the Dynamo soccer stadium, the club has a plush if slightly raffish ambiance. Sixty-two of its 300 members are high-level Government officials, who as honorary members enjoy club privileges without paying the annual dues.
Other businessmen and politicians flock to an oak-paneled social club called the Center for the Liberal Movement, founded by Yegor T. Gaidar, leader of the democratic party Russia's Choice, and Oleg Boiko, a business tycoon. Mr. Boiko left Russia's Choice after Mr. Gaidar attacked the Government's handling of the Chechen war, but both remain members of the club.
The Moscow Commercial Club was the first private club of the Soviet Union, founded in 1989 to serve the country's new millionaires by Vladimir V. Semago, a Soviet functionary who used state money to restore its pre-revolutionary grandeur.
By day, Mr. Semago is a leading member of the Communist faction in Parliament, railing against social injustice. By night, he presides over the club's paneled dining rooms and conference rooms, the portrait of a genial plutocrat in scarlet blazers and a Ronald Coleman mustache.
Moscow boasts a members-only country club and golf course, as well as a private yacht club on the Moscow River. The nightclub Lis's, which opened in the 1989 as the first, cavernous Western-style discotheque of the perestroika era, closed down not long after a suspected organized-crime figure, Valery Dlukach and his bodyguard were shot and killed leaving the disco in 1993.
A little like Los Angeles in the 1920's and 30's, Moscow is a city preoccupied with reinventing itself. Styles and tastes vary, but there is a make-believe, theme-park quality to most of these places, from Logovaz Club, so exquisitely Empire in its furnishings, to Arlekino, a nightclub for children that owes more to Studio 54 than Romper Room.
Opened last May by the owners of a well-known adult nightclub, Arlekino, the kiddie version, features nannies and armed security guards who keep watch as children dance and rough-house in a Day-Glo disco, complete with tiny bar and bar stools, under psychedelic strobe lights and blaring pop music.
In a restroom wallpapered in Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck hangs a gaily painted sign, "No Smoking." The club is open for now to those parents who can afford the $10 cover charge, but the managers are considering making it members-only this fall.
Russia today is awash in strange reversals of fortune, and if the winners can be found toasting one another over Courvoisier cognac in armchairs, many of the losers are sulking in the club's backstairs.
Yuri S. Ananyev, a well-known animal trainer, worked for 30 years at the prestigious, but now impoverished, Durov Animal Circus. These days, Mr. Ananyev trains laboratory rats to race for Grand Dynamo, which pays him $400 a month -- four times what he made at the circus.
Preparing for another rat race, his champions squeaking hungrily in a box at his side, he grudgingly pulled on his tuxedo jacket. "Unfortunately, the only work these days is here," he said, glancing at the velour armchairs and amber-lit bar area with distaste. "It is the problem of our lives. Instead of making art, we have to get involved in gambling."

BILL TO DECONTROL PHONES AND CABLE TIES UP THE HOUSE

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Friday, Aug. 4

 BODY:
House Republican leaders delayed final action early this morning on legislation that would open the nation's telephone and cable companies to freewheeling competition.
The bill is still expected to pass the House of Representatives by a comfortable margin -- though it faces a threatened Presidential veto. But a protracted debate and action on an unrelated appropriations bill ran past midnight, well beyond the time the House was scheduled to take up the telecommunications bill. 
 At 1:15 A.M., the House Majority Leader, Dick Armey, asked that the House adjourn until 8 A.M. today, when it would take up the telecommunications bill. The motion was approved unanimously.
The House's decision to take up the bill during the day comes after several Democrats criticized Republicans for conducting debate on it under the cover of darkness. The legislation amounts to the most radical deregulation of the nation's communications laws in more than six decades, and the first night of debate began Wednesday and stretched past 2 A.M. Thursday.
At that time, opponents of the bill accused its Republican backers of staging a nocturnal assault on consumers.
"After midnight, vampire-like, the communications bill rises each evening to be debated until dawn, when again we return to the regular order on the floor," said Representative John Bryant, Democrat of Texas. "These issues are too important to be debated when America is sound asleep."
Thursday afternoon, Vice President Al Gore reiterated President Clinton's threat to veto the bill, calling it "abhorrent to the public interest and our national economic well-being."
But the bill's backers hailed its changes, saying it would increase investment, create thousands of jobs and, contrary to the opponents' contention, eventually lower telephone and cable rates.
"This legislation is balanced, sweeping and momentous," said its chief architect, Jack Fields, a Texas Republican.
Representative John Linder, the Georgia Republican who was managing the bill on the floor, said, "The American people will be amazed by the wide array of technological changes that will soon be available in their homes."
Mr. Linder also captured the philosophy of the new Republican majority behind the bill. "The most extraordinary development has come in those nations that have put their trust in the power and potential of the marketplace," he said on the floor early Thursday morning. "This bill states that Government authority and mandates are not beneficial to economic development."
It was evident in the visitors' gallery during the evening that the telecommunications measure was no ordinary bill. Visitors there are usually diffident tourists clad in T-shirts and Bermuda shorts. But at 2 A.M. Thursday, a different breed was keeping an eye on the chamber. Dressed in white business shirts and ties, they were riveted to the floor action. This crowd was pleased when, at 12:14 A.M., the House rejected a motion to adjourn, and members rolled up their sleeves for a night of battle.
Democrats suggested that the bill was being rammed through in the middle of the night to keep its contents hidden not only from the public but also from House members, who have just slogged through one of their busiest sessions and have not had time to focus on the details of the complex package.
The House bill, which is similar to one passed by the Senate in June, would make these changes in communications laws:
*Remove regulation of cable rates within six months, except for basic services.
*Allow cable companies to offer telephone service, and telephone companies to get into the cable television business.
*Allow local phone companies to offer long-distance service, provided they open their local monopolies to new competitors.
*Lift limits on the number of television and radio stations one company could own, and allow broadcast companies to own cable systems, newspapers and radio stations in one city.
Consumer advocates sharply criticized the last provision, which goes well beyond the Senate measure. The critics predict that it would lead to media monoliths that quash alternative voices. As evidence, they pointed to this week's one-two punch in which Walt Disney agreed to acquire Capital Cities/ABC for $19 billion and Westinghouse Electric reached a $5.4 billion deal for CBS.
"This is a signal that competition is not going to flow from this bill -- more consolidation is," said Bradley Stillman, the telecommunications policy director of the Consumer Federation of America.
President Clinton has also objected to any relaxing of the limits on media ownership. He said he would not sign the bill unless the House removed these provisions, as well as those that would ease regulation of cable rates and allow the regional Bell companies speedy entry into long distance.
Those changes did not seem to be in the cards. The House was preparing to debate amendments that focus on price controls on cable television, the reregulation of broadcast ownership and provisions for regulation of violence and gratuitous sexual images that could be constrained by technology.
At one point, Representative Michael Flanagan, a Republican from Illinois, rose at his desk in the chamber and produced a plastic trash bag full of mail. It was only one of the four sackfuls that had been arriving daily in his office, and those of practically every other House member, for several days.
The AT&T Corporation, an opponent of the measure, "would have me believe that thousands of people in my district feel so strongly about their corporate profits that they are going to send me thousands of telegrams," he said.
Mr. Flanagan, a first-term Congressman who unseated the once-powerful Dan Rostenkowski, is from Chicago, and he knows something about ballots cast from the grave. So he was suspicious when a deluge of telegrams arrived bearing exactly the same message. He asked his staff to check them out.
Of 200 people who supposedly sent telegrams to Mr. Flanagan, only 75 could be found, he reported on the floor. Of those 75, many did not speak English and only 3 had heard of the telecommunications bill. And they hardly cared enough to rush down to Western Union and wire an "urgent-gram" to Washington. One telegram, he said, came from Casimir, whose last name was not disclosed, who "passed on in March."
"It has been said in Chicago that those who have gone beyond have a tendency to vote," Mr. Flanagan said, "but to send me a telegram is indeed, truly, long distance at its best."
Both sides generated tons of mail, but many members said these particular sacks of telegrams came from a campaign engineered by the chief opponent of the bill, the Competitive Long Distance Coalition, made up of AT&T and smaller long-distance carriers. The coalition once supported the bill. But when House Republican leaders took the highly unusual step of changing the bill after it had been approved in committee, the coalition turned against it and has been spending millions of dollars in an effort to defeat it.
The lobbying effort is headed by Marlin Fitzwater, who was press secretary for President George Bush. He said he did not believe that the coalition's direct-mail company had generated fictitious mailgrams. But, he added, "Anytime you have an '800' number, you're open to anybody calling in and giving contaminated information."
 Mr. Fitzwater said his side had spent $10 million to defeat the bill.
Early this morning, Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan and a ranking minority member of the Commerce Committee, called for a Congressional investigation to determine whether fictitious telegrams were sent to House members.
Expecting the legislation to pass, the other side -- represented by the regional Bell companies, which enjoy the backing of House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other Republican leaders -- has spent about $1 million to promote it.
But for all the millions spent, many members said it had no effect on how they would vote.
Mr. Flanagan supports the bill, and suggested that the sweeping lobbying campaign against it had only hardened his support. The bill, he said, "will provide competitiveness to an industry that has long lacked it," he said.
Similarly, Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, said the mailgrams were "getting on people's nerves."
But the mail was not the only venue for propaganda. In the ornate Speaker's lobby just outside the House chamber, a highly regulated and secure area, one lobbyist had apparently received special permission to install a large easel. On it sat a time-line chart entitled "Trends in long-distance rates and exchange access charges."
Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon, was staring at the chart in the wee hours when an irrepressible yawn consumed his entire face. Whichever side wins, he observed, "it will be done in the dark of night because it involves real money."
He added: "The other big thing pending is the Department of Defense bill, the only category of expenditures that is increasing, and that will come up in the very last moments before the recess, and there will be a tremendous rush to get out of here in the hopes that they can preserve the B-2 bomber and their other pet projects. It's all very intentional."
Representative Scott McInnis, Republican of Colorado, commented, "Everything that needs to be said has been said, but not everyone has said it."
Marcy Kaptur, Democrat from Ohio, was aghast at the whole scene, and took the floor to tell the dwindling number of her colleagues just how she felt.
"Here we are in the middle of the night considering the most sweeping rewrite of the communications legislation in the last half-century," she said, adding that she was ashamed of the House. "There has been enough lobbying money spread around on this bill -- over $20 million -- to sink a battleship."
She added, "With a $1 trillion industry, with the rights of free press at stake and competition in every one of our communities hanging in the balance," the constraints on the debate time were like being "forced into a girdle."
She concluded: "I feel sorry for America tonight."
No one took issue with her.

House Delays Final Vote On Communications Bill
House Republican leaders delayed final action early this morning on legislation that would open the nation's telephone and cable companies to freewheeling competition. The bill is still expected to pass the House of Representatives by a comfortable margin -- though it faces a threatened Presidential veto.
But the House adjourned until 8 A.M. after protracted debate and action on an unrelated appropriations bill ran well beyond midnight. The House's decision comes after several Democrats criticized Republicans for wanting to debate the telecommunications bill under the cover of darkness. [Page A1.]

Corporate Profits Surge, Despite Sluggish Quarter
The economy barely budged in the second quarter, growing at an annual rate of five-tenths of 1 percent, but corporate profits continued to rise. The operating profits at the companies that make up the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose about 18 percent in the spring quarter, off slightly from the 21 percent rise in the first quarter. [D3.]
 
NBC to Acquire Outlet
NBC has agreed to acquire Outlet Communications for $47.25 a share, or about $311 million. NBC has also settled its dispute with Renaissance Communications, which had a deal for Outlet that came undone. [D4.]
 
Retail Sales Rose in July
Many of the nation's large retailers reported moderate sales gains during July. The heat wave helped them reduce inventories of lightweight clothing and ring up strong sales of air-conditioners. [D2.]
 
Factory Orders Fall
Factory orders declined two-tenths of 1 percent in June, the fourth time in five months orders have fallen, with demand slipping for aircraft and communications equipment. But in a hint of economic strength, jobless-benefit claims took a surprising 51,000 tumble. [D3.]
 
Ford Sales Climb 4.9%
Ford said its car and light truck sales rose 4.9 percent in July, but the increase, added to other auto makers' results, was not enough to lift the industry out of its slump. [D3.]
 
F.A.A. Plans Tracking System
A consortium headed by Wilcox Electric, with Hughes Aircraft and TRW, won a $475 million Federal contract to develop a navigation system that would let anyone from airline pilots to wilderness hikers pinpoint their location to within 21 feet anywhere in the United States. [A10.]
 
Tele-Communications Backs Turner
John C. Malone, the chief executive of Tele-Communications, said his company would do "everything we can to help" Ted Turner obtain a television network. [D4.]

Campaign Focuses on Hurley
Estee Lauder is reported to be spending $12 million to $15 million on a new ad campaign with Elizabeth Hurley, but it is also completely refashioning its advertising look to suit the actress.

HEADLINE: Pathmark's Neighbors Learn to Compete

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Along Jamaica Avenue, the commercial heart of the working-class Woodhaven section of Queens, a string of small, mom-and-pop shops opens every morning, providing their owners with a steady, if not always bustling, business.
Just a few blocks away stands a Pathmark supermarket, a hulking 70,000-square-foot presence astride a small strip mall. When the giant supermarket opened 10 years ago most of the other local merchants openly worried that they would be driven out of business. How could they compete with this commercial giant? 
 Today, however, more than two dozen small stores remain open within a one-mile radius of the supermarket -- roughly equal to the number when this Pathmark opened.
Ever since Pathmark Stores Inc. announced plans to build two new, giant supermarkets in New York City -- one in East Harlem and another in southeastern Queens -- the fate of small markets and grocery stores in those neighborhoods has been the subject of intense, emotional debate.
The plans have prompted an outcry from many owners of small businesses and several elected officials, who complain that the new stores will force dozens of small businesses to close.
Merchants on Jamaica Avenue in Woodhaven, as in other areas where large supermarkets have been built, said that they initially had to change their strategies -- and stock. But many contend that once they did, they had no trouble staying in business.
"We were here before Pathmark came," said Young Woo, the owner of Jea & Son Inc., a small market selling snacks, sodas and canned goods on Jamaica Avenue. "We have seen some people go, but we have seen a lot of people come here, too." She explained that the merchandise she carries has not changed much over the years. "People shop differently here than they do at Pathmark. They come here for the quick shopping. That's what we offer, and we're doing O.K."
Down the street, at Produce and Plus, a grocery store with fresh fruit and vegetables in outdoor bins, David Kim said his market has thrived by stocking produce that is particularly attractive to his Hispanic and Asian customers.
"We sell yucca, Brazil yam, plantains and a lot of things that you can't always find in Pathmark," he said. "Plus, our vegetables and fruit are fresher."
The City Planning Commission as well as the Community Food Resource Center, a nonprofit group that focuses on increasing access to food for low-income New Yorkers, have studied the impact of large markets on smaller stores. Each has concluded that the presence of supermarkets has rarely if ever resulted in a decline in the number of smaller stores in a neighborhood.
Their research has also indicated that, in many cases, a large supermarket creates a financial anchor that actually improves business for neighboring stores, no matter their size.
"We found that new supermarkets did not threaten the viability of existing food stores," said Pamela J. Fairclough, who is a project manager with the Community Food Resource Center.
"We looked at the impact in several neighborhoods where large supermarkets were built, comparing the number of smaller stores there before and after," Ms. Fairclough added. "We found that the same number of stores existed before as after."
One reason the small, mom-and-pop stores survive, Ms. Fairclough and city planners said, is that they provide services and products that give them a competitive advantage. Some provide steady customers with lines of credit; others sell ethnic foods rarely stocked in large supermarkets.
"We have done extensive research and the record shows that smaller stores are competing and competing successfully," said Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission. "There is no question that there is beneficial financial impact on the surrounding area when a large supermarket comes in."
Still, many people remain unconvinced. Adam Clayton Powell 4th, a City Councilman from East Harlem who has bitterly opposed the construction of the Pathmark store in his district, vehemently disputes the Planning Commission's findings. Mr. Powell insists that the new 53,000-square-foot store planned for his neighborhood will drive out smaller stores.
"They devastate the local economy," Mr. Powell said. "The big stores can afford to come into a neighborhood and lose money for a time. Once they monopolize the consumer base because of their rock-bottom prices, they are the only store left in town."
Mr. Powell charged that the very prospect of Pathmark coming into East Harlem has created financial hardships for existing small markets, which are now finding it difficult to get lines of credit. One East Harlem business had been unable to refinance its debt because of a skittish finance company, the Councilman said.
In Woodhaven, store owners said that in the initial years after Pathmark came to the area, some owners sold their businesses. But they were taken over by other merchants. Some store owners still there complain that business has not been robust in recent years, but they attribute that primarily to their customers' economic fortunes, rather than to Pathmark.
"For the most part, this is really a convenience store," said Charlie Datta, the manager of a deli and grocery store on nearby Woodhaven Boulevard. "In Pathmark, you have to have a cart, wait in line with a lot of food in the cart. Here, you're in and out.
"People come here for the convenience," Mr. Datta said. "There is enough business for everybody."

Jobless Data Send Treasury Prices Down

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities headed south yesterday, after a surprisingly large drop in the latest weekly jobless claims report sparked fears of rapid growth and rising inflation.
Claims were down to 321,000 for the week ended July 29 compared with the average trade estimates of 371,000 and against a downwardly revised 372,000 the week before. 
 Traders are trying to determine if the weekly number was an aberration or the beginning of a trend. It caused concern that the Fed would avoid making further changes in monetary policy for fear that the economy would accerlate and ignite inflation.
The long bond plunged 110/32 at its worst point, but by late in the day it was down 31/32 , to a price of 10823/32 for a yield of 6.93 percent, up from 6.86 percent on Wednesday.
Shorter-maturity bill rates were up an average of 4 basis points on the six-month and one-year maturities. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The economic data were not the market's only worry; supply also remained an issue, as the Treasury prepared to come to market with more than $67.7 billion in new bills, notes and bonds next week. This includes $25.2 billion in three- and six-month bills that are auctioned weekly, followed by the large quarterly refunding that begins Tuesday with $18 billion in new three-year notes, and $13 billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday. On Thursday the refunding will finish with the sale of $11.5 billion in 30-year bonds.
In when-issued trading yesterday, yields were higher as dealers searched for prices that would begin to attract the most investors. The 3-year was offered at a price to yield 6.09 percent; the 10-year at 6.52 percent, and the 30-year at 6.88 percent, up an average of 6 basis points.
Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh, said the bond market was supersensitive to any signs of economic improvement at present.
The drop in the claims report may have been overstated, analysts said, and spooked the market, even though there is little connection between the claims report and payrolls data due today, since the period comes after the July jobs survey.
"Given all the problems with weekly claims data that we know about," Mr. Hoffman said, "today's numbers may not reflect the real picture. Many factories, especially auto plants, shut down in early July, which bloated the claims report. Subsequently claims plummented when these workers returned in late July," he said.
"I would expect a rebound in new claims to the 375,000 level during the next several weeks," he added.
Ford, the last of the Detroit car makers to report sales for July, posted a rise for the month, with truck sales setting records. The report brought the total of domestically produced cars and trucks for all the United States auto makers to 6.6 million for autos, and 5.3 million for trucks, for a total of 11.9 million. The figure was well below expectations, matching the April low for the year.
Michael Strauss, chief economist at Yamaichi International (America) Inc., said, "Government yields were also pressured higher because people were expecting the Japanese to immediatetly respond to a loosening of investment restrictions that prevent them from buying more foreign bonds, and they have not."
Elsewhere, in the municipal bond market prices declined amid a lack of demand, especially from mutual funds. Analysts report, nevertheless, that many investors do not expect prices to fall significantly because issuance is light, down 25 percent from the beginning of the year through July.
Some investors have been reluctant to buy tax-exempt securities because of lingering concern that tax laws could be changed, diminishing the value of municipal securities.
Currently general-obligation bonds maturing in 30 years and rated single-A are yielding about 6.14 percent, or about 88 percent of Treasury bonds, according to Bloomberg Fair Value analytics. Investors generally consider the bonds attractive when they yield more than 85 percent of Treasury securities.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Down Against the Yen As Intervention Seems to End

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against most leading currencies yesterday as currency traders took profits a day after the dollar surged to nearly a five-month high against the Japanese yen.
The dollar rose sharply on Wednesday after the United States and Japan jointly entered foreign-exchange markets, selling about $1 billion worth of yen. In addition to the coordinated intervention, the Japanese Government introduced measures to make it easier for Japanese insurance companies and portfolio managers to invest overseas. 
 Japan wants to weaken the strong yen, which has hindered an economic recovery by making the products of important Japanese exporters more expensive abroad.
Traders said they saw no signs of intervention yesterday, a departure from the practice begun on July 7 when the Bank of Japan followed through on a joint intervention to support the dollar.
"They sort of felt: 'We did our thing yesterday; let's step aside and see how things go,' " said Richard Holbrook, director of global equities at Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser, a money management firm in San Mateo, Calif.
The dollar settled in New York at 90.52 yen, down from 90.96 yen late Wednesday. Earlier on Wednesday, the dollar rose as high as 91.27 yen.
The dollar also slipped to 1.3909 German marks yesterday from 1.3976 marks late Wednesday. The British pound rose to $1.6055 from $1.5997.
While traders took profits, they were also assessing the new Japanese investing rules. Traders questioned whether the plan would persuade Japanese investors, typically conservative and averse to risk, to invest in United States bonds and stocks, thus increasing demand for dollars.
"The fact that the doors are a little more open does not address the economic problems that underline the capital flow imbalance and the state of the economy on both sides of the Pacific," said Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst at Smith Barney Inc. The United States had a trade deficit of $66 billion with Japan last year.
Other traders noted that bond yields in some European countries were higher than comparable Treasury yields.
Traders will look for clues to the direction of United States interest rates today, when the Labor Department reports on employment in July. They are looking for confirmation that the economy is growing fast enough to prevent the Federal Reserve from pushing down short-term interest rates anytime soon.

HEADLINE: In America;
Buying Clothes Without Exploiting Children

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Readers have been asking what they can do about American companies that sell clothing made by exploited workers, many of them children, in the maquiladora factories of Central America and the Caribbean.
A woman from Montauk, N.Y., wrote, "I simply cannot sit back and watch my two children frolic in their vacation surf knowing that other children suffer to enable my kids to have cute bathing suits." 
 A woman from Berkeley, Calif., wrote: "It makes me want to do something. But what?"
A man from Tulsa, Okla., said: "For the last 20 years or so, I have watched the 'Made in U.S.A.' label grow scarcer and scarcer in the clothing departments of retail stores. Nevertheless, over that entire time I have made a commitment to purchase American-made apparel exclusively. Up to a few years ago this merely resulted in some minor inconveniences: slightly longer shopping trips and increased catalogue browsing. More and more it is turning into a grueling ordeal."
Many readers asked if there were a list of good companies and bad companies, some kind of guide that they could follow.
The questions raised were good ones, sensible and direct, and filled with compassion and a sense of responsibility. Most people do not want to buy clothing made by workers who are treated like slaves, and they find the exploitation of children especially repulsive. But the issue is complex, and the answers at the moment are not very satisfying.
In 1980, 30 percent of all apparel purchased in the United States was made abroad. Today the breakdown is about 50-50, with the balance about to be tipped in favor of imports. Some items -- sneakers, for example -- are hardly made in the United States at all. So, as consumers have found, it is very difficult to simply "buy American."
Moreover, a "made in the U.S.A." label is not a guarantee that the product was made by workers who are treated humanely.
"There is a tremendous proliferation of illegal sweatshops right here in the United States," said Charles Kernaghan, executive director of the National Labor Committee. "We can document hundreds of sweatshops in New York, San Francisco."
On Wednesday, officials raided a garment sweatshop complex in El Monte, Calif., where, according to authorities, nearly 70 Thai immigrants had been held in virtual slavery. The complex was surrounded by barbed wire and spiked fences.
"I never would have believed a situation like this could exist in the United States, and I hope I never see it again," said California's Labor Commissioner, Victoria Bradshaw.
The best thing consumers can do is let American companies know, emphatically, that they do not want to buy goods made by child laborers, or by workers of any age who are exploited. Speak to clerks and store managers. Write to company executives. Ask if garments were manufactured under humane conditions.
"If the consumers would engage the companies on this issue, if they would just enter the debate, it would be a tremendous breakthrough," said Mr. Kernaghan.
Consumers should ask company executives to respond with a letter certifying that none of their products are made in factories in which abusive practices are employed.
Consumer and labor organizations can be contacted for the names of newsletters and groups that track employment practices and boycotts.
It is important also for consumers to write their representatives in Congress, alerting them to their concerns about this issue. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa has introduced a bill that would block the importation of goods produced by children under the age of 15. A similar bill has been offered in the House.
According to Senator Harkin, as many as 46 million children around the globe make goods for the United States market.
Many apparel companies in the U.S. have adopted codes of conduct that are supposed to insure that the workers who make their products are not abused. But the codes, primarily public relations devices, are widely ignored by the independent contractors who run the factories.
Said Mr. Kernaghan, "As it stands now, no worker in Central America or the Caribbean has ever heard of a code of conduct."
In the headlong rush to dismantle the barriers to trade, enormous efforts are being made to protect the rights and property of the businesses involved. But the workers, the human beings who make the products, are not protected. In the international corridors of power, they are less than an afterthought.

HEADLINE: HOUSE PASSES BILL CURTAILING RULES ON PHONES AND TV

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
The House of Representatives approved a bill today that would radically rewrite the nation's communications laws for the first time in more than six decades.
In a frenetic session before breaking for a monthlong recess, House members voted 305 to 117 for vastly reduced regulations on everything from cable television to local and long-distance telephone services. 
 The bill would give local phone companies -- the so-called Baby Bells -- something they have been seeking for years: the right to enter the long-distance market. But in a setback to the television networks, House Democrats curbed some of the legislation's strongest elements of deregulation, winning key amendments to limit media ownership and to mandate that all new television sets include technology that would allow parents to block out programs with violence or sexual content.
But consumer advocates said the amendments hardly made the bill consumer-friendly. They predicted that cable and telephone rates would increase as big communications conglomerates were allowed to become even bigger.
"Congress has reached deep into consumers' pockets, opened their wallets and taken out their money," said Bradley Stillman, director of telecommunications policy at the Consumer Federation of America.
Still, the bill's Republican backers exulted in their victory.
"With this bill, we will break up two monopolies: local telephone companies and cable companies," said Thomas J. Bliley Jr., the Virginia Republican who is the chief sponsor of the legislation.
Republican leaders said the wide margin of victory today, and the Senate's 81-to-18 vote in June approving a similar measure, guaranteed that they could override a threatened veto from President Clinton, who sides with the consumer advocates. To override a veto, both houses must muster a two-thirds majority.
But while the House Republicans marshaled a seemingly veto-proof advantage, both Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who sponsored the amendments on media ownership and technology to block violent programming, and White House officials insisted that they had already corralled about a dozen votes from Democrats who voted for the bill but said they would support a Presidential veto.
Mr. Markey said that the back-to-back ABC and CBS deals announced earlier this week prompted both Democrats and Republicans to vote for stricter ownership limits.
"The members are now much more aware of what could happen if they don't pay attention," Mr. Markey said. A third Markey amendment, which would have limited cable rate increases, did not pass.
In approving the so-called V-chip that would be included in new television sets and allow parents to block programming, the House followed the lead of the Senate. But the House left room for broadcasters to develop an alternative blocking technology. Whatever the technology used, it would be up to the broadcasting and cable industries to develop a rating system.
The debate over the V-chip capped an exhausting and emotional session in which the lawmakers veered from highly arcane discussions of local and long-distance telephone competition to an impassioned debate on how to protect children from violent and sexual programming.
Representative Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican and ardent proponent of the V-chip, broke down in tears after it passed. Before the vote, Mr. Burton had described witnessing domestic violence in his childhood -- behavior that he said was encouraged by the violent images on television.
Although the media and programming issues dominated the House debate, the telecommunications bill will have its biggest economic impact on the telephone industry, where local and long-distance companies will now be allowed to compete head-on.
The long-distance carriers were dealt a significant setback yesterday when the House leaders amended the bill to make it easier for the regional Bell companies to offer long-distance service.
In the original bill, the Bell companies would have had to meet a rigorous checklist of items to gain entry into long distance. Most important, they would have had to open their local markets to competitors and demonstrate that those competitors were offering service "comparable in price, features and scope."
Now, though, the Bell companies can gain entry into long distancmerely by demonstrating that there are competitors in their local markets who offer bxth business and residential service.
Thomas J. Tauke, the chief lobbyist for the Nynex Corporation, said that if the measure approved today, or one like it, was enacted, his company would probably be the first Bell company to move into long distance. He said that process would take 12 to 18 months. Nynex already has deals with cable companies and so-called competitive access providers giving them access to its local telephone network.
Mr. Stillman, of the Consumer Federation of America, estimated that consumers would pay an average of $10 a month more for local phone service in the year 2000 because the Bells would use their monopoly power in local markets to impede new competitors.
Daniel Reingold, a telecommunications analyst at Merrill Lynch, agreed that local rates would increase. But he said that was because state governments from New York to California had already been forcing the Baby Bells to open their markets to competition.
To compensate the Bell companies for this lost revenue, New York, California and several other states have allowed the Bells to raise their rates for basic residential service.
In the long run, several Bell executives said, technology will drive the rates down again. Philip J. Quigley, chairman and chief executive of the Pacific Telesis Group, said the legislation would also offer consumers more choices, since it would accelerate the entry of telephone companies into new businesses like video programming.
Consumers may face a similar trade-off with cable. The House bill lifts rate regulation for basic cable services like CNN and MTV after 15 months. Mr. Markey lost an amendment to scale back that deregulation, and consumer advocates said that the average monthly cable bill would increase by $5 to $7.
Cable executives insisted they could not risk raising rates at a time when they face new competition from direct-broadcast satellite and telephone companies. And they said consumers would benefit from the ability of cable companies to offer telephone service.
"With all these new competitors, is this the time you want to go out and alienate your customers?" asked Brian L. Roberts, the president of the Comcast Corporation, the fourth-largest cable operator.
The networks are losers on several fronts. The original bill would have allowed one company to own television stations reaching 50 percent of the nation's TV households. Mr. Markey's amendment reduces that to 35 percent -- the same level allowed in the Senate bill.
The amendment also prohibits a broadcaster from owning a cable system in the same city -- again the same as in the Senate legislation. Under the original House version, broadcasters would have been able to own newspapers, radio stations or cable systems in the same market.
Martin Franks, the vice president of government relations at CBS, said his network would be handicapped by the new rules. Assembling a powerful group of TV stations was a main motivation for the Westinghouse deal with his network. And while the combined company would still be within the House's ownership limits, the legislation would foreclose it from buying any more big stations.
Jack Fields, a Texas Republican and another architect of the bill, said that Mr. Markey's amendment was crafted to protect big newspaper publishers like The New York Times Company or The Washington Post Company. Newspaper companies would still be able to acquire other media properties in the same market, while broadcasters would not.
The House voted to move its final deliberations on the bill from midnight to later this morning after Democrats complained that the bill was being rushed into law under cover of darkness to avoid scrutiny. The Democrats threatened to tie up the proceedings with procedural motions unless the House leadership agreed to delay the debate by about six hours.
The Democratic victories bring the House legislation closer in substance to the Senate bill. But as both parties look forward to the conference committee, in which the Senate and House bills will be reconciled, Mr. Fields said that several issues still had to be resolved.
Among them: the Senate voted in its bill to make the transmission of pornographic material by on-line services a crime. But the House bill leaves the policing of the Internet, the global computer network, up to the on-line services themselves.
The House must also consider the prospect of a Presidential veto. White House officials said today that President Clinton was pleased with the success of the V-chip and media ownership amendments, but that he still had problems with several provisions of the bill, including the lifting of cable rates and the easier admission of the Bell companies into long-distance service.
"People are kidding themselves if they think there is some magic bullet that will get the President to sign this bill," one White House aide said.


GRAPHIC: Some important effects of the bill approved yesterday by the House, if it becomes law.
 
CABLE TV: The bill would erase limits on cable rates, allow telephone companies to offer cable service, and make it harder for customers to press formal complaints about rates.
Charts: "Changes the Public Would Feel"
Rates would probably rise for most customers, especially in the first few years and in smaller markets where competition is unlikely.
 
PHONE SERVICE: The billj would allow long-distance carriers, cable companies and others to compete with local phone companies and allow Bell companies to offer long-distance service if they meet certain criteria.
 Long-distance rates would probably continue to fall; local rates might also fall where there is competition, but might rise elsewhere.
 
VIOLENCE ON TV: The bill would require new television sets to include a feature that could be programmed to block out material rated as violent.
 
(pg. 1)
 
"The V-Chip: Regulating Violence on Broadcasts"
 
The Chip: The House and Senate telecommunications bills would require new television sets to be equipped with a so-called V-chip that would allow parents to screen out violent television programming. Broadcasters and cable operators have yet to agree on a ratings system that the chips could read.
 
Broadcasting the signal: The same broadcast signal that carries television pictures has room to carry data, like a violence rating for the program that would signal a V-chip to block access. Each frame of a television broadcast is made of 525 lines, of which 483 are used to create the video image. The 42 other lines make up what is called the vertical blanking interval, the black bar that appears on the screen if the image begins to roll. Twenty-four of these lines can be used for other information, like instructions that could activiate the V-chip.

"Highlights and Open Questions"
 Here are key provisions of the House telecommunications bill passed yesterday, how they differ from the bill the Senate passed in June, and concerns the White House has voiced about some provisions.
 
MEDIA OWNERSHIP
 
HOUSE BILL: Would lift almost all restrictions on the number of radio and TV stations a single company could own, except for three rule: An owner would be limited to two TV stations in any one market; only one of the two could be a VHF station (channel 2 through 13); and all of an owner's TV stations combined could not reach more than 35 percent of the nation's households. A current rule forbidding commong ownership of TV or radio stations and newspapers in the same market would be scrapped, but the Federal Communications Commission could block an "undue concentration of media voices." A ban on common ownership of cable systems and TV stations in the same market would be retained.
 
DIFFERENCES IN SENATE BILL: Would retain the current ban on common ownership of broadcast outlets and the newspapers in the same market, and the current owneership limit of one TV station of any kind in the market.
 
WHITE HOUSE VIEW: Consumers "should continue to benefit from a diversity of voices and viewpoints in radio, television and the print media."
 
LOCAL TELEPHONE
 
HOUSE BILL: In exchange for entry to new markets like cable television and long-distance services, local telephone companies would have to let would-be rivals connect to their networks at prices low enough to make competitive services practical. Small rural phone companies could seek an exemption to this requirement.
 
DIFFERENCES IN SENATE BILL: The F.C.C. would have a role in arbitrating between phone companies and new rivals over issues of access to existing networks.
 
WHITE HOUSE VIEW: State regulators would not be left with enough flexibility to regulate local rates and control the introduction of competition in local phone service.
 
LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE
 
HOUSE BILL: Local Bell telephone companies would be allowed to enter the long-distance business after six months, provided they meet certain requirements related to network access for would-be rivals, and provided that there is local competition.
 
DIFFERENCES IN SENATE BILL: The F.C.C. would have a role in determining whether it is in the public interest to allow a Bell company to compete for long-distance customers in a market.
 
WHITE HOUSE VIEW: Contrary to sponsors' claims, the House version would not insure competition in either local or long-distance services.
 
CABLE TELEVISION
 
HOUSE BILL: Would remove price controls on cable TV programming and equipment rentals, except for basic service, within 15 months - or sooner if a telephone company begins competing with the cable company. Small cable companies would have all price controls removed, including basic service. More than 3 percent of a cable company's customers would have to complain before the F.C.C. would begin a review of the company's charges.
 
DIFFERENCES IN SENATE BILL: Would deregulate rates only for companies that charge the national average rate or less, with the benchmark average recalculated every two years. The F.C.C. would continue to review rate complaints from one or a few subscribers.
 
WHITE HOUSE VIEW: The bills do not contain enough safeguards against high rates for consumers - especially in small towns and rural areas, where true competition would be unlikely.
 
INDECENT CONTENT ON-LINE
 
HOUSE BILL: Would encourage on-line computer services like Compuserve and American Online to police the content of subscribers' communications for pornographic materials.
 
DIFFERENCES IN SENATE BILL: Would make transmissionof pornographic matgerial over on-line services a crime.
 
WHITE HOUSE VIEW: Has not yet commented on this provision.

HEADLINE: Pain, and Dreams, Greet Christopher in Cambodia

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, Aug. 4

 BODY:
The last time a Secretary of State arrived in this poorest corner of Southeast Asia, 40 years ago, Cambodia still had its tragedies ahead of it: two savage wars, the secret bombings, the horror of the killing fields.
Today Secretary of State Warren Christopher landed here to declare that Cambodia had finally "emerged from a cruel darkness," and in small and sometimes unspoken ways, he spent much of the visit atoning for America's role in Cambodia's many miseries. 
 On Saturday, in what is expected to mark the most dramatic moment of his weeklong tour, Mr. Christopher will land in Vietnam and formally establish relations with the Communist Government that it battled for 15 years. It is a visit, he said today, that will "help the United States put behind it the pain of war."
Mr. Christopher's arrival here was the occasion for a meeting of starkly different worlds, as his motorcade, sirens blaring, rumbled down dirt roads past collapsing shanties, flooded rice fields and water buffalo who did their best to appear unimpressed.
From his car window, he could glimpse the warren of junk-strewn back allies that contain some of Asia's deepest pockets of poverty in a country that can only dream of the economic miracles that have so transformed neighbors like Thailand and Malaysia, only an hour's flight away. Nearly half the Cambodian population is under 15, meaning that they have no memory of the terror that destroyed the society.
Throughout the day Mr. Christopher received stunning reminders of how dramatically the nature of America's power in this part of the world has changed. For decades his predecessors viewed Cambodia first as a domino in the cold war, then as a failed state that imploded in genocidal fury, then as a testing ground for the United Nations.
But this morning the two men who share the prime ministership here -- Prince Ranariddh, a son of King Sihanouk, and Hun Sen, who first came to power with the backing of Vietnam after its 1979 invasion of the country -- asked Mr. Christopher to view Cambodia first and foremost as a trading partner.
They spent much of their time urging the Secretary to help them obtain most-favored-nation trading status -- he agreed -- and talking about how to attract foreign capital. Many officials told Mr. Christopher they now fear that American investors will pour into Vietnam, as Cambodia withers.
"It was a remarkable conversion," one of Mr. Christopher's aides said after the meeting. "This is a country that a few years ago had no economy, and whose people scavenged for food," he added, not mentioning that in the countryside here some still do. "And here they were talking about their hopes for future as an exporter."
But as Mr. Christopher reminded the two men, the first requirement for investment is political stability, in short supply here. There was a coup attempt a year ago; Pol Pot, weakened by defections, still stages attacks from the Thai border; corruption is rampant, and there are still 8 million to 10 million unexploded anti-personnel mines buried in the countryside. And the new Government is drifting toward authoritarianism.
In the last few months it has ejected a leading opposition member from the National Assembly, threatened others, and passed a widely criticized press law making it a crime to publish anything "injurious to the state," a term the Government itself will define.
So Mr. Christopher found himself lecturing on human rights, warning the leaders that "elections are not enough" and cautioning that American aid -- about $40 million -- will probably turn on the country's human rights performance.
"Compared to five years ago, things are definitely improved," said Keith Schulz, a legal adviser for the Asia Society who is based here. "Compared to a year ago, they are backsliding."
Everywhere Mr. Christopher went, it seemed, he tripped across the remnants of Cambodia's mind-numbing suffering.
In the morning he spent an hour learning the art of removing mines, watching demonstrations of the painstaking work involved in clearing out the jungles where farmers, children and animals are still regularly blown up. Mr. Christopher used the time to appeal for foreign aid funds. The "de-mining" project, a training program, gets $5 million in Federal grants that may well be reduced to $1 million.
This afternoon he visited the grim prison where Pol Pot's victims were photographed and sent off for execution. The pictures cover the dingy prison walls, eyes bulging out in the terror of imminent death, and Mr. Christopher seemed shaken when he viewed the museum's collection of human skulls.
But bby evening, he was dining in one of the world's most spectacular palaces, the home of King Sihanouk, who has spent millions over the last few years restoring the compound, with its French and Khmer influences, to its original 1870 splendor.
It was in the same place in 1955 that John Foster Dulles, the last Secretary of State to come here, tried to persuade the same King to abandon his neutrality in the growing war in neighboring Vietnam, a war America had yet to enter. The failed effort touched off a long downward spiral in America's relations with the enigmatic King, which reached a low-point when he was overthrown in a coup that brought Lon Nol to power and saw the Vietnam war spill across the border.
Tonight the aging King, who has been treated extensively in China for cancer and appeared thin but rested as he sat with Queen Monique in front of his gold-encrusted throne, was clearly in a mood to set aside lingering resentments. For his part, Mr. Christopher made it clear he had come partly to atone and partly to celebrate Cambodia's re-emergence as a nascent democratic state.
"No doubt with the benefit of hindsight the U.S. could have done many things better in Cambodia," Mr. Christopher said tonight, in words he was clearly rehearsing for his visit Saturday to Vietnam. "None of us is fully satisfied with the role of the U.S. in this period. But what we need to emphasize now is the future."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
HANOI, Vietnam, Saturday, Aug. 5 (Reuters) -- Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived in Vietnam today. His plane touched down at Noi Bai Airport, 20 miles north of the capital, at about 9:40 A.M. (9:40 P.M. Friday, Eastern time), and he was met by Deputy Foreign Minister Le Mai, Hanoi's main spokesman on American affairs.

One Man's Life of Virtue Earns the Papal Spotlight

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
If Americans' book-buying habits are any indication, lots of people are curious about what makes up a virtuous life. Just look at the best-seller lists, where "The Book of Virtues," by the erstwhile Presidential prospect William J. Bennett, has ridden high for months.
 Yet to assess the virtuousness of a person's life is essentially a religious matter. In the Roman Catholic Church, to take a prime example, there is the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints, which examines those lives in which dedication to moral good seems truly extraordinary. 
 Recently, after deliberations by that body, Pope John Paul II declared the Rev. Francis Solanus Casey, who worked for more than 20 years in various New York City parishes, to be "venerable." The title is the church's way of saying that the late Father Casey lived a life of "heroic virtue" and has cleared the first of three steps on the road to sainthood.
 No man born in the United States had ever received that distinction, said the Rev. Michael Crosby, a Milwaukee priest who spent years researching Father Casey's life, preparing the extensive documents on which the church authorities would make their decision.
 Indeed, only three American Catholics have been declared saints: St. Frances Xavier Cabrini, a founder of hospitals, orphanages and convents, who died in 1917 and was canonized in 1946; St. John Neumann, a bishop of Philadelphia, who died in 1860 and was canonized in 1977, and St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, founder of the Sisters of Charity of St. Joseph, who died in 1821 and was canonized in 1975, the first American-born saint.
 But then, the church's investigations into a person's holiness can be rigorous indeed.
 In the case of Father Casey, the process took 13 years and resulted in a three-volume document that runs more than 1,300 pages.
 After the Vatican gave approval to begin the process in 1982, officials in the Archdiocese of Detroit, where Father Casey spent much of his adult life, interviewed nearly 60 people who had known the priest. The interviewers worked from 29 single-spaced pages of questions. The resulting testimony, 800 pages long, makes up one of the volumes of the document.
 But the crucial volume is a careful examination of how Father Casey demonstrated 15 virtues, from faithfulness to God and love of the neighbor to prudence, justice, temperance and fortitude (the four cardinal virtues).
 Father Crosby, who wrote that book, as well as one other dealing with how Father Casey responded to the political and social events of his times, said he supported his findings with well over 1,000 footnotes, some with as many as 10 sources, drawn from the testimony of those who knew Father Casey and from the priest's own letters.
 Still, the bare facts of Father Casey's life are modest.
 He was born in a log cabin in Wisconsin in 1870 to Irish immigrants. Baptized Bernard Casey, he spent a few years as a streetcar worker and Federal prison guard before becoming a Capuchin Franciscan priest. His order gave him the names Francis Solanus. The first Irish-American among the Milwaukee-based, German-speaking Capuchins, he was ordained but never given authority to hear confessions or preach.
 From 1904 to 1924, he worked in parishes in Yonkers, Harlem and the Lower East Side of New York. Except for a few months in Brooklyn in the mid-1940's, he spent the rest of his life in Detroit. He died in 1957.
 For much of his life, Father Casey was popularly known as a man whose relationship with God was considered so profound that his prayers could help heal people, and as a man who had insight into people's futures. The faithful came by the busload to see him.
 "There is a thin line between the gift of prophecy, which Solanus had in abundance, and intuition," Father Crosby said. "He had this uncanny ability to listen. He would look right at you, and he would take as much time with you as you would want." He encouraged those he helped to perform acts of charity.
 Father Crosby, who has a master's degree in economics and a doctorate in theology and who works as an advocate for corporate social responsibility, said he was originally skeptical of efforts to push Father Casey's cause. He said he believed that enough priests and nuns had been canonized and that the church needed more saints who had been laypeople.
 But as he did his research, his views on Father Casey changed. "I really just came to have unbelievable respect for him," Father Crosby said. He was deeply impressed, he said, by the priest's unwavering faith in God and by his bedrock belief in human goodness.
 Toward the end of a telephone interview from the friary where he lives, Father Crosby mentioned in an almost offhand way that he had once met Father Casey. It was the briefest of encounters, not much more than a handshake, the day in 1956 when Father Crosby's brother entered the Capuchins.
 No, Father Crosby said, he did not recall what Father Casey said to him. But he remembered the words of his brother: "My brother Dan says, 'Come and meet Solanus, because he's going to be a saint someday."

HEADLINE: Transit Agency Seeks to Alter Union Contract

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
Seeking sharp reductions in spending, New York City transit officials want to renegotiate the existing contract with subway and bus workers, insisting on work-rule changes or even wage cuts and threatening thousands of layoffs if the union balks.
"We're looking at 2,000, maybe 2,500 positions that would have to go," unless there are major union concessions, said an official of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority who spoke on condition of anonymity. While some reductions could be made through attrition, he said, most would inevitably be made through layoffs. 
 The demand for union "give-backs" would be the latest step by M.T.A. officials in their efforts to piece together a financial package to cope with rising costs, stagnant revenues and declining city, state and Federal subsidies. Early this week, officials revealed that they plan to do away with free and half-fare student transit passes. And on Thursday, the M.T.A. chairman, E. Virgil Conway, proposed raising the price of a subway token from $1.25 to $1.50, and increasing Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Commuter Railroad fares and bridge and tunnel tolls.
Mr. Conway said that in addition to fare and toll increases, the M.T.A. would have to cut spending by $2.85 billion over five years to balance its budgets. Wresting concessions from transit workers would be the first and perhaps most important part of that campaign.
Because the Transport Workers Union has a year-old contract with two years still to run, management must have the employees' cooperation to make any changes in working conditions or wages, and union leaders made it clear that such cooperation would not be given readily.
"I don't relish the thought of having to take a more militant stand," said Damaso Seda, president of the Transport Workers Union Local 100, which represents 32,000 of the Transit Authority's 41,000 employees, "but if push comes to shove, it will get real ugly."
But management insists that it needs union concessions to make the Transit Authority, whose parent agency is the M.T.A., more efficient and to balance its budgets for 1996 and beyond. And the M.T.A. has at its disposal the powerful threat of layoffs.
The M.T.A. plans to take on the transit workers at the same time that talks on a new contract with Metro-North unions are stalled over the authority's insistence on work-rule changes and its offer of wage increases smaller than the rate of inflation. But if officials are to find economies, the most important place to do so is in the Transit Authority, whose work force and projected deficits are by far the largest in the M.T.A.
M.T.A. officials said that their actions were prompted both by the severity of the authority's financial problems and by the belief that the new, Republican Governor would back them in taking a harder line than in the past. In negotiating new contracts last year with L.I.R.R. and Transit Authority workers, the M.T.A. at first took a tough stand on wages and work rules, but later backed down. In the L.I.R.R. talks, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo forced a settlement after a two-day strike.
The M.T.A. official who spoke on condition of anonymity would not say what specific demands will be made of the transit union, but he cited as possibilities a wage freeze or reduction, and changes in contract provisions that narrowly define the work a particular employee group can do. Another potential change, he said, would be in contractually mandated staffing levels, an area that could prove crucial if the M.T.A. tries to eliminate the conductor's job on many subway trains, as it has indicated it might.
"I'm sure that they have a laundry list of things that they'd like us to consider," Mr. Seda said, "and they have told me some of those things," though he added that he had received some conflicting messages from M.T.A. officials and that no formal overtures had been made to the union. He said that the threat of layoffs had been made.
New York's Taylor Law, passed in the aftermath of a 12-day transit strike in 1966, prohibits strikes by public employees and carries harsh financial penalties for a violation. Striking workers are docked two days' pay for each day of a walkout, and the leaders of striking unions can face heavy fines. But that did not stop transit workers from staging an 11-day strike in 1980.
"This is going to be worse than 1980," Mr. Seda said. "It's going to be worse than '75, when there were all the layoffs."
Mr. Conway and the man who appointed him, Gov. George E. Pataki, have repeatedly shown an inclination to squeeze savings out of the transportation agency. In February, the Governor prevailed upon the M.T.A. board to avert a fare increase by cutting Transit Authority expenses by $113 million for this year and $201 million for next year, a move that brought on the first broad service cuts since the 1970's.
When cuts that have already been made take effect later this year and next year, the Transit Authority will have eliminated nearly 5,000 jobs since 1989, cutting its payroll to fewer than 40,000 people.
Mr. Conway said Thursday that despite the cuts voted earlier this year, the Transit Authority, with a $3 billion operating budget, must make up a $167 million shortfall before the year is over, and faces a deficit of $316 million next year, climbing to $627 million in 1999.
The 25-cent increase in the fare would generate an additional $275 million a year in revenue, but the bulk of the shortfall, Mr. Conway said, must be made up through cost-cutting. He refused to give specifics, other than to say his plan would rely on the cooperation of labor and management, and "it will entail certainly a reduction in staff." He did not say there would be layoffs, but he would not rule them out.
Mr. Seda blamed the situation on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Governor Pataki, each of whom cut subsidies for the M.T.A. by $128 million a year.
"Before they come to us for money, they have to talk to the Governor and the Mayor, who stole the money that's creating this gap," Mr. Seda said. "George and Rudy have stolen more money in the last six months than Jesse James did in his entire career."
At first he said of union concessions, "it's not going to happen." But he said that if it comes to a choice between that and huge job losses, "I will go to my membership and lay out the case, and see if we would be willing to do certain things to avoid layoffs." It would not be unheard of for a union, dominated by its older members, to agree to layoffs that would fall mostly on newcomers in order to protect hard-won wage and work-rule gains.
Paradoxically, Mr. Seda sounded at times like the Mayor, who has insisted that the M.T.A. is bloated and should cut waste before doing anything else. Mr. Seda, who insisted that all jobs related to actually keeping trains and buses running should be preserved, argued that the Transit Authority could eliminate 3,000 clerical jobs without hurting service, safety or maintenance.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Sweatshops Are Thriving, Experts Say

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Almost one-fifth of the garment industry workers in Los Angeles, many of them foreigners who came to the United States to escape the crushing poverty of their homelands, are toiling in unregulated, sweatshop conditions, labor officials, economists and union organizers said today.
Exactly how many find themselves bound to employers who take advantage of their legal status, naivete and cultural alienation is not known. But experts said their numbers were flourishing despite a host of regulations on labor, health, safety and immigration designed to flush them out and shut their employers down. 
 "I have heard things like this for years," said Mark Rosenbaum, legal director of the Los Angeles office of the American Civil Liberties Union. "It's one of these dirty little secrets that everyone knows about."
On Wednesday, state agents raided a makeshift garment factory in El Monte, Calif., where they found nearly 70 workers from Thailand who lived and worked, sometimes for years, in conditions the agents described as close to servitude.
Federal immigration officials acknowledged today that they knew of conditions at the El Monte factory nearly three years ago but that they took no action until state officials got a similar tip six weeks ago.
"The state solicited our participation to join them when they issued the search warrant, and we agreed," said Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. "But later our people felt that it was inappropriate to be present for a state warrant. We thought that maybe the case would be thrown out for a technicality."
Victoria Bradshaw, California's Labor Commissioner, today called the El Monte situation an aberration. She added, "I don't believe it's widespread."
Indeed, formal complaints about involuntary servitude are relatively rare. Since 1990, the Justice Department has prosecuted 29 people for violations of the antislavery laws, and 26 were convicted or pleaded guilty. Most of the cases involved migrant workers in Eastern states, not Asians in California.
Still, while brutal conditions like those found in the El Monte case are unusual, thousands of other workers often find themselves trapped in bleak, unregulated workplaces.
Of the estimated 120,000 garment industry workers in the Los Angeles area, 15,000 to 20,000 work in unregulated, sweatshop conditions, said Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles.
"A lot of times you get people coming from offshore and setting up these shops, because it's a very easy industry to get into and you don't need a lot of capital," Mr. Kyser said. "But in many cases they don't understand all the rules and regulations they have to comply with and all the forms they have to fill out.
"They're probably doing business like they did it in the country of their origin, but in the United States, they're breaking the law."
In a random survey last year of 69 California garment manufacturers and contractors, the state Labor Department found rampant violations of safety and labor laws, including cases of employers locking fire exits and children as young as 13 working nine hours a day.
The survey also showed that 50 percent of employers violated rules requiring them to pay workers the minimum wage, 68 percent violated overtime requirements, and 92.8 percent violated various health and safety regulations. Workplace conditions are likely to be worst in makeshift factories that operate outside the law.
Joseph Rodriquez, executive director of the Garment Contractors Association, said: "Something like we saw in El Monte, with the slavery and barbed wire, is extremely rare. Unfortunately, it is not rare to find illegal contractors who are not registered with the state."
He added: "The company that isn't registered is probably violating minimum wage laws or overtime laws. That's what gives our industry a bad name."
At the El Monte factory, workers sewed strips of ready-to-wear garments, some of which ended up in major stores on the East Coast like Macy's, Hecht's and Filene's, Ms. Bradshaw said today. Spokesmen for several companies said today that they had no knowledge that laws were being broken.
Jim Abrams, a spokesman for May Department Stores, owner of both Filene's and Hecht's, said, "Our purchase orders clearly require vendors to comply with the Labor Standards Act and all applicable regulations."
He added, "We are in the process of attempting to ascertain if in fact this incident in El Monte involves merchandise being manufactured for delivery to any May division and, if so, the vendor involved."
Carol Sanger, a spokeswoman for Federated Department Stores, the owner of Macy's, said: "The first we heard about it was what we read in the paper this morning. And we have tried to get in touch with the appropriate authorities in California to find out what exactly it is that they found, because we have no knowledge of the operation, no record of ever doing business with any vendor or subcontractor with any operations in El Monte.
"The situation is appalling and would not be anything we condone."
Chanchanit Mortorell, executive director of the Thai Community Development Center in Los Angeles and one of the first people to see the El Monte factory after the raid, said there were numerous violations of health and safety laws at the site.
"When the authorities asked the workers to open the doors, they couldn't," she said. "They were locked from the outside. The police had to ax down each door. Everyone was shocked and terrified."
Another community leader, Nongyao Varanond, president of Thai Inc., a service program, said that of the shops she had visited, "only a few are like the one in El Monte." She added, "The others are usually in good condition, but the workers are paid less than the minimum wage.
"They don't have any place to go," Ms. Varanond said. "Where else can they find a job here? All of them are illegal."

HEADLINE: Esoteric Wedge of Academia Is Roiled by Hunt for Bomber

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
Last October an agent from the Federal Bureau of Investigation showed up in New Orleans at the annual meeting of The History of Science Society, the main professional gathering for academics studying the origins of science and how it has transformed the world.
The agenda featured esoteric items like a discussion of 19th-century social attitudes toward the germ theory and a detailed analysis of the inks that Galileo used in one of his manuscripts. 
 Carrying court papers, the agent subpoenaed the society's membership records and questioned scholars for clues to the identity of the serial killer, often called the Unabomber, who in 17 years has killed three people and injured 23 others with homemade bombs.
That subpoena, and the disclosure that the F.B.I. believes that the bomber is immersed in the most radical interpretations of the history of science, has roiled the usually placid waters of the discipline. And across the country, professors have begun reconsidering old suspicions, acquaintances and tracts to help solve the crimes.
"They've thrown a bomb into the community," said Stanley Goldberg, a science historian in Washington. "My impression is that we're all scurrying around in our minds, thinking of people who might be suspects."
The bureau had detected the bomber's interest in the history of science, as well as other disciplines including behavioral psychology, by poring over letters he had sent to newspapers and to intended victims as long ago as a decade. The 35,000-word manifesto that he sent to The New York Times and two other publications in late June not only corroborated that interest but also gave the bureau insight into the issues that concerned the bomber, the depth of his reading and the authors he respected.
More than a few historians of science, who blanched at the possible link between their usually staid area of study and the object of the most intense manhunt in F.B.I. history, have taken pains to distance the discipline from a maniacal murderer who seems to be familiar with their debates and lines of thinking.
But Landon Winner, a political scientist and technology expert at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., said he was disappointed the F.B.I. had not consulted with him on the bomber. "I feel left out," Dr. Winner said. "It's like being left off the guest list for a really good party."
Scholars of the history of science investigate the origins of science from the Babylonians and Greeks onward. They study figures like Ptolemy, Copernicus, Newton, Galileo, Mendel and the Curies, and examine questions like how calculus was developed, and how telescopes, atom smashers and computers were invented and helped change the world.
In some history departments with no emphasis on the subject, professors sometimes believe that their pursuits are not considered as serious as political or philosophical history. "It was always regarded as a quixotic thing they let me play with," said Professor Harold Bauman, who has taught a variety of history courses for 30 years at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.
Mr. Bauman has been interviewed three times by the F.B.I. since the bomber left a booby trap bomb on the Utah campus in October 1981; the device was defused before anyone was hurt. He said he was scheduled to be interviewed again by the F.B.I. yesterday and to be shown a copy of the manifesto to review.
Several other professors in the field have also been given copies of the tract, which condemns technological society and the scientific progress that scholars in this arcane field usually champion.
"They've got to be desperate," said David C. Lindberg, a physicist at the University of Wisconsin who specializes in medieval optics and religion and who is president of The History of Science Society. "These are extremely tenuous inferences they're making. But if it's the only thing they've got, then it seems to make sense."
Some academics, while endorsing the bureau's all-out search, take umbrage at the mention of their field and the bomber in the same breath.
"It's like saying an appreciation of Beethoven has something to do with the Nazis," said David A. Hollinger, a professor of history at the University of California at Berkeley.
Dr. Hollinger maintained that the ideas he read in newspaper excerpts of the bomber's manifesto were less out of the realm of the history of science than "generally from a more amorphous critical discourse that moves out of environmental groups and religious groups and some literary discourses."
"I would be looking more toward alternative education courses of the 70's," he said.
While conservative and scholarly for the most part, and sometimes downright stuffy, the field of history of science also has undercurrents and factions that have sometimes mounted intellectual attacks on the science establishment, blaming the military, industrial and academic worlds for social ills like unemployment and pollution.
That radical milieu seems to have been the breeding ground for the bomber, whose treatise says that science and the industrial revolution have undermined human values and calls for returning to a pre-industrial world better in tune with nature.
This week Director Louis J. Freeh of the F.B.I. announced that agents were talking to college professors around the country about the manifesto. The bureau, Mr. Freed said in a statement, "is taking this investigative step in an effort to determine whether that community might recognize the writer's work or be able to shed light on important or telltale aspects of the manuscript's general topic, the history of science."
In its hunt for the bomber's origins, the F.B.I. is focusing on Northwestern University and the Chicago campus of the University of Illinois, where the bureau believes that the killer might have lived in the late 1970's.
In the course of its inquiry, the agency has sown dissension among university officials quick to disclaim any kind of culpability.
"This is a working-class campus," Jan Rocek, dean of the graduate school of the University of Illinois at Chicago, said in an interview. "These characters tend to come out of more affluent families."
Charles Loebbaka, a spokesman for Northwestern, said, "University officials are cooperating with the F.B.I. and have been for sometime." But Mr. Loebbaka refused further comment, saying details would have to come from the F.B.I.
Over the decades, historians and writers like Lewis Mumford, Jacques Ellul, Theodore Roszak and Herbert Muller have worried that science systematically ignores human values. And even strongly pro-science historians admit that science tends to sow cultural discord because it is such a powerful agent of social change.
In the 1970's, the intellectual critique of the science establishment turned acid and sometimes violent as it joined with and was amplified by protests against the Vietnam War. Groups like Science for the People, a leftist organization, used confrontational tactics to disrupt meetings of scientists and to push for wider debate on the social devastation wrought by science and its ugly offspring, like napalm and nuclear weapons.
Science for the People was well-organized in the Chicago area, sponsoring meetings at the various universities and helping finance anti-war pamphlets. Its membership included all kinds of scientists, not just historians and philosophers.
After the August 1970 bombing of the Army Math Research Center at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, in which a researcher was killed, the Chicago collective of Science for the People helped finance a 119-page "indictment" of the math project, which was denounced as a "deadly power center" working against "the peoples of the world fighting for liberation."
The F.B.I., which often infiltrated such anti-war groups in the 1970's, has not indicated whether it is looking at the membership of the Chicago collective for clues. But some historians say that it should as a possible aid to tracking down the killer.
"This is a bright guy, but he doesn't know as much history of science as the F.B.I. thinks he does," said Dr. Goldberg, the science historian in Washington, who has read published excerpts of the bomber's manifesto. "He's on the fringes. It's more of a counterculture thing."
Keith R. Benson, the executive secretary of The History of Science Society, which is based in Seattle at the University of Washington, agreed. Mr. Benson said that, based on his talks with F.B.I. agents and his examination of the evidence, the killer was a knowledgeable outcast rather than a mainstream scholar.
"My suspicion is that this guy lurked around the halls of academia rather than being a graduate student," Mr. Benson said. "He's unbelievably sophisticated. He's covered his tracks."

Map/Diagram: "WHERE IT HAPPENED: Tracking the Serial Bomber"
 In its effort to track down the terrorist whose bombs have killed three and injured 23 others in the past 17 years, the F.B.I. now believes that the bomber is a student of science history who may have taken classes or spent time at some university campuses from the late 1970's to the mid-1980's. Of the 16 bombing incidents, nine were at Universities or the homes of professors. (pg. 7)

HEADLINE: Dole Offers Welfare Bill, But Conservatives Reject It

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, set the stage today for a bitter debate over welfare policy as he introduced a compromise bill intended to overcome splits within the Republican Party. Conservatives immediately criticized it, saying it would not significantly reduce the number of babies born to unmarried women.
With the floor debate expected to begin on Saturday, Senator Dole and other Republicans were moving to the right in the hope of rounding up 51 votes for their bill. But in the process, they seemed to be diminishing their chances of winning support from moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats. So the outcome is in doubt. 
 Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, said: "Senator Dole's bill does what President Clinton said he wanted to do. It ends welfare as we know it."
Preliminary estimates by the Congressional Budget Office show that Mr. Dole's bill would save $70 billion, or 10 percent of the amount that would otherwise be spent in the next seven years on Aid to Families With Dependent Children, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income and child nutrition programs. The savings would be achieved by giving each state a fixed amount of money, or block grant, for cash assistance to poor people, and by changing the rules for determining eligibility and benefits in the other programs.
Aides to Mr. Dole said today that, after weeks of negotiations with conservatives, he was distressed to learn that the Christian Coalition had denounced the latest version of his bill. Brian C. Lopina, chief lobbyist for the coalition, told the Senator that "we will not support your bill in its current form" because it "will do little to change the alarming increase of illegitimacy."
Conservatives contend that the Government could discourage out-of-wedlock births by cutting off welfare payments to unwed teen-age mothers and by rewarding states that reduce such births. But some economists and sociologists suggest that the Government cannot alter behavior in that way.
Asked about the criticism, Mr. Dole, a Kansas Republican, said, "There is a split among conservatives on some of these issues." He said he was being true to conservative principles by arguing that the Federal Government should let governors decide how to deal with social problems like illegitimate births.
But Senator John Ashcroft, a conservative Republican from Missouri, said Mr. Dole's bill fell short on many counts. The bill, which would create a new Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services to supervise welfare programs, does not do enough to curtail Federal "meddling," Mr. Ashcroft said.
Democrats said they were pleased to see the splits in Republican ranks. But they have their own problems. In a meeting with Administration officials on Thursday, Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland complained that the White House was sending mixed signals.
A person who attended the meeting said the Democrats feared that Mr. Clinton would sign legislation like the Dole bill if it was "improved" in a few ways -- for example, with an amendment requiring states to continue spending their own money as a condition of getting Federal welfare grants.
The President's press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said there was "not an insurmountable distance" between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Dole.
"They could probably sit down and finish an acceptable bill and do it, you know, even before they go away for summer recess, if they wanted to," Mr. McCurry said. "The problem is that the extreme faction within the Republican majority in Congress keeps yanking the debate farther and farther to the right."
Mr. Dole's bill would end the longstanding Federal guarantee of cash assistance for poor families with children. States would have new freedom to decide who receives welfare benefits, and they would no longer have to put up any of their own money.
Mr. Dole's bill would require states to move half of their adult welfare recipients into jobs by the year 2000. Fewer than 10 percent of the five million adults on welfare are now employed.
Gordon L. Berlin, senior vice president of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a private group that has studied job programs across the country, said, "The work requirements in Senator Dole's bill could not be met by even the most successful job programs of the type established in Atlanta, Riverside County, Calif., and Grand Rapids, Mich."
Mr. Dole's bill would allow, but not require, states to deny aid to unmarried mothers under the age of 18, legal aliens and additional children born to families already receiving welfare. A companion bill passed by the House in March goes further, requiring states to cut off assistance in such cases.
The House bill would also authorize financial bonuses for states that reduce out-of-wedlock births. Mr. Dole's bill contains no such provision, but would require unwed teen-age mothers to live at home with their parents or guardians or in other places supervised by adults.

House Votes Radical Shift In Phone and Cable Laws
The House approved a radical change in communications laws for the first time in six decades. Members voted 305 to 117 for vastly reduced regulations on everything from cable television to local and long-distance telephone services. The bill would give the Baby Bells something they have long sought: the right to enter the long-distance market.
 But in a setback for the television networks, House Democrats curbed some of the legislation's strongest elements of deregulation, winning key amendments to limit media ownership and to mandate that all new television sets include technology that would allow parents to block out programs with violence or sexual content. [Page 1.]
 
Having passed a spending bill and the telecommunications bill, the House adjourned for a monthlong recess in a wave of partisan sparring. [1.]
 
Edward J. Markey, an archetypal liberal Democrat, fought the conservative tide and won approval of two important changes in the House bill, relating to program coding and station ownership. [32.]
 
Tighter Rules for Lobbyists
President Clinton said he would soon tighten the rules for contacts between lobbyists and the Executive Branch and chided Speaker Newt Gingrich for the House's "delay, debate and division" on the measure. [9.]
 
Suit Dismissed on Nasdaq Trading
A suit against Nasdaq market makers was dismissed by a Federal judge, but both sides said they expected the plaintiffs to refile it soon. The State of Louisiana and some 30 private investors argued that big Wall Street firms had benefited from wide price spreads in the stocks that they bought and sold to private investors. The defendants included dozens of firms. [35.]
 
Rail Streamlining Is Predicted
Union Pacific and Southern Pacific Rail executives expressed confidence that their union would promote greater efficiency and service. Securities analysts largely agreed, suggesting shippers would benefit from lower rates to come. [33.]
 
Atlantic Bank Fined $1.1 Million
Atlantic Bank of New York was fined $1.1 million after it pleaded guilty to helping its clients avoid declaring large cross-border transactions. The bank is a unit of the National Bank of Greece and has strong ties to the Greek-American community. [34.]
 
Phone Strike Deadline Near
Four of eight regional telephone companies face strike threats by the Communications Workers of America if contracts are not reached by midnight. The 164,000 workers involved include operators, repair personnel, technicians and other employees. The companies are: Bell Atlantic, Ameritech, Bell South and Pacific Telesis. [7.]
 
Recycling Plant for New York
Pratt Industries of Australia agreed to build a $250 million waste paper recycling plant in Staten Island, which will be the first of its kind in New York. [22.]
 
Sweatshops Are Flourishing
At least one-fifth of the garment workers in Los Angeles are toiling in unregulated, sweatshop conditions, labor officials, economists and union organizers said. Experts said that employers take advantage of the workers' legal status, naivete and cultural alienation, despite a host of regulations intended to shut down the companies. [6.]

Stocks Drift Lower
Blue-chip stocks sagged in lethargic trading, although technology issues rebounded. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 17.96 points, closing at 4,683.46, which was off 32.05 points for the week. Walt Disney gave up some of its gains from earlier in the week, slipping 1 3/8, to 58. Oil stocks dropped on prospects for lower earnings. [35.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities rose modestly, after the employment report suggested there was still weakness in the economy, easing fears of rapid growth and rising inflation. [34.]
 
The dollar rose to a 21-week high of 91.43 yen, as traders suspected the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve would intervene in the market to drive up the dollar. [41.]

HEADLINE: Unemployment Rises Slightly In New York and New Jersey

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN 

 BODY:
Unemployment rose in New York and New Jersey last month, but Labor Department officials said yesterday that the increases were small enough to allay any concerns about a regional economic downturn.
 "We're still in a holding pattern," John L. Wieting, the regional commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said in an interview. "The situation has been pretty flat for nearly six months, and July brought no signs of improvement." He added, "But the fact that there has been no real deterioration is somewhat of a postive sign." 
 The unemployment rate in New York State rose to 6.2 percent in July from 5.9 percent in June. In New Jersey, the rate went up to 6.8 percent from 6.6 percent. Nationally, unemployment increased to 5.7 percent from 5.6 percent.
 New York City's unemployment rate provided a contrast, decreasing to 7.8 percent, from 8.1 percent in June. However, labor officials emphasized that the city's figures were not seasonally adjusted and that summer employment had pushed down the rate.
 Mr. Wieting said the city gained 90,000 jobs, an increase he termed encouraging. But as with the rest of the region, the city's economy remains essentially stagnant, he said.
 Connecticut is not one of the states for which employment data are released in the first batch of monthly statistics from Washington. In both June and May, the jobless rate in Connecticut was 5.1 percent.
 Mr. Wieting said the relatively small increases in the New Jersey and New York jobless rates were a sign that the region was not entering an economic downturn that some economists had feared. In fact, he said the number of people employed in July increased by 100,000 in New York State, a rise that he described as "a sizable increase in labor market activity." Still, even more people than that entered the labor market, resulting in the higher unemployment rate.
 In New York City, he said, an increase in employment in the private sector was being offset by the reduction of city government jobs by the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
 Mr. Wieting said the flat labor market had reduced upward pressure on wages, keeping the inflation rate low.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Edged Higher Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
The economy shed factory jobs at an accelerated pace in July, as the unemployment rate edged up one-tenth of a point, to 5.7 percent, the Labor Department reported today.
 The Clinton Administration expressed disappointment in the figures, which came after a more upbeat series of recent reports had given signs that housing, consumer spending and even industry were rebounding from the economy's flat overall performance in the spring. 
 Despite evidence that consumers are in better spirits, analysts said companies remained uneasy because of still-high inventories and the lingering effects of a yearlong run-up in interest rates, which has only recently begun to reverse.
 "Businesses remain very cautious about hiring and producing," said Mickey D. Levy, chief financial economist at Nationsbank. He said that because of job uncertainty and other factors, he did not expect the upturn in consumption to continue, a view apparently shared by many of those who manage companies.
 The 85,000 factory jobs lost last month were in all areas of industry. Temporary shutdowns of auto plants for model change-overs were a relatively minor factor, analysts said. With July's drop in industrial employment -- the biggest in three and a half years and the fourth consecutive decline -- 188,000 factory workers have lost their jobs since March.
 Retail trade and other service jobs expanded enough to swell payrolls by 55,000 over all, but these gains were only mediocre and included a rise of 45,000 in relatively low-paying jobs in restaurants and bars.
 Today's report also showed a second consecutive hefty rise in hourly earnings. That caused nervousness among bond traders but not among economists, who generally saw it as something to be watched closely but not yet as a source of concern about rising inflation.
 Today's report seemed to have little effect on expectations of whether the Federal Reserve would cut short-term interest rates again. The weak job growth, which would tend to support such action, was accompanied by higher earnings, which give pause to those pushing for rate cuts. Most analysts continued to say that the Fed would take no action on rates at its next policy meeting, on Aug. 22.
 Data released today showed that the earnings of private production workers climbed 7 cents an hour in July and 5 cents in June after averaging increases of less than 3 cents for the 12 months through May. But because earnings figures are quite erratic, Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said, "We will need to see additional months' data before concluding that the underlying growth rate of this earnings series has changed."
 She noted that a 16-cent rise in the four months that began in July 1994 proved temporary and suggested that the 15-cent rise in the latest four months might be similarly benign.
 Indeed, Joseph E. Stiglitz, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, called the advance in hourly earnings, along with a rise in aggregate production hours, which were up five-tenths of 1 percent in July, "a welcome boost to income."
 He predicted job growth would be 100,000 to 200,000 a month, probably at the lower end of that range, for the foreseeable future.
 The department's survey of payrolls also showed a 6-minute lengthening of the workweek despite a 12-minute decline in weekly factory hours. The percentage of manufacturing industries adding to payrolls skidded to 35.3 last month, the lowest that figure has been since April 1991, when the most recent recession had just ended.
Somewhat cushioning disappointment over the modest expansion of 55,000 in payrolls -- less than half what was forecast -- was a revision upward in June's gain to 250,000 from 215,000.
 The department's survey of households showed 474,000 more people with jobs, not enough to offset the 649,000 people who joined the labor force, and thus the unemployment rate moved up a statistically insignificant one-tenth of a point.
 Adult women dominated the job gains, which were partly offset by a drop among teen-agers, whose unemployment rate surged 1.8 points, to 18.2 percent.
 A total of 7.78 million workers, or 6.1 percent, held two or more jobs in July, up from 7.17 million, or 5.8 percent a year earlier, the report also showed.
 "Something is going on here," Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, said in an interview, calling "the stress on family wages" a significant national problem.

Just What They Asked For: Higher Transit Fares

BYLINE: By Joyce Purnick 

 BODY:
THE most urgent question on this city's political table right now is whether transit fares will rise this fall, as the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority proposed this week. The smart betting is yes, for the most basic of reasons: New Yorkers voted for it, whether they realized it or not.
 They voted George E. Pataki into office last November, and Governor Pataki did what candidate Pataki promised he would do: He cut taxes. But tax cuts inevitably come at a cost. The changes in income taxes and business taxes enacted last spring weren't really cuts, they were tax shifts. If New Yorkers would tell themselves the truth, they would realize that the proposed transit increases are actually a tax increase, one that falls less on the Republican, suburban electorate that voted for Mr. Pataki and more on New York City residents who by and large did not. 
 If the increases proposed this week by the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority go through as proposed, bus and subway fares in New York City would rise 20 percent, to $1.50 from $1.25, while commuter railroad fares would go up 9 percent, and the round trip tolls on the M.T.A.'s bridges and tunnels would increase to $7 from $6, an increase of 16.7 percent. The authority chairman, E. Virgil Conway, also threatened to eliminate free- and reduced-fare rides for students.
 Mr. Conway's announcement was no doubt the opening shot in a negotiation, and it may be that the bus and subway fares will not rise the full 25 cents or, finally, that students will have to pay their way to school. But transportation increases of some magnitude are clearly on the way.
 Unless the economy rebounds, the state cut in income taxes and business taxes will mean lost revenues of over $600 million in the current fiscal year, and more in the future. Mr. Conway proposed the fare increases because the city transit system and suburban railroads are facing a budget gap of $388 million next year.
IT would be naive to assume that all of the lost tax revenue would have gone to the transit system if the tax cuts hadn't been enacted. But government policy reflects political choices. Surely with more money around, officials might not have proposed raising the fares as much, or charging students who ride to school.
 "For a guy who said 'lower taxes' all over the place, this is a tax on the working class," said the Bronx Borough President, Fernando Ferrer. "If you've got two kids in school, you're paying $1,000 a year. You tell these people 'I'm going raise taxes on your home $1,000,' there would be a French Revolution!"
 Why the concept of a tax shift is so difficult is one of the more baffling aspects of politics today. Or maybe people do understand and figure that as long as someone else shoulders the burden and they save a few bucks, it's O.K. In any case, somebody has to pay.
 The same is true of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's arguments about the student fares. The Mayor is furious that Mr. Conway says that even with fare increases, the M.T.A. won't be able to afford the free and reduced fares. The Mayor's anger is understandable: If the city really does make students pay for bus and subway rides to school for the first time since 1948, the Mayor will no doubt take the political hit.
 Mr. Giuliani says it costs nothing extra to transport students. "It costs the M.T.A. absolutely zero," he said. "No money to provide free transportation to public school students. The trains run anyway. The trains run at those hours anyway. The trains have precisely the same staffing levels." He feels the M.T.A. is using the issue to get more money from the city. "It's a subsidy," he said.
OF course it is. That is the point. There is no added expense to carry the students, but there is a cost to the Transit Authority if it loses the subsidy. The money was always no more, or less, than the city's contribution to the cost of running the system. Absent that subsidy, the budget gap will have to be made up somehow, because when Mr. Giuliani decided to withhold $128 million for student fares -- which gave Mr. Pataki the excuse to withhold part of the state's contribution -- the Mayor really just enlarged the Transit Authority's deficit.
 Mr. Giuliani says the system is poorly and expensively run and filled with cuttable fat, just like the Board of Education. But he does not control the semiautonomous M.T.A. any more than he controls the school board; in fact, less. The Transportation Authority is headed by an appointee of the Governor, Mr. Conway, and the 17-member board is made up mostly of Pataki choices. The Mayor has only 4 appointees.
 The authority could find other cuts to keep the student program. Or given the devastating appearance of being the first mayor to break with a 47-year tradition of paying students' way to school, the Mayor, the Governor and the Legislature will come up with a compromise. But the deficits are not going away. "The Mayor can't have it both ways," said Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign. "He can't cut the system by millions of dollars without putting huge pressure on the fare and service."
 Just as with the missing tax revenues, the money will have to come from somewhere, because government still delivers services to the people. The voters who so predictably elect candidates who promise tax cuts conveniently forget that.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up Again vs. Yen, Reaching a 21-Week High

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar climbed to a 21-week high against the Japanese yen yesterday on speculation that the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve were planning to enter the currency markets again to support the dollar.
 The yen has weakened against the dollar and European currencies since Wednesday, when the Japanese Government announced plans aimed at reining in the yen. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 91.43 yen, up from 90.52 late Thursday and the highest level since mid-March.
 The central banks of the United States and Japan staged a surprise intervention in the currency markets on Wednesday, aggressively buying dollars and selling yen. Earlier that day, Japan said it would make it easier for its insurance companies and other financial institutions to invest abroad, thus increasing the potential demand for dollars.
 Since Wednesday, traders have been cautious about taking the dollar too low, fearing that the central banks might move in again.
 "Everyone was watching to see if the central banks would return," said Peggy Reed, vice president at Credit Agricole in New York.
 While there was no confirmation of any intervention yesterday, Ms. Reed said that some traders were "suspicious" that the central banks were active because even when there was selling, "the dollar would not go lower."
 The dollar also jumped against the German mark on speculation that Germany's central bank might cut interest rates next week. Lower German rates would make mark-denominated interest rates less attractive to investors.
 In New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.3972 marks, up from 1.3909 marks.
 Analysts said the currency markets mostly shrugged off a Labor Department report that showed the increase in jobs in July was lower than had been expected.

HEADLINE: Circling the Grocery Carts;
Stop & Shop Plans a Foothold in the New York Region

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

DATELINE: QUINCY, Mass.

 BODY:
The Yankees are coming.
 Stop & Shop, the supermarket leader by a mile in southern New England with well-managed stores that have been praised for their variety and spaciousness, has begun a southward push into what its executives, like Whitehall officials, call "the new territories": the suburbs of New York City. 
 For shoppers in the New York metropolitan area, this could be good news. Many local supermarkets fall far short of their counterparts in other regions. Many of the stores are old and small, with uninspired service, selection and ambiance, and limited parking. The Stop & Shop Companies, with sophisticated distribution, deep pockets, giant-store mentality and competitive chutzpah, is the antithesis of stodgy supermarket retailing.
 But for Stop & Shop, a company whose majority owner is Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the move is a daring one. High-quality supermarket chains from other regions have been wary of attacking this fortress of a market because of high costs for labor, real estate and transportation, said Mark Husson, a retail analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities.
 Stop & Shop, an 81-year-old chain based in this city south of Boston, has 130 stores, including 103 so-called superstores of 60,000 square feet each. With 3.5 million regular customers in southern New England and $3.8 billion in revenue, it has a market share of 23 percent, as large as that of its next four competitors combined.
 Though the company is tight-lipped on the subject, analysts say Stop & Shop plans to establish a beachhead of at least 30 superstores in the New York metropolitan area before the millennium, and will continue expanding after that. Joseph D. McGlinchey, chief financial officer of Stop & Shop, said the first superstore in the New York area, already under construction in South Setauket in Suffolk County on Long Island, will open next March. Stop & Shop has announced plans to open stores in New Jersey in East Rutherford, Morris Plains, Piscataway, Springfield and Wayne, and on Long Island in East Islip and Roslyn. Four or five of these should be up and running within a year. The company is also looking for sites in Westchester County, but will not say where.
 Why move south now? "In three or four years we'll reach our saturation point here," Mr. McGlinchey said. "We've got to go south to where the population is. There are more people on Long Island than there are in Connecticut, and in Connecticut we already have 52 stores."
 Indigenous chains are talking tough on invasion eve. "Every chain in this area is a street fighter when it comes to protecting their turf, and there's going to be a battle," said Stan Sorkin, a spokesman for Pathmark Stores, part of Supermarkets General Holdings. He stood in the wide aisles of a 59,000-square-foot, 8-month-old store in North Hackensack, N.J., that is a prototype for Pathmark's defense against Stop & Shop and others.
 It is the newest of the chain's "Pathmark 2000" stores, and greets entering customers with its Fresh Foods Plaza, a track-lit celebration of fresh fruits and vegetables, fresh-fish displays and deli counters. The chain has renovated or built 30 stores as Pathmark 2000 superstores; it also has 70 older stores in the New York metropolitan area. Pathmark hopes to upgrade 30 stores a year, but may not have the resources, because of its debt burden from a 1987 leveraged buyout.
 The market-share leaders in metropolitan New York are the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, including A & P, Food Emporium and Waldbaum's, with 18 percent; Pathmark, 16 percent, and Shop Rite, 15 percent, according to A. C. Nielsen data. A & P also professes aplomb about the Stop & Shop challenge. "We're bigger than they are, so we're not too frightened," said Michael J. Rourke, a spokesman for A & P, which has 1,100 stores in 23 states and Canada and is controlled by the Tengelmann Group of Germany. Three hundred of the stores are in the New York metropolitan area. "We know the territory pretty well, since we started in New York in 1859," he said.
 Last month, A & P opened a 60,000-square-foot superstore in Mahwah, N.J., and broke ground for another in Woodcliff Lake, N.J. It plans to have eight superstores in metropolitan New York in the next year.
 Shop Rite, another major competitor, includes groups of independent stores with no public financing and shallower pockets. Shop Rite did not return repeated phone calls.
 Money is less of a problem for Stop & Shop, which spent $150 million last year on capital expenditures alone and will do so again this year. "Many of Stop & Shop's competitors just don't have this kind of money to invest," said Clifton S. Robbins, a general partner of Kohlberg, Kravis, which owns 62.2 percent of the publicly traded Stop & Shop. He is one of five Kohlberg, Kravis directors on the nine-member board of Stop & Shop.
 Kohlberg, Kravis's initial investment of $100 million in the chain in 1988 is now worth more than $800 million, and the stock, which traded at $12.50 at the initial public offering in 1991, now trades at $27.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. "If Stop & Shop needed more money from us, we'd put it in, but they don't need it," Mr. Robbins said.
 Stop & Shop will finance the expansion with its own cash flow of $230 million, he said.
 The average Stop & Shop superstore has "60,000 square feet of awesome food retailing, with the highest sales per square foot in mainstream food retailing," said Mr. Husson, the J. P. Morgan analyst, who recently issued a report about Stop & Shop titled "Heavily Armed and Moving South."
 "When these supermarkets show up in northern New Jersey and Long Island," he added, "people will say, 'Wow.' "
 The chain, which has a profit margin of 8 percent, among the highest in the business, is "top drawer, with some very powerful friends," Mr. Husson said, referring to Kohlberg, Kravis and the two other supermarket chains in which the firm has a major interest -- Safeway and Vons. For example, Stop & Shop's premium private-label brand can be sold at a competitive price because it benefits from the economies of scale in purchasing with Safeway and Vons.
 Mr. Husson, who has rated the company as a long-term buy, called Stop & Shop "sharp at regional and ethnic marketing, and very good at merchandising to large Jewish populations." He added that its sophisticated distribution system allowed it to leave few gaps on the shelves, and that the stores were given the freedom to compete aggressively on pricing.
 In its most recent survey on customer satisfaction with supermarkets, in 1993, Consumer Reports magazine rated Stop & Shop in the first tier, based on the opinions of 10,000 readers. By contrast, three of Stop & Shop's future competitors finished last: Pathmark, the third worst; Grand Union, the second worst, and A & P, last out of 23 chains.
 Shop Rite fared better than its local competitors, but still finished below Stop & Shop.
 The 68,000-square-foot Stop & Shop superstore in Watertown, Mass., is typical of the chain's newer stores, with their large fish markets and produce and floral sections, pharmacies, bookstores and bakeries stocked with 600 items. The store has a full-service Baybank branch, and brings in many customers like Anthony Gentile, who arrived "to make a deposit at the bank, and so here I am in the fish aisle."
 "Let me tell you," he said. "I think the buys and the service here are very good."
 Ray Viola, the manager of the store, said it used a computer to help study customer traffic and plan staffing. The store tries to have enough workers to open a new register if more than one person is waiting, he said.
 Stop & Shop's store work force is 92 percent unionized in New England, according to the company, and Brian W. Hotarek, Stop & Shop's senior vice president for real estate, said it expected to be 100 percent unionized in the New York metropolitan area. About 300 jobs will be created with each new store, although other jobs may be lost if Stop & Shop gains customers from competitors.
 The Stop & Shop invasion is still a formidable gamble. The chain "must surmount the hurdles of new-market entry," said Gary M. Giblen, a retail expert who is a managing director at Smith Barney. "The graveyards are littered with the bodies of supermarket chains that have tried new-market entry as a major part of their strategy."
He cited disastrous moves by two chains that survived nonetheless: Food Lion, which tried to segue into Texas and Florida, and Smith's Food and Drug, which entered Arizona and Southern California.
 One barrier for Stop & Shop could be real estate. In the South and West, chains like Publix have capitalized on the availability of low-cost land to build larger stores. In the New York area, almost all the land is occupied. And expensive.
 Even finding a site is no guarantee of success. In Roslyn Village, L.I., where Stop & Shop has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars working on the site and the foundation for a superstore, some residents have tried to invalidate the supermarket's building permit, citing potential congestion and environmental damage.
 Two weeks ago, Stop & Shop fought back with a $26 million lawsuit in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York, contending that village officials had violated the company's civil and property rights.
 The problems in Roslyn may be good news to Stop & Shop's competitors, but will only delay an inevitable reckoning with the chain. When the first Stop & Shop superstores are built, Mr. Giblen said, the most competitive of the local supermarket chains "will drop their prices and increase the amount of labor in their stores."
 "And then?" he said. "Shoppers will have a movable feast."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Obscure Global Bank Moves Into the Light

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
In a small Swiss city sits an international organization so obscure and secretive that for many years visitors got lost looking for a small plaque next to an otherwise undistinguished doorway.
 Control of the institution, the Bank for International Settlements, lies with some of the world's most powerful and least visible men: the heads of 32 central banks, officials able to shift billions of dollars and alter the course of economies at the stroke of a pen. For years, the United States participated in the closed conclaves of the Basel-based bank only as an observer, having turned down a chance to join the bank upon its founding in 1930. 
 Now, however, the bank is stepping out of the shadows a bit. Last September, the Federal Reserve, the United States' central bank, officially joined -- quietly and discreetly, of course -- and in June, Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, participated in the bank's annual meeting for the first time.
 Two other events this year have brought attention to the institution. Last winter, the bank agreed to put up $10 billion of the American-led $47 billion in credit for the bailout of Mexico. And in the last two months, the chairmen of the biggest central banks attended closed-door meetings held by the bank and subsequently cut some interest rates, giving the appearance of coordination.
 At the same time, the bank is beginning to draw the attention of the same unlikely array of American populists who have opposed the new World Trade Organization. From the consumer advocate Ralph Nader to Patrick J. Buchanan, a candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination, these critics of foreign entanglements are beginning to add the Bank for International Settlements to their warnings.
 The Federal Reserve's decision to join the institution "is a major surrender of American sovereignty," Mr. Buchanan said. "This is going to be really the global bank that they're creating -- the global central bank."
 If elected, Mr. Buchanan said, he would demand an audit of the Federal Reserve and its various commitments, including its participation in the bank.
 Mr. Nader objects to the bank's unusual independence under international law, including an exemption from many Swiss laws. "It's outside the rule of law," he said. "It's above the law."
 A few liberal Democrats in Congress have also taken an interest in the bank, and one of them, Representative Paul E. Kanjorski of Pennsylvania, tried last year to persuade the Federal Reserve to delay joining the bank until studies could be done and hearings held.
 Fed officials defend the institution and its meetings as too valuable to ignore. "The information, understanding and analyses acquired at these meetings and through the statistical activities carried out under B.I.S. auspices contribute to more effective and more efficient policies," the Fed said in a blandly worded article in its monthly bulletin, the closest it had ever come to announcing that it had joined the bank.
 The Bank for International Settlements plays host to 10 closed-door meetings a year of top officials from the world's 11 most powerful central banks. It coordinates the development of minimum capital standards -- cushions against losses -- for banks around the world; those standards have an indirect effect on interest rates and the availability of loans. And its staff does extensive research on topics of interest to central bankers, including influential work over the last few years on the risks and advantages of derivatives.
 Central banks own 84 percent of the bank's stock, while private individuals own the rest, including the shares that the United States did not buy in 1930. The voting rights to the shares belong to the country to which they were originally assigned, so the Federal Reserve was able to join last year without buying back the shares.
 Mr. Greenspan, in addition to playing a leading role in the Mexico bailout, has become an increasingly regular guest at monthly meetings of central bank officials in Basel, feeding speculation about whether the bank has become a forum for coordinated changes in interest rates. The central banks of France, Canada and Japan all cut rates within a day after the Federal Reserve did so on July 6, while the central bank of Switzerland cut rates and Canada cut rates again right after the last meeting in Basel on July 10.
 But international monetary officials and financial analysts contend that the rate cuts are a mostly coincidental response to similar economic and financial market conditions in many different countries. "I think countries are pursuing their own objectives in these cases -- when the U.S. reduces rates it makes it easier for other countries," said Allen Sinai, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers.
 With Republicans in control of Congress, critics of the Bank for International Settlements may not get far soon. Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the House Banking Committee, is one of the bank's defenders.
 "My view is that in a time of intertangled and intertwined international finances," he said, "it would be irresponsible for the United States not to work constructively with the B.I.S., and to insure that United States interests are represented."

HEADLINE: Mr. Dole and Deregulation

 BODY:
Corporate managers perpetually squawk about costly, job-killing regulations that Washington dreams up for no good reason. They exaggerate, but they have a point. Yet few in the Senate listened until the majority leader, Bob Dole, took up the issue. Now there are two regulatory reform proposals -- one good and one bad -- before the Senate. Neither has enough votes to pass. A "rump" group of Democrats is grasping for a faulty compromise.
One bill, proposed by John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, would require agencies to weigh the costs as well as the benefits of health, safety and environmental regulations in order to weed out those that would do more harm than good. The idea is to use cost-benefit analysis to inform public debate. 
 The bill offered by Mr. Dole goes further, prescribing the steps that agencies must take to conduct cost-benefit analysis. This statutory micromanagement threatens sensible rule-making. Cost-benefit analysis is too inexact, too full of qualitative ruminations about non-quantifiable benefits, to yield decisive answers. Mr. Dole's exactitude is a recipe for paralysis because it offers industry numerous ways to tie up Federal rules in court. What does it mean, for example, that agencies must use the best information or examine all reasonable inferences in cost-benefit analysis? Lawyers will get rich trying to answer.
Mr. Dole also gives industry the right to petition agencies to review old regulations within a fixed period of time, and to challenge in court an agency that denies such a petition. The bill would thereby create insurmountable problems for fiscally strapped agencies, whose budgets the majority leader is simultaneously preparing to cut. They would have to devote huge resources to reviewing old rules, or let those rules die by default.
Ironically, another section of the Dole bill makes his system of judicial checks and balances unnecessary. Both he and Mr. Glenn propose giving Congress plenty of time to review, and reverse, Federal rules before they go into effect.
Neither the Dole nor the Glenn bill has enough votes to pass. A group of Democrats, led by Kent Conrad of North Dakota, seeks compromise. The group would amend the Dole bill by loosening deadlines so that agencies would have enough time to review rules of petitioning industries. The group would guarantee that provisions of the Clean Air Act and other existing laws are not overturned by the new legislation. It would also jettison Mr. Dole's attempt to gut the so-called Delaney Clause, which is aimed at keeping even the smallest trace of carcinogenic additives out of processed food.
Despite these improvements, however, Mr. Conrad apparently wants to preserve the fatal flaw in the Dole approach: statutory prescriptions for cost-benefit analysis that invite legal paralysis. If he does so, his so-called compromise will make sure that Federal rules clog the courts rather than keep pesticides out of baby food, pollutants out of the air and dangerous equipment out of the workplace.

HEADLINE: Stiffing Straphangers

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's need to raise fares and cut costs is an unavoidable consequence of huge cutbacks in Federal, state and city subsidies. But its remedy for this problem is warped, and the abruptness of its unveiling by the M.T.A. chairman, E. Virgil Conway, was impolitic to say the least. The plan penalizes New York City riders and threatens an economy that is the core of the metropolitan area's prosperity.
Local subway and bus fares paid by many low-income people within the city would go up 20 percent, while commuter railroad fares would rise by only 9 percent. Worse, free passes for city school students would be eliminated. 
 Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, with typical finesse, calls the plan "a piece of junk." He exaggerates, but his point is valid. Mr. Conway, appointed by Gov. George Pataki, has laid out a plan that treats New York City more harshly than the suburbs and also seems to be tilted toward Republican constituencies. Even within the city, it grants special allowances for outlying areas that tend to be predominantly Republican.
The proposed increase in subway and bus fares -- 25 cents, rising to $1.50 from $1.25 -- would be the biggest ever, though past increases have been larger in percentage terms. The M.T.A. rationalizes that the city transit system faces much larger deficits than the suburban railroads, but that does not excuse suddenly taxing families with children in school -- an additional cost of $3 a day for each child.
The M.T.A. has lost more than $250 million in city and state subsidies in the past year, including the $128 million city subsidy for student passes, and will lose $80 million more if Congress kills the Federal operating subsidy, as seems likely.
Mr. Giuliani contends that it costs the M.T.A. nothing extra to carry students since trains and buses run regardless of whether students are aboard. That is true in some measure as far as the economics of transporting students go. But the explanation glosses over the fact that the Giuliani administration is withdrawing a major subsidy. In budgetary terms, the fact that the subsidy was labeled for student costs is less important than the fact that the system got this annual payment.
Ending the free rides for schoolchildren is the M.T.A.'s way of trying to make Mr. Giuliani ante up again. But this is a situation that calls for negotiation rather than confrontation. The negotiations would have to touch on these points: The children cannot lose their transportation, and the cost cannot be dumped on working families. It is also going to be difficult for the city, given its own deficit problems, to provide the money. That means it might have to come from other sources, such as imposing higher railroad fares and tolls on suburbanites and delaying the M.T.A.'s $125 million annual allocation for capital expenditures.

The Disney Trap

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
When a TV set still had so few channels you could count them on your fingers, Americans constantly complained, "There's nothing on!" Now we've entered that long-awaited multi-channel nirvana. But except for those who can't get enough of sub-equatorial soccer and Capitol Hill bombast, who believes that the vast wasteland has given way to the promised land? Most nights there's still nothing on.
The phenomenon of hunger amidst cultural plenty is hardly unique to TV. The movie palace that once housed a single film is now a multiplex, but if you're not part of the teen-age common denominator, isn't it harder than ever to find something to see, no matter how many screens? A new book? The superstore dwarfs the old independent bookseller, but for all the extra titles, the variety in the mix seems less. 
 What's happened? One answer can be found in the deals that have steadily consolidated American show business in recent years -- crowned this week by Disney's purchase of ABC. Whatever joy this merger of Goliaths brings to shareholders -- and some correspondents covering the story for ABC had unmistakable stock-option dollar signs in their eyes -- the bottom line for consumers is a further constriction of our popular culture.
The fewer corporate giants who control the content of what we see, hear and read, the fewer the choices -- no matter how large the increase in outlets for their cultural products. Instead of being able to choose between, say, "Pocahontas" and "Crumb," a consumer will be able to choose only among "Pocahontas: The Movie," "Pocahontas: The Musical," "Pocahontas: The Novelization," "Pocahontas: The World Wide Web Site," "Pocahontas: The TV Show" and "Pocahontas: The Theme-Park Ride" -- especially if that consumer doesn't live in the big cities where a specialty item like "Crumb" will have to be tracked down.
I exaggerate, of course, and the Disney-ABC merger is not all bad news, even though it sadly reduces ABC News's corporate status to that of Time at Time Warner. Just the announcement of the deal was more entertaining than most Hollywood productions because it came as a genuine surprise, with no advance hype. (The secret was kept, it's been reported, because investment bankers, the agent Michael Ovitz and cellular phones were kept out of the loop.) Another fun aspect of the Disney deal was its upstaging of Laurence Tisch's announcement of CBS's sale to Westinghouse the very next day. Mr. Tisch's inept timing of CBS's betrothal to a semi-decrepit rust-belt suitor was the perfect parting metaphor for his destruction of William Paley's Tiffany network.
A more serious virtue of the Disney deal and the homogenized mass culture it perpetuates is as a societal tie that binds. As America becomes increasingly fractionalized politically, linguistically and economically, mass culture may be the last common tongue we have. If the country will never rally around Bill Clinton or Newt Gingrich, then maybe an all-powerful Disney-ABC can provide the icons to unify us -- much as Lucy and Desi served that purpose back in the era when a far smaller electronic arena could be dominated by Paley's relatively modest CBS.
But corporate culture, however pleasing, is still corporate. Designed to sell to as many customers as possible, it is no more personal than most assembly-line creations. To the extent a "Lion King" or "I Love Lucy" reveals a human touch, they're the exceptions, while "Congo" and last month's canceled sitcom are more than ever the rule.
In a corporate culture, original and idiosyncratic artistic voices, which by definition reach smaller markets, have trouble making themselves heard. As our entertainment behemoths become larger and fewer -- a process to be accelerated even faster by Congress's telecommunications bill -- those essential alternative voices will have to fight to keep from being drowned out entirely.
But they won't necessarily disappear. When pop culture becomes too oppressively white-bread, history tells us, its prized international teen-age market protests by putting its dollars elsewhere; all it took was a stoned Jack Nicholson in the bargain-basement "Easy Rider" to bring the elephantine Hollywood studios of the 60's to their knees. If there's an invigorating flip side to this week's victory for corporate culture, it's that a new counterculture is sure to rise up in revolt.

HEADLINE: Ida Lupino, Film Actress and Director, Is Dead at 77

BYLINE: By PETER B. FLINT 

 BODY:
Ida Lupino, an earthy, intelligent movie actress who created a luminous gallery of worldly wise villainesses, gangster's molls and hand-wringing neurotics, died on Thursday night at her home in Burbank, Calif. She was 77 years old.
Miss Lupino had cancer and had recently suffered a stroke, Mary Ann Anderson, her former secretary, said yesterday. 
 The actress was also celebrated for directing eight provocative and socially relevant feature films and scores of episodes of many long-running television series, including "The Untouchables," "Have Gun, Will Travel" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents."
In the course of more than 50 films, Miss Lupino was a spiteful Cockney in "The Light That Failed" (1939), a crazed wife in "They Drive by Night" (1940), a loyal girlfriend in "High Sierra" (1941), an escaped convict in "The Sea Wolf" (1941) and a steely murderer in "Ladies in Retirement" (1941).
In later roles, she was a depraved warden in "Women's Prison" (1955), a sob-sister columnist in "While the City Sleeps" (1956) and the world-weary mother of a rodeo star in "Junior Bonner" (1972). Vincent Canby of The New York Times called "Junior Bonner" "a superior family comedy" made to order for both Steve McQueen and Robert Preston, but wrote "the loveliest performance is that of Miss Lupino."
In the early 1950's, she directed and helped write successful low-budget movies on such sensitive issues as illegitimacy ("Not Wanted"), rape ("Outrage") and pathological murder ("The Hitch-Hiker").
On television, she regularly starred in a dramatic anthology, Four Star Playhouse, from 1952 to 1956. In 1957 and 1958 she produced "Mr. Adams and Eve," a situation comedy about married film stars, in which her co-star was Howard Duff, her third husband. Many of the episodes dealt comically with their real-life experiences.
Ida Lupino was born in London on Feb. 4, 1918, during a German zeppelin bombing. Her paternal forebears were traveling players and puppeteers in Renaissance Italy. Later generations migrated to England in the 17th century. Her father, Stanley Lupino, was a noted comedian, and her mother, Connie Emerald, was an actress who was also descended from a theatrical family. A cousin, Lupino Lane, was an internationally popular song-and-dance man.
As a child, she improvised and acted scenes with her younger sister, Rita, in a small theater their father had built for them in their London garden. Her roles included Juliet, Camille and even Hamlet. At the age of 13, she entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. At 15, she made her film debut in a Lolita-like role in "Her First Affaire." She made five more movies in Britain in 1933, then signed a contract with Paramount Pictures in Hollywood and played a dozen more sugary ingenues over the next five years.
The turning point came with "The Light That Failed," in which she forcefully played a vengeful prostitute who betrays an artist going blind (Ronald Colman). That performance and her next one, as a demented murderer in "They Drive by Night," won her a long-term contract at Warner Brothers.
Over the next decade, critics increasingly hailed Miss Lupino as one of the great film actresses. Her favorite role was in "Ladies in Retirement," as a stolid housekeeper who kills her overbearing employer so she can use the house as a sanctuary for her two insane sisters. The New York film critics honored her as the best actress of 1943 for her portrayal in "The Hard Way" of a ruthless woman who propels her younger sister to stardom and destroys everyone in her way.
Miss Lupino gracefully disguised the intense effort she put into shaping her roles, displaying an economy of motion and an ease in using precisely on-target gestures and intonation. She insisted she was not a born actress, saying: "I study and work hard. I take a script and mull over it and underline the bits I want to emphasize. When I go on the set, I know exactly what I want to do and how I want to do it."
In 1949, Miss Lupino and Collier Young, a movie executive and producer who was then her husband, founded Filmakers, an independent production company, for which she directed candid films with feminist themes. One of the most popular was "The Bigamist" (1953).
The energetic Miss Lupino called directing the most demanding work in films, requiring tactful but firm handling of many temperaments and giving clear instructions to a usually all-male, often skeptical crew. Though she spent many hours at what was then a man's calling, she was unstintingly feminine in bearing and manner, observing, "I'm not the kind of woman who can bark orders."
Miss Lupino was petite, standing only 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighing 112 pounds. She had auburn hair and violet eyes framed by half-inch-long lashes. Her leisure pursuits included skin diving, writing short stories and children's books, and composing music. One work, "Aladdin Suite," was performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.
She was married to (and divorced from) the actor Louis Hayward (1938 to 1945) as well as Mr. Young (1948 to 1951). She and Howard Duff were married in 1951 and divorced in 1983. He died in 1990.
Miss Lupino is survived by a daughter, Bridget Duff, and a sister, Rita Lupino.

HEADLINE: Paper Recycler Will Build Plant on S.I.

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
An Australian company has agreed to build a $250 million waste-paper recycling plant in Staten Island that will be the first of its kind in New York State, company officials and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday.
 To persuade the company, Pratt Industries, to build a plant in New York, the city agreed to give it $28 million in tax breaks and the state will provide an additional $14 million in abatements. 
 The 475,000-square-foot plant will be built in two phases over the next four to five years, beginning at the end of this year. When completed, it will provide 413 jobs.
 With the new plant, New York will have its first local processing facility for recycled waste paper. The city has agreed to sell up to 150,000 tons of waste paper, or half of its current supply, to Pratt annually.
 New York now sells the paper to local vendors who then ship the waste to recycling plants across the country. At full capacity, the Pratt plant will be able to convert 500,000 tons of waste paper a year into liner board and materials for corrugated board.
 Though the plant will employ fewer than 500 workers when complete, the Mayor said the $28 million in tax relief is "nothing in comparison to the enormous investment being made in the city, which the city recoups probably when construction begins and 1,000 people go to work."
 Mr. Giuliani estimated that local residents will earn an additional $131.5 million while the plant is being built.
 Other officials noted additional benefits.
 "The opening of Pratt Industries on Staten Island is a giant win for our economy, our residents and our environment," said Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island Borough President, who noted that for every pound of paper sent to the recycling plant, one less pound will be dumped at the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island.
 Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson said Pratt's promise to buy the city's waste paper at no less than $10 per ton will also help the city achieve its recycling goals. He noted that about a year ago, the city actually had to pay as much as $35 to $40 a ton to get rid of the waste.
 "Now we know there will always be a revenue stream for our waste paper," he said. "This will provide the financial underpinning for the whole recycling program."
 John Doherty, the Sanitation Commissioner, said Pratt will be able to sort and recycle paper, including "mixed paper," or waste paper produced by offices, which the city plans to start recycling this fall.
"Now we can go out and purchase the equipment we need as we add material, and hire the sanitation workers we need," to collect this paper "knowing we have a contract that's going to pay," Mr. Doherty said.
 Previous plans for paper recycling mills, including one sponsored by a community-development group in the South Bronx, have faltered. Mr. Dyson said the city has been negotiating with three or four other waste-paper recycling firms. "I'm certain this announcement will spur those along," he said.
 The tax breaks offered to Pratt include a 100 percent building tax exemption for 15 years and a 10 percent exemption for 10 years after that. Pratt will also receive property tax abatements of $500 for every full-time employee and sales tax exemptions on building materials and machinery.
 The state's incentives include $1 million in road improvements and grants and loans from the Empire State Development Corporation.
 Pratt owns 10 paper recycling plants, including one in Indiana and another in Georgia. The company processes about 500,000 tons of waste paper a year in Australia, approximately half of that nation's waste-paper output.
 Richard Pratt, the company's owner and chairman, said the company had considered sites in New Jersey and Pennsylvania but ultimately decided on New York because of the ready supply of waste paper, and because of relatively low energy costs.

Unemployment Rate Edges Up

BYLINE: By SUSAN JO KELLER 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
The unemployment rate in New Jersey inched up to 6.8 percent in July from 6.6 percent in June, Federal officials said yesterday. That rate is more than a percentage point above the national unemployment rate, which rose to 5.7 percent from 5.6 percent in June. It is also the second highest unemployment rate among the nation's 11 major industrial states, after California, which posted a 7.9 percent rate. James Hughes, a professor at Rutgers University, said the state continued to feel the effects of restructuring and layoffs by major corporations. But he noted that the change in July was statistically insignificant and said he doubted that unemployment would rise much more in the coming months.

An article in Business Day on Tuesday about Monday's trading in the credit market misstated an economist's assessment of a Commerce Department report on personal income and spending that affected the market. The economist, Anthony Chan of the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said the gap between personal income and spending suggested that consumption would indeed grow, in the second half of the year.

HEADLINE: Salvadoran Labor Law Protects Workers;
What Mexicans Earn

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Kenneth Schwartz's information in "Mexican Maquiladoras" (letter, July 27) is out of date. Based on his experience "just before and after the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement," he tries to differentiate Mexican and Central American maquiladoras, or free-trade zone factories. Since he was there, the peso devaluation cut the value of Mexican worker paychecks by half. When I examined the pay stubs of workers this spring, I found all were receiving in the 53 to 59 cent an hour range. 
 Given the influence of United States prices in the border region, they have less buying power than their Central American counterparts.
Mr. Schwartz comments that Mexican plants do not employ child labor. He might have noted a plausible cause for this is the systematic firing of union organizers. This permits hiring adult labor for roughly the price of child labor.

BYLINE: By Laurel Graeber 

 BODY:

ONCE UPON A TIME: A Floating Opera
By John Barth. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $12.95.
The hero of the author's 11th work of fiction has his creator's name and many of his identifying characteristics. But nothing else -- including the flow of time itself -- occurs in the expected manner. This autobiography-cum-novel "is brilliantly conceived, elegantly written, bursting with life," R. H. W. Dillard said here last year.
THE STRUGGLE FOR RUSSIA
By Boris Yeltsin. Translated by Catherine A.
 Fitzpatrick. Times Books/Random House, $14.
This memoir by a man who is his country's first freely elected leader has been reissued with an index (the hard-cover edition lacked one) and a new preface that refers to the events in Chechnya. But here, as in the rest of his book, Mr. Yeltsin makes a plea for popular support for a reformed but unified nation. Containing journal entries written mostly between August 1991 and October 1993, the book "is a reminder of how delicate a plant Russia's flowering of freedom is," Paul Johnson wrote in these pages in 1994, "and suggests that in present circumstances Mr. Yeltsin, with all his faults, may be the best -- indeed the only -- man to nurture it." Russia's totalitarian past is the subject of SPECIAL TASKS: The Memoirs of an Unwanted Witness -- A Soviet Spymaster, by Pavel Sudoplatov and Anatoli Sudoplatov with Jerrold L. Schecter and Leona P. Schecter (Back Bay/ Little, Brown, $14.95). As a member of Stalin's security forces, Pavel Sudoplatov participated in numerous murders and oversaw atomic espionage in Britain and the United States. Although last year our reviewer, Adam B. Ulam, cautioned against taking Mr. Sudoplatov's statements at face value, he found "Special Tasks" "a valuable document and very readable."
MR. VERTIGO
By Paul Auster. Penguin, $10.95.
This novel concerns the career of a St. Louis orphan named Walt, who is plucked from the streets in 1924 by a charismatic sage named Master Yehudi. Yehudi gets both Walt and the story off the ground by teaching the boy to fly. The tale "is witty, inventive in its language and invitingly playful with its metaphors," Jay Cantor wrote in the Book Review last year.
THE DUKE ELLINGTON READER
Edited by Mark Tucker. Oxford University, $15.95.
No one, it seems, had a halfhearted opinion either about jazz or about the man who created some of its most famous compositions. This collection includes praise, criticism and even some of Ellington's own words. It "is full of excellent writing," our reviewer, Peter Keepnews, said in 1993. Oxford is also the publisher of JAZZ: The American Theme Song, by James Lincoln Collier ($12.95), which seeks to subvert some time-honored dogmas concerning the music's roots. In doing so Mr. Collier "mounts an impressive examination of Creole culture," Russell Davies wrote in these pages in 1993.
THE PRINCE OF WEST END AVENUE
By Alan Isler. Penguin, $9.95.
Otto Korner, Holocaust survivor and published poet, is the resident of a Manhattan retirement home that is mounting a production of "Hamlet." As Otto explores the theatrical milieu of his present, he is drawn into the dark world of his Auschwitz past in a story that "is able to haunt us," Bette Pesetsky said here last year.
LOOKING AT THE SUN: The Rise of the New East Asian Economic and Political System
By James Fallows. Vintage, $14.
The author analyzes the strength of Japanese industrial policies, arguing that the Asian tendency to ignore standard laissez-faire doctrine should be a cautionary lesson to the West. Last year our reviewer, F. M. Scherer, said he "provides fascinating insights."
I AM SNOWING: The Confessions of a Woman of Prague
By Pavel Kohout. Translated by Neil Bermel. Harvest/ Harcourt Brace, $13.
Written by a Czech author once exiled as a dissident, this novel is narrated by Petra Marova, who is confused by the conflicting claims of her lovers and by the new choices of capitalism. It "is undeniably impressive," John Bayley said in the Book Review last year. The same publisher has also reissued a novella by another dissident author, the Chilean Luis Sepulveda. THE OLD MAN WHO READ LOVE STORIES, ($8), centers on an elderly settler in the Amazon who is asked to lead an expedition to track an ocelot that has been killing white prospectors. "Readers will be enchanted by this finely wrought tale," David Unger wrote here in 1994.
ABDUCTION: Human Encounters With Aliens
By John Mack. Ballantine, $6.99.
Including a new preface in which the author, a Harvard psychiatrist, addresses his critics, this book explains his research into the experiences of people who claim to have been contacted by extraterrestrials. Last year our reviewer, James S. Gordon, felt that Dr. Mack's investigations, while not entirely convincing, were still "fascinating, suggestive and even inspiring."
AVA
By Carole Maso. Dalkey Archive, $12.95.
Written in staccato sentences that reveal the second-by-second images traversing a woman's mind, this novel unfolds on a single day in the life of a college professor stricken with cancer -- her last. It "uses repetition and thematic layering to create a shimmering, impressionistic portrait that eschews linear narrative," Wendy Smith said in the Book Review in 1993.
UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES: A Memoir of the Fifties.
By Sally Belfrage. Harper Perennial, $13.
The author tried hard to be the pert blond cheerleader the era demanded, but even in high school she had too much baggage: her British parents were former Communists and ultimately deported. She "is a sharp, unsentimental observer," Elinor Langer wrote here in 1994. LAUREL GRAEBER

HEADLINE: A WAR IN THE FAMILY

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN; Roger Cohen is completing an 18-month assignment as the Balkan bureau chief for The Times.

 BODY:
PARIS ZECEVIC EASES HIS METALLIC GREEN FORD PROBE OFF THE FREEWAY AND PULLS UP outside the R. & J. Barber Shop. A wasteland surrounds him, of audio stores and eateries, auto dealerships and repair shops, reaching into the featureless distance. Detroit. America. He yawns, stretches. His hair is tied back in a ponytail; stubble darkens his face; a loose belly suggests a young man going to seed. "I did not plan to grow a beard," he says, laughing. "But I was too lazy to shave, just too lazy. I got tired of it." His grim laughter lingers, full of disdain, the snicker of an uprooted man whose education has been singularly violent. Zecevic is a Bosnian Muslim refugee, one of the 2.7 million people displaced by the war. He pulls on a cigarette, zips his leather jacket and strides into the dingy store. "Can you shave me?" he asks.
"The only thing we shave here," declares the owner, "is necks." The tone is roughly that of a man saying, "The only thing we slit here is throats." The hairdresser shoots a glance at Zecevic in the mirror. Then he returns to the hair he is cutting. 
 Back in his car, just acquired with a bank loan of $12,000, Haris Zecevic muses on this encounter. It proves his pet theory that in America you can get everything except what you need. "Coming to the United States from Bosnia," he says, "one of the most difficult things is the transition from animal to human. I mean, I was in the war for a time and you have to change or you ain't going to survive. You have to learn to bite, to fight for whatever you can get. Here, you still feel like you felt before. That is, anyone messes with you and you take out a gun. You kill 'em, turn 'em into meat. You ever thought of taking a bite out of someone? But you know that you try any of that stuff here and you're in trouble."
Twenty-six years old, Haris Zecevic is a hollow man set down in the American wilderness. Just over three years ago, he was a kid from a middle-class Sarajevo family, hoping to become an engineer. In a city beneath the ski slopes and not far from the sea, he had few worries. Then Europe's post-Communist upheaval brought the continent's worst conflict since World War II to Bosnia and an unrelenting Serbian siege to Sarajevo.
His brother was killed by a Serbian shell in 1992. Lost and scared, Haris slipped out of Sarajevo and eventually reached Detroit as a refugee. One of the first things he learned there was that his mother, Bisera, had been shot dead by the Serbs. She died when United Nations troops beamed a spotlight on her as she tried to escape from Sarajevo by dashing across the airport one August night in 1993. Now he is obsessed with extracting his father from the Bosnian capital and by an amorphous desire for revenge.
Sometimes he hates all Serbs. More often, he focuses on his Bosnian Serb uncle, Slobodan Karisik, a telecommunications engineer who fled Sarajevo for Serbia soon after the war began on April 6, 1992. An irrational conviction that Karisik helped blow up Sarajevo's central post office and most of its phone lines on May 2, 1992, has taken hold of him. "You know, my uncle, he is the man I would kill if I had half a chance," he says.
At other times Haris Zecevic says he feels nothing. "That's a strange thing about my feelings," he remarks. "I don't have them too much anymore. Sarajevo left me with that. But, from time to time -- this is weird, this is sick -- one thing comes into my mind and it hurts me. I'm looking at pictures of my mom and my brother and I start wondering, what's happening to their bodies now, what do they look like in the ground? And that is something that is killing me."
THE SARAJEVO MORTUARY IS unrefrigerated this fourth summer of the siege because there is no electricity in the city, so the stench of bodies is often pungent. The smell seeps out of the tiled morgue into the small room of peeling paint and sagging plants where the records of the dead are kept. The names -- 3,060 in 1992, 3,091 in 1993 and 1,797 in 1994 -- are written in a spidery script across page after page of frayed ledgers: a dry chronicle of a European war and a city's dismemberment.
This woman, too, being wheeled in on a stretcher, will be such a name, recorded with the assiduity of the vestigial Communist bureaucracy that weighs on all the ill-born states of the former Yugoslavia. Smudged stamps and signatures will ratify her death. But they will say nothing of the way the left side of her head was torn open by hot metal, her gray hair matted with blood and her mouth contorted in a final grimace. Nothing, either, of the randomness of another Sarajevan death, delivered by a shell or some improvised 500-pound rocket as the 20th century slid down the slope toward its close.
I have come to the morgue to look for the name of Haris's brother, Muris Zecevic. I know him well by now from family photographs: the wide-eyed little boy with lank hair vacationing on the Dalmatian coast; the brooding adolescent with his guitar; the wiry, defiant young man who traded his musical instrument for a Kalashnikov and his jeans for military fatigues.
Three years have passed since his death. But the same shells that are audible on his father's video of the hasty funeral reverberate today through Sarajevo's tapering valley. And the loss of this 21-year-old Bosnian Muslim remains, in many ways, as unresolved as the Bosnian war itself.
I am searching still -- in the destruction of his family and in its dispersal from Sarajevo to places as far-flung as Detroit and Belgrade -- for some truth that might redeem, or at least explain, the premature death of Muris Zecevic in a makeshift trench near the bobsled track used at the 1984 Sarajevo Olympics and of his mother on the tarmac of Sarajevo's airport.
The last pictures show Muris in the summer of 1992 up on Trebevic mountain. Rising steeply above the south side of the city, it is a mountain before which Sarajevans feel naked and inclined to a collective scream, like that portrayed in Edvard Munch's famous painting. Once associated with winter skiing and summer picnics, it is now a font of anonymous death.
With a small group from what was a ragtag Bosnian Army, Muris had advanced up the slope to a position near an observatory built during the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The sun was shining and, in some of the photographs, he and his friends were laughing and making faces.
From a trench there, they were briefly able to interdict the strategic road linking the separatist Serbs' stronghold of Pale with the main Bosnian Serb garrison near Sarajevo at Lukavica. Until, on Aug. 3, 1992, several hundred shells fell on the emplacement, killing Muris Zecevic and five others.
It is on this same mountain that the Muslim-led Bosnian Army -- now trained, invigorated and far better equipped -- has been trading mortar fire with the Serbs since the offensive begun in June officially aimed at relieving the 40-month-old siege of Sarajevo. The fact that outgoing rounds now match those incoming is a measure of the shift in the conflict since Muris Zecevic died. Now, in a way that is new, this is a war between armies rather than a Serbian onslaught against civilians or amateur soldiers.
Nonetheless, the recent ousting of tens of thousands of Muslim civilians from Srebrenica -- during which Muslim men were taken to improvised detention centers and women and children were pushed over the front lines into Bosnian Government-controlled territory -- shows that the old pattern of Serbian "ethnic cleansing" has not changed. Moreover, Serbian artillery, inherited from the former Yugoslav Army, remains formidable. When Bosnian infantry tried to retake the crucial Pale-Lukavica road on June 16, they were again repulsed, with casualties, by accurate shelling. They retreated, just as the survivors of Muris Zecevic's unit did three years ago. And so the Balkan gyre turns.
Alija Hodzic has been running the morgue since June 1992. His deep blue eyes suggest a shrouded sea. In that time, he has recorded the deaths of his 22-year-old son, a niece and a nephew. His voice is gentle. "When the war is over . . . ," he says, only to catch himself: nobody can imagine when that might be. But if peace ever returns, he dreams of being a truck driver.
Asked to look up the deaths of August 1992, he searches for some time and then produces the relevant ledger. On Aug. 4, his hand has inscribed the name Muris Zecevic beside those of two of his friends, Tarik Kapetanovic and Zoran Susa, a Serb who was loyal to Bosnia's Muslim-led Government.
Names -- as alike on the page as the corpses in the soil -- they have ceased to signify anything. No hint remains that Muris Zecevic once exuded the vigor of a young man. Yet there is a verve about him in the most recent photographs that is unmistakable. "If you were angry with him, he would smile and everything would disappear," says Sanja Mrehic, his last girlfriend. "Nobody had his energy or vitality. For three months after he died I dreamed of him, and three times it was like reality. He was holding me, kissing me."
THE TIME OF MURIS'S DEATH WAS A PORTENTOUS one. Reports had just appeared of Serbian concentration camps through which many of the more than 750,000 Bosnian Muslim men, women and children killed or forced from their homes by the Serbs in the early months of the war had been processed.
Bill Clinton, then a Democratic candidate for President, had no doubts about how to respond. "The United States and the international community must take action," he declared the day after Muris Zecevic was killed. "If the horror of the Holocaust taught us anything, it is the high cost of remaining silent and paralyzed in the face of genocide."
Two days earlier, Aug. 2, 1992, a State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, said "abuses and torture and killings" had taken place in Serbian "detention centers" throughout Bosnia.
But a day later, as Muris Zecevic died on Trebevic mountain, Boucher was contradicted by Thomas M. T. Niles, a former Assistant Secretary of State, who said such reports could not be confirmed. Thus was established a pattern of American confusion and vacillation in which the only consistent point has been a determination to avoid the direct involvement of American soldiers in the worst European security crisis in decades.
Meanwhile, the cost of paralysis continues to mount. The war has festered, growing ever more intractable and leaving open a fundamental question: What happened to this former Yugoslav republic of sudden mists and rushing rivers, this hybrid society on the age-old border of East and West, to unleash such destruction on the unsuspecting likes of the Zecevic family?
FOR ASIM ZECEVIC, A MILD-mannered dentist and the father of Haris and Muris, the first sign that war would engulf Bosnia came on Jan. 4, 1992, three months before the fighting began. A passionate hunter, he had gone into the hills east of the capital. Abruptly, a group of Serbs who were apparently undergoing paramilitary training fired several rounds over his head. "I could not believe it," he recalls. "I came back and I told my family, 'There's going to be war here.' "
By this time, Yugoslavia had already fallen apart. More than 10,000 people had been killed in the 1991 war in Croatia, where a Serb minority fought to resist joining a newly independent state it saw as hostile. The war, in which the Serbs were strongly backed by the Yugoslav Army, had clearly demonstrated the basic conundrum of dismantling Yugoslavia: the presence of a large number of Serbs living outside Serbia with no wish to submit to a Government dominated by Croatians, Muslims, Albanians or whomever.
Despite the proximity of the Croatian conflict, and the fact that the Serbian minority in Bosnia was larger than in Croatia, people in Sarajevo generally could not believe that war would strike them too. The singular Sarajevan mosaic of Catholic and Orthodox churches, mosques and synagogues, bespoke a Bosnian intermingling of cultures seemingly too dense to be wrenched asunder.
Fida Karisik, Asim Zecevic's sister, had intense personal reasons for believing war was impossible. Her husband, Slobodan -- the man Haris Zecevic now talks of killing -- is a Bosnian Serb.
But she, too, had stumbled on a grim warning. In 1990, with the emergence of Alija Izetbegovic and his nationalist Muslim Party of Democratic Action, Serbs had begun to feel uneasy. A Bosnian Serb friend of Fida Karisik's, Milanka Deilpara, warned her that Bosnia would be destroyed and Muslims massacred.
"I could not believe it," Fida Karisik says. "I asked her to explain. She said that although she was from Bosnia, she was first a Serb and the Serbs would have to take their share of the country. Same with the Croats. So there would be no room for Muslims. Yet Milanka, like me, was born in the Sarajevo area. And before I am a Muslim, I am a Bosnian."
BUT BOSNIA IS AN ELUSIVE, MANY-FACETED thing, built on the gradual coalescence of diffuse civilizations and bloods. Too elusive, perhaps, for a time when national tribes are on the march in the Balkans. The sight of its hazy mountains rising from the placid plain of the Sava River is always suggestive of mystery. Its valleys are steep, its people alternately supine and electric, its mud a morass in which successive empires and armies have sunk -- but not without trace.
The words closest to its soul include "sevdah," a nostalgic, brooding longing associated with lost love, and "ceif," a personal pleasure taken with no regard to what anybody else thinks. They capture the reflective pessimism and hedonistic iconoclasm of a people familiar with the follies and passing glories of a shifting world.
The country has existed for a long time -- the medieval kingdom reached its apogee in the 14th century -- but when Bosnia gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1992 it had not been a sovereign state for 530 years. To some, particularly nationalists in neighboring Serbia and Croatia, this was long enough to suggest that the place was a complete invention.
But Bosnia is a composition of its complex history rather than an imaginary land. For more than four centuries after its conquest in 1462, Bosnia formed the western edge of the Ottoman Empire. Thus was a large body of Muslim converts added to a mixed population of Catholic Croats, Eastern Orthodox Serbs and a small but influential Jewish community.
Contemporary Bosnia, a state about half the size of Pennsylvania, was defined by an intense mingling of peoples and religions: on the eve of the war, about 30 percent of marriages were mixed. In the last prewar census, in 1991, 41 percent of the population of 4.4 million was Muslim, 31 percent Serb and 18 percent Croat. The rest simply called themselves Yugoslavs.
While the Bosnian Serbs blame the war on Muslim nationalism, there was little doubt in the Zecevic family that the Serbian onslaught was cynically prepared and essentially ineluctable. Early in the year, Asim Zecevic saw big guns being removed from the main barracks to be placed on the surrounding hills. Artillery from the Croatian war, ended by a tenuous truce in January 1992, was also installed around the capital. When he asked officers of the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Army why this was, he was told it was to protect the people.
"But protect them from who?" Asim Zecevic asks. "The guns were not pointing away from Sarajevo. They were pointing in."
In late February, tensions rose markedly when 64 percent of Bosnians voted for independence in a referendum boycotted by the Serbs. A few days later, a Serbian bridegroom was gunned down at a wedding party in the old, mainly Muslim Bascarsija section of town. Serbian paramilitary groups set up barricades near the Zecevic home in central Sarajevo. It appeared that war had begun. In fact, a relative calm held for another month.
But Muris Zecevic, unlike most of his compatriots, was getting ready for battle. Early in 1992, he joined the Patriotic League, a small group that provided military training and was the seed of the Bosnian Army. Most nights, his father says, he would disappear, refusing to say where he went. "Muris was kind of hyper-everything," his brother, Haris, says. "When he found some ideal, he went for it."
There is a video made by Bosnian television on April 5, 1992, the day before full-scale war broke out and the European union and the United States recognized Bosnia. It seems to capture the irrepressible and naive hopes of Muris Zecevic -- and of many of his people.
A group of Sarajevans are milling on the central Vrbanja Bridge when shots ring out, apparently fired by followers of the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic. Muris appears, wearing a beret and dark glasses and brandishing an automatic weapon. He alone is armed, and he fires shots into the air as the people shout "Cowards" and "Terrorists" to the Serbs shooting from a high-rise building. Then jet fighters from the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Air Force pass overhead. Muris joins the people on the bridge in jeering and chanting, "Bosna! Bosna! Bosna! Bosna!"
When the Serbian shelling started the next day, Muris had no hesitation. He left home with the parting words, "Dad, the war's started for me and I'm not coming back."
IT IS ONE CURIOSITY OF THE WARS OF Yugoslavia's destruction that Belgrade, itself a much-conquered and much-bombarded city over the centuries, has been an island of somnolent moroseness. Along the leafy avenues, not a shot has been fired that bears a direct relation to the battles in which President Milosevic has played such a central role.
When the nationalist fervor whipped up by Milosevic exploded in 1991 and 1992, the streets were full of patriotic songs and the badges, uniforms, insignia and memorabilia of the Chetniks, the Serbian irregulars who fought the Turks in the 19th century and, later, the Nazis. Unemployed kids up from the boondocks bought what they could to disguise themselves as Serbian warriors before boarding buses for the killing fields of Croatia and Bosnia. Their mission was to terrorize civilians, cleanse territory of non-Serbs, grab what booty they could and -- the killing done -- stick up signs in cafes saying, "This Is Serbia." But the fervor passed quickly enough.
Unlike much of the rest of the former Yugoslavia, Belgrade still has buildings with roofs. There are no corpses floating on the Sava and Danube Rivers, whose confluence beneath the old Ottoman fortress of Kalemegdan retains a melancholic charm that makes all the bloodshed nearby seem infinitely remote. The crafting and sustenance of this illusion has been not the least of Milosevic's achievements.
In an outlying suburb, on the flat and fertile plain that unfolds north of the capital to form the Serbian breadbasket, Vesna Karisik could be found earlier this year living in a dowdy ground-floor apartment. She is the 17-year-old daughter of Fida and Slobodan Karisik. A first cousin of Haris Zecevic, she has not seen him since shortly after the Bosnian war began. Pale and slender, she has a face dominated by the vivid green eyes that distinguish many Bosnians.
Greeting me, she unconsciously goes through the rites of entering a Muslim home in Sarajevo: the removal of shoes, the donning of slippers and the offering of Turkish coffee. There is a natural grace about her.
"My mother," she says, "hoped that the war would stop and a certain life resume in Sarajevo and we would all return there. But we will never go back to Sarajevo. My friends are here in Belgrade now. I am trying to forget Sarajevo. It's too sad, everything is ruined and my memories are bad."
It was on April 12, 1992, six days after the shelling of Sarajevo began and Muris Zecevic left home to fight, that Vesna and her older sister, Jasna (then 14 and 16 years old), flew in a military aircraft to Belgrade.
They were to stay with a Serbian friend as a precautionary measure while the moment of madness passed. "We were convinced it would all be over in 10 days," their mother says. In fact, Fida Karisik would not see her daughters for more than two years.
Fida Karisik is a handsome woman with a strong, upright bearing who is now wound so tight inside that tears well uncontrollably at the mention of any of a range of subjects: the death of her nephew Muris Zecevic, the death of her sister-in-law Bisera Zecevic, the war, her children and husband in Belgrade, her future.
She works for the municipal administration and lives, most of the time, with her brother, Asim, and their 83-year-old mother, Hasnja, in a spacious but shabby apartment a few hundred yards from Sarajevo's Holiday Inn. "When Muris was killed, it was almost like losing my own child," she says. "My brother came and said, 'You know, Fida, there is no more Muris.' No politics is worth all these young lives."
She lights a cigarette, fighting tears, and continues: "I am completely divided inside myself. I feel very sorry about Muris and about Bisera, and I feel I must take care of Asim. But, on the other side, my children are there in Belgrade. I am being pulled in all directions. I cannot stand anymore to be separated from my children.
"I am not really angry with my husband personally because he did not take a gun. But the idea of Greater Serbia is in the head of all Serbs. Some are murderers, some are not, but all support the idea. Slobodan looks very nice and honest, but who knows?"
Slobodan Karisik declined to be interviewed. A brilliant and introverted man, in the view of family and friends, he was a university professor teaching electrical engineering. Fifty-four years old, he also worked 20 years for the Bosnian telephone service, designing its main switching exchange, and for the United Nations, installing telecommunications facilities in developing countries.
His daughter Vesna says the war took him completely by surprise. The day the shelling began, she was out with her mother. The family's car was stolen in the chaos. They went to the police station to report this. Young men were running in and out collecting weapons.
"We were ordered to go home, but there was shooting on all sides and we could not pass the Holiday Inn," Vesna recalls. "My mother threw me on the sidewalk and lay on top of me. Finally, we made it home. My father was watching television. He was white, white. I had never seen him like that. We told him about the car, but I don't think he even heard us. He said, 'From now on, nobody leaves this house except me.' "
LESS THAN A MONTH LATER, ON April 30, 1992, Slobodan Karisik left Sarajevo for good and joined his daughters in Belgrade. The circumstances of his departure have become a subject of a venomous exchange that illustrates how war destroyed the Zecevic-Karisik family and how truth changes on different sides of the lines.
For if a Muslim boy like Haris Zecevic, who loved his Serbian uncle, now wants to murder him, it is perhaps possible to grasp how relentlessly gory official propaganda could, in just a few years, turn Yugoslavs living in a single country into "Serbian Chetniks," "Muslim Fundamentalists" and "Croatian Ustashe" (Fascists), divided by impenetrable new borders and disposed to kill one another.
To Haris Zecevic in Detroit, his uncle's actions have assumed every shade of darkness: Slobodan Karisik absconded from the Bosnian capital, abandoned his Muslim wife, made off with their children and sabotaged Sarajevo's telephones. His uncle has become for him the single most potent symbol of the forces that took the life of his mother and brother.
But for Vesna Karisik in Belgrade, her father's flight from Sarajevo was a necessary step, provoked by threats from Bosnian Muslim officials. "As a Serb, my father risked being killed if he had stayed much longer in Sarajevo," she says.
Fida Karisik sees a more nuanced truth. By the end of April 1992, it was clear the war would not be over so quickly. She and her husband agreed that he should go to Serbia to look after the girls. But the idea, she insists, was that he would then find a job outside Serbia. "I told him I would go anywhere in the world with him," she says.
Slobodan left Sarajevo by bus on April 30. After the central Sarajevo post office was blown up a few days later, on May 2, 1992, with the loss of thousands of phone lines, the Bosnian police searched the Karisik apartment and interrogated Fida about her husband. Families related to Serbs were frequently interrogated at this time.
"Haris is not the only one who thinks Slobodan helped destroy the post office by placing a bomb," she says. "Others have said this to me. But I am absolutely sure he had nothing to do with it. He made that exchange. He would never destroy his own work."
Asked about her nephew's violent feelings toward his uncle, Fida Karisik replies: "Look, I understand Haris completely because he lost his brother and he lost his mother and Serbs have done all these terrible things to us Muslims. But things were not as he imagines."
Slobodan Karisik and his daughters struggled to make a new life in Serbia. Meanwhile, a slow fraying of the marriage -- never openly avowed -- clearly began. Fida Karisik felt her husband had betrayed her by staying in Serbia, where he took a job with the telephone company. She felt efforts to make contact -- through mail or ham radio -- always came from her side. After initially urging his wife to come with him, Slobodan Karisik appears not to have renewed the invitation.
It was only in June 1994, more than two years after the girls left Sarajevo, that their mother was able to see them again. A NATO ultimatum in February 1994 temporarily silenced Serbian artillery, permitting a limited number of crossings over the bridge linking the Serb-held Grbavica district and other parts of the city. Unaccompanied by their father, who said he did not want to go, Jasna and Vesna traveled down through Serbian-held Bosnia to Grbavica.
"I did not know how my mother would be," Vesna says. "But she was more beautiful than I remembered her. She was crying. We started crying too, for joy. We stayed in the apartment in Grbavica of my father's former secretary, and Mom held our hands the whole time in the apartment. She did not want to let go. Then, after a few days, she had to go back over the bridge. I watched my mother going over the bridge. She kept turning back and looking at us and crying. She would stop when she turned back. It was terrible, so difficult. Then a United Nations vehicle came and she disappeared." Sobbing fills the small Belgrade apartment.
The next meeting took place two months later in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale. Again, Fida Karisik secured a temporary permit to cross the bridge and, this time, her husband came. In front of their children, the Muslim mother and Serb father tried to avoid talking about the politics of the war that had come between them. But it was not easy.
"At one point, Slobodan said he could make a list of the Serbs killed in Sarajevo at the beginning of the war," Fida Karisik says. "My reply was, 'You cannot make a list of the Muslims killed during this war -- there are too many of them.' And everyone in the room fell quiet after that."
The last meeting took place in October 1994. Again, Fida Karisik crossed the bridge. She secured fake documents identifying her as a Serb from friends in Grbavica and traveled with a cousin to Belgrade. The family was reunited for a few days.
But much was left unsaid. Fida Karisik expected her husband or daughters to urge her to stay, but she felt she never received this invitation. She was uncomfortable in Belgrade, but unable to explain why to her family. Her children were dismayed when she returned to Sarajevo; they had hoped the reunion would be permanent.
"I know my old grandmother and Asim are in Sarajevo, and my mother has her job there," Vesna says. "But it would be much better if she were here with us. How can she live alone in Sarajevo when her family is here?"
Vesna weighs this question and then goes on: "I try not to think about who is to blame for the war. From the moment the nationalist parties started spreading in Bosnia and the barricades went up, I knew it would not end in a nice way. It's so difficult in these mixed marriages now. I really don't know what to think. There have been many Muslims killed by Serbs and, on my father's side, some Serbs killed by Muslims. For myself, I cannot feel like a Muslim or a Serb. I certainly could never take sides against one of my parents. Never."
VESNA KARISIK APPEARS TO BE IN THE MIDDLE. But the middle ground barely exists in the Balkans, eroded by old and new violence, grievances, misunderstandings and sophisticated propaganda perfected over decades of autocratic rule. Vesna lives in a time when things are breaking apart. Truth is elusive. A bold experiment, a multiethnic state born before its time, Yugoslavia is dying very painfully.
The current violence is flashed instantaneously across the world's television screens. But each particular moment of destruction may be the fruit of a complex history that cannot be communicated. I thought of this as I drove back from Vesna's apartment and on past Kalemegdan, the old Ottoman fort long disputed by the Turkish and Austro-Hungarian Empires in this city halfway between Vienna and Istanbul.
Kalemegdan is one of the few traces that remain of the almost-350-year Turkish rule over Serbia, a dominion that turned Islam into the unwitting incubus of this proud people. The Serbs rose up against the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century, leading the march to liberation of the south Slavs as Piedmont led Italy to unification. At the heart of the current Balkan conflict is the Serbian conviction that the breakup of Yugoslavia left Serbs with meager recompense for this and other sacrifices.
These sacrifices were immense during World War I. Perhaps a quarter of the Serbian population died. Under attack from Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, the Serbian Army withdrew in the dead of winter across Albania to the Adriatic. During this epic retreat alone, 70,000 soldiers died. When the Serbs, supported by the French, came back to defeat Austria-Hungary and so help to destroy the Hapsburg Empire, they won a victory that brought Yugoslavia into being.
But Yugoslavia was ill born, skewed by this Serbian triumph. The south Slavs were united, but they were, in some ways, placed under the Serbian yoke. The Croats and Slovenes and Bosnians, who had fought on the side of Austria-Hungary, were joined in a country ruled by the Serbian monarchy in Belgrade. The Serbs, understandably enough, felt that Yugoslavia was their country because they had fought and suffered most for it.
Suffering and sacrifice: the theme is inexhaustible in Belgrade, where a veritable mythology of persecution and self-immolation exists. The tribulations were great. A half-century ago, the Serbs suffered a genocidal onslaught by the puppet-Nazi Croatian Ustashe during World War II, which was particularly devastating in northwestern Bosnia. As the largest population in Yugoslavia, they believed they were misused by Tito, who, they claimed, deliberately emasculated Serbia by creating a separate republic in Macedonia (conquered by Serbia in 1912) and giving self-rule to Kosovo (the cradle of Serbia but now 90 percent Albanian) and Vojvodina (which has a large Hungarian minority).
These were the real or imagined grievances that, from 1987 onward, Slobodan Milosevic was able to whip into the nationalist frenzy that destroyed Yugoslavia. A frenzy that, as the British author Mark Thompson has noted, saw Serbia suddenly "staggering back to its crib self-blinded, cursing the world."
The rampage across Bosnia was historical grievance reinterpreted as the license to murder and -- as Communism was officially disappearing -- the market economy reinterpreted as the license to steal at gunpoint. An onslaught in which all the honor and all the valor of Serbs over at least two centuries were trampled into the oozing Bosnian mud.
And what, I asked myself, did this gracious young woman, Vesna Karisik, and her entire uprooted Sarajevan family, have to do with all this? The retreat to Albania. Milosevic's cynicism. War as a kitsch video clip with militiamen donning the symbols of World War I Serbian royalist officers as they steal the jewelry of Bosnian Muslim women and cart off their kitchens as booty.
I had called on Mihailo Markovic, a dissident intellectual under Tito but now a prominent supporter of Milosevic. He lives in a comfortable Belgrade villa near the former mansion of Tito and the current home of Milosevic. It was all a mistake, he ventured. Yugoslavia was an impossible country. It was an attempt to forge a transnational entity when the peoples inside it -- Serbs, Croats, Slovenes and others -- had been delivered from empire but had not yet gone through the necessary historical phase of the nation-state.
So, I asked myself, the Muslim Zecevic and Muslim-Serbian Karisik families had been wrong to believe in Yugoslavia? Wrong to believe that the United States, which played a decisive role in creating Yugoslavia, would seriously strive to preserve it? Wrong to think that Serbian concentration camps would not be tolerated by a modern world where everything is immediately visible? Perhaps.
But this much seems clear: the modern world is a weightless place, easily distracted, restlessly diverted, more inclined to zap from channel to channel than to grasp that the dark tribal tide that swept this European family away came from the depths of time and has not been tamed. Not by the United States, the United Nations or anyone else. The apogee of its bloody cresting may therefore still lie ahead.
HARIS ZECEVIC IS remembering. In a dimly lighted Chinese joint in Detroit where kids do karaoke. A long way from home. Remembering what it was like to become a Bosnian warrior in Sarajevo and then to watch his younger brother, Muris, die.
His first weapon was his father's hunting rifle. It wasn't a question of loving Bosnia, he says. Or hating Bosnia. It was a question of survival. There were two choices: stand in front of the Serbs or let them in and get killed. He took the rifle.
He'd hardly ever fired a bullet before. But there was this strange feeling. Of the gun conferring authority. Of adrenaline and being invulnerable. "But if you bite too much," he says, "you're in trouble. And if you're pushing your luck, it's going to happen sooner or later."
So they were up there, on Trebevic mountain, pushing their luck. It was August, hot. Four months into the war and they were beginning to get organized. The hunting rifles had given way to automatic weapons, and they had one 12.7-millimeter machine gun. A group of Sarajevan kids -- what passed for the Bosnian Army.
Their commander, Bego Poturic, a mountain man, a hunter, was down in Sarajevo. They'd been up there too long, the Serbs knew their position; they were expecting the order to withdraw. But Poturic returned with an order to hold the trench overlooking the Pale-Lukavica road. Nobody knows who gave these instructions.
Haris was responsible for the schedule: he could decide who would go to the exposed trench, who would remain at their base in the old Austro-Hungarian observatory. "I kept Muris out," he says. "But he came to me, insisting on going to the trench with his friend Tarik Kapetanovic. You couldn't stop Muris. I had to redo the whole schedule to fit them in."
Then, in the late afternoon, it started. From his position at the observatory, Haris watched the Serbian mortar shells going in, near the trench, around the trench. Where exactly? There was so much dust rising, he could not see. He thought of the trench. It was strong. Big logs laid one on top of the other. Some rocks, some blankets, piles of earth. They should be all right. No way of getting there to see, the fire was too intense.
It is well past nightfall before the shelling eases and Haris can make his way over there. He can't see much. He takes the hand of the first man. It's cold. Somehow, he feels, in the dark, there's no life left in the trench.
Then he makes out Tarik's head -- with a gaping hole in the middle of it. He tries to pull him out, but a log has fallen over him. Haris calls for help. Some other men take over. He never does see his brother. But later they tell him that there wasn't much left of him to see.
"I thought, why Muris, not me?" Haris says. "I'm older, supposed to take care of him. That night, up there, when the shelling started again, I was really scared."
Guilt, rage, fear: they have wrapped themselves in a tight knot inside Haris Zecevic. To survive in America, he has sealed Bosnia inside him. Nobody would understand anyway. So he has tried to take on this big, new country with a certain bravado. But sometimes the pain creeps back.
How is he to tell his mother and father? Haris comes down the mountain the next morning, looking for somebody with a sedative when he meets a friend, who tells him that word of Muris's death is already out. His mother, when she sees the faces of the men who come to inform her, simply asks, "Which one of them is dead?"
She was brave, she did not cry much or scream. His father fell very silent. "He just keeps quiet," Haris says. "Keeps it inside. That is what I'm afraid of. So many people went nuts and my father's the only one I have left. I have to get him out of there."
Since Muris's death, Haris says, he has never had a dream that he remembered.
WHEN HIS MOTHER, BISERA, was killed, just over a year after Muris, Haris couldn't cry. He had cried for his brother. He wanted to for his mother. But all he could do was gasp for air. Nothing would come out of his eyes. "It's not that something in me is destroyed," he says. "I guess it's that most of me is destroyed." Haris believes that if he had stayed in Sarajevo, his mother might still be alive. The belief is probably irrational, but it is persistent.
At the time his mother was killed, Haris had been in America for just two weeks. Broken by Muris's death, troubled by thievery and greed among soldiers and officers in the Bosnian Army and obviously scared, he says he won the Government's permission to leave and escaped from Sarajevo in February 1993. He ran across the United Nations-controlled airport at night. Eventually, his application to the United States Refugee Resettlement Office in Croatia was approved. On July 27, 1993, Haris flew from Zagreb to Detroit, where he was met by a Bosnian immigrant and old friend of the family, Nino Cernovrsanin.
Although his mother died on Aug. 11, Haris did not find out until early September. There were no phone lines to Sarajevo. When Cernovrsanin told him he had bad news, Haris echoed his mother's words: "Which of my parents is dead?"
When he found it was his mother, he says something in his head crashed for a while. All he could think of was returning to Sarajevo, somehow, to exact some kind of revenge. "I was out of my mind," he says. "If I had gone back then I would have killed the first Serb I found and you would not be talking to me here today."
His mother was killed at the age of 52 by Serbian machine-gun fire. She was trying to follow her son's route across the airport at night -- the only way out of the encircled city. Suffocating under the siege, terribly wounded by Muris's death, this highly strung woman had decided to risk her life to reach Butmir, an area west of the city where the Zecevic family had a country house.
It was to this house in Butmir that the family used to go every year to celebrate Bairam, the Bosnian Muslim feast that marks the end of the Ramadan period of fasting. Only part of the Zecevic family fasted, but they always organized a big party for Bairam. Asim would buy a lamb and his sons would help him skewer it on a spit. Then they would dig a pit and light a fire over which they slowly cooked the animal. These parties -- to which about 15 people would come -- are now among the rare moments that Haris still remembers when the family was together and happy. The vacations on the Dalmatian coast that his father recalls with great fondness appear to have been blotted from his mind.
Bisera Zecevic was about 55 yards short of the Butmir side of the airfield when a United Nations personnel carrier beamed a spotlight on her. "She was not guilty of anything," Haris says. "She just wanted to get some food and some air. She had some memories, she wanted to get over to Butmir. She'd been in a cage for over a year. What would you do?
"And then some United Nations soldier who probably doesn't even know what he's doing points a beam at her and makes her a target."
The United Nations tookcontrol of Sarajevo airport in the summer of 1992, under an agreement with the Serbs. It has seen stopping Sarajevans from escaping across the airfield as part of the exercise of that control. But the fact that Bisera Zecevic was shot dead with the help of the United Nations while trying to escape from the surrounded capital of a state recognized by the United Nations underlines all the ambiguities and problems of the peacekeeping mission. A mission that has fed people, when possible, so, in the words of cynical Sarajevans, fattening people for the slaughter. A mission that has been a divided international community's way of trying to contain the Bosnian war while shying away from the bold steps needed to resolve it.
It seems Haris Zecevic is probably wrong when he says he could have saved his mother. After Muris's death, Asim and Bisera could not sleep at night. They would sit by the window, smoking, waiting. There was little to eat, nowhere to go. Like her dead son, Bisera was willful. She was boiling inside. But she never showed anyone how she was suffering.
Only when friends would come around unannounced during the day would they catch a glimpse of her pain. They would find her in tears. She was still working for an import-export company. But her sense of claustrophobia was overwhelming. She wanted to see the house that would remind her of Muris. When she announced that she was going to try to escape across the airfield to Butmir, her sister-in-law, Fida Karisik, urged Asim to forbid her to go.
"Don't you make conflict in my home," Bisera said. "I have decided to go and that is the end of it."
Before she left on the night of Aug. 11, she asked Fida to promise to take care of Asim. It appears that she knew exactly what was awaiting her.
DETROIT IS WEIRD. You drive 70 miles in a day, on highways that cross each other at right angles, and that's normal. Nothing takes the place of the Sarajevo coffee shop where pleasure is found in idle conversation with friends encountered by chance on streets that snake around the hills. Where wisdom is slowly gleaned as coffee grains dissolve in the mouth, from watching the way the shadows fall and the way the same place moves through the seasons. But after life in a dirt trench, weirdness is a relative thing.
So Haris Zecevic is getting the hang of it, this Detroit, this United States of America. He started out in Clinton Township, a grim place. Since then he's been on the move: Dearborn, Hamtramck, Madison Heights. But he's mostly managed to stay out of downtown Detroit, a place he describes with the Bosnian phrase "pojesti ce te mrak" -- "the darkness will eat you."
He's had four cars. Smashed the first one after two weeks -- an '85 Thunderbird bought for $3,000. Next came a $200 Buick. But that broke down after two weeks. So he walked to work for a while or found lifts with friends, before buying a Mazda and finally his $12,000 Ford Probe.
"It's weird," says Haris. "Here, you can't work, you can't do anything if you don't have a car. No public transport, nothing, zero! In Sarajevo they can't understand it."
He worked for a while in Cernovrsanin's metal-processing shop but tired of that. He then found work in the company of Cernovrsanin's son-in-law, a genial Anglo-Indian named Previn Mistry, who moved from London a couple of years ago. Haris works with lasers precise enough to cut a hole in a human hair without burning the hair. He programs robots that use computer-directed lasers to weld car parts, earning $27,000 a year -- better pay than most of the 1,000 or so other Bosnian Muslim refugees in the Detroit area.
"After Haris's mother died, you could see the strain he was under," Mistry says. "So I tried to structure a situation where he had to move forward. Haris is very computer literate. He's fast. But he's not studying enough. You see, I want to turn him into a professional."
On a mild March day, it's hot in Haris's one-bedroom apartment. The place costs $485 a month and the central heating can't be regulated. He's shaved himself now and made a bad job of it -- there are cuts all over his neck.
His wife, Vildana, is pregnant. She was Haris's longtime girlfriend in Sarajevo. He managed to get her out through a humanitarian agency in April 1994. She arrived in the United States on June 21, 1994, almost a year after Haris, and they were married the following November.
Now Haris complains that Vildana does not understand him, his need to make a career, his need to spend $12,000 on a Ford Probe that goes fast enough to provide him with a shot of adrenaline, his financial problems, his worries over the baby and over his father in Sarajevo, his sense of suffocation.
Vildana is concerned about money and is philosophical about Haris's fast-changing moods. She is still lost, here in the middle of America. "I still think I'm in Sarajevo and the rest is a dream," she says. She gets up and turns off the television.
The television has been bought on credit. So has the stereo system and the furniture. Vildana also has a car that Haris has leased. He has been learning fast about the American dream. He has Visa, American Express and various store credit cards. He's 26, heavily in debt, trying to make a life, with Bosnia buried inside him.
There's a Bosnian party in Hamtramck, a Polish-dominated township in northeastern Detroit, and Haris decides to go. The place smells of Bosnia: the cigarette smoke, the beer, the plum brandy, the lamb. There is a pall of weariness and pain, too, detectable amid the loud good cheer and the laughter. A Bosnian fleur-de-lis -- like the one in Haris's Sarajevo apartment -- is draped over the television.
Haris greets Nedzad Stukan, who lost one of his legs at Mostar. And Ramiz Gigic, who got shrapnel in his eyes in Sarajevo and now has 20 percent vision left in one eye. They're lucky: they're alive and they're out of there.
Cernovrsanin comes up to me. "Things can't get better," he says accusingly, "until we are all back in our homes." This remark sets the tone. I see, quickly enough, that at this gathering I am the representative of America's betrayal of Bosnia.
Somebody asks why America won't give the Bosnians weapons, but Haris steps in. "Let's cut the [expletive]," he says. "We ain't ever going to change anything with all this talk. This war's gone too far now. Unless the United States is ready to give us Muslims two million green cards, the end will only come when one of the armies is beaten."
LATER, WE GO AND SEE Ekrem Sorguc, a friend of Haris's and another Bosnian Muslim refugee living in Hamtramck. He was rounded up by the Serbs in Hadzici, west of Sarajevo, on May 14, 1992. They took him from his home and marched him off to a camp in the former Hadzici sports center, just as three-quarters of a million Muslims were marched off, early in the war, from the 70 percent of Bosnia now held by the Serbs.
In the camp, Sorguc saw men beaten and bleeding who were forced to suck their own blood from the floor without leaving a drop. He saw a Serbian guard trying to prize the wedding ring from a man's finger before losing patience and simply cutting off the finger. He saw other prisoners forced at gunpoint to perform fellatio. He saw people taken away to be executed. All this to the refrain of, "This is Serbia" or "You're not Muslims, you're Serbs who converted."
From Hadzici, Sorguc was taken to other prisons. Eventually he was freed in a prisoner exchange and got out of Bosnia with his family. Now, they live in a ground-floor apartment rented to them by a Serb, Dragan Vranes, who lost all his family in World War II -- massacred by the Ustashe -- and immigrated to America in 1972. He has six houses in Hamtramck and has done a great deal to help Muslims arriving in Detroit. His acts amount to a sort of living proof of the folly of Bosnia's destruction. "I don't care who is who," he says. "What have I got against them or anybody?"
This American Serb has a decorating company and knows everyone in Hamtramck. He finds televisions for the Muslim refugees, eases them out of scrapes with the police, shows them around the cheaper supermarkets and lends them money.
"Haris lost everything," Vranes says. "But he thinks too much about over there. There's nothing to do about it. The first thing is to try to forget that thing over there. He can't concentrate and he don't need that stress."
ASIM ZECEVIC HAS a room with a view. From his dentist's studio in the center of Sarajevo he can see Trebevic mountain and, he insists, the actual spot where his son Muris was killed. When the war is over -- and the end, he says, will be military and not political -- he will go and visit the spot.
Like many Sarajevans, he tries to keep up appearances. He always wears a tie and a small gold tiepin in the form of the Bosnian fleur-de-lis. He is punctual about his work and he never raises his voice. But his skin sags. He is sometimes unshaven, and his eyes are often blank. When he is asked how he is, he always says, "Very well." Then he smiles wearily to himself. Occasionally, he confesses that he cannot sleep at night and that he suffers from pains in his shoulder.
His family has been in Sarajevo for at least five generations. Now he hardly recognizes the city. There has been the destruction, of course. But also a vast influx of refugees who do not know the city's manners. Cemeteries and vegetable gardens have spread all over the place, wooden graves and sprouting onions where city parks used to be.
Muris has been dead for three years. Bisera for two years. He has not seen Haris for two and a half years. Fifty-six years old, he is alone with his sister, Fida, and his old mother, Hasnja. Sometimes he drinks a brandy or two at breakfast. Sometimes, gazing at family photographs, he seems very far away. "A man can suffer a lot," he says. "The outer limit of what a man can stand is not yet known."
On the 3d of every month, he goes to Muris's grave; on the 11th, to Bisera's. The graves are close to each other, in one of the cemeteries that rise above Bascarsija, the old Turkish quarter where the shells are crashing again these summer months. On his son's grave is written, "Muris Zecevic (Sehit) 1971-1992." A "sehit" is a hero and martyr.
This is a land where fathers bury their sons. They tend the plots around the wooden graves. Here, where the men are buried, none of the dead are more than 30 years old. Asim Zecevic stands there, in prayer, his arms outstretched, his palms turned upward, in a gesture that is at once humble and infinitely imploring.
Higher up, there is the grave of his wife. From here, there is a magnificent view down into the encircled city, down through the old white stone graves with their turbanlike bulbous tops, past the newer wooden graves, on to the town itself with its mingled minarets and church steeples and, beyond them, the high-rises of Dobrinja, built for the 1984 Olympics.
It is still a magnificent town, Sarajevo, cradled by the mountains. Despite the 40 months spent under assault, some vestige of the city's fabric remains, a fabric of civility and courage and tolerance. Perhaps, in the end, this is what all these Bosnian boys died for.
Asim begins the long trudge home. "This is my style," he says, "calm on the outside, inside a storm." Then he looks up to the mountains, where the Serbian gunners lurk. "Those people up there, I trusted them," he says, gesturing to the hills. "Now they want the Muslims to disappear. But we will not go away. We cannot take peace at any price. We paid a very high price, so we cannot sell this country so cheaply."
Back at home, he settles wearily into his armchair. It is late June and the boom of shelling resounds through Sarajevo's valley. Fida is there. She has not heard from her daughters in Belgrade for months and she is worried. Asim is concerned about getting the necessary papers to visit Detroit. Their mother, Hasnja, spry and wise, brings coffee. Haris, she says, should come back home when the war is over because it is sad to be in a foreign country, better to be at home.
Then they all start to tell the story of the birth of Haris and Vildana's son. The telephone rang in complete darkness. There is no electricity in Sarajevo. Fida stumbled toward the phone. Then Asim heard Fida screaming for joy. He said, "You don't need a phone, they can hear you in America." He groped toward the phone and Haris said, "Dad, you've got a grandson."
Asim, who is laughing as he recounts this, says he then tried to sit down, but the chair fell over and he landed on the floor on top of his 83-year-old mother who was also trying to reach the phone in the darkness. She injured her leg, Asim his back, and they all talked until the sun came up. "I heard my great-grandson's voice on the phone," Hasnja says. "I was crying."
The boy was born in Detroit on June 2, 1995. He is an American citizen. His name is Muris Zecevic.

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
REMEMBER banks -- those imposing marble Greek Revival-style temples found in every downtown, usually not far from a similarly solid and conservative structure called City Hall? How about bank branches or savings and loan offices -- those modest, modernist buildings that often dispensed money like Big Macs at drive-up windows?
Slowly, almost imperceptibly, banks seem to be vanishing from the American architectural landscape, both in cities and in the suburbs. No, they aren't disappearing as fast as old-fashioned movie theaters, department stores or other soon-to-be relics of 20th century commercial real estate. They are, though, frequently being shut down, sold, subleased, re-leased or remodeled for new uses, ranging from the merely unusual (restaurants and rug stores) to the highky unlikely (houses of worship and wine cellars.) 
 The evolution has occurred the most, perhaps, in the Northeast, where the financial-services sector of the economy has shrunk substantially over the last decade, in part, ironically, because of the turbulence in the region's real estate market in the late 80's and early 90's.
In some cases, though, especially in cities, when a bank closes, the physical carcass, sadly, is of landmark quality or close, and any new usage may seem somewhat incongruous, lacking the dignity usually associated with these magisterial buildings.
The former American Savings Bank, for instance, at 103 East 15th Street in Manhattan, is a neglected neo-Classical tomb with the entabulature of Union Square Bank above its doors. The new owners have announced plans to turn it into a restaurant and music club called the House of Blues, which, to some developers still reeling from the credit crunch a few years back, may not be an inappropriate name for a bank.
The former East River Savings Bank at 22 Cortland Street in Lower Manhattan was built in 1934 by the architects Walker & Gillette in the Art Deco style and is often referred to as one of the best buildings of the period in New York. The building is today a Century 21 department store.
Then there is the former New York Bank for Savings at 81 Eighth Avenue, at 14th Street, later a Gold Dome Bank, a 99-year-old, 40,000-square-foot building that has a copper domed roof, walls sheathed in travertine and antique chandeliers. The building is now Central Carpet, which is, according to the store's owners, who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars restoring the property, "the Grand Palais of Rugs."
"It's better than being demolished," said Clark Strickland, president of the Preservation League of New York State, which is based Albany, in reference to 81 Eighth Avenue.
The number of banks has declined substantially over the last 10 years in the New York metropolitan region, in part because of mergers and acquisitions, in part because of the failure of many savings and loans and in part because of automation, particularly the ubiquitous automated teller machine, which has eliminated entire branches, as well as thousands of teller jobs.
Thrift institutions, as savings and loans are often known, have been hit much harder than banks. There were 38 thrifts and 195 branches at the end of 1984 in Connecticut, according to the Federal Office of Thrift Supervision. A decade later there were 13 thrifts and 101 branches. In New Jersey the number of thrifts fell to 69 from 139 over the same period and the number of branches fell to 556 from 861. In New York, the number of thrifts fell to 66 from 93 and the number of branches to 517 from 732.
Even large banks, however, have cut back the number of branches they operate. When Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust merged in 1991, they had about 440 branches in New York. Today, the combined company has about 275 branches. More consolidations -- rumors of a merger between Chemical and Chase Manhattan have been widely reported in recent days -- could close scores more branches.
Nevertheless, branches are not likely to disappear, replaced by ATM terminals and on-line banking systems. In fact, nationally, the number of bank branches, excluding thrift institutions, has increased over the last 10 years because of continuing expansion in the south, Midwest and the Rocky Mountain region.
"There continues to be a great need for the branches," said Ken Herz, a spokesman for Chemical Bank. "We will always maintain a very large branch network. Branches continue to be important not just to individual customers but also to small businesses."
Citibank has even opened six branches in Connecticut in the last three years. "We are going to look for more locations," said Susan Weeks, a spokeswoman for Citibank. "So no -- branch banking is not dead."
And some bank branches that close reopen as other banks. Chemical Bank recently gave away a building it closed in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn to a small credit union there, the Central Brooklyn Federal Credit Union.
Most banks lease their suburban locations and own their older buildings. When a decision is made to close down a branch, a lease can have as little as a few months to run or as long as 20 years. Rents run the gamut from $15 a square foot to $200 a square foot. "Like anything else, location is everything," said Richard E. Lucia, senior director for corporate retail properties at Chemical Bank.
Suburban bank branches have been re-leased for myriad uses, ranging from dry cleaners to t-shirt shops to churches. A former Connecticut National Bank branch in Monroe, Conn., became the Sunday School and youth center for the Stepney Baptist Church in 1991.
"We don't use the drive-up windows for church purposes -- there is no one there to collect money," said Pastor Bill Minser. "We pass the offering plate for that."
"We also like that fact that this building is air-conditioned," he added. "That wouldn't necessarily be the case if it were 150 years old."
Climate control is a real consideration when leasing a former bank. Alfred A. Mirin, an associate at CB Commercial Real Estate Group in Stamford, Conn., said that the larger older banks were difficult to heat and cool because of the high ceilings, and the floors were often slabs of marble that were difficult to remove to put in new plumbing. "It is not necessarily an easy sell," he said.
Suburban banks in high-traffic locations and those with drive-in facilities are the easiest to lease. "In today's world, anything with a drive-through is a hot commodity," said Jonathan K. Putnam, director of the Hartford office of Cushman & Wakefield, the commercial real estate broker.
"I have seen a drive-through D'Angelos and a drive-through Boston Chicken, places that in the past I have never seen a drive-through," he added, referring to two fast-food chains that usually do not have drive-through windows but have leased former bank buildings with such facilities.
He said that new drive-throughs are often hard to establish these days because of local land restrictions. And the best locations have already been taken. "They are hot pieces of real estate," Mr. Putnam said. "Generally, what you are finding, though, is that banks are trying to dump the bad locations not the good ones."
He noted that Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's have been seeking out former banks in which to locate franchises. He said a Dunkin' Donuts recently moved into a former Bank of Hartford in Cromwell, Conn., and a McDonald's recently received permission to buy an old Gateway Bank in Fairfield, Conn.
"Banks are good sites for retrofitting," said Dominick Musilli, a McDonald's real estate representative based in Windsor, Conn.
He said the vault in the Fairfield bank branch would become restrooms and the teller counters would become fast-food counters. The Fairfield Planning and Zoning Commission, however, has turned down requests from the restaurant to use the drive-in windows. "We are appealing that decision," Mr. Musilli said.
Older bank buildings can be more difficult sells. There are curently two former banks on the market in downtown Stamford, Mr. Mirin said, and one has been vacant for three-and-half years. "They are trophy properties," he said. "They would be great for a museum, but how many museums are there?"
"Restaurants love them too, but the restaurant business is having a hard time," he added.
One bank that became a restaurant was the former People's Bank headquarters in Bridgeport, Conn., a traditional bank structure with columns, marble floors and vaulted ceilings. Last year it became Roberto's, a pizza parlor.
"It's just awesome," said Robert Mirafiore, the owner, "especially the 40-foot ceilings.".
The restaurant uses the former vault as a bar and service area. "People go up to the vault to get their drinks," Mr. Mirafiore said.
One of the most difficult tasks in retrofitting a bank, particularly an older one, is dealing with the vault. With their thick concrete walls and steel doors, they can weigh several tons. "It can be an obstacle," Mr. Lucia said. "But if it's in the basement, as it often is, then it is less of an obstacle, as the door can usually be taken off and the vault used for storage."
Vaults in newer banks are quite different from the old-fashioned round or oval steel-and-brass variety with one or more combination locks and a door handle like a ship's wheel. More modern vaults are modular, meaning they can be dismantled fairly easily. They also tend to have walls reinforced with inch-thick steel rather than the 18 inches of concrete in older banks. "It has the same strength rating," Mr. Lucia said.
Some new tenants have found innovative uses for the old decorative vault doors, if not the vaults themselves. At Fidelity Investments in Boston, which is based in an old Shawmut Bank headquarters, two vault doors have been laid on a wooden base for use as a conference table.
Sometimes, the entire vault is left in place and used as a marketing tool. In East Hampton, L.I., the Coach Leatherware Factory Outlet, which is housed in a former bank building, uses its vault for a small art gallery featuring local artists.
"It was too expensive to have the door removed and the space was odd, so they got creative and put in an art gallery about three years ago," said Amy Pierson, salesperson at the store.
At Rothman's, a men's clothing store at 17th Street and Park Avenue in Manhattan, the priciest suits are kept in a 20-foot-by-30-foot vault. (The dressing room is the old safety-deposit-box room, but without the boxes.)
"A lot of customers come in and say, 'I only shop in the vault,' " said Ken Giddon, president of Rothman's.
Mr. Giddon said that to remove just the vault door would have cost at least $10,000; the building was a Chase Manhattan Bank until 1985. "A lot of these vaults were dropped in when the buildings were built, and getting them out is very problematic no matter what your budget," he said. "It is, essentially, a huge cement and steel box that is part of the structure and support of the building."
Keeping the vault -- usually about 12 feet by 18 feet in size -- and using it for storage or display has its costs, too, though. "We had to get sprinklers, and we spent about $2,000 to make it a legal room," Mr. Giddon said.
Lane Brettschneider of Lane's Floor Coverings & Interiors in Manhattan received an estimate of $250,000 three years ago to remove the vault at the space they now lease at 2 Park Avenue, which used to be a Chemical Bank branch.
They have also tried -- and failed -- to sell the vault to anyone interested for $5,000, plus removal. "It's a joke," Mr. Brettschneider said.
In the meantime, Mr. Brettschneider, an oenophile, has turned the space into a combination carpet sample library and wine cellar containing about 40 single bottles and 50 unopened cases. The two rooms are separated by a Plexiglas wall, so carpet-book browsers in the library can also gaze at the wine, which is kept chilled at 58 degrees, at the other end of the vault.
"We hold wine tastings with our seminars on floor coverings," Mr. Brettschneider said. "It is a way for us to get architects in here and hear us talk about floor coverings. When they hear we are serving a 1978 Petrus, it brings them right in."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: The Brooklyn Academy of Music;
Restoring the Crown to a 1908 Queen of a Building

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
OVER four decades, many people have winced and averted their eyes as they passed the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where the removal of the 1908 building's delicate terra-cotta cornice in 1953 created a painful sight.
In a city of preservation successes, it was an awful wound. 
 But as it turns out, this scar itself is impermanent: The Academy of Music is going to replace the cornice.
The Academy was established in 1859 in Brooklyn Heights by a group of citizens to provide a home for opera, concerts, public meetings and other events.
In 1903 a committee raised $1 million to construct a new building farther out at Lafayette Avenue between Ashland Place and St. Felix Street, near elevated lines and the Flatbush terminal of the Long Island Rail Road.
A new Academy was a source of great concern to Brooklyn, especially because the City of Brooklyn became part of New York City in 1898, which "threatened the very existence of its distinctive civic life" as the magazine Architecture wrote in 1908.
Herts & Tallant produced an early scheme, a grand, stone monument comparable to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They worked out an ingenious and compact plan, a side-by-side opera house (with 2,217 seats) and concert hall (with 1,406 seats), sharing a huge rectangular foyer fronting on Lafayette Avenue and, above, a similarly sized room that served as a banquet hall and ballroom.
Fortunately, Herts & Tallant's original exterior was scaled down for reasons of cost. Their first design mimicked many of the city's civic monuments of the time, but there is nothing in New York like the revised scheme, which deftly mixes grand scale and intelligent economy.
The final work is of soft, cream-colored brick, lightly varied as if salvaged from some ancient ruin, and mixed with some of the best terra-cotta work in the city. The main doorways are surrounded by alternating panels of musical instruments and rondels of small carved figures. These figures -- a chorister, piper, triangle player, and others -- grimace, they sing, they reach, they blow, all with lifelike and expressive individuality. They look like they were modeled from life on some unruly kindergarten choir.
The names of composers are bracketed by soft criss-cross patterns at the ends of the building, and sophisticated terra-cotta work punctuates the rest of the building, including lions' heads with red tongues at the cornice.
It is the rich contrast between the soft, rippling brick walls and the luscious detail of the terra cotta -- produced by Atlantic Terra Cotta -- that gives this building a stature comparable to more ambitious limestone monuments.
Besides the exterior, there was another change in design. In July 1908 the trustees told Henry B. Herts that some of the undraped figures in the ballroom might make Brooklyn's leading citizens blush, and had him add some coverings. The architect minimized the incident to The New York Tribune: "A fig leaf here, a laurel wreath there and the air of respectability thereby attained was astonishing. The committee was perfectly right in asking to have the figures draped."
But Architecture felt sure that the volatile, high-living Herts was not properly quoted.
"Do you know Harry Herts?" the magazine wrote. "Well if you do you can possibly imagine what he said."
The new Academy opened for inspection on Sept. 16, 1908, when 10,000 people crowded through its halls, many no doubt looking for fig leaves and laurel wreaths.
PETER CASLER, director of capital projects for the Academy, said the cornice was a constant problem, with repeated repair campaigns even in the 20's. In 1953 the architects Brown, Lawford & Forbes, with Tuck & Eipel, engineers, made alterations to the building, including cleaning the facade but also removing the cornice, replacing it with a plain wall.
The loss of the cornice has seemed immutable, even as the Brooklyn Academy of Music experienced a remarkable revival beginning in the 60's. "The Queen of England without a hat" is how Elliot Willensky and Norval White described the loss in the 1988 edition of the A.I.A. Guide to New York City. But now the Academy has the engineers Robert Silman Associates and the Stein Partnership, architects, designing a replacement cornice in fiberglass, designed to exactly match the missing work.
Last month the Academy received general approval for the $800,000 restoration from the Landmarks Preservation Commission. This is part of a projected multiyear, multimillion-dollar renovation of the building, which will include many internal improvements as well.
"Historic integrity and state-of-the-art interiors -- we think that's what will make the greatest facility," says Karen Hopkins, executive vice president of the Academy.

In Elizabeth, Dusting Off an Art Deco Treasure

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: ELIZABETH

 BODY:
Standing above the discount stores and fast-food restaurants of Broad Street, Hersh Tower is a throwback to another era. Its facade is an elegant mix of pale brick, black marble and nickel. Its lobby is an Art Deco showpiece, with terrazzo floors, marble walls and elaborate grill work.
 The 14-story bulding languished through a number of owners and an economic malaise that has plaqued Elizabeth for decades. But the lastest owners, two brothers who own a real estate company in New York City, have renovated Hersh Tower, hoping to attract new businesses to the city.
 "The historical value of this building interested us, and the proximity to New York interested us," said Edward Wydra, one of the new owners. "We think it could be a very viable building."
 Hersh Tower was the tallest bulding in Elizabeth when Louis Hersh, an Elizabeth businessman, built it in 1931. (These days, only the Union County Court building is taller.) At the corner of Broad and East Grand Streets, it was brimming with law offices, insurance agencies and other businesses for decades.
 But tenants fled as the building fell into disrepair, and by the 1980's it was almost empty. A bank foreclosed on the bulding in 1990, and three years later, the Wydras took over the $3.4 million mortgage. Since then they have spent more than $1 million on renovations. Among other things, they have replaced the elevators, polished the marble for the first time in 64 years, and replaced silver leaf in the lobby.
 Because Hersh Tower is within Elizabeth's Urban Enterprise Zone, new tenants can benefit from tax incentives and other forms of state aid. It is only 45 percent occupied, but the Wydras said they are confident that the building, with its views of the Manhattan skyline and proximity to the Elizabeth train station, will attract more businesses.
 "This town is going to come back booming," Edward Wydra said. "There's a new energy coming that's going to turn this place around."
 Meanwhile, the Wydras have a backup plan: last week, they registered the building with the Union County Film Commission so that it might be used for a movie set someday.

10 Days to Takeoff for a New Airline and a Dormant Airport

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: EWING TOWNSHIP

 BODY:
The sign outside the Trenton-Mercer Airport building says "Airport Terminal." It might as well say "Grand Opening."
On Aug. 16, Eastwind Airlines is to become the first commercial jet carrier to call Trenton home and New Jersey's first new airline since Kiwi International Air Lines started in Newark in September 1992. 
 It is a risky endeavor: of the 47 airlines that have started in the United States since 1990, only 27 are now operating. But if Eastwind survives, it will help revitalize a moribund, almost anonymous airport that hasn't had a commercial jet flight since 1992 and is better known for the General Quarters restaurant inside the terminal than anything to do with aviation.
And a successful airline would give Mercer County, which is reeling from a succession of factory closings, something tangible to claim as its own, much the way people have embraced the Trenton Thunder minor-league baseball team.
"This gives us one more identity, just like the baseball stadium has," said Robert D. Prunetti, the County Executive. "It is sort of a boost, if not materially right now, then certainly psychologically."
County and state officials are doing their best to trumpet Eastwind's debut. On Aug. 15, Governor Whitman is to preside at a ribbon-cutting ceremony, complete with tours of Eastwind's two Boeing 737-200 jets and souvenir pins of the Eastwind mascot, a bumblebee wearing sunglasses.
The next day, Eastwind plans to begin its (what else?) "Bee Line" service: two flights a day to Boston (at 7:55 A.M. and 2 P.M.) and one to Greensboro, N.C. (5:15 P.M.). The fares -- $53 each way to Boston, $63 each way to Greensboro -- are more than 30 percent below those of other carriers in Newark and Philadelphia. Eastwind hopes to provide service to Florida by Christmas, said Richard R. Haller, its vice president of marketing.
History is not on Eastwind's, or Trenton's, side. United Airlines had daily jet service from Trenton to Chicago via Allentown, Pa., from 1983 to 1986 but stopped because too many passengers preferred Newark and Philadelphia. USAir flew to Pittsburgh in 1991 and 1992 but stopped because the average flight was less than 30 percent full.
In a business whose highest industrywide profit margin in any year is 2.5 percent, most start-up airlines fail. The reasons are manifold: bad management, unpredictable economy, rising costs. Yet more and more people want to be involved, in part because there is a certain glamour associated with the business, said Mark L. Gerchick, acting assistant secretary of the Federal Department of Transportation. In 1990, two companies applied to start new airlines; last year, 24 applied.
But some analysts say now might be a decent time to try. The economy is strong, fuel costs are down, and the collapse of major carriers like Pan Am and Eastern has left some room for smaller players.
"It's always hard starting up an airline," said Ray Neidl, an airline analyst at Furman Selz in New York, "but I think probably the strategy Eastwind is trying is a good one: keep costs low, find a market niche, stay away from the big guys."
Eastwind has been two years in the planning, the brainchild of its president, James E. McNally Jr., who previously worked as a consultant to troubled airlines for the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. It is a subsidiary of UM Holdings Ltd., a privately held company in Haddonfield with interests in fitness equipment, medical services and real estate.
Eastwind officials won't say how much money it needed to start. But it usually takes $10 million to $20 million to start an airline, said Barbara Beyer, president of Avmark Inc., an airline consulting concern in Rosslyn, Va.
To succeed, Eastwind intends to mimic Southwest and Valujet, which emphasize rock-bottom fares and no-frills service -- but not People Express, which expanded too fast and finally collapsed.
"People get jet fuel in their veins and they want to grow quicker, but in my viewpoint, bigger is not necessarily better," Mr. McNally said. "You have to keep your eye on the bottom line and the balance sheet."
And the potential, as well. Two million people live within 30 minutes of the airport, which is just off Interstate 95. And although Mercer County has lost thousands of jobs in recent months, the New Brunswick-to-Trenton corridor still has blue-chip employers like Princeton University, Johnson & Johnson, Merrill Lynch and Dow Jones.
To encourage Eastwind to tap that potential, the county received $300,000 from the state to renovate the airport. It repainted the passenger areas, bought metal detectors and a baggage carousel, and even changed the name of the airport from Mercer County Airport to Trenton-Mercer Airport. But the parking is still free.
To break even, Eastwind needs to fill 45 percent of its seats; for now, the airline hopes to reach one-third of capacity. And while it has been a little tough informing people that there is, indeed, a Trenton airport, the company says it is confident.
"We have to get people used to getting out of this airport because right now, this airport is like an imaginary place," said Thomas H. Paine Jr., an Eastwind spokesman. "It's a short-term problem, but a long-term advantage because we'll be here first."

Paying Child Support

 BODY:
The New Jersey Supreme Court has rejected a divorced father's argument that his child-support payments be reduced so he could spend the money as he saw fit when he cared for his children. Is this fair, or not?
 
Saving for the Future 
 The words "as he sees fit" bother me with children involved. If he is spending all the money, will there be something left to save for future plans, such as college or career training? I agree with the Supreme Court ruling that his payments should not be reduced. In an age where inflation overtakes fixed payments, it is unlikely that any of the money will be squandered, if that is his fear.

 I work with a gentleman who is paying child support for three children to his ex-wife. The oldest girl, who is 14, ran away from her mother to live with him. He started to protest the fact that he was still required to pay child support to her for a child now living with him. His ex-wife threatened to take him back to court for alimony if he continued his protests. I have no problems with the mandate that a father pay support for his children (in fact, I think any respectable person would do it without a court order), but situations such as this have got to be stopped. Where will it end?

A Frightening Prospect
 Hurray for the New Jersey Supreme Court. Having noncustodial parents be allowed to reduce their monthly payments so that they can spend the money as they see fit scares the living daylights out of me. This recent ruling supports women's rights as parents, not to mention our right to reasonably exist.

Protect the Children
 The man who brings a child into this world and refuses to support him or her or thinks he can cut back on it should have wages garnished by courts until the child is 21 years of age. And if he refuses to work, his unemployment and welfare payments should be sent to the children.
DAN DERNBACH
Leicester, N.Y.
 
Paying Extra on Visits
 The noncustodial parent, usually the father, pays his share to the mother. The hidden assumption is that the father spends no other money on his children. But for a father who wants to be involved with his kids and who fights to secure a reasonable visitation arrangement, anything extra he spends for food, clothing, entertainment or gifts is over and beyond what he already gives his spouse for child support.
Adding to the insult, support payments are not deductible for the paying spouse, and they're tax-free to the receiving spouse.

HEADLINE: Wheels, Deals, Half-Pipe Dreams

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
Kanaf Hagi lay in his cramped room in a Oneida County juvenile detention center on a warm July morning and imagined himself flying. A hyper kid with trigger reflexes, Kanaf could feel his feet twist in phantom intimations of what they could do on wheels, and his mind spun with images of himself mid-sky, body stretched beyond the ground and way beyond the fences of juvenile hall.
Kanaf had just served a year-long sentence for beating a man with a pair of num-chuks while stoned. Today he was leaving. There was only one thing on his mind: getting back to the skate ramps of Mullaly Park. 
 That same morning, Julio Rivera, a slight, soft-faced 14-year-old with a shaggy head of hair, pulled himself out of bed early at his home in the South Bronx. Yanking on his skates, he glided down the long wooden hallway of his home and headed for the door. His mother, Raquel, amazed at her son's early rise, screamed her daily blessing, "Que Dios te bendiga!," at the closing door.
Outside his home, at East 162d and Walton Avenue in the Bronx, Julio slipped his headphones into his ears and started toward Mullaly, avoiding rough spots in the street and instinctively turning up the volume. Ever since he'd taken up in-line and stopped hanging on the street -- dropping bottles from the roof, xxxxx -- his former mates called him "Shrimpy" or "white boy."
But today it was too early for taunts. Julio had gotten up to wait for Kanaf to return, the friend who first taught him how to skate the ramps and rails of Mullaly Park's skate rink, before he was sent away. Kanaf had been the best skater that the local crowd at Mullaly had ever seen. Now that he was coming back, Julio had a few things to show him.
Kanaf and Julio are skate dreamers, two urban hopefuls in a new sport called aggressive skating. Aggressive is one of a number of so-called alternative sports, like snowboarding, downhill biking and bungee jumping currently in vogue with the young and televised. Alternative sports make good TV, and TV makes good for the athletes, with made-for-the-small-screen spectacles like ESPN's Extreme Games and MTV sports shows creating mini-celebrities of those willing to risk life and limb to create eye-catching visual fare.
Aggressive skating consists of in-line skaters, moving at maximum sped, performing tricks, flips, and grabs while either in a half-pipe or on a street course dotted with ramps, rails and boxes. But competitions are only part of the game. Aggressive skaters and their fast, flashy talents are rapidly being recruited by advertisers who want to cash in on the young, subculture feel of the sport to peddle everything from candy bars to sunglasses.
The air of hip glamour hanging around the sport are also encouraged by skate companies themselves, who keep stables of an elite skaters on monthly retainers and fly them around the country for promotional events and competitions. Their motivation is simple: In-line is the nation's fastest growing sport, with sales of over million dollars in 1994, according to statistics from the National Sporting Goods Association. And aggressive skating, with whole new lines of special skates (selling for about $200 a pair), pads and wheels, is in-line's fastest growing segment.
Companies scout places like Mullaly Park's skate rink, the city's only rink equipped with a half-pipe and a street course, for young skaters to add to their teams.
Success can come as fast as the sport. Take the case of Rollison Rivera, a one- time pitching prospect for the Yankees from Washington Heights, who took up skating at Mullaly a year ago. Last October, he was featured in a video which was shown on MTV That led to a sponsorship and monthly retainer from Rocce's skates. Today, he has endorsement contracts with four other companies, is starring in new documentary, "Hoax 2" about the sport, and is negotiating for a wheel endorsement contract that would pay him a nickle for every wheel sold. Count of the number of skates you see on a Manhattan street and you understand the potential for quick cash.
But Rollison's story is rare. A much more common deal involves free merchandise: boxes of wheels, t-shirts, ball bearings, clothing, even skates. What companies expect in return is for skaters to talk up the products.
But for the sport's participants, mostly under 20, mostly male, the appeal is not only economic. It's emotional. Aggressive skaters say they are part of a close-knit community that shelters them from the dangers of the streets and gives them individual and group identity.
The sport has its own heros, most known by nicknames, first names or just initials (like Arlo Isenberg, or Arlo, the king of the street, and C.E., Chris Edwards, a California skater with his own line of skates.)
It has its own lingo and traditions. The term "roller blading" is a considered a curse. It is offensive amongst aggressives to wear Spandex, the common garb of recreational skaters. They talk about run-ins with "gromlits" (i.e. skateboarders) and the old days on "quads" (standard roller skates).
The skating rite of passage is "sessioning" -- a practice where a pack of skaters travel from location to location using various bits of the urban landscape to hone their skills. Favorite spots are the steps at Union Square with their waxed curbs, or the "Screamer", a 25-step long rail in downtown Manhattan, which the skaters "grind" down i.e. use the middle wheels of the skate to locomote and the side of the skate to brake their descent. Mastering an especially difficult handrail can become a covert citywide challenge -- the rails at St. Luke's Hospital on 58th Street and 8th Avenue are the current dare.
Whether or not the sport will have mass appeal or staying power is debatable. What is certain is that the odds of making a career out of being a professional in-line skater are extremely long. (There are about 150 skaters nationwide making a decent living as "professional" in-line skaters, experts say -- professional basketball, by contrast, hires about 360, at much higher rates.)
Still, the possibility of that is enough to make young people like Kanaf and Julio dream of long green lawns with skate ramps, of making a life by doing something they love, or even just the simple attention brought by winning a neighborhood competition.
Maybe that attention would bring a break: a recommendation by a scout for an sponsorship or an endorsement offer. And that maybe, could lead to something bigger. At the very least, for Kanaf and Julio, winning means respect from peers and pride in one's self.
It is those things that make them skate, those things that make them move.
 
THE FIRST SKATE
Monday afternoon. Kanaf flew down River Avenue towards Mullaly. His tight schedule (off the bus at 1 P.M., to the skate shop for wheels, then home, to Mullaly by 3) had been blown by Manhattan traffic and his grandfather's reluctance to run red lights. But now he was out of the car and on skates again.
Mullaly skate rink is a smooth concrete oval in the corner of Mullaly Park, a run-down patch of green flowing north from Yankee Stadium. The rink, at East 164th Street and River Avenue, is the almost exclusive domain of children and teenagers. Facial hair is rare. And the trash that litters the broken concrete around the rink consists of soda bottles, ice cream containers, and candy wrappers. The park is overseen by two tattooed twentysomthing BMX bikers who sport Parks Department t-shirts and read "Pictorial" to bide the time. Two rusted snow plows resting inexplicably in one corner of the park signal the abandonment of adult bureaucracy.
When Kanaf turned the corner into the park, he saw things had changed. The skate rink had been nearly barren when he left, with the exception of a beat-up half pipe and few rotting plywood ramps which periodically got burned by vandals. Now, the park was crammed new ramps and practice rails.
Some things were the same: the empty chemical drums that served as giant steps up to the top of eight foot tall half-pipe, the Puerto Rican flag painted on a ramp, and the deafening screech of the passing 4 train overhead.
The big difference was in the crowd, its size and its makeup.
"50 skaters I don't know," Kanaf thought to himself. And young. Kids he last had seen as clumsy 5 year-olds were on skates. And on ramps.
Ray Mendez was one of the first to see Kanaf back. Ray is a 20-year old professional skater (an elder, by aggressive standards) who grew up in the same building as Julio. An assured young man with a casual, easy to talk to style, he is the de facto big brother to most young skater at Mullaly. He saw changes in Kanaf too.
Kanaf had left a street talker, a cocky skate prodigy whose talent was "phenomenal," according to Ray, but whose attitude was of "a little snot." Ray remembered when Kanaf would get baked and try to skate, one time running into a biker and breaking his nose. But now Kanaf's whole manner had changed: something about him was calmer, more focused.
"He had a smile on his face," said Ray.
After a few high five's and screaming "Heys" and "Where you beens" from friends, Kanaf glided onto the rink, forgetting his pads and immediately hopping onto the half-pipe.
He fell. Laughter came from everywhere. Kanaf laughed too but felt the flare of embarrassment inside him. I really fell off, he thought. He got up and retreated to the edge of the rink.
It was then someone handed Kanaf a flyer. There was a competition at the rink that coming Saturday, July 15. Two photos on the flyer jumped out at Kanaf. Both were of Julio, arching his legs behind him, perfectly, to touch his back in mid-air.
Julio couldn't take the heat. He'd waited at the rink till the sun had burned him and then gone home.
Sitting in the relative cool of his room, he considered his pencil sketches of airborne skaters pinned to his walls: contorted bodies suspended in different skate grabs and flips, some that he had mastered, others that he had simply imagined.
Julio stored his skates in their spot on his empty bookshelf ("his library" he calls it) and went to play with his nephew, one of eight people he shared with house with. He'd play for a while, do some drawing. Then maybe, when the sun had settled down, head out to find Kanaf again.
Kanaf stayed till 6, and then went home, leaving others who stayed behind after the rink had closed. They just hopped the fence and kept skating.
At home, Kanaf caught his mother, Sue, trying to move some stuff into his room. He stopped her and insisted she sit.
Sue Nagi's heart had almost stopped years before. It was after her quintuple bypass that Kanaf, left without as much supervision, had begun to hang out with a bad group. ("The kids with the cheap skates," Mrs. Nagi called them.)
"They were pulling me away with a rope and finally I hung myself," said Kanaf.
Kanaf didn't want her, or him, to get sick again.
 
A DAY OF FRUSTRATION
Tuesday stormed. Puddles everywhere on the rink.
Kanaf brooded, angry at the weather. His moods always were dark when he couldn't skate. He felt impatient. He'd watched videos in the detention center of skaters he knew making their names. He'd seen their pictures on magazine covers and followed their results in competitions. He didn't have time for rain.
You can watch skaters at Mullaly scramble when the rain hits, and then watch them buzz back to the rink when the sky clears, whizzing down the streets around the rink like bees returning to a hive. Even in the winter, skaters plow paths to get from ramp to ramp. But the on again, off again rains bred by the humidity and heat made the whole afternoon a wash.
Kanaf's mother had told him that when he got out, with credo should be "Live to skate, skate to live" and Kanaf agreed. But he'd have to wait till the rink was dry.
Julio sat around and gourged himself on some cuchifritos from a shop on East 161st Street and thought evil thoughts about Disney. Julio's only seeming break into the in-line world was a photo shoot he'd had in January for a Disney kid's book. They'd taken him to a fancy Manhattan photo studio and dressed him in Spandex. Instead of a skate ramp, they'd put him on a trampoline and asked him to "do skate tricks." He'd done his best and they'd promised mail a check.
"Neither rain nor sleet nor dark of night..."
Nothing had ever come.
By Wednesday afternoon, clearer and hot again, Kanaf was back up to speed, headphones dangling from his ears, performing tricks that made the younger skaters stop and gape, sometimes breaking up his time with a cigarette break. His quick smiles marked each flight on the half-pipe. He grabbed more air on every pass, egged on by the crowd. "More air!" "Come on, you Energizer bunny!" Kanaf responded by swinging high off on end, twisting his body one and half times around while swinging his right hand across his body to grab the outside of his left skate, a manuever called a mute-method.
During a break, Kanaf caught a figure shooting down East 164th, straight through the intersection, not even breaking to swing the sharp right turn into the park. It was Julio.
Kanaf didn't quite recognize the speeding figure until he got close. And he got close fast.
He stopped. They hugged. Julio hung near Kanaf's arm for a bit, uncertain, while Kanaf talked around the group, teasing some of the other skaters to get higher, to trust the momentum of ramp's curve. Then Julio moved away, up on the platform above the half-pipe. Ray had been assuring a younger that if he dropped into the half- pipe shoulders first, he would be okay. Julio was in before the younger kid could work up the nerve. Julio instantly, cold, pulled him a move he'd made up himself, a backwards 360 with a . He called it the P.R. (for Puerto Rico) flip.
Damn, Kanaf thought.
Julio had once broke a pair of skates trying a move like this, leaving him skateless for a full year before he could afford a new pair. It was period, he admits, half-smiling, half-hiding his head in his chest, that he would pass by the park and watch from beyond the gates. "I kept crying" he said. But there was nothing wrong with Julio's skates now.
Kanaf pulled the flyer from a pocket and showed it to a friend.It hit him. "That's Julio," he said quietly. "I left, and he soared."
He knew then that the competition, a place where he had told himself he was just going to find out "where I am now" was going to come down to between him and Julio.
 
ACTION
Thursday the first offer came.
Ray's fledgling instruction and promotion company, City Sk8, had been asked by a Japanese production to assemble some skaters to stage a session hitting all the major spots around the city. Ray asked Julio and Kanaf to come along.
They shot on Friday, going from Mullaly, down to Columbus Circle, threw Central Park for a while, down to the Chelsea Piers and then finally to Union Square.
Julio marveled at the star treatment, free food and cameras everywhere, taking down what he did and said. He felt like a movie star, and thought, 'This is the best day of my life, this is what I want.'
Kanaf asked Julio to do some tricks: a mute, a Gumby, a method. Julio did every move and ask Kanaf to match him. Kanaf coaxed spitting laughs out of Julio, and started calling him Rosa, a nod to a fellow juvie mate, a gymnast named Delarosa.
Julio didn't know what it meant, so he laughed. They goofed for the camera. They hit their marks. They scouted each other. They shot for 16 hours for no pay, but the attention of an video entourage and a rapt audience wherever they went.
Finally, dog tired and thinking about the next day's competition, Kanaf and Julio headed home.
 
THE COMPETITION BEGINS
Saturday was the hottest day of the year. By noon, the sheet metal on the half-pipe was sizzling hands of falling skaters.
A DJ worked out of a van was parked in the corner of the park and bass heavy rap and hip hop boomed through the park. A PA had been set up and the competition's organizers, Ray and his partner David Smith, took turns trying to announcing competitors names and adding commentary to routines: "Oh, that's a 360 transfer, baby. Nice!" The half-pipe's platforms were draped with banners announcing Hyper Wheels and Power Bars, and topped with a McDonald's flag. The park guys had run a hose over the roof, creating a single stream shower for people to cool off in. Blankets sat in the shade for parents. Skaters showed early and came from everywhere, slowing the competition down by adding multiple rounds.
By the midday start of vert competition, the temperature was 101. Kanaf, Julio and 11 other skaters had signed up for the vert, the faster, harder to master end of aggressive. (51 signed up for the street course.) The competition would be one round of prelims then the top 8 would compete in the finals.
A corwd of baout 200 people had showed up to watch, driven to the shade of the park by the heat indoors. Hanging around the edge of the rink was a German photographer, a Brooklyn skate enterpreneur looking to form a team, and a handful of pros, not allowed to compete, but watching for new talent.
The first round showed off Kanaf and Julio. Kanaf, heavier and steadier, older and stronger, could trust momentum would build behind him. Julio had to work a little harder for the speed.
And Kanaf had style. In a black soccer-style shirt and frayed dungarees, Kanaf milked the stalls between tricks, gripping the edge of the platform with his skates like flamenco dancer: arms slightly bent, head cocked, eyes in the middle distance. And then down into the pipe, seemingly fed by the music, effortlessly gaining speed, arms to his side, and then with a perfectly timed push, up, two, three, four feet into the air, turning his body from the sky to the ground to the sky again, landing and shooting backwards towards the other curve of the pipe. No sign in his body of any fear of falling on anything but the glide of four wheels still in motion.
But Julio had moves. Smaller, almost birdlike, he found the twists and grabs less clumbersome. Perching for a moment on the edges of the platforms, he would swoop down, pushing his skates with more desperate action, looking for the speed to launch him up. But then suddenly, airborne, twisting, his fast hands locking into sudden perfect positions, he would be frozen for a moment. Then as soon as eyes could snap his image, the next moment he was falling back into the pipe, landing and pushing again to gain the speed for the next flight
The judges, a trio of sponsored skaters, gave the prelims lead to Kanaf. Julio was 2d.
In between, Kanaf smoked and fast-chatted a battery of girls and buddies. Julio stayed atop of the half-pipe, fiddled with the hem of his "Your Wheels Suck" t-shirt and thought about the next round. His watched parts on the street competition and played eye-tag with a girl standing beyond the park's fence.
When the finals came, hours late, the sun had begun to set behind the projects to the west of the park. The water had got out of hand and many of the spectators were drenched.
In the finals, Kanaf stuck with a high air strategy, blasting up and twisting, ripping 540's, following one leap with another, confident that he was skating "harder than I ever skated before." Coming down out of the pipe, he was covered in sweat, like he'd stepped through the makeshift fountain. He thought about it: This is all the sweat that I clogged in my pores for a year coming out.
But Julio dogged Kanaf, spinning mercilessly, again and again, using a simple ideas to keep focus: Where's the ramp? Put fear to the side. Don't fall and look stupid. The remaining crowd fed him, Kanaf screaming along with the rest.
When the judges tallied their cards, there was a tie.
A playoff was hastily arranged to decide the competition between Julio and Kanaf. The lights on the basketball court had already clicked on, and the DJ had packed up, taking the PA and the commentary with him. The crowd had dwindled.
Julio approached Kanaf.
"You want first?" said Julio.
He said he was exhausted, and could hardly see the ramp. The prizes between first and second weren't that different, and he'd be happy with second...
Kanaf responded before the words got out of Julio's mouth.
"If you're not to going to skate, I'm not going to skate, it'll be a tie," said Kanaf. "But I want to skate, so you get your little butt out there."
Kanaf stood on the edge and dropped in. The routine was good, no falls, no misses, but lacking the speed and intensity of before. Kanaf missed the grind and beat of the music, the energy of the big crowd.
He finished. Julio began.
At first, it seemed like his regular routine, said Ray. But then he pulled it. Flying up the curve of the pipe, he made a push about six inches from the top and entered the air that Kanaf had seemed to own all afternoon. He flipped skates over head, his eyes flashed with sky's dusk, so high that he "smelled pollution," he said. He completed a full flip and then, twisting like a cat falling from a roof, turned his body 180 at the last instant to land moving forward towards the other curve of the pipe.
Silence for a second. Then shreiks of "Oh man, oh man!" He had pulled a pro move, a gravity bender known as a Mc-Flip.
The decision was unanamious.
Ray pronounced Julio "King of Mullaly."
"Was that so hard?" asked Kanaf.
Julio seemed stunned. "I didn't feel a thing," he said. He said later that when he smiled, it was in the shape of a U -- a half-pipe of a smile.
 
EPILOGUE
A week later, Kanaf got a call from casting agent from American Express. Two days later he was filming in Central Park, playing a skate messenger in a Jerry Seinfeld ad. He had to wear Spandex, but got paid $810 for two days work.
Both Julio and Kanaf were signed to Free Ride, a new skate company in Brooklyn. Unfortunately, it's called Free Ride because its skaters skate free.
Ray also booked Julio and Kanaf onto his City Sk8 team, and their first show is planned for next month. "I'm making sure they get sponsored. They'll have careers," said Ray.
In the meantime, every afternoon the sky is clear at Mullaly Park, they'll skate to live, and live to skate.
 
 
 
From Gring to Gromlit: A Glossary
 Someday you might overhear something like this: "He pulled a mute method and then he tweaked it into a gumby."
Here's a guide to the basic lingo of aggressive skating.
 
Anti-rocker: The wheel alignment that makes grinding easier. (Two middle wheels are slightly smaller than the two outside wheels, improving the skate's grip.)
 
Gromlit: A slang word used to describe skateboarders.
 
Grind: The action of sliding along a rail, skates roughly perpendicular to it. The two outside wheels are used to cradle the rail and gravity does the rest of the work.
 
Gumby, mute, method, rocket: The basic skate grips, all involving grabbing a skate or skates while mid-air.
 
Hip hop: The action of hopping with the hands along the coping, or top metal bar, of a half-pipe while in a handstand.
 
Invert or sad plant: A handstand on the top of a half-pipe.
 
Quads: Standard roller skates.
 
Sessioning: When a pack of skaters travel from location to location using handrails, steps and curbs to perfect moves. Favorite spots are an area under the Brooklyn Bridge on the Manhattan side called the Brooklyn Banks and the "Screamer," a 25-step-long rail in downtown Manhattan.
 
THE BUSINESS OF A RISING SPORT
 
 Who the Corporate Players

 * Skate and accessory manufacturers seeking to cash in on the nation's fastest growing sporting goods market.
 * Advertisers seeking urban, youthful feel to sell products from credit cards to candy bars.
 * Television networks and video companies looking for new, cheap sports programming that appeals to a public jaded by the turmoil in more traditional sports.

 What the Skaters Do

 * Promote skate equipment by talking it up in skate parks and hangouts, using a company's skate equipment, sporting its logos on shirts, helmets and hats provided by the company.
 * Perform at trade shows and store openings to provide entertainment and build crowds.
 * Scout for other talented skaters to become members of company teams.
 * Give advice on research and development of new products; test new products.

 What the Skaters Get

 * Top skaters kept on retainer by large companies like Roller Blades can earn up to $6,000 a month. Skaters travel around the country and, and in some instances, overseas to promote and compete.
 * Many deals involve free merchandise, payment of entrance fees to tournaments and small royalties for any photo or broadcast appearance.
 * Other deals pay in the neighborhood of $300 for appearances at trade shows, store openings and in commercials.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
One Way to College: Buy Now, Learn Later

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
AS one of five children of a working-class Ohio family, David Sweet financed college the hard way, with loans that he is still toiling to pay off at the age of 34. So when his son, Paul, was born five years ago, Mr. Sweet was determined not to weigh him down with the same millstone.
Mr. Sweet and his wife, Cindy, became two of the hundreds of thousands of participants in a novel college-financing venture that is catching fire around the country. They enrolled in a state-operated plan that allows them to prepay up to four years of tuition at an Ohio state college at a locked-in price -- roughly $15,000 at today's rates. No matter what the caprices of tuition, inflation or politics during the next dozen years, Paul will be able to start state college as a freshman with much of his tuition paid off. 
 "It will be like going to the store and paying 29 cents a gallon for milk," predicts Mr. Sweet, a tall, lanky communications director for a health-care affiliate of the Chamber of Commerce in Columbus.
In the years since 1986, as tuition has risen ever more sharply, seven other states -- Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wyoming -- have set up comparable plans, and a half-dozen more have passed legislation to do so. Still more -- including New York, New Jersey, California and Illinois -- have made inquiries. By one expert's estimate, more than 400,000 American families are already enrolled in such plans, almost half of them in the robust $1.5 billion Florida program.
The financial premise behind these programs is that by pooling tens of thousands of individuals' savings in what are considered to be safe investments, the states can earn enough to cover the cost of future tuition increases, which have been handily outpacing inflation.
To be sure, the plans have their detractors. Critics worry that a sustained period of low investment returns could undermine some of the weaker plans. The states, not the students, are on the hook if that happens, but that just means taxpayers in general will have to make up any shortfalls, critics say. While those who sign up are fully protected, they might earn more by investing elsewhere, perhaps in a mutual fund. What's more, the plans make little sense for poor families, which can qualify for state aid. Worse yet, critics contend, prepaid tuition plans could even discourage states from providing direct tuition assistance to truly needy students.
Nonetheless, state officials like prepaid tuition plans because they provide a politically popular service during an era when they have been forced to raise tuition sharply at state colleges, up to a peak nationally of 12 percent in 1991-92.
"They're almost patriotic," said Michael A. Olivas, a University of Houston law professor who has studied the plans. "Who can be against any plan that encourages parents to save money to send their children to school and rewards them for it? It's almost a no-brainer."
With increases in tuition exceeding gains in consumer prices by three or more percentage points in each of the last five years, participants like these plans because most lock in "tomorrow's tuition at today's rates," as the Massachusetts sales brochure points out. The Florida plan promises that "you never have to worry about whether the amount you saved will be enough."
"What I like about it is, once I put the money in, it can't be taken out," said Mr. Sweet, who together with his wife, a medical records specialist at a hospital, earns under $60,000. "If I decide I want a new car or the water heater blows up, I can't raid that fund."
Gale Richards, a home economics teacher in New Port Richey, Fla., has already paid off four years of college and two of dormitory expenses for her 9-year-old daughter, Bonnie, by putting down $135 a month for five years.
"There's a peace of mind about having that for her," said Ms. Richards, who earns $26,000 a year. "She's extremely bright, and there might be other options available for her, but at least we have this basic program."
The plans come in all shapes and sizes. Some states sell contracts guaranteeing they will pay whatever the tuition will be down the road; others sell bonds whose value can be applied toward the tuition bill. In Ohio, participants buy up to 400 "tuition units" of the $15,000 price tag of four years at a state college, paying $37.50 a unit.
The Sweets, who in addition to their son, Paul, have an 18-month-old daughter, Sarah, are squirreling away birthday gifts and the money they earn from trading in recyclables so they can put away $40 a month toward roughly half the cost of their children's anticipated college education. They want the children to pick up the rest of the tuition through summer jobs and savings.
Most states allow participants to make payments either in lump sums or in monthly Christmas Club-type installments as low as $25. The payments can be made at banks, through payroll deductions or with coupon books.
"This gives people a discipline of savings that they're used to, that they've done all their lives with other things," said William W. Montjoy, executive director of Florida's program.
The Florida program, whose popularity stems from a low-priced college system that means a Floridian can buy four years of senior college for a newborn at a rock-bottom $5,639, offers separate prepayment plans for dormitory costs and permits the savings to be transferred to out-of-state institutions. If a child cannot qualify for admission to a state college, the parents receive a refund of the money paid into the program, though not the accumulated interest.
Walter C. Young, a retired junior high school principal who represented Fort Lauderdale in the Florida Legislature for 20 years, decided to give each of his three grandchildren a gift of a fully paid college education. Over a seven-year period, he paid $3,500 to educate Ian Dasho, 17, $4,000 for Robert Bucellato, 8, and $5,000 for Elisabeth Tucker, 5. Whether the three decide to go to Florida State or Harvard or Slippery Rock State, they can apply the prevailing tuition at Florida's state colleges during their senior year of high school toward a college of their choice.
"I question whether I would have done it for the grandchildren if I didn't have an easy way to do it," said Mr. Young, 73.
Massachusetts, with more private college seats than public, does Florida one better by selling "U-Plan" bonds whose face value at maturity can be applied toward all or part of the tuition at 67 participating colleges in the state, including such elite private institutions as Wellesley, Smith and Mount Holyoke. By buying bonds, which pay an interest rate of 2.5 percentage points above the consumer price index, participants actually purchase a percentage of tuition at a Massachusetts college of their choice, with the percentage varying by college.
SOME plans, though, have had their problems. Michigan, the first state to enact a prepaid tuition plan, has halted new enrollments since 1991, because its plan's earnings fell 2.5 percentage points behind the pace of tuition increases.
Wary of the Michigan experience, Florida and Ohio set their purchase prices slightly above prevailing tuition costs. Nevertheless, last year, Ohio's officials chewed their nails as their investments returned only 1 percent. But this year, with investments earning 14.5 percent, they're delighting in their shrewdness.
In Ohio, proceeds from the prepaid program are invested by the state's pension system and thus risk is sharply reduced, with no more than 50 percent of a portfolio in equities. Since 1994, the investments have been backed by Ohio's full faith and credit.
Because of a favorable court ruling, even Michigan may soon get back into the prepaid tuition business. Last November, a Federal appeals court said Michigan should not have paid taxes on the investment income it earned and required the Internal Revenue Service to refund the state an amount lawyers calculate at $75 million. That decision is expected to open the floodgates for states that have been cautious about starting plans.
(Once they start college, students enrolled in prepaid plans do have to pay Federal income taxes on the appreciation in the value of their contracts.)
Prepaid tuition plans are not for everybody. They mostly attract middle-income people who get nervous choosing among stocks, bonds and mutual funds. Ohio's surveys show that most buyers, like the Sweets, earn $35,000 to $70,000. Canny investors, or those who can afford to pay canny investors, may do better by buying mutual funds. But state officials and satisfied participants point out that a mutual fund does not come with a guaranteed tuition.
Barbara M. Jennings, executive director of the Ohio Tuition Trust Authority, discourages low-income families from joining, saying they would be siphoning money they need for immediate essentials when the likelihood is their children will qualify for state grants.
"To me this is a middle-class empowerment thing that needs to be there because middle-income people are not qualifying for anything but student loans, and don't have the purchasing power to pay for college," said Mrs. Jennings.
Critics also see a number of philosophical and financial drawbacks to the plans. They worry that a convergence of low investment returns and rising college costs could spell disaster for the states.
"I think the states have fared O.K. because we've been in a bull market," said Peter A. Roberts, who runs a popular private prepaid tuition plan called the College Savings Plan in Princeton, N.J. "Inflation has been going down and the investment rate of return has been going up. The true test will come when those situations reverse themselves."
But that possibility does not worry participants like Mr. Young of Florida because the full faith and credit of the state is behind the plan.
"It may hurt the state," he said of a stock market decline. "But it will not hurt the people involved in the plan."
SOME experts believe that if the prepayment plans succeed in saturating the state colleges, state legislators may be less generous with the money they provide for student aid and loans. Indeed, both Mr. Roberts and Mr. Olivas think the plans are regressive transfers of wealth because every time a plan runs into trouble, a state may feel obligated to close the gap.
"People who don't go to college," Mr. Olivas said, "are paying for the elite who do go to college."
Mr. Roberts said, "It's definitely reverse Robin Hood." Mr. Roberts acknowledges that his own plan has been hurt by state plans with distinct tax advantages that he can't offer. Last year, Mr. Roberts filed a Federal suit against the Florida plan for infringing on College Savings Plan's patented investment technique.
Mr. Olivas also believes that college admissions officers will favor applicants backed by prepayment plans.
"I think the pressure is going to be irresistible to give preference to those kids who've got aid in hand as opposed to the ones who are need-eligible," he said.
Still, Mr. Olivas thinks the plans make sense because they serve as a ballast to keep tuition costs down. "Legislatures have to moderate tuition rates fully aware that the existence of this plan depends on modest raises, not wild swings," he said.
It is precisely their confidence in the state that has drawn people like the Sweets to put their measured earnings in this novel venture.
"Some of my friends say that I should go with a mutual fund because you can do better than something that just keeps up with inflation," Mr. Sweet said. "But I don't know of any mutual fund that is backed up by the full faith and credit of the state of Ohio."

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
The American Dream Glitters Still -- in Foreign Countries

BYLINE: By ROBERT BRYCE 

 BODY:
IN 1991, John Connelly lost his job. With more than a decade of experience as a materials supplier, Mr. Connelly, now 45, hoped to find a new one quickly. After eight months, though, he began to worry. Finally, frustrated, he interviewed with Samarec, a Saudi Arabian oil company.
Within weeks, he was living in Jidda, making $55,000 a year and loving it. 
 Mr. Connelly is not alone. This may be the era of downsizing in the United States, but overseas, in both developed and developing nations, companies and governments are actively seeking skilled American workers, from engineers to entrepreneurs. "There are good opportunities now, but I only see them getting better," says Robert Sanborn, the director of the career center at Rice University in Houston and author of two books on working overseas.
Mr. Sanborn and other international employment advisers say the spread of capitalism and the globalization of the economy has created this worldwide demand.
The overall numbers of such jobs are elusive, but one common measure -- the tax forms filed by all Americans working abroad, regardless of employer -- are moving up. According to statistics from the Internal Revenue Service, about 159,000 Americans filed such tax forms in 1983. In 1987, about 171,000 forms were filed, and in 1991 there were approximately 220,000. Moreover, these statistics probably understate the truth because many citizens abroad do not file tax forms.
The I.R.S. has no statistics that are more recent -- it surveys these numbers just once every five years -- but Mr. Sanborn and others say the figures are only getting bigger.
"If you have the technical skills, language and cultural ability, and the proper temperament, there are opportunities," says Paul Flask, of Korn/Ferry International, an executive search firm. The firm recently found several American executives to help manage one of Russia's biggest industrial companies, Zil.
Mr. Flask, however, warns against thinking that getting a job abroad is easy. "You don't buy a book for $25 and apply," he said.
Still, the demand is widespread. In Eastern Europe, for instance, Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and other nations embarking on market economies are eagerly seeking workers with business expertise. In the Czech Republic alone, some 10,000 Americans are now working, according to the American Embassy in Prague.
Erik Best, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Prague, is one of many Americans who have begun businesses in the city. Mr. Best publishes The Fleet Sheet, a daily newspaper published in English. "For those who speak Czech there are lots of opportunities," he said. "If they don't, the opportunities diminish -- but they are still there."
Like many Americans working abroad, Mr. Best, 32, had traveled extensively in the region before moving to Prague. He also speaks Russian, has an M.B.A. from the University of North Carolina, and has studied the economies of Eastern Europe.
Newly capitalist countries are not the only seekers of American labor. The Australian Government, anxious to bolster its economy, is energetically encouraging American entrepreneurs to relocate. The effort -- the attractions include dual citizenship and assistance in both relocation and business start-ups -- will snare an expected 3,600 American immigrants this year, compared with less than 1,400 in 1994.
One small-business owner, Elias Aghnatios, will move to Australia on Dec. 1. Mr. Aghnatios has run a computer sales and service company in Santa Monica, Calif., since 1987, but no more.
"I've had enough" of Los Angeles, he says. "I can't afford to buy a house here." He plans to open a computer company in Sydney or Brisbane, where, he says, the business climate is good.
IMMIGRANTS to Australia need a good deal of pocket change, however; the bigger a person's business and resources, the greater the chances of admission. On average, American entrepreneurs moving to Australia take along $500,000.
In the Middle East, however, skills alone are sufficient to land jobs. In the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, the public and private sectors employ thousands of Western workers, including engineers, draftsmen, technicians and safety inspectors. The Government of Qatar, now in the midst of a $3.5 billion construction program to develop a natural gas field in the Persian Gulf, will have several hundred job openings for American workers in the next two years, says Steve Michaels of the Leslie Corporation, an international recruiting company.
While salaries in that region may be somewhat below comparable American pay levels, other factors often more than make up for the difference. In the United Arab Emirates, for example, cash allowances for housing, travel and other costs often add up to 38 to 44 percent of salary. And many Persian Gulf countries impose no income tax. Coupled with the I.R.S. exclusion of up to $70,000 in overseas income from taxes, that means American workers in that region often pay no tax to anyone.
Add in the generous housing and other subsidies, and "the only thing they have to buy is food and entertainment," says Mr. Michaels. (Of course, such advantages disappear in countries, like many in Western Europe, where tax rates and living expenses are higher than in the United States.)
Latin America, also thirsty for skilled workers, is where Brad Gray chose to go. He worked for AT&T until July 1, when he took a job with Itatel, a Brazilian company.
"I wasn't looking for a job, not at all," says Mr. Gray, who has worked for nearly a decade on cellular telephone and paging services. Instead, he was lured by the challenge of setting up a wireless communications network in a country with 155 million people. So he is selling his home in Austin, Tex., and, on Aug. 12, moving with his wife and 11-month-old son to Sao Paulo.
Of course, life-style preferences often play a big role in the decision to work overseas. For Mr. Aghnatios, for example, there is the smog and overcrowding of California, and his biggest concern -- a good quality of life for his 9-month-old son. "That's what it comes down to," he said. "Australia has a slower pace of life, the air is cleaner."
For others, the lure is adventure. After a three-year stint in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Connelly moved back to Denver in January. He could have found a job in the United States, he says, but took a job in Bombay, India, instead, because the domestic offers were either boring or didn't pay enough.
"You get hooked," he said. "Going overseas kind of spoils you for regular work."
That goes for children, too. After cruising the Nile and doing other exotic things during Mr. Connelly's stint in Saudi Arabia, his three school-age children have the perspective of world travelers. "The Holidome in Omaha," Mr. Connelly says with a chuckle, "just doesn't do it for them anymore."
 
 
 
Job Hunting Overseas
 WILL CANTRELL says there are two types of people who want to work overseas: the dreamers and serious job seekers.
The dreamers "expect to be overpaid and live in some exotic foreign capital," says Mr. Cantrell, who publishes The International Employment Hotline, a newsletter. "They are not willing to do what it takes to be qualified in the international job market."
For the serious seekers, Mr. Cantrell recommends the same strategies used in getting domestic jobs. Work the phones and network aggressively, for example. If you belong to a professional association, interview members who have worked abroad.
Seek out reputable headhunters and other talent-search firms -- especially those active in international placements or with offices worldwide.
For example, the Leslie Corporation of Houston is retained by Middle Eastern governments and companies to fill positions in a wide variety of fields.
Consult international employment listings. Large-circulation newspapers and periodicals carry them, but also check out specialty sources.
Mr. Cantrell's newsletter, which costs $39 a year, lists hundreds of overseas jobs (703 620-1972). Transitions Abroad, published every two months, is geared to entry-level work; it costs $19.95 a year (800 293-0373).
Also subscribe to foreign newspapers and periodicals for their job listings, or consult these publications at larger public libraries.
If it is practical and if you know where you want to live, visit there and look on-site -- this is always easier than a long-distance search.
Browse the many books on foreign employment. A popular one is "The Almanac for International Jobs and Careers," by Ronald L. Krannich and Caryl Rae Krannich (Impact, $19.95).
Although the hunt for foreign work is much like any job search, remember that it can take much longer than its stateside counterpart. "Job hunt while you are actively employed," Mr. Cantrell advises. Looking for a job abroad is "not for desperate people who have to put food on the table."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS: FUNDS WATCH;
Sitting Tight Abroad Despite Weak Returns

BYLINE: By Carol Gould 

 BODY:
MUTUAL fund investors who own foreign funds remain committed to their holdings despite weak performances over the last 12 months, according to a recent survey by the Gallup organization for Scudder, Stevens & Clark Inc.
For the 12 months ended July 19, foreign stock funds gained a paltry 2 percent, while Pacific stock funds lost just under 1 percent and Europe stock funds gained 14 percent, reported Morningstar Inc., the fund researchers. Although the figure for Europe is far from bad, it pales next to the 24 percent gain for United States diversified stock funds in the period. 
 Investors, though, are undeterred. A quarter of all fund shareholders own global or international mutual funds, according to Gallup, which conducted telephone interviews with 1,000 households with stock or bond funds outside of employer-sponsored saving plans. Most of these people plan to stay in for the long haul, no matter the short-term results, the survey found.
More than half of the fund investors without international funds said it was unlikely that they would buy any. The most common responses -- 18 percent each -- were too risky, unfamiliar and no money available for investing.
Fund owners said they believed the greatest opportunities in the next three years were in Europe and the Pacific Basin, though Russia garnered a significant number of mentions as well. The greatest risks involved in foreign investing, the fund owners said, are economic and political instability. A year earlier, they were far more concerned about political turbulence than about economic conditions. In what may be a reminder of how quickly people forget, currency fluctuations fell to third on the list of risks. For the last year, of course, the dollar has largely been declining against foreign currencies, making foreign investments worth more for Americans.
 
Disappearing Acts
More and more funds are simply vanishing. Already this year, as many funds have been merged out of existence or liquidated as in all of 1994, according to Morningstar.
About 60 percent of this year's 189 disappearing funds can be attributed to mergers, largely because of consolidation by parent companies. The merger of Smith Barney and Shearson alone has accounted for the demise of 50 funds. More recently, Liberty Financial's acquisition of Colonial and First Union's purchase of the ABT and Evergreen groups have created a frenzy of fund consolidation, analysts say.
A lesser factor is a decision by some fund companies to simplify pricing. When investors began balking at paying hefty up-front sales charges several years ago, sponsors found ways to make fees less obvious, and along the way they created complex fee structures. One class of shares might have a redemption fee that declines over several years, while another might have an up-front sales charge. Van Kampen Merritt and the One Group have cut back from four classes of shares to three. Given the complexity of choosing among multiple classes, investors can only hope it's the beginning of a trend.
 
Investing Tools
 Morningstar's new software, Principia for Mutual Funds, is compatible with Windows and includes data on more than 6,500 funds. But it lacks the fund manager profiles, analysts' commentary and portfolio holdings that can be found on Morningstar's Ondisc product. Principia contains 98 categories of information on each fund as well as tools to find and rank funds and to draw charts. Similar data are available for closed-end funds and annuities. A one-year subscription to Principia is $95; a one-month trial subscription costs $45. Call (800) 876-5005.
The Vanguard Retirement Planner, software available in Windows and DOS versions, costs $15 plus $3 for shipping. The Vanguard Retirement Investing Guide, an 11-chapter book, costs $10 plus $3 for shipping. Both can be ordered for a total of $26.50. To order, call (800) 937-8368.
Kemper Financial Services has prepared a booklet to help investors choose a money fund. It is available by calling (800) 694-1080, extension 501.
 
Prospectus in English
There is good news for investors who are fed up with slogging through mutual fund prospectuses filled with legalese and jargon. Eight mutual fund companies began testing a new, slimmed-down version, called a "profile" prospectus, last week. For now, the short versions will be mailed along with the longer ones.
 The abbreviated prospectus provides 11 pieces of basic information, including the fund's goals, risks, investment strategies, appropriateness, fees and expenses. A bar chart shows the fund's total return for 10 years, making comparisons with other funds easier and showing years of declines.
The test has the blessing of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will work with the fund companies to evaluate the project's success. Although eight companies were involved in the initial project, any company can now adopt the format for any or all funds, as long as the longer prospectus is given to investors as well.

Manager Changes
Neil Devlin has handed over the reins of Templeton Income to Tom Latta, who will also keep running Franklin Templeton German Bond.
 
New Funds
Ariel Premier Bond, a joint venture of Ariel Capital Management and the Lincoln Capital Management Company, aims for maximum total return by investing in high-quality fixed-income securities.
The Flex-Partners group of Dublin, Ohio, is offering mutual funds with sales charges as a counterpart to the Flex funds group. The new investments are the TAA fund, a "fund of funds" that will invest in other stock funds, and the BTB fund, which invests in equities of foreign and domestic utilities that do not use nuclear power.
 
In Brief
Vanguard's version of Schwab's fund service is now available on a limited basis. Vanguard Fund Access provides a consolidated statement and a central account for investors in funds from nine other groups, including Benham, Dreyfus, Mutual Series, Neuberger & Berman and Strong. So far, only a small group of Vanguard Brokerage customers have been offered the service, but it will be expanded over the next year. Fund transactions cost $35.
Bank Polska Kasa Opieki S.A. and Alliance Capital Management have signed a letter of understanding to form the Trust Fund Company, a jointly owned venture that would market funds to Polish investors. Alliance's move follows that of the Pioneer group, which set up a Poland fund in July 1992
Berwyn Income has exceeded $100 million and expects to close to new investors shortly. Its companion fund, Berwyn, has $76 million and also plans to close at $100 million.
Colonial Newport Tiger has stopped accepting new retail accounts through the no-load program of Charles Schwab & Company, but existing shareholders can add to their positions. Financial advisers, though, can still buy the fund for clients without a sales charge.
Stein Roe Young Investor, a growth fund intended to teach children about money and investing, has reduced its minimum investment to $100 from $500 for people who invest at least $50 a month in an automatic investing plan, through Jan. 31, 1996.
Value Line Fund has changed its investment style to try to reduce volatility by adding stocks ranked 3 by Value Line to its mix, previously limited to stocks ranked 1 and 2. Value Line ranks stocks on a 1 to 5 scale, 1 being the most likely to outperform the general stock market.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MIDTOWN;
Domino Real-Estate Deal Cleared

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
A final obstacle has been removed to a complex deal to relocate both the City University Graduate Center and the State University College of Optometry in a $173 million project involving the old B. Altman department store and two other sites.
In a three-year process, the college will move from 315 Park Avenue South at 24th Street to CUNY's building at 33 West 42d. CUNY will move to the Altman building, on Fifth Avenue at 34th. To allow the deal, Gov. George E. Pataki signed a special law cutting off state funds for the optometry college's $7 million annual rent, breaking its lease without penalty or compensation to the landlord. Mr. Pataki's press office did not respond to a reporter's inquiries. 
 The law is under attack from State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, some real estate industry leaders and the owners of 315 Park. The owners, TM Park Associates, say the move could bankrupt them, since their $50 million mortgage is based on the lease's lasting till 2004. They plan to sue. Mr. McCall's office called the law unprecedented and said it could have serious consequences, hampering future lease negotiations.
"The concept that the state can simply abrogate a contract seems to me unfair, unethical and immoral -- you and I could not get away with that," said Michael Cohen, president of Williams Real Estate, which has several leases with state agencies. He called the law a terrible precedent.
Controversies aside, officials at the optometry college and CUNY Center say they are delighted at the prospect of new homes. CUNY, which opened in 1961, long ago outgrew its 172,924-square-foot 42d Street building and spilled over into 100,831 square feet rented in adjacent buildings.
"We're really cramped," said Pam Bayless, a spokeswoman. "The hope is to get out as soon as possible."
Despite agitation within the Real Estate Board of New York to oppose the lease-breaking law, the industry organization has not done so. Some critics say that reflects the influence of Peter L. Malkin, a governor of the board and a real estate power who is a general partner in the redevelopment of the Altman site. He did not respond to a request for an interview.
The CUNY move is the third time Mr. Malkin's partnership has benefited from special legislation and public money to help rescue the troubled Altman project and fill it with new occupants and owners.
After the store closed in 1989, the partnership tried to convert the building into the New York Resource Center, a mart for the office furnishing industry. But that flopped as the city sank into recession. Then the partnership tried dividing the building into condominiums for nonprofit institutions who, by owning, would avoid property taxes.
Senator Roy Goodman, who is also the Manhattan Republican Party chairman, sponsored the lease-breaking law and also introduced an earlier bill that helped land the Altman building's first occupant. That legislation enabled the State Dormitory Authority to finance $30 million for Oxford University Press to buy 110,000 square feet in the top five floors of the building's eastern end, facing Madison Avenue. Oxford moved in this year. Mr. Goodman was out of town last week and unavailable for comment.
The Dormitory Authority is also helping finance a $125 million project creating the Science, Industry and Business Library in 213,000 square feet on the lower eight floors of the Madison wing, scheduled to open later this year. CUNY's move, also authorized by state legislation and financed by public funds, will fill 375,000 square feet of Altman's remaining space, making CUNY the building's major occupant.

FLUSHING
Call: Save Qu Yuan! Response: What, Again?
The dragons are coming back to the lake in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park today with the fifth annual Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival.
The boats, which are 39 feet long, have dragon heads at the prow and tails at the stern. Each is powered by a team of 20.
The race is based on an ancient Asian legend, said Melinda Parsons of the Hong Kong Government office in New York. Around 400 B.C., Qu Yuan, a court minister who was loved by the people but not by the king, was banished. For a time, he wandered about the countryside, writing poetry, but he eventually decided to drown himself in a river. Local fishermen raced to save him, but in vain. Their rescue dash is re-enacted in the dragon boat race.
Six boats will race today, and the championship will be decided next Sunday.
Hong Kong Boat Festival, Meadow Lake in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park; today, 1 P.M. to 4 P.M., and next Sunday, 11 A.M. to 5 P.M.; free; (212) 629-0370.

Washington: Not Just Another Big City?

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
DESPITE the gloss and pomp of its Federal superstructure, the nation's capital offers as much urban pathology as Detroit and New York City. Underneath a patina furnished by museums and monuments, the city has lurched from mayoral scandals to fiscal crises, with high rates of crime, homelessness and teen-age pregnancy. The capital, in the view of some Republicans, represents the failed liberal agenda writ large.
 So it was all the more remarkable last week that Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, attended a town meeting at a local high school to emphasize his commitment to rejuvenate the capital and make it a model of urban policy. He says he is receptive to ideas that cost money, whether they involve hiring more police officers or giving special tax breaks to city residents. 
 At the same time that the Speaker affirmed his desire to remodel the District, House Republicans were cutting housing assistance and education and job programs that funnel billions of dollars a year into distressed inner-city neighborhoods like those in Washington.
 How to reconcile these disparate efforts is a mystery. Mr. Gingrich, who recognizes that Congress has a special responsibility for the District, says his vision is to make Washington "the best capital city in the world" by 2000. His ideas applied elsewhere in the country would cost tens of billions of dollars, and he would be seeking more money, not less, for the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
 Mr. Gingrich appointed a task force of House Republicans to brainstorm for new ideas on education, housing, crime, welfare and taxes in the capital. One panel member, Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island, said: "It is inescapable that this city is going to require an infusion of Federal dollars to meet the challenge of making it the best capital city in the world. It's not going to happen simply through regulatory changes and cheerleading."
 Even as Republicans were lavishing attention on Washington, the House passed an appropriations bill last week that cuts the budget of the Housing Department by 26 percent, to $19.4 billion next year from $26.1 billion. The bill would cut assistance for homeless people by 39 percent, to $676 million from $1.1 billion, and money for the renovation of public housing would be reduced 32 percent, to $2.5 billion from $3.7 billion.

 
 
Few Specifics as Yet
 The House also passed a spending bill for the Labor Department that would eliminate the summer jobs program for disadvantaged youth. President Clinton had requested $958 million. Democrats said the program teaches work habits to teen-agers and helps keep peace in the cities, but the House Appropriations Committee said it found no evidence that it produced any lasting improvement in employment or earnings.
 At Wednesday's town meeting, Mr. Gingrich listened more than he talked. He promised "significant tax relief" for city residents and said he would seek "increases in resources" for the city, but he offered few specifics.
 "I have to applaud the systematic way the Speaker has generated ideas for Washington," Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said recently. "I wish he would widen his vision and encourage the same kind of innovation across the country."
 The capital's tax base has been eroding and its population is declining. After two decades of home rule, Congress has revoked some of the powers it granted the city, whose residents say they suffer taxation without full representation. In April, Congress created a financial control board capable of overruling actions of the Mayor and City Council that would exacerbate the city's current fiscal emergency.
 "The great virtue of the fiscal crisis," Mr. Gingrich said, "is that it forces people to confront the scale of the problem and creates an opportunity for us to rethink the future of Washington."
 While the Speaker was ferreting out ways to revitalize the capital, Republican troops under his command passed the housing bill. Mayor Dennis W. Archer of Detroit, a Democrat, said the measure would be "devastating to every major city in the United States."

 
 
Words and Deeds
Mr. Cisneros said that the Republicans were cutting welfare, food stamps, child care and child nutrition programs, as well as housing assistance. Taken together, he said, these bills will "draw jobs, private investment and income out of inner-city neighborhoods," at the very time Mr. Gingrich says he is trying to stimulate private investment and employment in Washington.
 The Speaker recently invited the nation's mayors to join him in writing a "contract with the cities," after the Contract With America, the manifesto that set the agenda for House Republicans in their first 100 days this year. Cities, he said, might keep 20 percent of any savings that result from more efficient operation of local programs, or from the elimination of "stupid" Federal mandates and requirements.
 Washingtonians who are skeptical of the Speaker suggest that he is exploiting the city and its Mayor, Marion S. Barry Jr., to show that Republicans have an urban agenda and harbor no racial bias. But Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington's nonvoting delegate in the House of Representatives, who introduced Mr. Gingrich to the audience Wednesday, appears to have become a true believer.
 "This is an overwhelmingly liberal, Democratic town," Mrs. Norton said. "Gingrich is our opposite politically." But, she said, "the ultraconservative Speaker" has repeatedly shown that he is willing to help "the ultraliberal District," as he did last week when the House passed a bill to inject extra highway money into the nearly bankrupt city.
 George E. Peterson, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research center here, said "there's a potential inconsistency" between the Republicans' solicitude for the capital and their crusade to cut spending on urban programs elsewhere. The Speaker says many of those programs have failed, but he clearly views Washington as a special case, requiring new approaches and resources.

Business Often Goes to the Swift, Not the Best

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
IT was Emerson, by most accounts, who said: Build a better mousetrap, and the world will beat a path to your door. And for a nation of optimists, inventors and entrepreneurs, the maxim embraces an American ideal -- smarts and hard work will be rewarded.
 Woolly-headed nonsense, according to some leading economists. "It's naive to believe that efficient engineering solutions win in the marketplace," declares Paul A. David, a professor at Stanford University and a senior research fellow at Oxford University's All Souls College. "That view is not supported by the study of history." 
 The notion that markets make winners of second-best technology appears perverse. But one of the most telling examples, it seems, is now making its way to the marketplace with a vengeance: Windows 95, a new software program from the Microsoft Corporation, is scheduled to go on sale Aug. 24. Yet as a media phenomenon, it has already become the business world's equivalent of the O.J. Simpson trial, written, discussed and scrutinized endlessly.
 The fuss is because Windows 95 is the lastest version of an industry standard -- Microsoft's operating system software, which runs more than 80 percent of the world's personal computers. Though the product is not yet on the shelves, reviewers have given Windows 95 high marks for being a big improvement for most computer users, making PC's less frustrating to use and able to do more. Windows 95 is so good, they agree, that it is almost like Apple's decade-old Macintosh system.
 So why is Microsoft's Windows the industry standard while Apple's Macintosh is a distant also-ran? The search for answers to such questions has spawned a cottage industry of economists who try to explain not only the seeming paradox of personal-computer software but also why keyboards use the qwerty format (the first six letters), why the VHS format prevailed in videocassette tapes, why light-water reactors were used in nuclear power plants and why alternating current is used to transmit electric power.
 Sometimes, these economists say, the best product lost in the marketplace, and at other times the success of the winner did not hinge on superior design or performance. Instead, they talk of "network effects," "increasing returns markets," "path dependencies" and "leverage." In layman's terms, history and luck have a lot to do with the outcome.
 This school of thought seems an affront to market economics. The "invisible hand" of the marketplace, if not moral, is at least supposed to be ruthlessly efficient. Still, there is a logic to why some products become industry standards even when they are not necessarily superior to alternatives. Initially, the product may have benefited from more aggressive marketing or missteps by rivals. Later, the advantages of being ahead snowball, insuring that consumers flock to the leader.
Microsoft's Windows, which was introduced in 1985, has certainly been a beneficiary of that logic. Microsoft sold its software far more successfully than Apple to companies, the big growth market for personal computers until recently. As its dominance grew, Microsoft's operating system became the standard that more and more software applications, from word processing to E-mail, were written to run on, which in turn attracted more users. A major advantage to using Windows was that "everybody else was" -- inferior or not, it became the common language of computing.

 
 
The Qwerty Factor
 The same principle of "self-reinforcing advantage" that helps explain choices in technology, says Paul Krugman, a Stanford economist, can also be used to explain why industries are clustered in certain places. Or why cities, like New York and Chicago, continue to thrive long after their original economic rationale has disappeared.
 Silicon Valley, Mr. Krugman notes, is best suited for growing apricots. "There is nothing in the soil or air that makes it ideal to make microchips here," he said. But once the industry got started in the early 1970's, a skilled labor pool, networks of specialized suppliers and a community of people sharing ideas all combined to insure that the heart of the semiconductor industry and then software makers would reside in Silicon Valley. Mr. Krugman tells of similar blend of clustering that resulted in 80 percent of America's carpet-making industry being located around Dalton, Ga.
 The way chance and history can determine winners is what Mr. Krugman calls "the world of qwerty."
 The man responsible for securing qwerty a respectable place in economic history was Mr. David, the Stanford and Oxford scholar, who wrote a minor classic entitled "Clio and the Economics of Qwerty," published in the American Economics Review in 1985.
 In it, Mr. David presents some of the well-known history of the typewriter. The qwerty typewriter was designed by a Milwaukee printer, Christopher Latham Sholes, and introduced in the 1870's. The keyboard layout was designed partly to insure that typebars would not jam if the operator typed too quickly. And the second row contained all the letters needed to peck out the brand name: TYPE WRITER.
 Rival designs surfaced during the typewriter boom of the 1880's, like the so-called Ideal keyboard, which placed in the home row the sequence DHIATENSOR, which is said to be the 10 letters needed to spell 70 percent of the words in the English language. Later, in 1932 August Dvorak and W.L. Dealey patented another keyboard arrangement, the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard, which has devotees to this day and holds many records for speed typing.
 The key to qwerty's success, Mr. David says, was the use of its keyboard format by schools teaching touch typing in the late 1880's. Qwerty's use in training made it the standard, which sharply increased the costs and inconvenience of switching to another, more efficient system.
 Yet the qwerty doctrine has now brought a revisionist attack from Stan Liebowitz, an economist at the University of Texas management school, and Stephen E. Margolis, an economist at North Carolina State University. They raise doubts about the claims that alternative keyboards, especially the Dvorak, were superior. In fact, one study in the 1940's by the Navy was conducted under the auspices of a time-motion expert, Lt. Commander August Dvorak. "Paul David tells a great story," said Mr. Liebowitz. "It just turns out to be wrong."
 Mr. David replies that his critics may be right on some details, but he insists that his qwerty conclusion remains unchallenged. "The game was already over by 1910," he said. "Qwerty was the de facto standard."
 The story of the Beta and the VHS has another theme: Beta came first, and to this day some say it was superior. But the VHS offered two hours of recording time instead of the Beta's one. Sony changed its Beta, but not fast enough.
 And the mousetrap? Well, it turns out that people are constantly coming up with new mousetrap patents. Some have made inroads, but none has apparently supplanted the basic standard yet.
 In 1988, Claude Coots, a textile worker in Mentone, Ala., patented the Electric Mouse Exterminator, which is a small rectangular box with an entrance at one end, bait at the other and an electrical killing mechanism. Mr. Coots, now 65 and retired, tells a sad story of unreliable partners, business mistakes and an investment lost.
 "It was a better mousetrap," he said, "but everybody gave up on it."

Resurgent Nuclear Theory: More Fear, More Peace

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FIFTY years after the nuclear age dawned with a blinding flash and a mushroom cloud over the ruins of Hiroshima, the debate persists: are nuclear weapons a deterrent to war or a mortal danger to mankind?
 The issue was joined at the outset. Just a few weeks after the bombing of Nagasaki vaporized huge swaths of a second Japanese city, the University of Chicago held a conference to weigh the consequences. Only one of those who attended, an economist, believed the spread of nuclear weapons to more nations would make wars less likely. 
 Now, the consensus has shifted a bit. It is clear that in the 20th century, mankind has been able to develop devastating new weapons -- atomic, biological, chemical -- and to forgo them in subsequent conflicts. Perhaps by luck, perhaps because it was the only rational outcome, the balance of terror has held fast.
 With that in mind, an increasing number of thinkers are challenging the conventional wisdom, which holds that the spread of nuclear weapons is unassailably evil and must be combatted through diplomacy, law enforcement and covert intelligence operations.
 Perhaps a gradual enlargement of the nuclear club, these scholars argue, might not be such a bad thing for the world's security. Why wouldn't the "mutually assured destruction" that constrained war between Moscow and Washington have the same effect on regional conflicts? On what grounds can industrialized nations continue to argue that only they have the right to nuclear weapons?
 "The risks that people see in the spread of nuclear weapons are vastly exaggerated," said Shai Feldman, a professor at Harvard University, who argued in a widely discussed 1982 book that Israel should make explicit its nuclear threat and then trade peace for land. There is no reason, Mr. Feldman argues, to believe that nuclear deterrence cannot be effective in guaranteeing peace in the Middle East, or between India and Pakistan.
 That view is heresy to most American officials. All the world's major powers, and a generation of Republican and Democratic Administrations, have embraced the imperatives of preventing proliferation.
 After the Persian Gulf war, American officials shuddered at the thought that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi Army had been just a year or two away from being able to detonate a crude nuclear bomb. The Clinton Administration has labored hard to frustrate the nuclear programs of North Korea, Iran, Iraq and Libya, and has embarked on an ambitious program to prevent Russia's nuclear weapons from falling into the wrong hands. President Clinton has made countering proliferation one of its top foreign policy priorities, and his aides saw the recent extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty as a triumph.
 Kenneth Waltz, a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley, takes another view. One of the most ardent advocates of the view that "more is better" when it comes to nuclear weapons, Mr. Waltz contends in the new book "The Spread of Nuclear Weapons: A Debate" that wars break out when leaders miscalculate the risks and that the spread of nuclear weapons "makes war less likely."
 Mr. Waltz's argument begins with concept of deterrence, an idea that has dominated strategic thinking since the first tribes of men went to war with sticks and arrows. Simply put, it means: I will refrain from attacking you if I am certain that retaliation will be inescapable and more painful than I am willing to bear. Conventional arms are less of a deterrent than nuclear arms, Mr. Waltz and others contend, because the harm they inflict is less certain and easier to withstand.
 By this reasoning, Pakistan's progress in building nuclear weapons, which was resisted by American officials at every turn, can be cast as a step toward stability for the sub-continent, not a threat of even greater carnage. (Both Pakistan and India deny that they have nuclear weapons; American intelligence officials believe that both countries maintain an arsenal that could be quickly deployed in a crisis.)
 This argument assumes that any new members of the nuclear club would behave rationally and use the nuclear deterrent to achieve their "objective" interests. It also downplays the chance of accidental attacks, miscalculation by military officers or theft by terrorists.
 As for the leaders of what are sometimes called rogue nations -- Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, Saddam Hussein of Iraq and the like -- Mr. Waltz sees canny survivors unlikely to court the retribution of the nuclear powers by exploding a bomb or two.
 These assertions respond to an unspoken but essential aspect of the West's nuclear policy: we can be trusted with nukes, but you can't.
 That policy, some say, is founded on the ethnocentric view that less industrialized nations cannot be trusted to act with the same restraint as the United States, Britain, France, China or Russia.
 "The whole notion is that you have five nuclear powers and they're responsible, but God forbid if any other country becomes a nuclear power," said Mr. Feldman. "These are semi-racial assumptions that the advanced world can handle these things, and the primitive world is not able to."
 There are, to be sure, some powerful arguments for limiting access to nuclear weapons.
 Gary Milhollin of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control said that each new country that obtains nuclear weapons increases the danger that a terrorist might be able to steal a warhead and detonate it in a major city.
 "The mere fact that you have it means it can get out of control," said Mr. Milhollin. "That's the real risk, that weapons will be stolen, or that persons will use them without authority, or that irresponsible leaders will take over. The big risk is the loss of control. That risk is greater than any gain in deterrence."
 Scott D. Sagan of Stanford University concurs. In "The Spread of Nuclear Weapons," in which he alternates chapters with Mr. Waltz -- and reaches diametrically opposite conclusions from largely the same body of evidence -- Mr. Sagan insists that "more will be worse."

 
 
Stumbling to War
 Where Mr. Waltz sees reliably rational leaders with their hands on the button, Mr. Sagan believes that armies, with their inflexible routines, parochial interests and shared biases, are likely to blunder into war sooner or later.
 He worries that new nuclear nations might be tempted to launch first strikes, just as some officers in the American military considered the possibility of attacking the Soviet Union when the United States still enjoyed an overwhelming advantage in nuclear weapons.
 Nuclear newcomers do not have the elaborate safeguards that the industrialized nations have put in place to prevent accidents, guarantee civilian control and avert thefts of warheads.
 "Nuclear weapons do not produce perfect nuclear organizations," Mr. Sagan writes. "They only make their inevitable mistakes more deadly."

 
 
Should We Share?
 The threat of accidents -- a mad soldier setting off a bomb, a rogue commander ordering a first strike -- raises a difficult question for the world's industrial nations. Should they share with nuclear neophytes the sophisticated technology they have developed to guarantee what the military terms "command and control?" For now, export of such equipment is closely restricted.
 "What characterizes these nations is that they are very backward in command and control," said Benjamin Frankel, the editor of the Washington quarterly Security Studies. "We could give the North Koreans electronic devices that would make their central control much more secure."
 Mr. Frankel said the first atomic bombs were a technological achievement. Today, any of 45 nations with modern scientific capacities could build a bomb in a matter of months. "It is illusion," he said, "to think the genie is not out of the bottle."

HEADLINE: Word for Word / The McLibel Trial;
Your Lordship, They Both Think They Have a Legitimate Beef

BYLINE: By TOM KUNTZ 

 BODY:
PITY America's court junkies: About the best they can hope for in juridical diversion is the mostly grim O.J. trial. Britain, on the other hand, has the frequently farcical "McLibel" case -- the lawsuit filed by McDonald's against two vegetarian environmentalists on the unemployment dole who distributed a leaflet some years back implicating the American burger chain in a variety of greed-driven crimes against earth, humankind and beast. While not televised, the libel proceedings offer, to those spectators willing to endure long bouts of tedious testimony, moments of high absurdity as world views collide: It's the (sometimes) bewigged lawyers and suited executives of McDonald's versus the defendants in jeans and sandals, who are representing themselves. The defendants -- Dave Morris, 41, a former postal worker, and Helen Steel, 29, a gardener -- say they have succeeded in turning the tables on McDonald's in court by putting its practices on trial. Many evidently agree: McDonald's stockholders have complained that the trial -- the longest libel trial in British history at 13 months and counting -- is a costly public-relations disaster, and the company has reportedly pursued a settlement. Here are excerpts. TOM KUNTZ 
 This is from the original leaflet at issue in the case, distributed in the mid-1980's by the defendants' obscure environmental group, called London Greenpeace:
 McDollars, McGreedy, McCancer, McMurder, McDisease, McProfits, McDeadly, McHunger, McRipoff, McTorture, McWasteful, McGarbage.
 This leaflet is asking you to think for a moment about what lies behind McDonald's clean, bright image. It's got a lot to hide. . . .
 . . . including, according to the leaflet, McDonald's responsibility for the destruction of rain forests . . .
 McDonald's and Burger King are two of the many U.S. corporations using lethal poisons to destroy vast areas of Central American rain forest to create grazing pastures for cattle to be sent back to the States as burgers and pet food . . .
 . . . malnutrition . . .
 What they don't make clear is that a diet high in fat, sugar, animal products and salt . . . and low in fiber, vitamins and minerals -- which describes an average McDonald's meal -- is linked with cancers of the breast and bowel, and heart disease. . . .
 . . . not to mention worker exploitation, animal cruelty -- and the brainwashing of children:
 . . . Thousands of young children now think of burgers and chips every time they see a clown with orange hair.
 In November 1990, McDonald's said enough is enough and filed suit. After years of preliminary hearings, the case was ready for trial in June 1994. The company explained its position in a flyer, "Why McDonald's Is Going to Court," distributed in Britain beforehand:
 *[The leaflet] contains many statements about McDonald's which are NOT TRUE AND HIGHLY DAMAGING.
 *The leaflet has been distributed worldwide since 1984. Its contents have been repeated in the media, schools and even a church magazine.
 *During that period, the group has ignored several requests from McDonald's to stop publishing the leaflet.
 *As a last resort, McDonald's is going to court to prove that the contents of the leaflet are untrue and to stop its publication.
 *This action is not about freedom of speech; it is about the right to stop people telling lies.
 Under British libel law, the burden is on defendants to prove that what was printed was true (while plaintiffs in the United States need to prove damaging assertions false). Saddled with this seeming disadvantage, the hard-up defendants (backed by an international McLibel Support Campaign) nevertheless have been able to ventilate their charges, examining scores of witnesses. On July 19, 1994, there was this exchange between Miss Steel and Paul Preston, President of McDonald's in Britain:
 Miss Steel: This may sound like a silly question, but what is the purpose of Ronald McDonald?
 Mr. Preston: He is a spokesman to children.
 Q. For what reason?
 A. An advertising symbol . . . He is a character who has become known and loved with children on many fronts in an educational sense, synonymous with McDonald's, the food, the fun involved. . . .
 Q. Is that part of what is known as "the McDonald's experience"? . . .
 A. I think for young children [in the] 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-year-old age group, I would say it is very much a part of the experience. All you have to do is watch one of his magic shows. . . . It becomes blatantly clear what power he has in terms of an educational, influencing factor on young people.
 Q. What about an influencing factor in terms of what those children might eat?
 A. Well, certainly he is a factor. If he promotes McDonald's, he is obviously there to help promote the business.
 Q. Right. So . . . you are using Ronald McDonald to sell your products directly to children?
 A. Ronald McDonald does not sell food. Ronald McDonald is seen in restaurants. He does not sell large boxes of fries or Big Macs. He never has to children. He has never been seen in a McDonald's advertisement selling big sandwiches, big fries, drinks to children ever once. . . .
 Q. You mentioned a large Coke or a large fries. What about medium Coke or medium fries?
 A. Never. He has never been used with anything other than hamburger, cheeseburger, soft drink, Happy Meal, to my knowledge, anywhere . . .
 Q. So you are using him to sell food?
 A. He is associated with food but . . . has never said: "Kids, come in, buy this" -- never.
 Q. But that is the purpose.
A. The purpose is to promote McDonald's.
 Q. Yes, but McDonald's sells food? . . .
 And last Dec. 8, there was this exchange between the defendants and Edward Oakley, senior vice president of McDonald's in Britain, over a McDonald's pamphlet on nutrition:
 Miss Steel: Going over to the third page: "To help all our customers eat healthily, we are constantly making our menu even more nutritious." Is the implication of that that your menu was nutritious in the first place?
 Mr. Oakley: It certainly contains all the nutrients you need in a daily diet.
 Q. All of them?
 A. Well, I am not aware of any that it does not contain.
 Q. In the amounts that you need?
 A. Not in the amounts that you need. We are not claiming that. You have to balance the diet to get the correct amount . . .
 Q. What do you mean by nutritious?
 A. Foods that contain nutrients.
 Q. That is what it means?
 A. Yes. . . .
Mr. Morris: Over the page it says : "Every time you eat at McDonald's you will be eating good nutritious food." If I go into McDonald's and buy a milk shake and take it away, that is eating good nutritious food?
 A. Yes, there are a lot of nutrients in a milk shake.
 Q. If I just go in and have some chips [french fries], that is good nutritious food?
 A. Potatoes are a good source of nutrients, yes. . . .
 Miss Steel: Is there any food you know of that is not nutritious?
 A. I do not know if you would call it food or not, but you could put up an argument for black coffee or black tea or mineral water.
 Q. Right.
 A. On their own.
 Q. What about Coca-Cola?
 A. Coca-Cola has a good source of energy, no question of that.
 Q. So you think it is nutritious then?
 A. Yes, it can be.
 The trial, now in recess, resumes next month and is expected to drag into 1996 before a ruling by the long-suffering presiding Justice, Rodger Bell. Not everyone is amused, least of all taxpayers upset over the cost. "Anyone who doubts the need for reform of the law of libel should pay a visit to the Royal Courts of Justice in London's Strand," The Economist wrote of the trial.

HEADLINE: University Ponders Unabom Link

BYLINE: By DON TERRY 

DATELINE: EVANSTON, Ill., Aug. 5

 BODY:
The search for a deadly serial bomber has crisscrossed the country for 16 years but it always seems to return to the sedate campus of Northwestern University here, the place where the manhunt began with questions about Dungeons and Dragons.
The F.B.I. started poking around Northwestern, just outside of Chicago, in 1979. A simple bomb, rigged in a cigar box, exploded inside the school's technological institute on May 9 and a graduate student was slightly injured. 
 Few seemed to take the incident too seriously. The Chicago Tribune wrote a six-paragraph story about the bomb and buried the article on page 11 of section two, even though another small but more sophisticated device had exploded the year before, injuring a university security guard.
In the coming years, however, the explosions would be considered by the authorities as the first acts of the elusive terrorist in the investigation known as the Unabomb case, who says, in a 35,000-word manifesto, that he is bent on the overthrow of the "industrial-technological system."
But when the agents first arrived in 1979 on the campus , spread out across 240 acres along the gleaming Lake Michigan shore, they found a hotbed of political inactivity.
They had a hard time finding clues about the bomber's identity in the campus's political organizations. The passions and protests of the 1960's rarely gripped Northwestern as tightly as they did other campuses in the Midwest and by the last days of the 70's many people figured the cigar box bomb had probably been more personal than political.
"Northwestern has never been Berkeley," said Professor Henry C. Binford, who has taught history at the university since 1973. "My reaction to the '79 bomb was that it might have been some overly ambitious chemistry student, not that it was the beginning of a campaign of terror."
The F.B.I. seemed to agree. As one professor remembers it, the agents did not ask a lot of questions about Marx or Lenin or neo-Nazi's. They wanted to know about any students who were obsessed with the fantasy game Dungeons and Dragons, assuming perhaps, that the bomber was playing a game instead of making a statement.
No one knows if the bomber ever attended Northwestern or worked there. But the university cannot seem to shake itself free of the case that has frustrated dozens of F.B.I. agents, injured 23 people and killed 3 others from California to New Jersey.
Several weeks ago, Thomas R. Tyler, a professor of social psychology at the University of California at Berkeley, received a package in the mail. It contained a manuscript similar to the 35,000-word manifesto sent to The New York Times.
From 1978 to 1990, Mr. Tyler taught at Northwestern.
In the last few weeks, Federal agents have been back on campus. This time they have been showing professors at Northwestern, and several other universities, copies of the bomber's manifesto, hoping that his writing style will jog a former professor's memory, especially those teaching the history of science.
What Patrick M. Quinn, the university's archivist since 1974, remembers about the days the bomber was thought to have been at the university is how quiet they were politically.
"It was almost like the return of the 1950's to Northwestern," Mr. Quinn said. "Fraternities were coming back strong and R.O.T.C. was restored to legitimacy."
In 1978, the year the bomber apparently started down his path of postal terrorism, an article in The Daily Northwestern declared, "Individuality is dead."
"After a short-lived life in the 60's of ad hoc clothes, life styles and heroes," the article said, "conformity is back."
In a "viewpoints" column, a senior wrote that he was glad to see that most of the "More-Radical-Than-Thou" students of earlier years had been replaced by a freshmen class "seen as somewhat right wing."
What political activism existed in the late 70's on campus was of a smaller scale and quieter than in years past. Students still came out to protest and picket but not nearly as many as in the early days of the decade when Vietnam was still eating away a generation.
Although the passions had cooled considerably, among the issues that still comprised political activity were the fight over the Equal Rights Amendment, the knocking down of closet doors by gays and lesbians and the beginning of a demand that the university divest itself from South Africa.
Professor Binford, who specializes in urban history but has also taught the history of technology, said that when he read lengthy excerpts of the bomber's manifesto he could "see issues that were alive in the late 70's, alive in his mind."
"Here at Northwestern and across the country, there was a lot of questioning of the unthinking use of technology," the professor said. "It was not uncommon for people to debate the consequences of unrestrained economic growth. There was a lot of talk about trying to make industrial manufacturing more humane."
But Bernard Beck, a professor of sociology at Northwestern since 1965, said the late 70's were the beginning of the birth of the conservative movement on campus, a rightward turn inward.
"Students were warming up to what would become the Reagan Revolution," Mr. Beck said. "The idea and politics of life-style choices had taken hold at that time. Those were the notorious days of malaise."
Then a bomb went off.

HEADLINE: White House Seeks Areas of Welfare Accord With G.O.P.

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Clinton Administration officials today itemized their objections to the welfare bill backed by Senate Republican leaders and proposed changes to make the bill more palatable to President Clinton.
Mr. Clinton, who promised in the 1992 campaign to "end welfare as we know it," said he opposed the Republican bill in its current form and preferred an alternative devised by the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota. 
 But in documents analyzing the Republican bill, Administration officials suggested that it might be made acceptable with some significant changes. As the Senate prepared for major debate on the issue, Mr. Clinton said today in his weekly radio address that he hoped to see "a bipartisan agreement."
Cataloguing its objections to the bill, the Administration said it would not guarantee child care for people forced to work and could encourage states to save money by throwing people off welfare.
The bill would set a time limit on welfare, stipulating that no child could receive cash assistance for a total of more than five years. The Administration said that this restriction would eventually terminate Federal welfare benefits for 3.9 million of the 10 million children receiving such aid. Those estimates are within the range suggested by the Congressional Budget Office.
In a draft of the official statement of Administration policy, the White House suggests four amendments to the bill. The amendments would encourage states to continue spending their own money on welfare and would earmark money for child care and job programs, which in the bill are lumped together with cash assistance for poor people.
In addition, the White House says Congress should reward states that move people from welfare to work, and should guarantee more money for states that experience increases in unemployment or population. The bill would set aside some money for such purposes, but the White House said it was inadequate.
The House passed a comprehensive bill to redesign the nation's welfare programs in March, and Senate Republicans have been trying to write a companion bill since then. The Republican bill, introduced by the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, has 31 of 54 Republican Senators as co-sponsors.
"When all the talking is done," Mr. Dole said, "I believe we will pass legislation that will transform the welfare system from a failed system into one that succeeds in providing work, hope and opportunity to Americans in need." He predicted that some Democrats would ultimately vote for his bill.
But at the moment, Mr. Dole finds himself in a crossfire of criticism from Republicans who are more conservative than he is and from Democrats who are more liberal.
In the draft of its official comments, the White House said it opposed Mr. Dole's bill because it "falls short of the central goal of real welfare reform, moving people from welfare to work." Moreover, it said, the bill "does not provide the level of child care resources necessary to support the imposition of tough work requirements."
Mr. Clinton does not explicitly threaten to veto the welfare bill, as he has threatened to veto other Republican bills. Nor does he insist that Congress preserve welfare as an open-ended entitlement, available to any families that meet criteria set by Federal and state laws.
Mr. Dole's bill would give each state a fixed amount of Federal money, or block grant, to aid the poor. From 1996 through 2000, the total amount of Federal cash assistance would be frozen at $16.8 billion a year, the same amount spent in 1994.
Mr. Dole's bill would require states to move half of their adult welfare recipients into jobs by 2000. At present, fewer than 10 percent of the five million adults on welfare are employed.
"Child care is not guaranteed under the Republican plan," the Administration says in its analysis of the Dole bill. As a result, it says, states that choose to provide child care so welfare recipients can take jobs would have less money available to provide cash benefits for their poorest citizens.
In short, the Administration says, "states will have to make tough choices between providing child care, enforcing work requirements and insuring a safety net for poor families." But Mr. Dole and other Republicans say that state officials will make much better choices than Federal officials have made.
States and counties now contribute 43 percent of all the money spent on the main cash welfare program, Aid to Families With Dependent Children. Mr. Dole's bill would eliminate a longstanding requirement that states spend their own money as a condition of getting Federal money.
Without such a requirement, the White House says, "many states could be expected to withdraw their own funds, cut benefits, purge large numbers of current recipients from the rolls and avoid the burden of helping people become self-sufficient."
In his own welfare bill last year, Mr. Clinton proposed terminating welfare benefits for people who refused to work. But the White House says the time limit in Mr. Dole's bill is "unduly harsh" because it "would not provide any protection for children when their parents are unable to work due to illness, disability, the need to care for a disabled child or high local unemployment."
Catholic Charities USA expressed a similar concern. In a letter sent today to all Senators, the Rev. Fred Kammer, president of Catholic Charities, said, "We are very concerned that the new work requirements and time limits will leave children without adequate adult supervision while their parents are working or looking for work."
Mr. Dole's bill would tighten eligibility criteria for children seeking disability benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program. The Administration says that 157,000 children, or 18 percent of those on the rolls, would lose cash and medical benefits. In addition, it says, over the next five years, Mr. Dole's bill would deny benefits to 226,000 applicants, or 21 percent of those who would qualify under current law.
In recommending tougher standards, the Senate Finance Committee said that "only needy children with severe disabilities" should receive benefits.
The Administration said it opposed a section of Mr. Dole's bill that would let states take their food stamp money in the form of block grants, with little Federal regulation. States could use the money for food assistance or work programs.
"A food stamp block grant forces states to bear the entire cost of increases in caseload," the Administration said.

HEADLINE: 2 Black G.O.P. Lawmakers in House Differ Slightly on Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
They have been cited by their fellow Republicans as proof that blacks are welcome in their party. They have been vilified by some of their fellow blacks as turncoats. They have been dismissed by some political analysts as irrelevant curiosities.
But as the Republicans struggle for consensus on dealing with the complex issue of affirmative action, everyone is watching Gary A. Franks of Connecticut and J. C. Watts of Oklahoma, the party's two black members of the House of Representatives. 
 Though they generally agree on the desire to abolish some of the more widely criticized facets of affirmative action, like set-asides, they have very different responses to the scrutiny they are receiving.
"There is nothing wrong with it," said Mr. Franks, comparing his situation with that of Vietnam veterans in Congress when the issue is Vietnam or American servicemen still listed as missing in action there. "It's just like McCain and Kerry are looked upon to deal with the P.O.W.-M.I.A situation in Vietnam," a reference to Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, both Vietnam veterans.
But people who ask Mr. Watts if his race and party make him a natural leader in the debate over affirmative action get a more testy response.
"I don't feel any burden to necessarily be the black Republican in this debate," the 37-year-old freshman Congressman said in an interview in his office earlier this week, as he ate a hurried lunch between House votes and committee hearings.
That these lawmakers should react differently, even on an issue on which they essentially agree, is nothing new. Though they are often viewed as two peas in a pod, these two black conservatives have differences, great and small, in background, party loyalty and temperament.
Mr. Franks, 42, who was elected in 1990 as the first black Republican in the House in 56 years, is the son of a millworker but grew up in an affluent white section of Waterbury, Conn., received a bachelor's degree from Yale University, where he was captain of the basketball team, in 1975 and became wealthy as a real estate investor.
Mr. Watts had a dirt-poor childhood in rural Oklahoma; he went to the University of Oklahoma on a football scholarship and became a star quarterback, leading his team to two victories in the Orange Bowl.
Mr. Watts, who came to Congress in the 1994 Republican landslide, was a Democrat until 1989, when he switched parties just months before his first statewide race in Oklahoma. Despite the switch, analysts and lawmakers consider him a consummate team player.
Mr. Franks is a lifelong Republican who has an unpredictable voting record and has shown a willingness to criticize black Democratic lawmakers and his own party's chieftains with equal fervor. His record on environmental issues has earned him a 23 percent approval rating from the League of Conservation Voters in 1992, a 64 percent rating in 1994 and a zero this year. He voted for the Republican welfare plan after accusing Republicans earlier this year of "waging a war on the poor."
Representative Donald M. Payne, a New Jersey Democrat who is chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, called Mr. Franks's voting record "inconsistent" and "bizarre," adding: "He seems to have different votes for different days. The things he does are patternless."
Of Mr. Watts, Mr. Payne said: "J. C. seems to be more self-assured. He knows really what he feels and stands for, and has an approach to try to see that it comes to fruition. That probably comes from his background in athletics, where you study a plan, train for it and execute it."
Mr. Franks and Mr. Watts are also backing different candidates in the Republican Presidential sweepstakes. Mr. Watts is a national co-chairman for the campaign of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader and front-runner in the Republican race. Mr. Franks is a national co-chairman in the campaign of Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, one of Mr. Dole's principal challengers.
And there are subtle differences in the two Congressmen's positions on affirmative action. Both men want to do away with the policy of setting aside contracts for women and minorities, and place other strict limits on policies granting benefits based on race or sex.
"Affirmative action as we know it today is on its last legs," Mr. Watts said. "I say that because I know there are enough votes on the Democratic and Republican sides that affirmative action, as we know it today, will not survive the 104th Congress."
Mr. Franks believes in requiring Federal contractors to try to meet "goals and timetables" in hiring and promoting women and minorities, while Mr. Watts says he is more disposed to scrapping this requirement, too.
For two junior members of the House to wield as much influence as Mr. Franks and Mr. Watts on the issue illustrates how much affirmative action is viewed as a matter that involves minorities, rather than women. It also highlights the fact that, despite Republican gains among black voters, Mr. Franks and Mr. Watts are still anomalies.
"These fellows have been given a platform by the new Republican majority," said Eddie Williams, president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research organization that studies black issues. "They get attention because they are the equivalent of 'man bites dog.' But they represent a narrow band of black thought, and as soon as the platform leaves, they disappear."
While both men express support for each other's efforts, there are, at times, hints of rivalry. Mr. Franks, for example, says that while he opposes set-asides and quotas, he supports anti-discrimination laws and is one of only four Republicans to vote for increasing money for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. At a breakfast interview, Mr. Franks criticized, though not by name, Republicans who voted against increasing spending on the commission and those who did not vote at all on the measure.
"There is no excuse for not voting on something as important to African-Americans as the enforcement of civil rights laws," he said.
Left unsaid is the fact that Mr. Watts missed the vote on financing the commission.
"Sometimes I think Gary is behaving like a rejected suitor," said Mr. Payne, who has had his share of clashes with Mr. Franks. "His rage is that he is no longer -- and I'm not sure he ever was -- the superstar, the only African-American Republican in Congress."
The latest exhibition of Mr. Franks's maverick tendencies came last week, when he said the House Republican leadership had reneged on a promise to support his amendment barring the Government from setting aside a portion of contracts for minorities and women.
Faced with the threat of delaying tactics by Democratic lawmakers on a Defense Department spending bill, to which Mr. Franks's' amendment was to have been attached, Speaker Newt Gingrich, who has urged a go-slow, deliberative approach to dismantling racial and sex preferences, withdrew his support for Mr. Franks's measure.
In a reaction that stunned lawmakers and Congressional staff members, Mr. Franks called Mr. Gingrich a liar who "did not have the stomach" to take on the issue of affirmative action, unusually harsh words by a backbencher for the leader of his party in the House. This week Mr. Franks gave no sign that he regretted his sharp remarks.
"I don't mind confrontation," he said in the interview. "I think that's what we're here to do. We're here to shake things up. We're here to make a difference. You don't make a difference by procrastinating. You make a difference by saying to people, 'This is what I believe and I'm willing to fight for it.' "
True to form, Mr. Watts said he agreed with the thrust of Mr. Franks's measure to outlaw set-asides. But the Oklahoma lawmaker also said that attaching such a measures to a spending bill was not the way to accomplish that goal.
"He wanted to to put it on some appropriations legislation before we had any hearings or before we had any chance to talk things through," Mr. Watts said. "I didn't think we were prepared to deliver this product, if you will. I thought we were shooting from the hip as a party. I felt we were not organized or prepared."

HEADLINE: U.S.-Vietnam Ties: War Is Yesterday, Hope Is Today

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Declaring an end to "a decade of war and two decades of estrangement," Secretary of State Warren Christopher arrived here today to open formal diplomatic relations with the Communist leaders of Vietnam, and immediately plunged into talks about turning a former enemy into an emerging trading partner.
In a day constantly haunted by images of a war from which neither side has fully recovered, Mr. Christopher began his visit by witnessing the return of fragmentary remains of four American servicemen who were among the 58,000 who died here. More than a million Vietnamese also died. 
 "A generation ago, the trauma of war bound together the history of our nations for all time," he said, standing against the austere backdrop of "Thud Ridge," the mountain range where scores of American pilots were shot down as they flew bombing runs on Hanoi. "Let us now lay our past of conflict to rest, and dedicate ourselves to a future of productive cooperation."
Those were the words the Vietnamese have waited years to hear, and by midday -- over a luncheon at which his hosts conspicuously served California wine -- there was already talk of trade and tax treaties and investment incentives. The Vietnamese were so eager for quick accords that Mr. Christopher had to send his top economic deputy, Joan Spero, to explain that such agreements can take months or years to draft, and will require major changes in Vietnam's economy.
"They took copious notes," Ms. Spero said later. "They are beginning to understand this will be a detailed process," one that many in Congress will oppose and that many others will insist include specific requirements for vast improvements of Vietnam's dismal record on human rights.
Today there were already signs that the country's leaders would stiffen at any such conditions: Vietnam's urbane Foreign Minister, Nguyen Manh Cam, said at a signing ceremony with Mr. Christopher, at an ornate colonial-era guest house, that a key to the new relationship would be "non-interference in each other's internal affairs."
As Mr. Christopher moved through the center of this increasingly chaotic capital, which is gradually being restored to its old French graciousness, there still seemed to be two Vietnams living side by side: the ideological state that continues to decorate its parks with statues of Lenin, and the bustling, motorbike-choked streets that have brought a vibrancy to this city that was markedly absent just four years ago.
The conflicting images are everywhere. Mr. Christopher met tonight with Vietnam's President, Le Duc Anh, just blocks from the simple wooden house in which Ho Chi Minh and his successors prosecuted the war and wrought political havoc half a world away in America.
The house has been carefully preserved, and both Vietnamese and foreigners visit it daily to see the simple long table where Ho met his generals. A single ancient-looking telephone sits at the end, near his seat, to dispatch commands.
But if the Vietnamese are preserving Ho's home, they are racing to tear apart the other remnants of the war, betting that the documents signed today will clear a wider path for investors. While Mr. Christopher was signing the formal documents establishing diplomatic relations, workers a few blocks away were in the last stages of knocking down one of the city's most notable landmarks, the Hanoi Hilton, where American fliers and other prisoners of war were held for years.
"John McCain's cell was over there, but it was knocked down already," Pham Tu, an official of the cultural affairs ministry, said today, referring to the Arizona Republican Senator whose support of diplomatic recognition helped give President Clinton the political cover he needed to make the move.
Where the prison once stood, a group of local and foreign investors is building two office towers, one 23 stories high and the other 13, making them among the tallest in the city. The block that became a symbol of the terrors of Vietnam is to contain a hotel, a supermarket, a parking lot and offices. A few cells are being preserved in the front as a museum.
To Mr. Christopher, this was a day heavy with history: no American Secretary of State has ever visited Hanoi (though Henry A. Kissinger came here as national security adviser in 1973), and none have set foot anywhere on Vietnamese soil in the quarter of a century since William Rogers traveled to Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, now named Ho Chi Minh City.
Acutely aware that many veterans and relatives of the missing consider Mr. Clinton's diplomatic recognition of Hanoi a betrayal, the Administration carefully orchestrated Mr. Christopher's first day here to focus on the efforts to account for the 1,615 Americans still listed as missing in Vietnam.
"Every one of them is a cherished human being with a name and a family and a nation that cares and this endeavor is a reflection of that deep caring we have for every one who goes into battle," he said at a news conference.
The Vietnamese leaders, while promising continued cooperation on the prisoner issues, made it clear that their focus is intently on the markets and on making up for time lost when America's trade embargo sharply limited the country's ability to grow. They see trade and tax treaties with the United States as the surest way to reassure international investors, and thus the path to building the kind of foundation that turned Thailand and Malaysia into economic powerhouses.
But they want to do so on the Singapore model: letting free markets bloom, but with minimal challenges to central political authority. By some accounts they were perturbed by President Clinton's observation last month that trade benefits often "require certification regarding human rights and labor rights before they can succeed."
It was a subject that Mr. Christopher was not anxious to discuss at length today, perhaps for fear of putting a damper on the celebration. "Today's normalization gives us an added basis for having a human rights dialogue," he said, adding that his Chinese counterpart was "ready to proceed down that road."
"The main thing is that the trend be in the right direction," he said. "I don't want to give a letter grade" to Vietnam on human rights, he said, presumably a reference to the country's sharp controls on press freedom and political opposition.
"This is a great day in Vietnam. We shouldn't miss the significance of this day."

HEADLINE: Experts Debate Proposed Fare Increases

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
The package of fare and toll increases proposed by the Metropolitan Tranportation Authority risks sending damaging ripples through a region that depends more than any other in the nation on public transportation, some urban planners say.
While much of the emerging debate has focused on schoolchildren, who would lose free and half-fare passes under the proposals, experts say other far-reaching effects may be felt -- from potential job losses as corporate executives weigh the cost of doing business in New York City, to increased traffic congestion and pollution as commuters find it cheaper to drive. 
 Economists were loath to predict how the proposed 20 percent increase in subway and bus fares would play out, saying it was too early to tell how transportation patterns would change. To be sure, most adult riders and suburban commuters would probably manage the financial burden, the experts said, just as they have adjusted to previous increases.
Nevertheless, "For any city that depends as much as we do on public transit, this is a very big deal," said Emanuel Tobier, a professor of urban planning at New York University in Manhattan.
"It is impossible to disentangle the precise cause and effect, but this is bound to help persuade companies to leave," he added. "And for poor families with school kids, it is just unthinkable."
But Robert D. Yaro, executive director of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit economic development organization, said that more than a 25-cent increase in subway and bus fares was at stake.
"It's a lot of money for people who might not have a lot of money," he said. "But the biggest issue is having a functioning system for the area. If we end up with a failing system with a low fare, we haven't benefited."
M.T.A. officials have said the increases are needed to close a budget gap for New York City transit and suburban railroads that is expected to grow to $816 million by 1999. But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said the M.T.A. budget can be balanced without raising fares, by trimming fat.
"The plan they came up with isn't even a plan," he said yesterday. "They haven't looked at any of the underlying things they can do to reduce spending."
Most damaging for the New York City economy, Mr. Tobier and others say, is a proposal by the transit agency to eliminate free and half-fare transit passes for New York City schoolchildren. The passes, which have been part of growing up in the city for decades, were given to 497,000 public- and private-school students last year, who qualified because they lived far from their schools or were enrolled in special-education courses.
For a family with two children who hold free fare passes, the economic impact would be harsh: $900 a year in added transportation costs. And the burden would be magnified because huge numbers of New York City's public-school pupils live in poverty.
"It is simply not a fair option to force kids to pay to go to school," said H. Claude Shostal, president of the Regional Plan Association. "At some point, you have to raise fares, but it is bad policy to use school children in a budget gambit."
The bus and subway fare increases, coupled with higher commuter railroad and bridge and tunnel charges, are also bound to be felt in increased traffic and pollution in the city, the experts said.
"It's going to put more cars on the road because people are going to find out that a gallon of gas is cheaper than a subway token," said Mitchell L. Moss, an economist and director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University.
Bridge and tunnel tolls would be increased less sharply than fares for public transit, Mr. Tobier said, further aggravating auto traffic and the difficulties of doing business in the city.
"As it is, we have gridlock, and I think this would create yet another incentive for business to move where driving is easier," he said.
If experience in raising public fares is repeated, the transit agency would also lose ridership if its increases are approved, cutting at least temporarily into the revenue that it needs to close its budget gap.
The fare increase proposal "is just a tax increase on commuters," said Alan G. Hevesi, the New York City Comptroller, who released an analysis yesterday showing that for every 10 cents that bus and subway fares have been increased over the last 25 years, the transit agency has suffered a setback, sometimes only temporary, of 60 million passengers a year.
"New York City cannot afford to lose these riders, whether they be lost to other forms of transportation or to the city's economy," Mr. Hevesi said.

HEADLINE: Pataki Signs Bill to Study Job Loss Due to Domestic Violence

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki has signed a bill that could pave the way for awarding unemployment benefits to people, mostly women, who lose their jobs because they are victims of domestic violence.
The bill, intended as the first step in a two-part process of changing the current law, would seem to run contrary to Mr. Pataki's general aim of restricting government benefits rather than expanding them. In fact, several people involved in negotiations said his aides had sent strong signals that he might veto the bill because of concern about cost. 
 But, after what people in both parties described as an intense lobbying effort from crime-victims' groups, on Thursday the Governor signed the bill, which had broad legislative support from both parties.
The bill is deceptively simple. In three short paragraphs, it instructs the Department of Labor and other state agencies to study the issue and determine how many abused women seek unemployment benefits and report back to the Legislature by Jan. 15.
But depending on what the study finds, the bill sponsors say, the intent is to draft a second law next year directing the state to pay unemployment benefits in certain cases. Now, residents may collect benefits only if they lose their job through no fault of their own, not if they leave voluntarily.
"It gives them help in dealing with the economic aspect of this problem, which is a far more serious aspect of it than most people realize," said Assemblyman Daniel L. Feldman, Democrat of Brooklyn and co-sponsor of the bill.
The Republican sponsor, Senator Michael Hoblock of Albany County, said the study is an attempt by the state to determine how many people leave jobs because they are too injured to work or are afraid that a partner will track them down at the office, for example. He said he saw no contradiction with the Republican philosophy of shrinking eligibility for benefits.
"I don't think there is any intent here to cut benefits for the sake of cutting benefits," he said. "The whole goal and objective here is to become efficient, economical and to insure that whatever limited resources there are go to the most deserving."
Making it a two-part process, he said, came out of fear that Mr. Pataki or lawmakers would dismiss the initiative out of hand because of fiscal problems this year. At least four other states have similar rules, and the two-phased track is similar to the way Minnesota instituted its regulations in 1993.
Minnesota officials said they had seen few such cases since then, and the policy has had no effect on the costs of unemployment insurance.
Christopher Chichester, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, said he did not know of any reservations Governor Pataki had about the bill. But he seemed to allow the possibility for opposing an expansion of benefits in the future, though that could leave him open to charges that he was abandoning battered women after endorsing a study aimed at changing the law.
"The Governor signed a bill to study the relationship between domestic violence and job dislocation," Mr. Chichester said. "The bill does not conflict with the Governor's goal of streamlining government, because the bill language does not expand eligibility for unemploment benefits."
Maria Imperial, general counsel for Victims Services, a private, nonprofit organization, said a 1987 study by the organization showed that 56 percent of battered women reported going to work late at least five times a month because of the abuse. The study also showed that 74 percent of abused women were harassed at work by their partner, either in person or by phone.
Ms. Imperial said any expansion of unemployment benefits would be most helpful for women who are not on public assistance and could help them relocate to find another job. "It would help keep women self-sufficient," she said.
She said the study would be useful even if it did not result in granting unemployment benefits because it could lead to a greater involvement by employers in the lives of abused employees. "Domestic violence isn't a private issue and looking at how it affects the workplace makes it more of a public issue," she said.

HEADLINE: A New Group Will Accredit Some Colleges

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
The Federal Department of Education, in an unusual decision, has granted a group of tradition-minded scholars the authority to judge and accredit liberal-arts colleges.
The organizers of the group, called the American Academy for Liberal Education, say their aim is to turn the liberal arts curriculum away from faddish courses and back to solid surveys in literature, history and philosophy that were typical core courses 30 years ago. 
 Among the organizers are prominent academics like Edwin O. Wilson, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Harvard science professor; Jacques Barzun, the Columbia philosopher and historian, and Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, the Emory historian.
Education Secretary Richard S. Riley late last month formally recognized the Washington-based academy as a national accrediting agency, which means it can now certify institutions as qualified to receive Federal financing, including Stafford student loans and research money.
In a recent interview, Dr. Barzun said he and other scholars founded the academy in 1992 because "students haven't learned to think, and the leading universities are leading us down into a pit."
Jeffrey Wallin, the academy president, said: "One third of all college courses are remedial. The students come illiterate and leave unlearned. We're against the frivolity of higher education. The core curriculum is the basis of the liberal arts curriculum, and it's in disastrous shape."
Currently, colleges and universities become accredited by one of six regional associations. The Middle States agency, for example, accredits the whole range of institutions within its geographical area, from Princeton University to Bronx County Community College. The system has been criticized by educators who say it makes no sense to have strictly regional organizations evaluate such disparate institutions.
The academy is the only other group to be recognized as an accrediting agency. Approval by the academy will not replace accreditation by a regional association, but some institutions will elect to be certified by it rather than a regional group. The academy will also offer its imprimatur so that potential students and their parents will know that a particular institution has a strong core curriculum.
Recognition will be determined by how well the college or university meets 17 standards. The faculty must, for example, emphasize teaching over research; senior faculty must be involved in teaching undergraduate education, and the college must require all its liberal arts students to take broad courses in the sciences, languages, literary classics, philosophy, history, politics, economics and mathematics.
"Specialization is a crime against undergraduates," Professor Barzun said. "What's needed in today's world and what we're trying to develop are people who are quickly adaptable rather than masters of a given subject."
Mr. Wallin said a number of large universities were guilty of giving undergraduates too much choice. He said that at a large Midwestern university there were now some 4,000 courses that qualify for the core curriculum. "It's meaningless," he said.
Some colleges are lining up to get accreditation, a two-year process.
James H. Daughdrill, president of Rhodes College in Memphis, said his college was seeking accreditation from the academy because "we can learn from a group of people devoted to some of the same things that we care about."
One of the most profound questions in education today, he said, is, "Can human interaction -- and life-changing teacher-student experiences -- be done electronically?"
"The academy made us think about that in a way that we hadn't done before," he said. "It made us ask if we may need some intermediate people to form a bridge between the techies in our computer center and teachers."
William Allen, dean of the James Madison College at Michigan State University in East Lansing, said he was seeking accreditation from the academy to help attract a more diverse student body.
"We want more people to know about us so that we can attract students from beyond our immediate area," he said. "We think diversity of the student body will help us to teach what we're trying to teach."
Dr. Barzun said a large part of the academy's work would be to keep colleges honest. "Those glossy statements in the college catalogues usually don't mean a thing. It's advertising for something that may have vanished during the growth of the research syndrome which makes graduate students do most of the teaching."
He added, "Counting the number of Nobel Prizes at an institution may be only recording extinct volcanoes."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Despite Predictions, Astros Stay in Hunt In the N.L. Central

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The recent flurry of trades that sent players, mostly pitchers, scrambling upward in the standings for mostly minor league prospects was viewed generally as a whole lot of salary dumping. Last December, the Houston Astros were accused of executing a similar economic move.
The Astros, who ended last year's abbreviated season half a game from first place, engineered a 12-player swap with the San Diego Padres, shedding two high-salaried players in third baseman Ken Caminiti and center fielder Steve Finley. They would be contenders no more, the consensus concluded. 
 So look who's leading the race for the National League's first wild-card slot in the playoffs. But don't say "wild card" too loudly around Bob Watson. "That's not my goal," Watson, the Astros' general manager, said. "Our goal is to win the division."
The Astros have been in second place in the N.L. Central since June 25, ranging from six and a half to three and a half games behind the Cincinnati Reds. The teams, not recently, have played seven times, and the Reds have won all seven.
"I really believe how we play the next six games with Cincinnati will tell us if we will win the division," Watson said. "We didn't play well the first seven times we played them."
The teams play later this month and again next month. Whatever the outcome of those games or the division race, the Astros already have pulled off one of the major surprises of the season. But don't tell Watson they've been a surprise.
"It's not a surprise to me," Watson said of the team that has the fifth best won-lost record in the majors. "The only thing surprising is that we are not getting the attention we should. But that's nothing new. We're off the beaten track. That's been the history of guys and teams in Houston."
The latest player not to receive the attention he deserves is Derek Bell, one of the six players the Astros received in return for their December salary dump. A 26-year-old outfielder who showed a little power (21 home runs) in 1993 and a little hitting (.311) last year, Bell has been one of the league's top offensive players this year.
Entering last night's games, he was second in runs batted in with 79, tied for first in hits with 127 and third in hitting with a .333 average. Before Jeff Bagwell suffered a broken hand for the third successive season, Bell had joined Bagwell and Craig Biggio as a formidable offensive trio that has helped make the Astros the highest-scoring team in the league.
They also have the fewest shutouts in the league, being held scoreless only by the Mets in their 18th game of the season, May 16.
"When we made the deal, I said it definitely will help us be the contender we want to be," Watson said. "I knew exactly what I was doing. I did my homework. I'd be less than honest if I told you I knew Derek Bell would be leading the league in hits and r.b.i. But I knew he was a solid player."
Watson, once a hitting coach for the Oakland Athletics, is at least in part responsible for making Bell even more solid.
"One of the things I wanted him to do when he came here was come up with a two-strike approach to hitting," the former first baseman related. "He took that to heart as well as another guy I had, Jose Canseco. When he was a 40-40 guy, he hit .385 and 25 home runs and had 80 some ribbies with two strikes. Bell is doing basically the same thing without the homers."
When Bell gets two strikes, Watson explained, he spreads out his stance, chokes up on the bat, hits taking no stride and tries to hit the ball hard up the middle.
Watson also did his homework on Bell before asking for him in the trade. "He has a reputation for being a high-maintenance guy," Watson said. "The word from Toronto" -- where Bell began his career -- "was he has to have direction. We're giving him some positive direction."
But while Bell moved in a positive direction, Bagwell was yanked in reverse, going out for more than a month after recovering from a slow start and looking like the most valuable player he was a year ago.
"We'll be O.K.," Watson said. "Do we miss him? Sure. He's the heart and soul of our club. But we've got to go on without him. What do you want us to do, fold up our tent and go home?"
The Astros could have done that after they lowered their payroll, but under Watson and Manager Terry Collins, they have pounded the tent stake harder than ever.
"They're going to have to reckon with us," Watson said. "We're not going away."
 
The Longest Yard
 National Leaguers have apparently taken the pick-up-the-pace edict more seriously than their American League counterparts.
Although more time is needed to determine the success or failure of the adjustments that were made beginning July 28, it is reasonable to compare the time of the first week of games under the new guidelines with the time of the previous week's games, or before batters had to remain within three feet of the box when they step out and pitchers had to deliver the ball within 12 seconds after the batter was set.
In the previous week, 94 major league games averaged 2:55. In the first week of the new stipulations, 89 games averaged 2:47. But virtually all of the change came in the National League, where the average time dropped from 2:53 to 2:38. The A.L. average changed from 2:57 to 2:56.
Maybe it takes the A.L. hitters longer than their N.L. colleagues to walk three feet.
 
Pitchers a Study in Contrast
 Randy Johnson of Seattle and Tim Wakefield of Boston aren't the only candidates for the American League Cy Young Award, but they could be considered the leaders, and they pose an intriguing contrast -- Johnson (11-2) with his overpowering, intimidating fastball, Wakefield (12-1) with his baffling, frustrating knuckleball.
Wakefield, though, has remained more consistent than Johnson. In their last two starts, Johnson gave up 10 earned runs in 14 2/3 innings, Wakefield 3 in 14 1/3 innings. Johnson's earned run average rose from 2.66 to 3.03, Wakefield's from 1.63 to 1.66.
But Johnson's recent problems may be physical. Johnson said yesterday that he has been bothered by pain in his pitching shoulder for a while. He will miss his scheduled start against Oakland today, and will be examined by team doctors in Seattle tomorrow.
In the National League, no other pitcher is a legitimate candidate for the award as long as Greg Maddux (12-1, 1.74) is around. But Denny Neagle of Pittsburgh could be challenging him if his teammates provided a little more support.
Not long ago, Neagle owned 40 percent of the Pirates' victories, which at the time was by far the best ratio in either league. But Neagle (10-4) hasn't won any of his last four starts despite allowing only 5 earned runs in 29 2/3 innings, a 1.52 e.r.a. The Pirates lost all four games, though Neagle wasn't the losing pitcher in any of them.
 
From Hot to Cold
 When Juan Gonzalez was unable to play for Texas the first five weeks of the season because of a back ailment -- he returned June 1 -- Mark McLemore filled in more than nicely. In 27 games through May 24, McLemore hit .404. But there's a reason the 30-year-old McLemore has been a career platoon player.
Continuing to play on a regular basis, McLemore has squandered his strong start. In 62 games since, before last night, he has hit .192, slashing his season average to .256.
Then there's San Francisco's Mike Benjamin, who keeps plugging away trying to match the 14-hit spree he staged in three games in June. In 29 games since, he has 13 hits in 84 at-bats.
 
Announcement, Please
 The Cincinnati Reds beat the Mets on what appeared to be a steal of home by Ron Gant on Thursday night, but the fans who saw the game at Riverfront Stadium didn't know what really happened until they got home and watched the play on television or read about it in the newspapers the next day.
No announcement was offered at the ball park, leaving the fans unaware that Paul Runge, the plate umpire, called Gant safe not because he stole home but because Alberto Castillo, the Mets' rookie catcher, was guilty of stepping in front of the plate before he had the ball. Under the rules, the pitcher, Reid Cornelius, was charged with a balk, allowing Gant to score, and Bret Boone, the batter, was awarded first base on catcher's interference.
It might have been a once-in-a-lifetime play, and the fans didn't know what they had witnessed while they were still at Riverfront.

HEADLINE: Most Russians Suffer a Decline in Health

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Those who are puzzled by the decline of life expectancy in Russia (front page, Aug. 2) are not taking account of an accompanying general decline in well-being and health care. 
 According to statistics for the first half of 1995, 46.5 million people had incomes below the minimum -- 31 percent of the population. Just having children is enough to plunge families into poverty: in 1993, 70 percent of families with three or more children and half of families with two children lived below the poverty line.
 Malnutrition is now common for pregnant women and infants, and may well explain some of the birth defects and ailing children in Russia. Baby food is almost not produced in Russia, and even though families spend half their incomes on their children, given the price of meat, milk, vegetables and fruit, only the very wealthy can afford a balanced diet. Even under the Soviet system, the average Russian's diet was deficient, so we may be seeing the cumulative effect of decades of poor living.
 There are hospitals even in cities that exist without hot running water or a constant supply of electricity. Medicines are in short supply and in some hospitals entirely lacking. Particularly in rural areas, hospitals are being closed because they are not considered cost-effective, although there are still people in need of service. The high rate of traumas resulting in severe disability is one example of the consequence of the present policy of emphasizing cost-effectiveness over social need.
 If the Soviet system was far from perfect in its response to social need, it has yet to be demonstrated that Russian "democracy" is doing any better. The disastrous decline in life expectancy among men, some of whom have increasingly opted out by suicide, is yet another illustration of the social cost of measuring political or economic viability based solely on economic considerations.

HEADLINE: Most Russians Suffer a Decline in Health;
Can't Happen Here?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The usual explanation for the decline in life expectancy in Russia (front page, Aug. 2) is to attribute these changes to environmental and health policies of the previous government or the dislocations caused by the transformation to a market economy. A deeper, more generalizable lesson is that deterioration in the living standards of a population leads to declines in public health. 
 In the United States, growing numbers are living in urban poverty; more than 35 million Americans lack health insurance; death rates for urban young people 15 to 24 are increasing, and our country's infant mortality rate is higher and its immunization rate lower than those of many other developed nations. An oft-cited study found that men in Harlem are less likely to reach their 65th birthday than men in Bangladesh.
 At the same time Republican legislators at the state and Federal levels are proposing dramatic cutbacks in environmental regulation, public assistance and public support for health care. A review of the history of public health tells us that the likely outcome of this social experiment will be similar to that in Russia: a "puzzling" increase in illness and death among vulnerable populations.

 "Global Grass-Roots Banking" (editorial, July 27) describes the success of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in providing loans for as little as $100 at low interest rates with no collateral required except the borrower's word, with a repayment record of 97 percent. 
 We've had a similar American experience with the Community Reinvestment Act, now mistakenly under fire in Congress. The act has increased bank lending to low-income minority borrowers, with a better repayment record than more affluent borrowers.

HEADLINE: The Devolution Revolution

BYLINE: By Daniel Patrick Moynihan; Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A considerable debate has commenced in the Senate, but it is not, as commonly portrayed, about welfare. The subject, rather, is the devolution -- "causing to descend" -- of social welfare programs from the Federal Government to the states. This takes the form of block grants. It may well prove the next stage in the long, alternating history of federalism.
At issue is the political economy of the New Deal, or at least a goodly portion of it. As a matter of policy, the New Deal brought about a great shift in resources from the North to the South and West. At the same time, New Deal policies brought a great measure of support for the dependent poor, not least in New York State (which, adjusting the cost of living, now has the sixth highest poverty rate in the nation.) Devolution might ease the former problem while hugely worsening the latter. 
 Prof. Herman B. Leonard and Monica E. Friar of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard comment that the changes wrought by block grants may be small at first but that "these proposals amount to profound structural changes in the funding mechanisms underlying the programs and therefore will likely result in profound changes in the spending trajectory."
On July 27, in testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Richard P. Nathan of the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany coined the name for the change: the Devolution Revolution of 1995. It would be, he said, far more consequential than the Great Society. He elaborated: "As economist Joseph Schumpeter once said . . . it is in fiscal issues like this that you can hear the thundering hoofbeats of history."
Well, Schumpeter could. It's harder for the rest of us, but surely not that hard. Take welfare. Aid to Families with Dependent Children began with the Social Security Act of 1935 as a widow's pension, pending the time when Survivors Insurance would take over. But a new class of dependent families appeared, young mothers either unmarried, separated or divorced.
In New York City today, more than half a million children are on welfare at any one time, and more than half of all children will be at some time. The racial and ethnic component of this change inhibited open discussion in the 1960's and 70's. But mostly the problem was that at the time the welfare departments didn't recognize that they were dealing with something new.
There is a Law of Retarded Response. Political change often comes abruptly (contrast the 103d Congress with the current 104th). But there is a lag in grasping social change. By 1988, the welfare bureaucracies had caught up -- enough so that in the Senate, by a vote of 96 to 1, A.F.D.C. was redefined as a form of temporary assistance, with a wholly new emphasis on getting a job and becoming self-supporting. The states were encouraged to experiment, innovate, evaluate. In fact, some were already doing so.
Now to something crucial. Welfare is not an entitlement to individuals. It is a commitment by the Federal Government to match state spending on programs that states devise. Individuals must be treated equally, says the Social Security Act, but states can provide whatever benefits they choose. Indeed, they can choose to provide nothing.
A Federal waiver process obscures the fact that there is no individual entitlement, but it needn't. Virginia recently asked for a waiver to limit eligibility for A.F.D.C. to two years. Two years and out! On July 1, President Clinton approved, saying, "It's a good plan, and I'm proud to be supporting it." Wisconsin is planning to end A.F.D.C. altogether by the end of 1997. Entirely doable under present law.

Another little-noticed aspect of the present debate is that conservative critics of the previous welfare system, before the Family Support Act, are demonstrably alarmed at what is being proposed. On March 9, Lawrence Mead, a professor at Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School, a conservative, told the Senate Finance Committee, "To improve welfare, I believe, requires changing the Federal role, not abandoning it."
The hidden agenda of the Devolution Revolution is a large-scale withdrawal of support for social welfare, no matter how well conceived. The result would be a race to the bottom, as states, deprived of Federal matching funds, compete with one other to reduce spending by depriving their own dependent population of help.
Such an outcome was projected by the economists Thomas Granneman and Mark Pauly 12 years ago after conducting careful simulations to determine how states would respond to block grants. In New York, they concluded, spending per poor person would drop by half.
The nation is straying into the unknown here. Consider the matter of out-of-wedlock births. A steadily growing percentage of children are born into single-parent homes, and many of these will become dependent on welfare. Some think the answer is simple: repeal Title IV-A (A.F.D.C.) of the Social Security Act and eliminate welfare benefits.
It is an argument that James Q. Wilson, professor of management and public policy at the University of California at Los Angeles, describes as "in large measure based on untested assumptions, ideological posturing and perverse priorities."
"We are told that ending A.F.D.C. will reduce illegitimacy," he said in a speech, "but we don't know that. It is, at best, an informed guess."
The voices being heard on behalf of the children just now have been thought of as conservatives in the past. Liberals would do well to listen to them today.

HEADLINE: DANCE;
When Disbanding Is the Only Logical Step

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING 

 BODY:
Ralph Lemon's career as a modern dance choreographer took off in 1990, a decade after he created his first pieces. He was internationally acknowledged as a leading member of his generation in American dance. He had established a small but highly respected company of dancers attuned to the demands of his bold, complex style of choreography. And he was passionate about his work. "I love the edge of it, the challenge," he told an interviewer the following year. "I love the fight. Not the struggle, but the challenge of solving problems I pick out of the air."
Yet Mr. Lemon had started to feel a sense of foreboding about the field in general. "Everything started to get like a roller coaster," he said in a recent interview. "We'd have a good year touring, then the next year work would be cut in half. And I was one of the fortunate ones." 
 By 1993, he began to think seriously about working in new ways to "stretch the form" of dance, as he puts it. Then, last October, he told his six dancers he was going to disband the company.
It was a hard decision. He had made a point of involving them in creative decisions; together they had formed a close-knit family of performers, and it would not be easy to find jobs like this. But in their hearts, Mr. Lemon said, the dancers knew that it was time. "I told them that I was frustrated, that I felt this was becoming a little abusive," he said. "They kind of agreed."
The 10-year-old Ralph Lemon Company will go out in style, with seasons at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., where the troupe performs Aug. 18 through 20, and at the Joyce Theater in Manhattan in October. Mr. Lemon will move on to projects -- about half of which are already financed -- that include collaborations on a photographic book, directing a video documentary on Haitians living in Miami, staging movement for a play to be produced by the Penumbra Theater of St. Paul, and creating a film-dance duet with Bebe Miller, another choreographer who has chosen not to have a company. The Lemon dancers will try to find other work as performers or in other areas of dance.
But the pool of modern dance companies is slowly shrinking, as choreographers are restructuring, rethinking or closing down the single-choreographer troupes that have been a tradition in American modern dance. The Lar Lubovitch Dance Company will concentrate for the next year and a half on creating dances rather than performing. Susan Marshall talks of reconsidering the traditional company structure and reorganizing her choreographic work. Laura Dean, daunted in part by the lack of affordable studio space in New York City, is re-establishing her group of musicians and dancers in Salisbury, N.C. And Bella Lewitzky recently closed her 30-year-old troupe out of a desire to "leave behind the perpetual struggles of getting boards, finding money, just surviving," she told Dance Magazine.
Most of the choreographers are in their 30's and 40's and have maintained small or medium-sized troupes for 10 to 15 years. Some have decided that they can no longer continue creating dances while faced with the burden of trying to keep even a small organization afloat in a difficult economy and an atmosphere of seeming antipathy toward the arts in America. The specter of the demise of the National Endowment for the Arts hangs over dance these days, symbolizing for many a despair about the future.
"There doesn't seem to be any mercy," said Maxine Glorsky, a stage manager who has worked with the Lubovitch company. "I think the reason people are closing companies is because they know they can go nowhere, they can ask for nothing. There is no support, no underpinning any more. People used to go banging on doors. Now they're not bothering. No one is listening behind those doors."
But there are other, more complex reasons. Most of the choreographers came of artistic age during the dance boom of the late 1970's and 80's, when everyone had ideas, and audiences were eager and growing. The audiences are still there, Paul Taylor suggests, speaking from the perspective of one who has lived through a good many of the rises and falls of modern dance in a career spanning four decades.
What has changed, then? It may be that the ideas no longer seem so new and thrilling, and that the struggle is now less for achievement than for simple survival.
Mr. Lemon, who is 42, arrived in New York from Minneapolis in 1979. "There was a lot of exciting energy for dance," he said. "This wonderful feeling of anything being possible, in the sense of where you could go with the form, beyond what was traditional. And I was getting a lot of encouragement."
He presented his first evening of choreography in 1981. The next step seemed clear. "Everyone I danced with had a company," Mr. Lemon said. "It seemed to me I was following a tradition. That was the way it worked in modern dance."
To develop one's own work and style, it was necessary to have a core group of dancers who would serve as instruments for the expression of that style. To keep such a group at the ready meant providing employment. And it was then -- and is now -- easier to raise money for an institution than for an individual artist. In 1985, Mr. Lemon incorporated a hitherto informal group of dancer friends as a nonprofit organization. By 1995, its annual operating budget was $170,000.
In talking about the last 10 years, Mr. Lemon frequently described himself as lucky. Friends helped him manage his company. For the last three years he and his dancers have rehearsed free of charge at the Dia Center for the Arts on Mercer Street, a lifeline organization for small and medium-sized companies and individual artists. But it was becoming increasingly clear to Mr. Lemon that he would not be able to offer the full-time employment and health benefits that he felt his dancers deserved, at least in the foreseeable future. His dancers would never have the stable employment of the performers he had worked with in state-supported European troupes. And his worries were making it harder to concentrate on making dances.
"The art form is about struggling," Mr. Lemon said, repeating a familiar dictum about American modern dance. "But I'm not settling for that. It's affecting my work. I need to find a kind of space and work that is right for me. It means letting go of that traditional dance company model. Too much of my time was spent trying to hold on."
Yet this has been "the hardest year," Mr. Lemon said. "I opened up this can of worms. A grieving has been taking place. There has been a sense of abandonment. There was anger."
 FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS, RECALLED Nicholas Leichter, a company member, several of the dancers simply could not accept the news. Eventually, there was a sense of relief and even happiness for Mr. Lemon. Wally Cardona, who joined the group in 1987, agrees. "I thought he was doing a very right thing for himself and for the company," Mr. Cardona said. "A lot of time was being spent on just holding things together, which for a group of creative artists is a little limiting."
As reality sank in, the dancers began to make plans to move on. Mr. Leichter and Mr. Cardona will be presenting their own choreography in concerts at St. Mark's Church in November and December, respectively. Mr. Leichter even dreams of eventually forming his own company, particularly as he watches the dancers he wants to work with committing to other choreographers so as not to waste their young years off the stage.
Mr. Cardona will continue to teach dance. Barbara Gruber plans to get her master's degree in dance and become a teacher. "I really want a life," she said. Some will leave dance. Few in the company had been able to support themselves entirely by dancing. Most had already been dancing part-time with other groups. But now the search begins again for a place to put down artistic roots.
Ms. Gruber and Mr. Cardona worry about the dancers of the future. Ms. Gruber talks of a gifted and intelligent 24-year-old dancer she knows who she fears will never have a solid career as a performer. Mr. Cardona watches the young dancers in his classes, so well-trained and technically adept, and wonders if they will ever dance anywhere but in the studio. And how will they learn to be individuals without the opportunity to test themselves on stages, in a company situation? "It takes a long time," Mr. Cardona said, looking back on "all those years with Ralph, on different stages, learning who I was." His students, he added, can do anything asked of them. "But they are losing themselves."
It is from those dancers that the choreographers of the future will come. The modern masters learned about their craft in part from performing with companies. Mr. Taylor began to create dances while performing with Martha Graham, working with friends at first as a way to learn about being a dancer.
"I can't tell you how valuable an experience it is to be in a company," Mr. Taylor said. "Martha herself gave me the feeling that I could do something in this direction. Being around people you learn that it's possible, that it can happen. You learn how rehearsals are conducted. You learn about stages. You learn about what you want to steal and definitely what not to."
Faced with shrinking careers, some dancers may begin to choreograph prematurely in their attempt to get onto the stage. "I think a lot of dancers jump into choreography too soon, before they are ready," Joan Duddy, director of dance programming at Dia, said. "What's that line from 'A Chorus Line'? 'There I was on unemployment, dancing for my own enjoyment.' "
Ms. Duddy is discovering that even solo performers are having to revert to the shared programs that were a necessity of dance in the 1960's, despite the fact that Dia offers one of the most affordable deals in New York dance.
Some choreographers are turning away from dance altogether. "A lot of younger choreographers are becoming involved in film, video, opera and theater," said Sali Ann Kriegsman, director of Jacob's Pillow and the former director of dance at the N.E.A., "though film and video are also extremely difficult to raise money for. One could get very depressed. But I think it's exciting that these artists are trying to come up with ways of working that are more responsive to their needs." What must be done now, Ms. Kriegsman added, is to develop ways for choreographers to move in and out of dance.
Mr. Lemon agrees that the shift is not necessarily a bad thing. "The Judson said no to technique," he said, referring to the iconoclastic Judson Dance Theater movement of the 1960's that ushered in postmodernism in dance. "I'm saying no to the traditional company model. I'm playing with the edge of not dancing any more." At the same time, Mr. Lemon has been setting up dance workshops around the country. "Arenas where I can continue to explore," he explained, "to stay connected to the dancing part.
"A part of me feels that dance is dying in this country. I would really like to see how and if the form becomes something else, transforms. The traditional company model is all we know. Is there something else?"

HEADLINE: Wheels, Deals, Half-Pipe Dreams

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
Kanaf Hagi lay in his cramped room in a Oneida County juvenile detention center on a warm July morning and imagined himself flying. A hyper kid with trigger reflexes, Kanaf could feel his feet twist in phantom intimations of what they could do on wheels, and his mind spun with images of himself mid-sky, body stretched beyond the ground and way beyond the fences of juvenile hall.
Kanaf had just served a year-long sentence for beating a man with a pair of num-chuks while stoned. Today he was leaving. There was only one thing on his mind: getting back to the skate ramps of Mullaly Park. 
 That same morning, Julio Rivera, a slight, soft-faced 14-year-old with a shaggy head of hair, pulled himself out of bed early at his home in the South Bronx. Yanking on his skates, he glided down the long wooden hallway of his home and headed for the door. His mother, Raquel, amazed at her son's early rise, screamed her daily blessing, "Que Dios te bendiga!," at the closing door.
Outside his home, at East 162d and Walton Avenue in the Bronx, Julio slipped his headphones into his ears and started toward Mullaly, avoiding rough spots in the street and instinctively turning up the volume. Ever since he'd taken up in-line and stopped hanging on the street -- dropping bottles from the roof, xxxxx -- his former mates called him "Shrimpy" or "white boy."
But today it was too early for taunts. Julio had gotten up to wait for Kanaf to return, the friend who first taught him how to skate the ramps and rails of Mullaly Park's skate rink, before he was sent away. Kanaf had been the best skater that the local crowd at Mullaly had ever seen. Now that he was coming back, Julio had a few things to show him.
Kanaf and Julio are skate dreamers, two urban hopefuls in a new sport called aggressive skating. Aggressive is one of a number of so-called alternative sports, like snowboarding, downhill biking and bungee jumping currently in vogue with the young and televised. Alternative sports make good TV, and TV makes good for the athletes, with made-for-the-small-screen spectacles like ESPN's Extreme Games and MTV sports shows creating mini-celebrities of those willing to risk life and limb to create eye-catching visual fare.
Aggressive skating consists of in-line skaters, moving at maximum sped, performing tricks, flips, and grabs while either in a half-pipe or on a street course dotted with ramps, rails and boxes. But competitions are only part of the game. Aggressive skaters and their fast, flashy talents are rapidly being recruited by advertisers who want to cash in on the young, subculture feel of the sport to peddle everything from candy bars to sunglasses.
The air of hip glamour hanging around the sport are also encouraged by skate companies themselves, who keep stables of an elite skaters on monthly retainers and fly them around the country for promotional events and competitions. Their motivation is simple: In-line is the nation's fastest growing sport, with sales of over million dollars in 1994, according to statistics from the National Sporting Goods Association. And aggressive skating, with whole new lines of special skates (selling for about $200 a pair), pads and wheels, is in-line's fastest growing segment.
Companies scout places like Mullaly Park's skate rink, the city's only rink equipped with a half-pipe and a street course, for young skaters to add to their teams.
Success can come as fast as the sport. Take the case of Rollison Rivera, a one- time pitching prospect for the Yankees from Washington Heights, who took up skating at Mullaly a year ago. Last October, he was featured in a video which was shown on MTV That led to a sponsorship and monthly retainer from Rocce's skates. Today, he has endorsement contracts with four other companies, is starring in new documentary, "Hoax 2" about the sport, and is negotiating for a wheel endorsement contract that would pay him a nickle for every wheel sold. Count of the number of skates you see on a Manhattan street and you understand the potential for quick cash.
But Rollison's story is rare. A much more common deal involves free merchandise: boxes of wheels, t-shirts, ball bearings, clothing, even skates. What companies expect in return is for skaters to talk up the products.
But for the sport's participants, mostly under 20, mostly male, the appeal is not only economic. It's emotional. Aggressive skaters say they are part of a close-knit community that shelters them from the dangers of the streets and gives them individual and group identity.
The sport has its own heros, most known by nicknames, first names or just initials (like Arlo Isenberg, or Arlo, the king of the street, and C.E., Chris Edwards, a California skater with his own line of skates.)
It has its own lingo and traditions. The term "roller blading" is a considered a curse. It is offensive amongst aggressives to wear Spandex, the common garb of recreational skaters. They talk about run-ins with "gromlits" (i.e. skateboarders) and the old days on "quads" (standard roller skates).
The skating rite of passage is "sessioning" -- a practice where a pack of skaters travel from location to location using various bits of the urban landscape to hone their skills. Favorite spots are the steps at Union Square with their waxed curbs, or the "Screamer", a 25-step long rail in downtown Manhattan, which the skaters "grind" down i.e. use the middle wheels of the skate to locomote and the side of the skate to brake their descent. Mastering an especially difficult handrail can become a covert citywide challenge -- the rails at St. Luke's Hospital on 58th Street and 8th Avenue are the current dare.
Whether or not the sport will have mass appeal or staying power is debatable. What is certain is that the odds of making a career out of being a professional in-line skater are extremely long. (There are about 150 skaters nationwide making a decent living as "professional" in-line skaters, experts say -- professional basketball, by contrast, hires about 360, at much higher rates.)
Still, the possibility of that is enough to make young people like Kanaf and Julio dream of long green lawns with skate ramps, of making a life by doing something they love, or even just the simple attention brought by winning a neighborhood competition.
Maybe that attention would bring a break: a recommendation by a scout for an sponsorship or an endorsement offer. And that maybe, could lead to something bigger. At the very least, for Kanaf and Julio, winning means respect from peers and pride in one's self.
It is those things that make them skate, those things that make them move.
 
THE FIRST SKATE
Monday afternoon. Kanaf flew down River Avenue towards Mullaly. His tight schedule (off the bus at 1 P.M., to the skate shop for wheels, then home, to Mullaly by 3) had been blown by Manhattan traffic and his grandfather's reluctance to run red lights. But now he was out of the car and on skates again.
Mullaly skate rink is a smooth concrete oval in the corner of Mullaly Park, a run-down patch of green flowing north from Yankee Stadium. The rink, at East 164th Street and River Avenue, is the almost exclusive domain of children and teenagers. Facial hair is rare. And the trash that litters the broken concrete around the rink consists of soda bottles, ice cream containers, and candy wrappers. The park is overseen by two tattooed twentysomthing BMX bikers who sport Parks Department t-shirts and read "Pictorial" to bide the time. Two rusted snow plows resting inexplicably in one corner of the park signal the abandonment of adult bureaucracy.
When Kanaf turned the corner into the park, he saw things had changed. The skate rink had been nearly barren when he left, with the exception of a beat-up half pipe and few rotting plywood ramps which periodically got burned by vandals. Now, the park was crammed new ramps and practice rails.
Some things were the same: the empty chemical drums that served as giant steps up to the top of eight foot tall half-pipe, the Puerto Rican flag painted on a ramp, and the deafening screech of the passing 4 train overhead.
The big difference was in the crowd, its size and its makeup.
"50 skaters I don't know," Kanaf thought to himself. And young. Kids he last had seen as clumsy 5 year-olds were on skates. And on ramps.
Ray Mendez was one of the first to see Kanaf back. Ray is a 20-year old professional skater (an elder, by aggressive standards) who grew up in the same building as Julio. An assured young man with a casual, easy to talk to style, he is the de facto big brother to most young skater at Mullaly. He saw changes in Kanaf too.
Kanaf had left a street talker, a cocky skate prodigy whose talent was "phenomenal," according to Ray, but whose attitude was of "a little snot." Ray remembered when Kanaf would get baked and try to skate, one time running into a biker and breaking his nose. But now Kanaf's whole manner had changed: something about him was calmer, more focused.
"He had a smile on his face," said Ray.
After a few high five's and screaming "Heys" and "Where you beens" from friends, Kanaf glided onto the rink, forgetting his pads and immediately hopping onto the half-pipe.
He fell. Laughter came from everywhere. Kanaf laughed too but felt the flare of embarrassment inside him. I really fell off, he thought. He got up and retreated to the edge of the rink.
It was then someone handed Kanaf a flyer. There was a competition at the rink that coming Saturday, July 15. Two photos on the flyer jumped out at Kanaf. Both were of Julio, arching his legs behind him, perfectly, to touch his back in mid-air.
Julio couldn't take the heat. He'd waited at the rink till the sun had burned him and then gone home.
Sitting in the relative cool of his room, he considered his pencil sketches of airborne skaters pinned to his walls: contorted bodies suspended in different skate grabs and flips, some that he had mastered, others that he had simply imagined.
Julio stored his skates in their spot on his empty bookshelf ("his library" he calls it) and went to play with his nephew, one of eight people he shared with house with. He'd play for a while, do some drawing. Then maybe, when the sun had settled down, head out to find Kanaf again.
Kanaf stayed till 6, and then went home, leaving others who stayed behind after the rink had closed. They just hopped the fence and kept skating.
At home, Kanaf caught his mother, Sue, trying to move some stuff into his room. He stopped her and insisted she sit.
Sue Nagi's heart had almost stopped years before. It was after her quintuple bypass that Kanaf, left without as much supervision, had begun to hang out with a bad group. ("The kids with the cheap skates," Mrs. Nagi called them.)
"They were pulling me away with a rope and finally I hung myself," said Kanaf.
Kanaf didn't want her, or him, to get sick again.
 
A DAY OF FRUSTRATION
Tuesday stormed. Puddles everywhere on the rink.
Kanaf brooded, angry at the weather. His moods always were dark when he couldn't skate. He felt impatient. He'd watched videos in the detention center of skaters he knew making their names. He'd seen their pictures on magazine covers and followed their results in competitions. He didn't have time for rain.
You can watch skaters at Mullaly scramble when the rain hits, and then watch them buzz back to the rink when the sky clears, whizzing down the streets around the rink like bees returning to a hive. Even in the winter, skaters plow paths to get from ramp to ramp. But the on again, off again rains bred by the humidity and heat made the whole afternoon a wash.
Kanaf's mother had told him that when he got out, with credo should be "Live to skate, skate to live" and Kanaf agreed. But he'd have to wait till the rink was dry.
Julio sat around and gourged himself on some cuchifritos from a shop on East 161st Street and thought evil thoughts about Disney. Julio's only seeming break into the in-line world was a photo shoot he'd had in January for a Disney kid's book. They'd taken him to a fancy Manhattan photo studio and dressed him in Spandex. Instead of a skate ramp, they'd put him on a trampoline and asked him to "do skate tricks." He'd done his best and they'd promised mail a check.
"Neither rain nor sleet nor dark of night..."
Nothing had ever come.
By Wednesday afternoon, clearer and hot again, Kanaf was back up to speed, headphones dangling from his ears, performing tricks that made the younger skaters stop and gape, sometimes breaking up his time with a cigarette break. His quick smiles marked each flight on the half-pipe. He grabbed more air on every pass, egged on by the crowd. "More air!" "Come on, you Energizer bunny!" Kanaf responded by swinging high off on end, twisting his body one and half times around while swinging his right hand across his body to grab the outside of his left skate, a manuever called a mute-method.
During a break, Kanaf caught a figure shooting down East 164th, straight through the intersection, not even breaking to swing the sharp right turn into the park. It was Julio.
Kanaf didn't quite recognize the speeding figure until he got close. And he got close fast.
He stopped. They hugged. Julio hung near Kanaf's arm for a bit, uncertain, while Kanaf talked around the group, teasing some of the other skaters to get higher, to trust the momentum of ramp's curve. Then Julio moved away, up on the platform above the half-pipe. Ray had been assuring a younger that if he dropped into the half- pipe shoulders first, he would be okay. Julio was in before the younger kid could work up the nerve. Julio instantly, cold, pulled him a move he'd made up himself, a backwards 360 with a . He called it the P.R. (for Puerto Rico) flip.
Damn, Kanaf thought.
Julio had once broke a pair of skates trying a move like this, leaving him skateless for a full year before he could afford a new pair. It was period, he admits, half-smiling, half-hiding his head in his chest, that he would pass by the park and watch from beyond the gates. "I kept crying" he said. But there was nothing wrong with Julio's skates now.
Kanaf pulled the flyer from a pocket and showed it to a friend.It hit him. "That's Julio," he said quietly. "I left, and he soared."
He knew then that the competition, a place where he had told himself he was just going to find out "where I am now" was going to come down to between him and Julio.
 
ACTION
Thursday the first offer came.
Ray's fledgling instruction and promotion company, City Sk8, had been asked by a Japanese production to assemble some skaters to stage a session hitting all the major spots around the city. Ray asked Julio and Kanaf to come along.
They shot on Friday, going from Mullaly, down to Columbus Circle, threw Central Park for a while, down to the Chelsea Piers and then finally to Union Square.
Julio marveled at the star treatment, free food and cameras everywhere, taking down what he did and said. He felt like a movie star, and thought, 'This is the best day of my life, this is what I want.'
Kanaf asked Julio to do some tricks: a mute, a Gumby, a method. Julio did every move and ask Kanaf to match him. Kanaf coaxed spitting laughs out of Julio, and started calling him Rosa, a nod to a fellow juvie mate, a gymnast named Delarosa.
Julio didn't know what it meant, so he laughed. They goofed for the camera. They hit their marks. They scouted each other. They shot for 16 hours for no pay, but the attention of an video entourage and a rapt audience wherever they went.
Finally, dog tired and thinking about the next day's competition, Kanaf and Julio headed home.
 
THE COMPETITION BEGINS
Saturday was the hottest day of the year. By noon, the sheet metal on the half-pipe was sizzling hands of falling skaters.
A DJ worked out of a van was parked in the corner of the park and bass heavy rap and hip hop boomed through the park. A PA had been set up and the competition's organizers, Ray and his partner David Smith, took turns trying to announcing competitors names and adding commentary to routines: "Oh, that's a 360 transfer, baby. Nice!" The half-pipe's platforms were draped with banners announcing Hyper Wheels and Power Bars, and topped with a McDonald's flag. The park guys had run a hose over the roof, creating a single stream shower for people to cool off in. Blankets sat in the shade for parents. Skaters showed early and came from everywhere, slowing the competition down by adding multiple rounds.
By the midday start of vert competition, the temperature was 101. Kanaf, Julio and 11 other skaters had signed up for the vert, the faster, harder to master end of aggressive. (51 signed up for the street course.) The competition would be one round of prelims then the top 8 would compete in the finals.
A corwd of baout 200 people had showed up to watch, driven to the shade of the park by the heat indoors. Hanging around the edge of the rink was a German photographer, a Brooklyn skate enterpreneur looking to form a team, and a handful of pros, not allowed to compete, but watching for new talent.
The first round showed off Kanaf and Julio. Kanaf, heavier and steadier, older and stronger, could trust momentum would build behind him. Julio had to work a little harder for the speed.
And Kanaf had style. In a black soccer-style shirt and frayed dungarees, Kanaf milked the stalls between tricks, gripping the edge of the platform with his skates like flamenco dancer: arms slightly bent, head cocked, eyes in the middle distance. And then down into the pipe, seemingly fed by the music, effortlessly gaining speed, arms to his side, and then with a perfectly timed push, up, two, three, four feet into the air, turning his body from the sky to the ground to the sky again, landing and shooting backwards towards the other curve of the pipe. No sign in his body of any fear of falling on anything but the glide of four wheels still in motion.
But Julio had moves. Smaller, almost birdlike, he found the twists and grabs less clumbersome. Perching for a moment on the edges of the platforms, he would swoop down, pushing his skates with more desperate action, looking for the speed to launch him up. But then suddenly, airborne, twisting, his fast hands locking into sudden perfect positions, he would be frozen for a moment. Then as soon as eyes could snap his image, the next moment he was falling back into the pipe, landing and pushing again to gain the speed for the next flight
The judges, a trio of sponsored skaters, gave the prelims lead to Kanaf. Julio was 2d.
In between, Kanaf smoked and fast-chatted a battery of girls and buddies. Julio stayed atop of the half-pipe, fiddled with the hem of his "Your Wheels Suck" t-shirt and thought about the next round. His watched parts on the street competition and played eye-tag with a girl standing beyond the park's fence.
When the finals came, hours late, the sun had begun to set behind the projects to the west of the park. The water had got out of hand and many of the spectators were drenched.
In the finals, Kanaf stuck with a high air strategy, blasting up and twisting, ripping 540's, following one leap with another, confident that he was skating "harder than I ever skated before." Coming down out of the pipe, he was covered in sweat, like he'd stepped through the makeshift fountain. He thought about it: This is all the sweat that I clogged in my pores for a year coming out.
But Julio dogged Kanaf, spinning mercilessly, again and again, using a simple ideas to keep focus: Where's the ramp? Put fear to the side. Don't fall and look stupid. The remaining crowd fed him, Kanaf screaming along with the rest.
When the judges tallied their cards, there was a tie.
A playoff was hastily arranged to decide the competition between Julio and Kanaf. The lights on the basketball court had already clicked on, and the DJ had packed up, taking the PA and the commentary with him. The crowd had dwindled.
Julio approached Kanaf.
"You want first?" said Julio.
He said he was exhausted, and could hardly see the ramp. The prizes between first and second weren't that different, and he'd be happy with second...
Kanaf responded before the words got out of Julio's mouth.
"If you're not to going to skate, I'm not going to skate, it'll be a tie," said Kanaf. "But I want to skate, so you get your little butt out there."
Kanaf stood on the edge and dropped in. The routine was good, no falls, no misses, but lacking the speed and intensity of before. Kanaf missed the grind and beat of the music, the energy of the big crowd.
He finished. Julio began.
At first, it seemed like his regular routine, said Ray. But then he pulled it. Flying up the curve of the pipe, he made a push about six inches from the top and entered the air that Kanaf had seemed to own all afternoon. He flipped skates over head, his eyes flashed with sky's dusk, so high that he "smelled pollution," he said. He completed a full flip and then, twisting like a cat falling from a roof, turned his body 180 at the last instant to land moving forward towards the other curve of the pipe.
Silence for a second. Then shreiks of "Oh man, oh man!" He had pulled a pro move, a gravity bender known as a Mc-Flip.
The decision was unanamious.
Ray pronounced Julio "King of Mullaly."
"Was that so hard?" asked Kanaf.
Julio seemed stunned. "I didn't feel a thing," he said. He said later that when he smiled, it was in the shape of a U -- a half-pipe of a smile.
 
EPILOGUE
A week later, Kanaf got a call from casting agent from American Express. Two days later he was filming in Central Park, playing a skate messenger in a Jerry Seinfeld ad. He had to wear Spandex, but got paid $810 for two days work.
Both Julio and Kanaf were signed to Free Ride, a new skate company in Brooklyn. Unfortunately, it's called Free Ride because its skaters skate free.
Ray also booked Julio and Kanaf onto his City Sk8 team, and their first show is planned for next month. "I'm making sure they get sponsored. They'll have careers," said Ray.
In the meantime, every afternoon the sky is clear at Mullaly Park, they'll skate to live, and live to skate.
 
 
 
From Gring to Gromlit: A Glossary
 Someday you might overhear something like this: "He pulled a mute method and then he tweaked it into a gumby."
Here's a guide to the basic lingo of aggressive skating.
 
Anti-rocker: The wheel alignment that makes grinding easier. (Two middle wheels are slightly smaller than the two outside wheels, improving the skate's grip.)
 
Gromlit: A slang word used to describe skateboarders.
 
Grind: The action of sliding along a rail, skates roughly perpendicular to it. The two outside wheels are used to cradle the rail and gravity does the rest of the work.
 
Gumby, mute, method, rocket: The basic skate grips, all involving grabbing a skate or skates while mid-air.
 
Hip hop: The action of hopping with the hands along the coping, or top metal bar, of a half-pipe while in a handstand.
 
Invert or sad plant: A handstand on the top of a half-pipe.
 
Quads: Standard roller skates.
 
Sessioning: When a pack of skaters travel from location to location using handrails, steps and curbs to perfect moves. Favorite spots are an area under the Brooklyn Bridge on the Manhattan side called the Brooklyn Banks and the "Screamer," a 25-step-long rail in downtown Manhattan.
 
THE BUSINESS OF A RISING SPORT
 
 Who the Corporate Players

 * Skate and accessory manufacturers seeking to cash in on the nation's fastest growing sporting goods market.
 * Advertisers seeking urban, youthful feel to sell products from credit cards to candy bars.
 * Television networks and video companies looking for new, cheap sports programming that appeals to a public jaded by the turmoil in more traditional sports.

 What the Skaters Do

 * Promote skate equipment by talking it up in skate parks and hangouts, using a company's skate equipment, sporting its logos on shirts, helmets and hats provided by the company.
 * Perform at trade shows and store openings to provide entertainment and build crowds.
 * Scout for other talented skaters to become members of company teams.
 * Give advice on research and development of new products; test new products.

 What the Skaters Get

 * Top skaters kept on retainer by large companies like Roller Blades can earn up to $6,000 a month. Skaters travel around the country and, and in some instances, overseas to promote and compete.
 * Many deals involve free merchandise, payment of entrance fees to tournaments and small royalties for any photo or broadcast appearance.
 * Other deals pay in the neighborhood of $300 for appearances at trade shows, store openings and in commercials.

FLUSHING
Call: Save Qu Yuan! Response: What, Again?
The dragons are coming back to the lake in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park today with the fifth annual Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival.
The boats, which are 39 feet long, have dragon heads at the prow and tails at the stern. Each is powered by a team of 20.
The race is based on an ancient Asian legend, said Melinda Parsons of the Hong Kong Government office in New York. Around 400 B.C., Qu Yuan, a court minister who was loved by the people but not by the king, was banished. For a time, he wandered about the countryside, writing poetry, but he eventually decided to drown himself in a river. Local fishermen raced to save him, but in vain. Their rescue dash is re-enacted in the dragon boat race.
Six boats will race today, and the championship will be decided next Sunday.

Domino Real-Estate Deal Cleared

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
A final obstacle has been removed to a complex deal to relocate both the City University Graduate Center and the State University College of Optometry in a $173 million project involving the old B. Altman department store and two other sites.
In a three-year process, the college will move from 315 Park Avenue South at 24th Street to CUNY's building at 33 West 42d. CUNY will move to the Altman building, on Fifth Avenue at 34th. To allow the deal, Gov. George E. Pataki signed a special law cutting off state funds for the optometry college's $7 million annual rent, breaking its lease without penalty or compensation to the landlord. Mr. Pataki's press office did not respond to a reporter's inquiries. 
 The law is under attack from State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, some real estate industry leaders and the owners of 315 Park. The owners, TM Park Associates, say the move could bankrupt them, since their $50 million mortgage is based on the lease's lasting till 2004. They plan to sue. Mr. McCall's office called the law unprecedented and said it could have serious consequences, hampering future lease negotiations.
"The concept that the state can simply abrogate a contract seems to me unfair, unethical and immoral -- you and I could not get away with that," said Michael Cohen, president of Williams Real Estate, which has several leases with state agencies. He called the law a terrible precedent.
Controversies aside, officials at the optometry college and CUNY Center say they are delighted at the prospect of new homes. CUNY, which opened in 1961, long ago outgrew its 172,924-square-foot 42d Street building and spilled over into 100,831 square feet rented in adjacent buildings.
"We're really cramped," said Pam Bayless, a spokeswoman. "The hope is to get out as soon as possible."
Despite agitation within the Real Estate Board of New York to oppose the lease-breaking law, the industry organization has not done so. Some critics say that reflects the influence of Peter L. Malkin, a governor of the board and a real estate power who is a general partner in the redevelopment of the Altman site. He did not respond to a request for an interview.
The CUNY move is the third time Mr. Malkin's partnership has benefited from special legislation and public money to help rescue the troubled Altman project and fill it with new occupants and owners.
After the store closed in 1989, the partnership tried to convert the building into the New York Resource Center, a mart for the office furnishing industry. But that flopped as the city sank into recession. Then the partnership tried dividing the building into condominiums for nonprofit institutions who, by owning, would avoid property taxes.
Senator Roy Goodman, who is also the Manhattan Republican Party chairman, sponsored the lease-breaking law and also introduced an earlier bill that helped land the Altman building's first occupant. That legislation enabled the State Dormitory Authority to finance $30 million for Oxford University Press to buy 110,000 square feet in the top five floors of the building's eastern end, facing Madison Avenue. Oxford moved in this year. Mr. Goodman was out of town last week and unavailable for comment.
The Dormitory Authority is also helping finance a $125 million project creating the Science, Industry and Business Library in 213,000 square feet on the lower eight floors of the Madison wing, scheduled to open later this year. CUNY's move, also authorized by state legislation and financed by public funds, will fill 375,000 square feet of Altman's remaining space, making CUNY the building's major occupant.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
At 21, This Show Must Be Doing Something Right

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
DURING ITS MARATHON 21-year run, the musical revue "Beach Blanket Babylon," a frenetic spoof of American politics, culture and ethnic life, has become a San Francisco institution. More than three million Bay Area residents and tourists have squeezed in to see it at the 400-seat Club Fugazi in the city's North Beach neighborhood. Hotel concierges recommend it for what The Los Angeles Times has called its "pure fun, the epitome of the San Francisco experience."
Many fans see it more than once. The department store tycoon Cyril Magnin came back 464 times. But in June, the man who could probably top that figure, Steve Silver, the show's creator, producer and driving spirit, died of AIDS at the age of 51. "The little show that could," as the local newspaper columnist Herb Caen called it, now faces the future on its own. 
 Inspired by the 1960's movie series with Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon ("Beach Party," "Beach Blanket Bingo"), the revue consists of a live, rocking band and an ensemble of singers and dancers who deliver sight gags and puns as they quick-change into outlandish costumes, towering wigs and oversized hats -- ingredients that Mr. Silver wanted when he began to create the show on the city's streets in 1974.
He produced the first indoor version of "Beach Blanket Babylon" in the back room of a local restaurant. For atmosphere, he covered the floor with sand, put the waiters in swimsuits and stamped the audience's hands with Coppertone. It was a popular hit from the start and moved to its current location in 1975.
In an interview last February, after his public announcement that he had AIDS, Mr. Silver insisted, "This show is not closing; everything will stay the same." Five years earlier, he had begun grooming Kenny Mazlow, 42, a featured performer and the show's assistant director and choreographer, to take over the creative reins.
Jo Schuman Silver, Mr. Silver's widow, is the new producer. With 85 full- and part-time employees, 10 of them in the cast, the revue grosses nearly $5 million a year for Steve Silver Productions, a privately held company that Ms. Schuman Silver now runs. According to David Lincoln King, the general manager, annual operating expenses for eight shows a week are virtually the same as the gross revenues. Ticket prices range from $18 to $45 and drinks and other concessions generate another $200,000 annually, he said.
Marsha Garland, executive director of the North Beach Chamber of Commerce, a neighborhood group, said the show generates $2 million to $4 million a year for the local economy. "It's a phenomenon" for the area's restaurants, bars and hotels, Ms. Garland said. "If it left, there would be a big black hole in North Beach."
Ms. Schuman Silver is optimistic about the future of her husband's favorite show. She said she was exploring possibly opening it in other markets, perhaps Boston, Chicago or Dallas, with New York as the ultimate goal. "It will go on," she said simply.
"Beach Blanket Babylon" has lasted, Mr. Caen said, because Mr. Silver "never made it bigger than it had to be. He didn't move into a larger theater, get more glamorous name performers. It has a real San Francisco feel to it, neighborly, misleadingly simple. He kept control in a very intelligent way."
Val Diamond, the star for the last 17 years, said the show "doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. In fact, the show is much better if you don't think." During the finale, Ms. Diamond wears one of Mr. Silver's hat fantasies, executed by Alan Greenspan: a 200-pound, 12-foot headdress showing the San Francisco skyline on which buildings rise and lights flash. A 33-foot version, built for the 20th-anniversary show, is displayed in the San Francisco City Center. The city threw a party last year to honor Mr. Silver for his civic contributions and the show.
 SIX MONTHS LATER, MR. Silver announced he was seriously ill. He had been secretly fending off AIDS for five years, and now he was losing his eyesight. He was hospitalized just before Christmas and then rallied, returning home for six more months, before his death on June 12.
In signature style, he designed his own funeral, choosing his eulogists and choreographing numbers by the "Beach Blanket" cast. "It was definitely a Steve Silver production," Ms. Schuman Silver said.

HEADLINE: Census Study Sees Ethnic Shifts

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
THE county's population will grow only slightly during the next 25 years, but there will be dramatic changes in the racial and ethnic makeup of Westchester, a new report on census trends shows. By the year 2020, blacks, Asians and Hispanic residents living in Westchester will equal the number of whites living here, according to the study released late last month by the County Planning Department.
The latest census predictions have broad implications for many sectors of society -- including education, transportation, recreation, housing and public medicine -- and will no doubt bring about significant changes in the delivery of services, said the county's Planning Commissioner, P. Lynn Oliva. 
 Commissioner Oliva referred to the government report as "a blueprint for spending, a tool to help us plan ahead."
The census study says that by 2020, Hispanic residents will make up 24 percent of the county's population, up from 9.9 percent in 1990.
Asians and people from the Pacific islands will constitute 10 percent of the population, up from 3.7 percent five years ago. And the numbers of blacks will grow to nearly 17 percent from 13 percent at the beginning of this decade.
By contrast, the white population will decrease to slightly less than 50 percent, from 73 percent in 1990.
Ms. Oliva said Westchester will still be in large part "a wealthy area of one-family homes, with golf courses and parks," but will also exhibit a growing diversity over the next quarter century -- a pattern that has already begun to manifest itself.
While some analysts, like Dr. Anthony A. Cupaiuolo, director of the Michaelian Institute of Public Policy and Management at Pace University, described the trends as "dynamic and eclectic," others expressed concern about widening demographic divisions in the years ahead.
A draft report released last week by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, a regional planning organization representing Nassau, Suffolk, Putnam, Rockland and Westchester Counties and New York City, addressed what it called "challenges of uncertain impact and complexity."
"Increasing racial, ethnic, linguistic and cultural diversity, and a widening income and economic disparity confront the region as the effects of heavy foreign immigration, continued job and housing discrimination, unequal access to capital and education resources, and impending cutbacks in social safety-net expenditures combine to broaden the gap between the 'haves' and the 'have nots' in our society," that report says.
The changing racial makeup of Westchester is part of a larger regional trend that the Transportation Council has been documenting for some time. That organization's report says there are 12.4 million whites -- 62 percent of the population -- in the New York City area, down from 15.7 million, or 79 percent, in 1970.
Hispanic people account for 3.3 million people, or 16 percent of the regional population, compared with 1.6 million, or 8 percent, in 1970.
Blacks also account for 3.3 million people and 16 percent of the population, although their numbers have not grown as quickly. The Transportation Council counted 2.3 million blacks, or 12 percent of the population, living in the region in 1970.
Asians are the smallest but most rapidly expanding group, with 1.2 million people, or 6 percent of the population, up from 200,000, or 1 percent, in 1970.
The report notes that five in every eight residents of New York City are Hispanic, black or Asian. In New Jersey, those numbers are one in three. In the mid-Hudson region, about one in every four residents is a member of a minority group. And in Connecticut and Long Island, it is one in every five -- fewer than the average for the country.
Since 1970, nearly three million immigrants have moved to the region, and half of those have been admitted under the family reunification provisions of immigration law, which contributes to "tight concentrations of newcomers in ethnic enclaves," the report says.
The Westchester Planning Department report on census trends corroborates those findings, noting that most of the county's population growth will be in the southern part, in cities like Mount Vernon and Yonkers, where many members of minority groups settle.
The population of Yonkers, for example, is expected to increase to 191,250 in the next 25 years, from 188,082 in 1995. By then, the report says, slightly more than one-fifth of the county will live in that city.
But over all, projections show no major geographic shifts in the population. By 2020, 46.6 percent of the county's population, slightly less than in 1990, will live in the south. Thirty percent of the county's population, slightly more than in 1990, will live in the northern part of Westchester. And about 23 percent, slightly less that five years ago, will live in the central area.
But what will change is the type of housing that is built in the county. The report says that as the racial makeup of the county changes, there will be a demand for more multi-family housing, including rental units -- what Commissioner Oliva called "a starter form of housing."
Housing construction will be "fueled by in-migration" from the Bronx and other areas within the New York City and will occur near waterfront areas and along the central corridors in the county like Routes 1 and 9 and the Saw Mill River Parkway, the report says.
Housing development is expected to be limited in the north, where the Croton watershed covers 60 percent of the area, because of New York City's strict watershed regulations.
In other census projections, the report says that the county's population, now 888,000, will grow an average of less than 1 percent a year, and by the year 2020 will reach 905,000. It also says that the population is not likely to exceed 910,000 in the future, based upon limits determined by employment opportunities and the availability of housing.
In 25 years, Westchester's share of the Hudson Valley region's total employment is projected to decline to 39 percent from 47 percent. Over all, though, the total number of wage and salary jobs in the county is projected to grow by 16.4 percent, or 74,000.
The net increase in housing is not expected to exceed an average of 1,000 units a year from now to 2020, the report says.
"The historic highs of the 1960's and early 1970's in terms of housing construction will almost certainly not be sustained again," the report says. "The building shortfall, especially in multi-family construction, is a major constraint on population growth."
In other population projections, the report says, the current baby boom, which is defined as more than 10,000 births in a year, is expected to continue to the end of the decade. And another "baby-boomlet period" is expected between 2010 and 2015.
Meanwhile, the under-20 population in Westchester is expected to decline to about 19 percent of the overall population by 2020 from 24 percent in 1990. The numbers of those 20 to 64 will increase to 64 percent, from 61 percent five years ago. And the 65 and older group will increase to 17 percent from 14 percent in 1990.
William N. Cassella, chairman of the Westchester County Planning Board, who called the report's findings "expected, not surprising at all," pointed out that the demand for more affordable housing will be coming from two sectors: immigrants who cannot yet afford single-family homes and the growing group of those 65 and older.
Mae Carpenter, director of the County Office for the Aging, said recent surveys of the elderly showed affordable housing to be a primary concern for that group, many of whom now spend about half of their incomes on housing, because the county has a limited stock of affordable units.
She said the census projections for 2020 pointed up an urgent need to address the housing and transportation concerns of the elderly so that they do not become isolated from other sectors of the population.
Educators, too, said the report would serve as a planning tool. At Westchester Community College in Valhalla, Betsy Weiner, director of College Communications, said college enrollments reflected population shifts in the population at large.
She said demand was already very high for non-credit English as a second language courses and for a credit course on diction for non-native speakers of English.
She noted also that Hispanic students represented 10 percent of enrollments, blacks 17 percent and Asians 5 percent. Hispanic and Asian students are the fastest-growing groups at the college, while enrollments of blacks have "begun to flatten out," she said.
The Department of Social Services would not comment on the report, and a spokesman there said Commissioner Mary E. Glass did not necessarily foresee any major changes in the delivery of services.
But at the Health Department, Commissioner Mark Rapoport said the population shifts further complicated the outlook for public medicine, which was also having to adapt to many other changes at the same time. He said he foresaw a possible conflict between the increased demand for public services and a government policy that is "looking toward private-sector partnering" and less of a direct-treatment role.
"It's hard to predict how this will all play out," Dr. Rapoport said, "so we prefer to plan only two years in advance and make incremental changes. It's the only way to go when the general patterns are not all that clear."

HEADLINE: Sales on a Seesaw: Retail Picture Mixed

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
A REPORT on retail trade in Westchester, based on the the 1992 Economic Census, shows gains in some areas and losses in others.
Gross retail sales in the county grew at a modest 10 percent from 1987 to 1992, lagging behind the state's retail growth of 15.2 percent. 
 Sales activity in the north of the county appeared strong for the period and was increasingly concentrated in towns like Yorktown and the Mount Kisco-Bedford area. By contrast, retail performance in the county's southern cities dropped off, although it remained vigorous along the Route 100 and Route 1 corridor in places like Mamaroneck and Port Chester. The Route 9 corridor near the Hudson River, however, showed a mixed sales picture for towns like Ardsley, Irvington, North Tarrytown and Croton-on-Hudson.
Over all, retail sales in the county in 1992 were about $7.4 billion, compared with $6.8 billion in 1987. That represents a 10 percent gain in actual dollars, but a decrease of 13 percent when the figures are adjusted for inflation. From 1967 to 1987, retail sales made gains of up to 52.5 percent in each five-year period.
The total payroll for retail trade in the county rose to $932 million in 1992 from $815 million in 1987, or 14.3 percent But the number of employees in retail trade dropped to 59,559 from 64,947 -- a loss of 8.3 percent.
Westchester ranked fourth in retail sales for New York counties in 1992 after Manhattan ($17.4 billion), Nassau ($13.7 billion) and Suffolk ($10.7 billion).
Yonkers ranked third among the state's cities for retail sales that year ($1.3 billion), after New York City ($36.5 billion) and Buffalo ($1.4 billion). White Plains ($885.7 million) ranked sixth. New Rochelle ($415.7 million) fell to 15th place from 8th in 1987.
The top 10 retail centers in the county in 1992 in terms of sales dollars were Yonkers, White Plains, Yorktown, New Rochelle, Greenburgh, Scarsdale, Mount Kisco, Mount Vernon, Eastchester and Bedford. The lowest were Irvington, Rye Brook, Cortlandt and Hastings-on-Hudson. The report said that there were 1,654 eating and drinking places in Westchester in 1992, or 26.9 percent of all retail establishments. But they generated only 8.6 percent of the county's retail sales.
By contrast, there were 878 food stores, and they generated $1.5 billion in sales, or 20.2 percent of all retail sales.
There were only 216 automobile dealerships, but they accounted for $1.4 billion in sales -- or 19 percent of the county's retail trade for 1992. In 1987, however, auto sales accounted for 22.1 percent of all sales in the county, and the report noted that the 1992 recession "undoubtedly had a dampening effect on new car sales."
Annual sales per employee, when adjusted for inflation, declined 5.5 percent, to $98,373 in 1992 from $104,147 in 1987.
The report was the fourth on retail trade in the county prepared by the County Planning Department. The Economic Census, also known as the Census of Business, has been conducted by the United States Bureau of the Census every five years since 1967. It provides information on retail trade, wholesale trade, service industries, manufacturing and agriculture for counties and municipalities nationwide.
The census included all establishments with paid employees that sell merchandise for personal or household consumption and render services related to the sale of goods. It did not include governmental organizations or establishments like warehouses.
For the first time, the 1992 Census of Retail Trade provided data on individual towns. In previous years, that information had not been broken out and was included in a category called "Balance of County."
Albert A. Annunziata, the Planning Department's director of research, said that since 1992 the retail sales picture had improved and that retail sales tax receipts were up.
"The county on balance is maintaining a good position in the metropolitan region for retail trade," he said, attributing part of the gains in the last three years to Westchester's emergence from the most recent economic recession.

HEADLINE: Shooting for the Basket, and in the Process, for a Better Life

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
THE stampeding sounds of sneakers echoed through the second-floor gymnasium at the Y.M.C.A. on Riverdale Avenue here, as Randy's Bus and Van team squared off against the team from Saturn of White Plains in a ferocious basketball game. Despite the sweltering night, unrelieved by the circulation of a few sluggish fans, the players raced up and down the court, leaping to dunk baskets and make jump shots, hitting nothing but net, until Randy's won, 58-56.
But the players in this late-evening game, on July 27, were doing more than just shooting hoops. As participants in the new Midnight Basketball program in Yonkers, these young men were among 120 local participants in a social experiment that seeks to combine sports and self-improvement. 
 The Yonkers program is part of New York Midnight Basketball, which has leagues currently in Manhattan, the Bronx and Brooklyn as well as a women's league. A sister program exists in Albany. The program targets an inner-city population ages 17 to 26. New York Midnight Basketball, founded by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in 1994, serves about 500 people a year. It is a program of HELP (Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged) an organization that provides housing for the homeless and other social services. Beyond basketball, the program, which is financed by donations, tries to motivate participants toward schooling and the job market.
Councilwoman Symra D. Brandon of Yonkers, who represents the First District, approached Midnight Basketball last year about expanding into Yonkers. The program began a season here in June; it will continue through September.
"The hook wasn't just basketball, but real workshops, so that these young men could do something other than basketball," Ms. Brandon said. "The program is a viable option to keeping them off the streets. Yonkers doesn't have a lot of programs for youngsters at night."
The games provide an activity not only for the players but for the spectators, who are invited to watch without charge. The Yonkers games typically draw 200 to 300 fans.
On the national level, Midnight Basketball has been in existence for the last decade. There are programs in cities like Atlanta, Chicago, San Antonio and San Francisco. The Oakland, Calif.-based National Association of Midnight Basketball Leagues represents a network of about 50 different leagues nationwide.
The local organizers said the program seeks to help young adults who are unemployed or underemployed and who lack educational credentials or skills. To be eligible to take part, all potential players must attend eight evenings of "boot camp," a rigorous program of motivational workshops and intense physical activity. Those who stay with the program are selected for basketball teams sponsored by local businesses in a public draft in which attitude and attendance count for more than athletic ability. There are 10 players assigned to a team, with five alternates.
The games, which begin at 10 and 11:30 P.M., are held two nights a week. In order to play, participants have to attend pre-game workshops on topics like resume writing and interviewing techniques; AIDS awareness and health-related issues like alcohol and drug abuse; preparation for the high school equivalency diploma and applying for college financial aid, and conflict-resolution skills. Some coming workshops will even include job-recruiting sessions from local employers. From the 1994 New York Midnight Basketball program in New York City, about 40 percent of the participants moved on to college or full-time jobs. Each participant is scheduled for one game and one workshop each week.
"We didn't want another basketball league," said Mike Klein, executive director of New York Midnight Basketball. "We want to be seen as a jobs and education program. It's not just about basketball. Basketball is the magnet, the hook, to get these guys to come in. The guys will listen to a workshop, not to a teacher in a classroom. To play in Midnight Basketball, you have to follow the rules. This is a program based on personal responsibility. When these guys are 30, basketball won't pay the bills."
The rules are strict and enforced. For each player on a team, there are anywhere from three to five alternate players eager to take his place.
"If they don't come to the workshops, they can't play," said Ray Jones, coordinator for the workshops. "If they come late and don't have a good excuse, like a note from their employer or a documented emergency, they can't play."
Jim Bostic, a Yonkers native and former player for the Detroit Pistons, is manager of Midnight Basketball in Yonkers. "The basketball aspect is the smallest part of it," he said. "We threw it in to draw the young men in, and also to break up the monotony of the classes and workshops.
"I made boot camp as tough as possible to simulate life and see how they handle it. I wanted to see if they quit, or if they could find a way around difficult situations. The program helps them be more marketable and employable. Here's a chance for them to pick themselves up and restart their life."
The program relies on community members as team coaches and mentors for the players. "The basketball coach is there for other things besides basketball," Mr. Klein said. "It comes down to networking, and what we're trying to do is generate new networks."
Midnight Basketball receives no government funds. A variety of sponsors underwrite the league, paying $2,000 a season to support a team or $250 for sponsoring an individual player. Yonkers has eight teams, sponsored by Saturn of White Plains, Randy's Bus and Van, the Cross County Shopping Center, Greenway Plaza Shoprite, the Yonkers Minority Business Association, Roizman Development Inc. and the law firm Novick, Edelstein, Lubell, Reisman, Wasserman & Leventhal. One more team sponsor is still being sought. Other contributors include Con Edison, Nike, Snapple, H.I.P and two radio stations, WQHT, which broadcasts as Hot 97 (97 FM), and WRKS-FM (98.7), which broadcasts as KISS.
The corporate sponsors "need this population for their employees," Mr. Klein said. "These guys need a job, and they need to make the connection to work. We're trying to transfer that work ethic."
Ms. Brandon added: "What sold sponsors is this link. Shoprite, for example, wants to get two or three young men from this program to work in their store and go through college."
A recent workshop for the players, led by a counselor from the neighboring Y.W.C.A., Dwayne Middleton, focused on the decision-making process and how the participants could set and meet goals for themselves. One participant, Nate Wylie, 19, a graduate of Lincoln High School in Yonkers, where he was an all-county quarterback, termed the program beneficial. "I like people who participate," said Mr. Wylie, who is working with disabled children before going to college in the fall, "and I like to play sports."
Kibwe Dorsey, 20, who attended Roosevelt High School and is hoping to earn his equivalency diploma, conceded that "boot camp was hard, but it was disciplined." He continued: I really like to play basketball, and this keeps me off the streets and keeps me out of trouble. I want to go to college and play sports."
The effort is working, said Mr. Jones, the workshop coordinator. "What I like about the program is that it's taking young men with nothing to do, and giving them something to do," he said. "This may be the last opportunity for some of them."
More information about Midnight Basketball is available by calling Councilwoman Brandon's office at 377-6311 or contacting the program directly at 476-1806.

HEADLINE: Long Island Q&A: George Bundschuh;
From H.M.O.'s to AIDS Research, It's More Than Insurance

BYLINE: By SUSAN E. KONIG 

 BODY:
THIS year the New York Life Insurance Company celebrates its 150th anniversary. For nearly 40 years George Bundschuh has worked for the company, becoming president in 1990. He will retire in October.
With $69 billion in assets, New York Life ranks fifth among American insurance companies. It has 200 offices in North America, with three on Long Island, and others in Europe, Asia and South America. Life insurance accounts for by far the largest share of business, but the company also owns the Sanus Corporation, a health maintenance organization with 900,000 customers, and sells asset-management services, pension products, mutual funds and annuities. 
 Mr. Bundschuh became president after having been vice chairman. He earned a B.B.A. in accounting from Pace University and a master's from the Columbia University Graduate School of Business. For 28 years he has lived in Port Washington, where he and his wife, Joanne, raised two children.
Q. How many people have life insurance and how have sales been?
A. About 154 million Americans have some type of life insurance. Sales were flat last year, although they didn't fall. I think they pretty much reflected the economy.
Q. Who should buy life insurance? Should young single people buy it to obtain lower rates?
A. I don't think anyone should buy it unless they have a need. Once you buy a policy you can always borrow some of the money and put more in later. As for young single people, if you are truly farsighted -- that is, if you know you are going to be married and have children, you have extra cash and you know that at this point in time you'll get good rates because you're in good health -- then maybe you should buy. But the decision should really be based on need.
Q. What kind of insurance should Long Islanders buy?
A. In terms of financial planning and protecting the family, life insurance is an excellent base. It's quite important for families with children, so that should something happen to the wage earners there is a stream of income to provide for housing, education, etc. After that you may want to think about other capital-accumulation opportunities. If your firm has a 401K plan, for example, take advantage of it, because the tax preferences make it ideal. I.R.A.'s and annuities are also an excellent way to build up a sizable asset base.
Q. What would you say to people who feel life insurance has become too expensive?
A. The first thing you want to do is distinguish between permanent and term insurance. Term insurance is much cheaper, because all you're really doing is considering the mortality risk. It's strictly a death benefit. There's no buildup of cash. When you have a permanent policy -- a whole-life policy, a universal-life policy -- there is a death benefit plus a built-in savings component. Yes, you're putting more into the policy, but you're building an asset base which you can use for living expenses. People seem to think borrowing on their policy is just for emergencies. That's not true. It can be a "planned for" thing. You may want to build a cash base for someone's education, a new home, etc., and there are built-in tax preferences. Because this business is so competitive I think you can find the coverage you need at a good price.
Q. With increasing single-parent families, are more women buying life insurance?
A.Absolutely. Men are still the primary buyers. But, in 1994, 40 percent of our sales were to women. Women represent 35 percent of our life-insurance business. More women are selling life insurance, too. Nearly 20 percent of our agents are female.
Q. What is a "second to die" policy?
A. It's an estate-planning tool, really. It is a policy which pays off when both parties, a husband and wife, pass away. The advantage is that the premium is typically much lower than they would be on each party individually. So it serves a real need. And it's a pretty popular product these days.
Q. What job opportunities exist in the industry?
A. There are some excellent opportunities for college graduates in a number of areas like computer systems, actuarial sciences and investments, to name just a few. I started in investments. And there is always a need for good agents. But most people starting as agents have had prior experience elsewhere in the business world. You don't often see people right out of school, because one needs a network of business people to sell to. It's also a very tough business, though it can be quite lucrative. And you can make your own hours. It's not a 9-to-5 job. Agents have the most success when they sell to their peers. So they generally "grow up" with their clients. As the client gets older, earns more money and needs more insurance, that's when the agent really does well.
Q. What do you think of the Island's real-estate market?
A. I think it's perking up, but frankly it has a ways to go. And hopefully the improvement won't be offset by a surge in interest rates. That's the danger to Long Island right now. The market has clearly bottomed, and I think it will continue to grow, with that one proviso, that we don't have another surge in interest rates.
Q. How is the health-insurance industry doing?
A. It's growing rapidly. Last year was very significant for the industry, because Clinton's health-care plan was still a possibility, and that would have affected us adversely. But Congress decided against a "grand health care scheme." And because of that, we see progress being made with regard to some much-needed changes in the system. We're all sensitive to the need for "portability" of health insurance. The Health Insurance Association of America has made some proposals along those lines. We're also quite cognizant of the issue of uninsured people and hope this, too, can be resolved. I think over the next year or so the emphasis will shift from the Federal to the state level, as Congress starts focusing on other things. They spent so much time and energy on health care last year I think they're finally ready to see improvements made "incrementally." And I doubt we'll see anything major like the Clinton proposal introduced again.
Q. How has AIDS affected the health-insurance industry?
A. The industry was affected by the spread of AIDS right from the start. And I'm proud to say that funding research is the priority of the New York Life Foundation, an AIDS-related research and educational organization. I think the industry has handled AIDS pretty well. As far as group health insurance goes, there is generally no screening for pre-existing conditions like AIDS. But we've adjusted for that. I can't say AIDS has had a significant adverse impact on group insurance. And we feel we've been able to provide people who have this disease with the proper treatment.
Q. What changes do you foresee in health care?
A. We're already seeing some dramatic changes, and they're all moving toward managed care. There will be a great deal of innovation. Our company just signed a letter of intent with Duke University Health Systems to form a managed-care company in South Carolina. This is the first time in this country that an H.M.O. has teamed up with a major research hospital. We want to create new standards in medical care by pooling our expertise. Duke will learn more about how a managed-care environment works, and we'll learn more about quality medical care and how to apply it.
Q. Why does your company, which does business nationally and internationally, retain the New York Life name?
A. Obviously the company was started in New York. But when we began going overseas in the mid-80's, I was amazed to find that the name was so well accepted. I think it was because New York is looked upon as a worldwide financial center. Personally, I thought the name would suggest something very provincial. But it's actually had the opposite effect. So we're using it in many foreign markets.
Q. What advice would you give to someone shopping for insurance?
A. Check the rating agency manuals. There are a number of independent sources like Standard & Poor's, Moody's and A. M. Best whose job it is to evaluate companies and assess their credit standing. It's very important to look at that. It's also important to choose an agent who is knowledgeable, reputable and experienced, and one whom you'll feel comfortable with on a long-term basis. You can do this through referrals. You can also call up any company office and ask to speak to an agent. You'll get a feel for his or her personality, and you can compare recommendations before you choose someone. If you're considering very large purchases, you may want the advice of a variety of professionals such as accountants or lawyers to make sure the products you're buying will meet your financial objective.

PAYBACK
The Conspiracy to Destroy Michael Milken
and His Financial Revolution.
By Daniel Fischel.
332 pp. New York:
Harper Business. $25. 
IT'S 1995. What do you think now about the crimes of Michael Milken? Do you think the former junk bond king was at the center of "the greatest criminal conspiracy the financial world has ever known" -- as James B. Stewart famously described him in the best-selling book "Den of Thieves"? Or do you take the revisionist view that he and his firm, the now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert, were unfairly railroaded by the Government, as Daniel Fischel, a University of Chicago economist, argues in "Payback"?
Do you think Mr. Milken's most visible creation, the junk bond market, destroyed companies or built them? Is Ivan Boesky, the crooked arbitrager whose allegations were most responsible for putting Mr. Milken behind bars, a repentant criminal or a craven liar? And how about Rudolph Giuliani, the United States Attorney (now, of course, New York's Mayor) who went after Mr. Milken and many other Wall Street figures? Was he just doing his job, or was he conducting, in Mr. Fischel's phrase, a "reign of terror"?
What's amazing is not just that these questions have been around for so long -- nearly a decade, believe it or not -- but that they still resonate. Mr. Milken remains a subject of such fascination that The Wall Street Journal devoted a recent front-page story to his postprison life. More to the point, the questions surrounding Mr. Milken's downfall aren't even close to being settled. If anything, now that the smoke has cleared -- he was released from prison two years ago -- they have become more contentious than they were in the 1980's.
One important reason for this is that there is so much ambiguity surrounding the Milken affair; even the fact that he pleaded guilty to six felonies can be interpreted in a number of different ways. But another reason, nearly as important, is that virtually every writer to have taken up the subject has, rather than face those ambiguities directly, used them to stake out extraordinarily inflexible positions. Thus, several years ago, the writer-actor-lawyer Benjamin J. Stein could publish a virulently anti-Milken book while the journalist Jesse Kornbluth could write a book that practically canonized Mr. Milken -- even though both men were relying on the same facts.
"Payback" fits squarely in this lead-with-your-chin tradition. Its subtitle alone tells you that this will not be a subtle exploration of ambiguity. Indeed, Mr. Fischel is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. What is surprising is that the author, who acted as a consultant to a number of key Wall Street figures in the 1980's, including Mr. Milken, doesn't use his position as "an insider to many of the events that are the subject matter of this book" to enliven his account -- that is, to humanize the individuals he writes about. Then again, it is perhaps not that much of a surprise, since Mr. Fischel's contempt for journalists like Mr. Stewart, who do rely on humanizing devices like anecdotes, practically drips off the page.
Mr. Fischel has taken a different approach. He has attempted to build a case -- not just on behalf of Mr. Milken, but also on behalf of many of the other figures brought low by the Wall Street scandals -- in much the same way a lawyer lays out a final argument. One's verdict, however, is likely to be mixed: though there are plenty of places where his logic is powerful, there are other places where his sympathies simply get the best of him. As a result, he ends up more or less preaching to the converted.
The most telling part of Mr. Fischel's account is his detailing of the excesses of the Government, both in hunting down Wall Street figures whose crimes were far from evident and, in a larger sense, in helping create such 1980's disasters as the savings-and-loan crisis. With barely controlled rage, Mr. Fischel recounts the stories of minor Wall Street characters like Timothy Tabor and Richard Wigton, who, on Mr. Giuliani's orders, was hauled away in handcuffs. He tells of the United States Attorney's willingness to use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO -- a statute aimed at mobsters -- to cripple firms like Drexel and Princeton/Newport Partners, which were not cooperating to Mr. Giuliani's satisfaction. "The Government's police-state tactics," Mr. Fischel labels such methods. Inasmuch as the principals of Princeton/Newport had their convictions overturned on appeal on the ground that they had been convicted of things that simply weren't crimes, and Mr. Tabor and Mr. Wigton were never even brought to trial, it would be hard to disagree.
Mr. Fischel is similarly correct in saying that the S. & L. crisis -- for which Mr. Milken was largely faulted, because so many big S. & L.'s held Milken-issued junk bonds -- was an instance where government was the real culprit. It was Congress, after all, that changed the rules of the game, making it possible for S. & L.'s to buy junk bonds. And when Congress -- in a knee-jerk reaction to Mr. Milken's troubles -- then passed a law forcing S. & .L's to sell off their portfolios en masse, it pretty much guaranteed that the junk bond market would crash, and the S. & .L's with it. That the junk bond market is now thriving is further proof of how woefully misguided Congress's action was.
Yet in his eagerness to exonerate Mr. Milken et al., Mr. Fischel goes wildly overboard. In this he really does resemble a lawyer -- but, alas, a lawyer who has got so involved with his client that he has lost his ability to evaluate the evidence coolly. Thus, for every Princeton/ Newport, there are cases where Mr. Fischel attempts to defend the indefensible. He rails on about the conviction of his former consulting client Charles Keating, for instance -- a man who gulled elderly savers into putting their money into risky bonds whose worth collapsed when his S. & L. did. He says that Victor Posner, who notoriously bought companies only to loot them, "created wealth for investors and society as a whole." He even claims that those who decried the 1980's as the "decade of greed" were motivated by the desire "to delegitimize and discredit the efforts and success of others." In other words, they were envious.
And then there is the thorny issue of Michael Milken. Were some of the felonies to which he pleaded guilty technical violations of securities law, as Mr. Fischel charges? Yes. Is it likely that Mr. Milken fell on his sword in part to save his brother, Lowell, who was also being threatened with indictment? Probably. Is it true that when prosecutors were allowed, in an extraordinary hearing, to make their best case against Mr. Milken, they fell flat on their faces? Without question. But can one therefore draw the conclusion, as Mr. Fischel does, that there is "no evidence" that Mr. Milken committed any crimes at all? Not remotely.
For instance, try as he might, Mr. Fischel never adequately explains away the relationship between Mr. Milken and Mr. Boesky. He describes their business dealings as "routine reciprocal accommodations to preserve good client relationships," but they were far more than that. Mr. Milken both underwrote and invested in the fund Mr. Boesky used to bet on hostile takeovers -- many of which were made possible thanks to Mr. Milken's junk bonds. The temptation on Mr. Milken's part to help Mr. Boesky was powerful, as was the incentive for Mr. Boesky to do Mr. Milken's bidding. And when the Government uncovered a $5.3 million invoice from Mr. Milken to Mr. Boesky for "consulting services" -- an invoice that both men would later admit was a settling between the two of them for illegal securities transactions -- the prosecutors had their smoking gun. Mr. Fischel is reduced to complaining that the four Milken felonies that stemmed from that invoice weren't all that felonious, since "the Government never could identify any . . . injury to anyone." By that standard, Heidi Fleiss was railroaded, too.
What the Milken debate lacks -- and "Payback" is a good example of this -- is common sense. Common sense suggests that Mr. Milken was not the greatest white-collar criminal who ever lived -- not even close. But common sense should also lead us away from the position, taken by people like Mr. Fischel, that a completely innocent man was destroyed by the forces of darkness. If you ask former Drexel hands -- and not those who turned state's evidence, either -- they'll tell you that Mr. Milken did cross the line. "I really like Mike," one such person told me a few years ago, "but he deserved to do some time."
Strip away the overheated rhetoric and you're left with a man who admitted to committing some white-collar crimes and wound up spending two years in jail. All in all, that seems just about right. Perhaps someday we'll be able to admit that. When we do, we'll finally be ready to come to terms with what Michael Milken wrought.

 LOSING the family farm has almost become a literary genre of its own, one rich with sentiment and, unavoidably, some sentimentality. At times, there seem to be nearly as many people writing about farming as there are actual farmers. And with the rate that agribusiness is gobbling up small holdings, the equation might actually be approaching parity.
Rarely have shoppers who buy their bacon and chops out of the supermarket case heard the pig's final throaty gurgle at slaughter, or seen the past-peak milk cow stunned to her knees before being sacrificed for hamburger. Too many people cling to a storybook picture of piglets and calves cavorting in green pastures -- and mourn the encroachment of subdivisions even as they move into them. Those who get no closer to the furrow than their weekly sojourn at the roadside farm stand are susceptible to romantic notions about the purity of the work ethic, the spiritual rewards of tilling the soil, tapping the sugar maples and being at one with nature. Of course, there are ample rewards to be gained from a life on the land, but they are often realized in complicated ways. It is just this intricate intersection of satisfaction and sacrifice that is explored in four elegiac new books about small farming ventures ranging from New England to California.
Charles Fish confronts his own family's situation squarely and thoughtfully in his first book, "In Good Hands: The Keeping of a Family Farm." Although Mr. Fish takes us back to the 1830's as he traces the history of his ancestors' small Vermont dairy farm, he is concerned with far more than an evocation of a way of life or a vision of the vanishing past. From the very outset, it is clear that he also intends to examine contemporary issues of morality, connections between Yankee rectitude -- "honesty, duty, charity, compassion, sexual restraint, clean speech, frugality, faith, love of country, and hard work" -- and the demands of the outside world.
Jane Brox is the granddaughter of Lebanese immigrants who came to New England in 1900 to work in the mills and bought a piece of land instead, some 30 miles up the Merrimack River from Newburyport, Mass. She grew up helping to pick, sort, sell and partake of the fruits of the family truck farm. After college, she left home and went to live on an island, where she worked as a baker. Gradually, the farm drew her back. "Here and Nowhere Else" is a poignant account of that return and recommitment, darkened by the realization that her contract with the land might soon be broken.
David Mas Masumoto, a third-generation Japanese-American, raises peaches and grapes in the San Joaquin Valley of California on land coaxed into productivity by his father and mother, possibly the same soil on which his grandparents labored as new immigrants. A committed organic farmer, Mr. Masumoto also works hard as a freelance writer to illuminate the life of the small farm, and thus save a niche for it. "Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on My Family Farm" amply demonstrates what a prodigious struggle that can be.
John Hildebrand married into a tightly knit family that farms the same 240 acres near Rochester, Minn., that were acquired by its Irish ancestors in the 1880's. The land he describes in "Mapping the Farm: The Chronicle of a Family" produces corn, soybeans and alfalfa. Much of the corn and alfalfa go to support two dozen Hereford cows with their calves, as well as an annual cash crop of pigs. The cows are pasture-bred rather than artificially inseminated. Their manure is returned to the soil. Corn is only grown twice on a field before that field is turned to soybeans, a legume that puts nitrogen back into the soil, and then alfalfa. As on the other farms, there's a rhythm and balance to each seasonal task and pleasure, and Mr. Hildebrand is brilliant at detailing them.
All of the farms described in these four books are in jeopardy today, although some are more precarious than others. Agribusiness and public apathy are the most obvious villains. Economic forces squeeze the small farmer dry; it requires enormous fortitude and flexibility to stay afloat in the present-day market, where, as Mr. Hildebrand puts it, "giant corporations at the top exercise a virtual monopoly on food from farm to table." On the other hand, individual consumers don't often provide much solace: palates dulled by fast foods no longer seem able to appreciate subtle tastes. If they could only sample Mr. Masumoto's tree-ripened peaches, with "flesh . . . so juicy that it oozes down your chin," perhaps they might be swayed.
After all, customers still flock to Jane Brox's family farm stand for tomatoes and corn in season. The same handful of loyal workers pick blueberries in July, apples in August and September and squash and pumpkins in October, but there are few to take their places when they're gone -- and no one to supplant the aging patriarch. "He is 83," Ms. Brox reports. "By now both knees are bad, and he is stone blind in one eye." He worries about where people will get their corn.
The one son who might have succeeded Ms. Brox's father is troubled and unwell, with a longstanding drug problem. "He goes unwashed and unshaven, and his clothes are ragged," she notes with alarm. "He is sullen and alone," his eyes "shining and feral." Neither of the two other siblings wants to take over the farm, a predicament Ms. Brox describes crisply yet with great feeling. As the suburbs encroach, land values soar. Soon the fields will be swallowed by housing developments. People will have to get their corn, starchy and days old, at the supermarket.
These kinds of market forces may also compel Mr. Masumoto to give up his luscious Sun Crest peaches. An organic baby-food producer rescued one crop, but this remarkable peach has a short shelf life and does not withstand shipping and storage well. The sole organic farmer of the group, Mr. Masumoto is an idealist who seems to have found his vocation, at least in part, for esthetic reasons. Initially, he planted cover crops in his orchards simply to provide lush clover for his wife and new baby to stroll through in the spring. Next he added wildflower seeds to the mix, again for the sheer pleasure they provided. Gradually he came to realize that these early blooms were a welcome mat for beneficial insects.
 MR. MASUMOTO'S style is naive, lyrical and, alas, a little repetitive. Still, "Epitaph for a Peach" is an important book. It is not resignation but stoicism that tinges this text, eliciting sympathy and admiration. Mr. Masumoto makes a convincing case for composting and cover crops, as opposed to industrial fertilizers and heavy reliance on herbicides. He has observed the sterility of soils treated year after year with these compounds. Some wells in his valley have shown traces of dibromochloropropane, a chemical once used to control microscopic pests. "No one knew it would contaminate drinking water," Mr. Masumoto explains. And now people in the neighboring cities are angry about their damaged water supply. "How could you farmers poison the water?" they ask. In this matter, small farmers may often suffer for the activities of their much larger rivals.
Family farmers like Mr. Masumoto are also at the mercy of both the weather and the labor market. In late August, it is time to harvest the grapes, which must have 20 days of full sun in order to dry into dark, sweet raisins. Time passes, but workers are scarce. They go first to the big producers; Mr. Masumoto waits and frets. The drama builds as a storm front approaches. The harvest is almost over, and 35,000 trays of would-be raisins are on the ground. A good part of the crop is lost as a second front overtakes the first. Nevertheless, Mr. Masumoto will persevere. "When I first started," he tells us, "I realized I would never make a fortune in farming, but I hoped I could be rich in other ways -- and maybe, just maybe, my work would create some other kind of wealth in the process."
John Hildebrand's "Mapping the Farm" provides thorough documentation of the intangible, emotional wealth Mr. Masumoto is talking about. Longer and more ambitious than the three other books, it manages to be both a personal testament and an absorbing chronicle of agrarian history. Mr. Hildebrand's accounts of the Depression years and the strike of the Farm Holiday Association (which pledged to withhold produce from market until a fair price was obtained) are gracefully interwoven with the experiences of his own in-laws, the O'Neills. He describes, for example, the emergence of the firebrand Father Coughlin, whose radio broadcasts lambasted the agricultural policies of the New Deal, and William Lemke, Coughlin's hand-picked candidate for the Presidency, even as he shows how the O'Neills were caught up in the politics of the time. In a similar fashion, he provides a fascinating disquisition on the delivery in 1911 of the 20-horsepower steam traction engine that would liberate the workhorses on the O'Neill farm -- and modernize threshing across the country.
 THROUGHOUT this absorbing book, historical facts enrich descriptions of present practices. Mr. Hildebrand is even able to summon up an idyllic and now all but obsolete scene without making it seem a cliche: milking time in the old barn, with cats lined up waiting for the final pint and children at liberty, between their assigned tasks, to climb to the haymow and swing on the ropes. Yet at the same time, Mr. Hildebrand is unsentimental about castrating terrified calves and packing hogs off to slaughter, and he seems to accept on faith the ungovernability of the few horses that figure in his account. ("Someone tethered the big sorrel to the back of a manure spreader, where, maddened by flies, it drove one of the spokes into its head.")
Attending a livestock auction at the county fair, Mr. Hildebrand is dismissive of the animal-rights movement because the members he has met seem "less interested in the connections between humans and animals than in the expiation of a free-floating guilt." But he acknowledges that such connections are sometimes troublesome: when unacceptable levels of nitrates are found in the farm's drinking water in the spring, the cause is laid to "traces of fertilizer and manure that had percolated through the fields and into the groundwater."
This sort of unflinching observation is the strength of Charles Fish's account of his family's history as farmers in Vermont. For every abstract noun in his often richly speculative text, there is a buttress of specific detail, from killing woodchucks to recording milk production statistics, from the sweaty work of putting up hay in summer to the icy job of spreading wet manure, by hand, on the fields in winter. Pigs are slaughtered, calves castrated, chickens decapitated, for there is nothing on the farm that does not have its price.
A Rhodes scholar, the holder of a Ph.D. from Princeton, a world traveler, Mr. Fish returned in mid-life to the hilltop village of Dummerston Center, Vt., and from this quiet pulpit began his searching philosophical inquiry into the boyhood summers he spent on the nearby family farm. His splendid book is informative, reflective, investigative and wise. And it is further enhanced by a final section, called "Witnesses," that reproduces various family documents, including an essay composed by his great-great-grandfather, who bought the land in 1836, as well as scrapbook jottings by his quietly authoritative grandmother and portions of a diary Mr. Fish kept during the summer he turned 8 years old.
The farm he remembers from his childhood now operates as a vegetable market garden, and Mr. Masumoto's peach and grape operation is still pursuing its goal of offering pesticide-free ripe fruit in defiance of large-scale commercial pick-em-green enterprises. But a less secure future awaits the O'Neill farm in Minnesota and Ms. Brox's family spread in New England. "None of the children had been groomed to take over the farm," Mr. Hildebrand says of his wife and her siblings. "By accident or omission, they had been reprieved from a life they hadn't asked to be reprieved from." A compromise is reached in which the aging parents give the farm to their children while still maintaining a life-estate interest. The hard decisions are thereby postponed. This year, one son will put in the crops, a son-in-law will repair the fences and so on. For the time being, "each grain of soil belongs to all eight children and cannot be divided."
Reading these books is a way to see what ought not, in a much larger sense, be divided. But it may already have happened, for we have lost much in terms of our allegiance to the land. Perhaps it is the function of the genre of writing practiced by these four authors to provide urban dwellers, hungry for their lost roots in the hayfields and cow barns of their great-grandparents, with at least a tenuous connection to the earth and living creatures. Indifference and ignorance are as much the villains as technology, greed and pollution. Possibly these books will heighten public awareness of the fragility of the environment and alert readers to the stewardship required if our land and our water are to be rescued from ongoing contamination.

HEADLINE: Why Applaud an Increase in Unemployment?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"More From Labor in New York," your July 30 editorial encouraging the Mayor to seek "more concessions" from city workers, is based on distortions and myths.
The most disturbing is the idea that eliminating tens of thousands of jobs is a positive step, as if the people who lose these jobs (or new workers who won't be able to get those jobs) simply disappear or magically find employment elsewhere. 
 A person who loses a job is unemployed. An eliminated job perpetuates unemployment. Joblessness is at the root of this city's problems. It's a burden on services, a drain on revenues and a source of deterioration of our quality of life. To applaud its increase is absurd.
This says nothing of the services lost when these jobs are eliminated, but you seem to believe that city workers aren't really providing services. Instead, you advance the contention that the city must "force" an increase in productivity.
I can attest, and document, that the city's work force is stretched thin. Many of our members are handling responsibilities designed for two people, and a visit to any city office will demonstrate how service delivery has become a frantic challenge for those who remain.
The editorial suggests measures "workers everywhere have had to accept," including insurance co-payments and elimination of overtime. But many city workers already make co-payments as part of their benefits packages. And where (except in the most barbaric situations) have workers been forced to work overtime without adequate compensation?
You want city workers to work several hours more a week without getting paid. Working overtime takes us back to the turn of the century; working without pay takes us back to slavery.

HEADLINE: Cuban Leadership Shows Little Hope Of Closer U.S. Ties

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: HAVANA, Aug. 6

 BODY:
After months of diplomacy that raised Cuban hopes for a thaw in relations with the United States, the Government of President Fidel Castro appears to have abandoned hopes for a significant improvement before the American presidential election next year.
In recent speeches and interviews, Mr. Castro and his senior aides have criticized the Clinton Administration as sharply as ever, attacking its support for the American economic embargo against Cuba and describing its proposal to increase contact between the countries as sabotage in disguise. 
 "The enemy does not cease in its efforts to destroy us," Mr. Castro said in one address. Even more moderate American opponents of the Cuban Government, he insisted, "want to penetrate us, weaken us, create all kinds of counterrevolutionary organizations to destabilize the country, whatever the consequences."
Such remarks have prompted concern from the United States and from European and Latin American governments that strongly oppose the American embargo and hope to encourage democratic political reform in Cuba while promoting foreign investment and trade.
Diplomats say the official statements have not coincided so far with any visibly tougher treatment by the Communist Government of those whom it has seen as potential agents of the new subversion: students, scholars, members of the country's tiny but growing civic groups.
But after making small political moves that encouraged American officials, Cuban officials have increasingly dismissed the idea of gradual progress toward closer ties with the United States. Once again, they have suggested that so long as the embargo remains, political change in Cuba is out of the question and efforts to solve other problems between Havana and Washington are probably a waste of time.
"Let us not be fooled," Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said in an interview last week with a Cuban newspaper. "All of the other measures about which there is so much speculation are also instruments for the submission of our country."
"They are not debating whether or not to cut off our heads," he said of American policy makers, "but how they will do it, with a knife or with a razor."
Mr. Robaina and other Cuban leaders have generally been much more upbeat about the potential for improved ties with the United States since the two countries signed an agreement last September to end an exodus of more than 30,000 refugees from the island.
A second accord, announced on May 2, was a particular triumph for the Castro Government. For the first time since Cuban revolutionaries came to power in 1959, American officials agreed to deport Cuban refugees who try to enter the United States illegally. Some 20,000 Cubans who had been held at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Station since trying to flee the island in rafts last summer are also to be allowed to emigrate to the United States under the deal.
In announcing the pact, Cuba's chief negotiator, Ricardo Alarcon, said it was "only fair" to recognize "positive factors" in the Clinton Administration. After unflagging support for Cuban exiles going back to the end of the Eisenhower Administration, he said, President Clinton "turns things around 180 degrees."
Mr. Alarcon and other Cuban officials reiterated at the time that they would never agree to the United States' longstanding demand that Cuba open up its one-party political system in exchange for an end to the embargo.
But they praised what they described as political courage on the part of the Clinton Administration and said the accord should be understood as proof of Cuba's willingness to negotiate in good faith. They also took several modest steps toward rapprochement with their political critics.
In early June, the Cuban authorities released six political prisoners, two of them relatively well-known dissidents. Mr. Castro then made what American officials saw as one of his more significant political gestures in recent years, meeting with Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, an exile political leader who spent 22 years in Cuban jails. Mr. Castro also held a rare encounter last month with Cuban Catholic bishops at the home of the Vatican envoy in Havana.
The Communist Party's top official for hemispheric relations, Jose Antonio Arbesu, described the harder tone of recent Cuban Government remarks as "a matter of putting one's feet on the ground."
"The blockade is the essence of this problem, and there is no sign that it is going to change," Mr. Arbesu, who heads the party's Americas section, said in an interview. "It would be very difficult for the Clinton Administration to take important steps to improve things between now and the next election."
Cuban officials have been bitterly critical of efforts by conservative Republicans in Congress to tighten the embargo, and what the Cubans describe as the Clinton Administration's acquiescence in that campaign.
Legislation proposed earlier this year by Sen. Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and Rep. Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, would punish foreign companies that do business with Cuba and press for full compensation for American citizens with claims to private property seized since the revolution. State Department officials say the law could increase the value of American claims against the Castro Government from about $6 billion to as much as $100 billion.
The Clinton Administration has objected to parts of the bill, saying they would violate international law. But its alternative proposal for pressing the cause of democratic reform in Cuba -- a combination of continued economic sanctions and greater political and social contacts -- has begun to anger Cuban officials almost as much.
"They want to exercise their influence by way of wide exchanges with different sectors that they consider permeable, giving away juicy scholarships, impressing us with their millionaire institutes, their technologies, and their centers of social research," Mr. Castro said in his state-of-the-nation speech on July 26.
Referring to what American officials call the second track of their policy, he added, "Those are the ones who want to destroy us from within."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY: DIGITAL COMMERCE;
2 plans for watermarks, which can bind proof of authorship to electronic works.

BYLINE: By Denise Caruso 

 BODY:
WATERMARKS in paper stock, visible when held up to the light, have been used for centuries to thwart counterfeiters and help prove the authenticity of documents and currency. In recent years, some cable channels and networks, like Comedy Central and CNN, have been stamping their programs with a video version of the watermark.
These video watermarks, which appear in a corner of the television screen, identify the channel for browsing viewers and, cable executives hope, scare off a few video pirates. 
 So it is no surprise, as information becomes currency in the global economy, that so-called digital watermark technologies are beginning to appear. As with their paper and broadcast counterparts, the concept behind digital watermarks is to provide a secure means to certify the origin, ownership and authenticity of digital works. And by doing so, they can provide the first line of defense against piracy of digital media like music, photographs, film, words and video games.
Because making and distributing copies are tasks that computers and networks perform with ease, some people argue that it is impossible to protect digital media from counterfeiters. They say that today's intellectual property laws simply cannot be applied to digital works. On the other hand, most large media companies contend that despite the increased risk of theft, they can protect their assets with existing law and a little creative problem solving.
But even if today's copyright laws are rejected as irrelevant in a digital world, or if authors and publishers choose not to collect a dime for what they put on a disk or distribute over a network, there will still be a need to verify the authorship of digital works -- if only to give credit where it is due and to protect the creator from plagiarism.
Thus, digital watermarks are not intended to increase commerce on computer networks, or even to prevent copying. Instead, their inventors say that they simply bind proof of authorship and other identifying data so tightly to the work that attempts to erase or remove them will cause permanent damage and render any copy useless.
Two start-up software concerns -- the DICE Company in Palo Alto, Calif., and the Digimarc Corporation in Portland, Ore. -- have taken slightly different approaches to creating digital watermarking systems. Each has patents pending on its processes for inserting and locking the watermarks in a file. Each approach uses a variation of data-security technology that scatters identifying information in such a way that it cannot be reassembled without an electronic key to the code.
Digimarc, which was founded by Geoffrey Rhoads, an astrophysicist who wanted to copyright his digital photos of Jupiter, is looking for partners to build products around its many patents. DICE -- an acronym for Digital Information Commodities Exchange -- is about to release an early version of its watermarking system, called Argent, for use in the music industry.
Cane Records, an independent music label run by University of Miami students, is using Argent technology to embed watermarks in the master recordings of its latest compact disk, a compilation of South Florida bands that is scheduled for release at the end of August.
The idea, according to DICE's vice president of technology, Marc Cooperman, was to demonstrate that the technology is compatible with existing audio equipment and that it is possible to embed a digital watermark without affecting sound quality. Dan Warren, the audio engineer who mastered the Cane recording, indeed states emphatically there was "no degradation whatsoever" in sound quality after embedding the mark.
This particular watermark, scattered as data in a random pattern invisible to the CD playback unit, included the date the disk was manufactured, its universal product code, the artist, title, producer and engineer for each track, the copyright year and copyright authority (Cane Records, in this case) and how many CD's were pressed.
By itself, this information may have little use. But as a test, the Cane disk reveals how watermarks may make it possible for publishers to sell media on computer networks without ceding the battle to pirates.
In an on-line purchase, Mr. Cooperman said, a watermark could easily include the purchaser's name, authenticated at the time of purchase along with an identifying customer account number. Consumers as well as counterfeiters are likely to be more careful about copying what they buy if they know illegal copies can be traced to them.
So far, it is not possible with either the DICE or the Digimarc systems for a consumer to read the watermark on a piece of digital media.
Only the publisher or owner of the copyright holds the electronic key that makes the watermark readable. That may be useful to the copyright holder, but it does not help the person who wants to know if it is permissible to copy a particular work -- or from whom to receive or purchase such permission.
Digimarc's founder, Mr. Rhoads, said he was working on a method that would allow the embedded watermark, which people cannot read or alter, to co-exist with a public watermark that people can read.
Whether or not Digimarc or DICE develop their experimental technologies in large-scale systems for digital commerce, big media companies are already exploring the potential benefits of the digital watermark concept.
Ed Horowitz, chairman of the interactive media unit of Viacom Inc., said he was intrigued by the potential.
Whether starving artist or media conglomerate, he said, "Our challenge as publishers is to decide whether the things we value, our pearls, are things we want to get paid for, or whether they are pearls we want everyone to have."
And the first obvious step is to establish who, in fact, owns those pearls. Though the technology for digital watermarks is still in early development, it may prove to be the cornerstone upon which an information economy is built.

HEADLINE: Plan Links Child Support To Licenses

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 6

 BODY:
New York State will begin suspending the driver's licenses of parents who fall more than four months behind in their child-support payments, Gov. George E. Pataki said today.
The new policy, similar to ones tried in a small but growing number of states, is designed to put some sting into an arsenal of child-support collection programs that have proved to be largely ineffective. State officials also hope that it will reduce welfare costs by pulling some families out of poverty. 
 Courts have ordered child-support payments in 380,000 cases in New York State. In 350,000 of those cases, or 92 percent, parents are behind in payments. Together, they owe more than $1 billion, an amount that is expected to grow by $321 million in the next year, state officials estimate. In 170,000 cases, or almost half, no payments have ever been made.
"This is a staggering figure, and it cannot be permitted to continue," Mr. Pataki said in a statement today. "My message to deadbeat parents is simple: If you fail to make your child-support payments, you risk losing your driver's license."
New York is sharing in a national frustration over collecting child-support payments. Nationwide estimates say those payments are made less than 20 percent of the time.
Suspending driver's and professional licenses has emerged as the new weapon of choice in that fight. Maine, Massachusetts and California have initiated programs similar to New York's, and all have reported some level of success, New York officials say.
President Clinton has also advocated the idea as part of his national welfare agenda.
Dan Hogan, a spokesman for the state Department of Social Services, said that the mere threat of license suspension had helped increase collection rates in other states. He said Maine had collected $26 million from 13,023 chronic nonpayers since it began threatening license suspensions in August 1993. In that period, only 100 licenses were actually suspended.
"From the Maine experience, you can see most people realize it's a serious threat," Mr. Hogan said. "We're saying, 'Here's your chance to get in and clean things up because we're coming after you if you don't.' "
Under the new policy, which was approved by the Legislature in June as part of the state budget, the state will begin mailing notices Monday to 190,000 parents to warn them about the new policy. About 380,000 notices will be mailed in September, with half of those going to the same people who will receive letters this month.
In October, the Department of Motor Vehicles will begin requiring that applications for new licenses or renewals include Social Security numbers, which will help in tracking people who owe child support.
The Department of Social Services will then begin randomly comparing D.M.V. records against lists of parents who owe child support and suspending licenses when matches are made.
By next summer, the state expects to have in place a computer system that will allow D.M.V. clerks to find out immediately when someone applies for a new license or a renewal if the person is more than four months behind in child support. If the answer is yes, that application will be denied on the spot. If the person has a license, it will be suspended.
Under the policy, a parent's license would remain suspended until that person either paid the arrears or agreed to a payment schedule. Mr. Hogan said the new policy was expected to increase child-support payments by $30 million in the coming year.
Mr. Hogan said California, which has issued warnings to 22,889 drivers, had seen its child-support collections increase by $10 million. Massachusetts sent 60,000 warning notices last year and has collected $600,000 as a result, he said.
The new policy will also allow the state to suspend the professional licenses of people who are behind in their child-support payments. However, Mr. Hogan said, the state is still developing a program to track down those people.
Until now, the state's strongest tool for enforcing child-support payments has been to deduct money from a delinquent parent's paychecks. But that policy has been somewhat ineffective, Mr. Hogan said, because people change jobs frequently and employers have often been slow to forward information to the state.
The state also has the power to intercept tax refunds and unemployment insurance benefits and to seize bank accounts to enforce child-support payments. But Mr. Hogan said that suspending driver's licenses was expected to be more efficient and effective because it is simpler and involves fewer legal machinations.
Child support has become an integral part of the welfare debate here and in other state capitals because so many single parents wind up on the public dole. In New York State, half the families receiving court-ordered child-support payments are also receiving public assistance. Ninety percent of the time, those families are headed by women.
Some welfare experts have questioned whether cracking down on "deadbeat dads" will significantly help poor families because the absent fathers are often poor themselves and capable of only minimal payments to their children.
But Russell Sykes, deputy director of the State Communities Aid Association, which lobbies on behalf of poor people in Albany, said national studies had shown that many fathers who fall behind in their child-support payments are not poor but are simply unwilling to pay.
"Unlike the popular perception, many who aren't paying can pay," Mr. Sykes said. "That's why we are very supportive of Pataki's efforts to force payments."
Mr. Sykes said the Pataki administration should take even stronger measures to enforce child-support payments, including speeding up the process of establishing paternity. He also recommended that the state transfer the responsibility for tracking delinquent payers from the Department of Social Services to the Department of Taxation and Finance, where enforcement would probably be more rigorous, he said.

HEADLINE: In TV Deregulation, Qualms About Losing Local Control

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
G. V. Montgomery is worried that the Walt Disney Company could bring sex and violence to the South. Mr. Montgomery is a Democratic Representative from Mississippi, and during a House debate on the communications bill last week, he cited Disney as a reason not to lift Government restrictions on the ownership of media properties.
In Mr. Montgomery's home district, the local ABC affiliates routinely pre-empt programming, like the racy "N.Y.P.D. Blue," that might offend their viewers. Now that Disney is acquiring ABC, Mr. Montgomery fears that the company could snap up ABC stations like WLOV in Columbus, Miss., which is owned by an independent businessman. 
 If Disney owned the Mississippi affiliates, he said, it would be far less likely to block out ABC's programs in deference to local standards, because the network is seeking the largest national audience for its programming and advertising.
The perceived threat to localism is a key argument of those who oppose the growing concentration of media ownership. And it proved potent enough that 60 Republicans joined 168 Democrats on Friday in voting to retain stricter limits on that ownership, tempering a bill that clears away regulations in every other corner of the communications industry.
Curbing the power of giant media conglomerates has long been a popular issue among politicians. But last week's billion-dollar deals, in which Disney agreed to acquire Capital Cities/ABC Inc. and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation agreed to buy CBS Inc., galvanized lawmakers who previously regarded the debate over communications legislation as mostly an arcane battle between local and long-distance phone companies.
"This has catapulted media concentration to the front page," said Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who sponsored the amendment on media-property ownership. "The average consumer is far more concerned about this than whether they are going to have three new long-distance companies."
Many critics contend that it is not in big metropolitan markets where media consolidation and the deregulation of the telephone and cable monopolies pose the biggest threat. According to this argument, robust competition in such markets would give big media companies the incentive to keep consumers by giving them what they want. It is in smaller towns and rural areas, over which big companies might not care to fight, that a narrowing of voices could hit consumers the hardest.
Despite his victory on the amendment, Mr. Markey still voted against the bill because he said it would allow other types of media concentration that he considered dangerous. Specifically, he said, the bill would still let one company own multiple media properties -- like newspapers and television stations -- in a single market. Mr. Markey said this would quash alternative voices.
Indeed, Mr. Markey's amendment was narrowly focused on television ownership: No company can own stations that reach more than 35 percent of the television households in the nation. The original bill would have raised that limit to 50 percent, from the current 25 percent. The amendment also prohibits one company from owning a TV station and a cable system in the same market -- an existing restriction that the original House bill would have removed.
The Senate's communications bill, passed in June, would also lift the cap on station ownership from 25 percent to 35 percent, but unlike the House bill would retain a series of restrictions on cross-ownership of media properties. The House and the Senate must reconcile the two bills in a conference committee this fall.
The House bill would allow a variety of new combinations: Newspaper publishers could own a TV station or a cable system in the same city. Broadcasters could own an unlimited number of radio stations nationally, and multiple stations in one city. A company could even own two TV stations in one city, provided that one of the stations uses a lower-power UHF signal.
It was only coincidental that the Disney and Westinghouse deals occurred in the same week as the House vote on the bill, but they might have been difficult to conclude without the changes provided for in the legislation. By buying CBS, for example, Westinghouse will own 39 radio stations across the country, including the two all-news stations in New York City, WCBS and WINS. In addition, Westinghouse will own 14 television stations, covering roughly 33 percent of the nation's households.
If the original version of the House bill had passed, Westinghouse could have bought even more stations -- which some analysts said was one of its primary goals in buying CBS.
By buying Capital Cities/ABC, Disney would own two television stations in Los Angeles, KABC and KCAL. Both are higher-powered VHF stations, so Disney's chairman, Michael D. Eisner, has said he may sell KCAL. But under the bill, Mr. Eisner could seek a waiver from the Federal Communications Commission to hold onto both of them.
Moreover, the Senate and House bills are both silent on the issue of vertical integration, which occurs when programming companies own one or more distribution channels. Disney-ABC, Time Warner Inc. and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation are the most notable examples of such integration. Time Warner owns both the Warner Brothers studio and many cable television systems, while the News Corporation owns both the 20th Century-Fox studio and the Fox television network.
Thomas J. Tauke, the chief lobbyist for the Nynex Corporation, the regional Bell company, said lawmakers focused briefly on the dangers of vertical integration after the Bell Atlantic Corporation, another regional Bell, announced a plan to merge with the cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. in 1993. But after that deal foundered, such concerns died on Capitol Hill, said Mr. Tauke, a former Republican Congressman.
He also said the emergence of new distribution channels, like the Internet, had allayed fears that a few giant companies would gain a stranglehold over the dissemination of information.
But consumer advocates and other critics of the legislation said the danger of such a stranglehold had not diminished. The Internet is still a niche medium, where the audience for an information service at any one time can be measured by the tens of thousands at most -- as opposed to a mass medium like the ABC network, which attracts viewers by the tens of millions.
Disney, moreover, will also have access to telephone wires through its programming venture with three regional Bells: the Ameritech Corporation, SBC Communications Inc., and the BellSouth Corporation.
"Yes, you'll have access to the Internet," said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Media Education, a research group in Washington. "But if your modem is connected to the BellSouth network, the first thing you're going to see when you click on is Mickey Mouse."
Media executives contend that they have little choice but to consolidate. Entertainment has become a global business dominated by companies with the resources to produce and distribute a vast amount of programming, or "content."
Martin D. Franks, the senior vice president and chief lobbyist of CBS, said his network needed to grow to compete with its rivals. Fox, for example, stripped eight affiliates from CBS last year, in part because Mr. Murdoch could invest $500 million in the stations' parent, New World Communications.
Yesterday on the ABC news program "This Week With David Brinkley," Barry Diller, the former chairman of QVC Inc. who at one time last year was poised to become the new head of CBS, said vertical integration "will continue while there's money to fuel it."
"Once the money stops, once we get a big advertising recession," he added, "you'll see things get thrown over the side for survival."
 As for the issue of station ownership, executives of Capital Cities/ ABC noted that most television stations were already owned by station groups. In Mr. Montgomery's Congressional district in Mississippi, for example, the affiliate in Meridian is owned by Richard Benedek, a New York businessman who owns three other ABC affiliates around the country.
Patricia Matson, a spokeswoman for ABC, said outside owners could serve local needs better by having the resources to invest in large local news operations. And often, when local stations pre-empt network offerings like "N.Y.P.D. Blue," the replacement fare is cartoons or network reruns -- not programs tailored to local tastes.
Even critics of media concentration acknowledge that it is hard to gather solid data about its effect on what Americans watch, read or listen to. But, the critics say, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that television and radio programming has become more uniform and less adventurous as those businesses have consolidated into giant conglomerates.
"As you get bigger and bigger, you have to have more predictable programming," said Ben H. Bagdikian, the former dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California at Berkeley. "There is simply too much risk in innovation."
Mr. Bagdikian also said large media companies did not pay as much attention to local issues because such programming was not as profitable as mass-market fare. He noted that large radio station groups had replaced local disk jockeys across the country with nationally syndicated celebrities like Rush Limbaugh and Howard Stern.
The House voted solidly last week that the nation needs a deregulated communications industry to compete globally in the 21st century. But the prospect of distant overlords ignoring the tastes of local communities touches an old-fashioned political chord familiar to many lawmakers.
It goes to show that as in politics, all media is local.

HEADLINE: Burden of Transit-Fare Rise Will Not Be Borne Equally

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
As one who lives in the no man's land of two-fare zones, Arnold C. Lewis of Springfield Gardens, Queens, will be one of those hit hardest if the price of a token climbs to $1.50. But he considers himself lucky.
"It will be hard for me, but I'll live," said Mr. Lewis, 49, who counsels inmates at a work-release center in Harlem. "However, someone who works for minimum wage, what is that person supposed to do? Some of them live in two-fare zones, too, and it's already $5 a day just to get to and from work." 
 Commuters like Mr. Lewis have to scour their pockets and purses twice on the trip to work, first for a bus and then for a subway. And last Thursday, they and millions of others across the metropolitan area learned that they might have to dig a little deeper.
To cope with rising costs and falling government subsidies, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, E. Virgil Conway, proposed increases in bridge and tunnel tolls and subway, bus and commuter railroad fares. He also said that the M.T.A. would stop issuing free or half-fare transit passes for 500,000 students.
Under Mr. Conway's plan, riders would bear a larger share of the costs for all of the region's public transportation, but the added expense would not fall equally on different groups of commuters, and some people would actually pay substantially less.
But in recent interviews, one thing united several users of public transportation: an angry sense that they were being asked to shoulder an unfair burden, and a weary belief that this was about what could be expected from government.
The largest proportional increase, 20 percent, would be borne by straphangers like Julio Vega, a maintenance worker from Brooklyn, who would have to pay $1.50 instead of $1.25 for a subway token.
The transit fare increase would fall hardest on the estimated 350,000 two-fare zone commuters, many of whom live in eastern Queens and southeastern Brooklyn. But Mr. Conway pledged to eliminate the zones in 1997, letting residents of those areas transfer between subways and buses free.
Under Mr. Conway's plan, riders on the Metro-North Commuter Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road would pay 9 percent more, a smaller proportional increase than subway and bus riders. But many suburban residents, like Stephen Marro, a self-employed film maker from Long Beach, L.I., take both the train and the subway to work, so they would be hit twice each way by the increases.
The tolls on major bridges and tunnels between boroughs would rise 17 percent, from $6 for a round trip to $7. But the discount toll paid by Staten Island residents like Peter Trombetta, a general contractor, who take the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to Brooklyn, would fall to $3.20 from $4.
For Mr. Vega, the F train, which he catches at Avenue I, is a lifeline, the only link between his home in Borough Park and his $25,000-a-year job in housing maintenance at New York University. The price of subway trip is already hard on his family, he said, but "we have no other choice, we really don't."
He and his wife, a nurse, struggle to support themselves, their two unemployed children and three grandchildren. "We don't do a lot," he said. "Everything is just based on paying the rent and the bills."
One of his most difficult tasks, he said, is to find $5 each day to give his son and daughter so that they can take the subway to look for work. "It's a little bit unfair to those who really can't afford it," he said.
His own commuting now costs $12.50 a week and promises to rise to $15. He estimated that all told, he, his wife and his children spend $75 a week on subway tokens, a figure that would climb to $90 with the fare increase.
For two-fare commuters like Mr. Lewis and his friend, Valeria Roberts, 43, the fare increase would mean another $1 a day, $5 a week and $250 a year just to get to and from work. Both take the Q111 bus on Guy R. Brewer Boulevard to the E train at Jamaica Center for the long ride to Manhattan. Ms. Roberts gets out at 34th Street, while Mr. Lewis transfers at Times Square to the 2 or 3 train.
Mr. Lewis, who is single and whose children are grown, acknowledges that, with a $40,000-a-year income from his job at the Lincoln Correctional Facility in Harlem, he will be able to absorb the added cost.
For Ms. Roberts, a single mother who lives in Jamaica, Queens, and whose son attends the University of Maryland, the stretch will be harder. She earns $29,000 a year working at the Matching Gift Center, a firm that administers charitable giving programs for large companies. She still remembers her shock at discovering two-fare zones when she moved to New York four years ago, after living in Chicago and Washington, where riders can transfer from trains to buses for a quarter.
Many New Yorkers have no choice but to use the subway, but not so Mr. Marro, the film maker, who is self-employed and describes his financial situation as "comfortable." Most days, he takes the 8:37 out of Long Beach and tries to get some work done aboard the train with his Apple Power Book balanced on his knees.
But with a fare increase, "I'd rather stay home," said Mr. Marro, 36, who is married but has no children.
The weekly ticket from Long Beach to Pennsylvania Station that he often buys now sells for $44, and would cost $4 more with the fare increase. If he traveled to Manhattan four times in a week, the amount he would spend on subway tokens to and from his Gramercy Park office would rise to $12 from $10.
Mr. Trombetta, 28, the Staten Island contractor, drives every workday over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to jobs in Brooklyn, so he stands to benefit from the lower toll for island residents -- but only if he drives his car. The discount will be available only to residents who have electronically read stickers in their car windows, and the stickers are not available for trucks.
"For my car, absolutely I would get the pass to get the savings, but a lot of days I drive the truck to work," he said. "I guess I would try to drive it as little as possible."
Mr. Trombetta, who would not give his income but described himself as middle class, said he was skeptical that the savings would last long or that the new system would work smoothly.
"Probably a year, a year and a half from now, they'll claim that they're losing millions of dollars a year on it and they have to raise it again. It doesn't end."

HEADLINE: Animal Advocates Protest Plans for a Primate Lab

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: TUXEDO, N.Y., Aug. 3

 BODY:
For the 225 chimpanzees at the New York University Medical Center's primate laboratory here, the routine varies from fun and games to medical tests that could mean the difference between life and death for members of another primate species, human beings.
On this morning, while five diaper-clad baby chimps tumbled or napped amid a collection of stuffed toys and a pair of 3-year-olds watched "The Wizard of Oz" on television, in other buildings dozens of adult chimpanzees infected with the AIDS virus or hepatitis were taking part in vaccine studies. 
 For 28 years, the chimpanzee and monkey colonies at the Laboratory for Experimental Medicine and Surgery in Primates, or Lemsip, have played an internationally recognized role in research, in areas ranging from AIDS to alcoholism to organ transplantation.
And, while many laboratories housing primates have been harshly criticized by animal-rights advocates, Lemsip has been credited for its open-door policy and relatively humane conditions.
Now, though, animal-welfare advocates and conservationists, led by Dr. Jane Goodall, a pioneer in the study of chimpanzee behavior, have joined with the laboratory's staff in protesting plans to transfer ownership of the laboratory to the New Mexico-based Coulston Foundation, which has a history of violations of Federal animal-welfare regulations.
As recently as last month, the Department of Agriculture accused the foundation of keeping several dozen chimpanzees in undersize cages and causing the avoidable deaths of at least five chimpanzees. Three of them died in October 1993 when a space heater malfunctioned and pushed temperatures in a holding room to 140 degrees.
In addition, the foundation's leader, Dr. Frederick Coulston, has long been a target of animal-welfare advocates because he favors the use of chimpanzees, the closest living relative of humans and an endangered species in their home range in Africa, in toxicity tests of drugs and industrial chemicals.
Should the Coulston Foundation acquire Lemsip's 225 chimpanzees, it would control more than half the 1,500 chimpanzees currently being used for medical research in the United States, said Suzanne Roy, program director for In Defense of Animals, a California-based advocacy group. "If the Coulston Foundation can't even insure that its own facilities are in compliance with the law," she said, "how can they take over another facility?"
Unfazed by his critics, Dr. Coulston, an 81-year-old zoologist who has used monkeys and apes in laboratory tests since 1936, defended his record and plans. He denied reports that most of the 540 chimps in his care were locked in small individual cages. "We keep most of them in family groups," he said. "Just like in the jungle, only better, because they've got food to eat without having to forage."
He said the heater malfunction had occurred two months after his organization took over a laboratory from New Mexico State University. "Now we're fixing the place up," Dr. Coulston said. "By Sept. 15 there will not be a single violation of any kind."
The Coulston Foundation in Alamogordo, N.M., owns about 400 chimpanzees and has sought to acquire 140 that it leases from the United States Air Force. In May, Dr. Goodall led a separate effort, so far successful, to prevent the military from giving Dr. Coulston the Air Force chimpanzees, which are descendants of animals used in the early days of the American space program.
Dr. Coulston said the Air Force was eager to give away the animals, which have no military use anymore and are extremely costly to maintain. "I've been working with the Air Force since 1963," he said. "This is not over yet."
In an Aug. 1 letter to the New York University Board of Trustees, Dr. Goodall said, "I request that you require the Coulston Foundation to completely solve, to the satisfaction of Federal authorities, all violations at its New Mexico facilities before giving T.C.F. any role in the ownership or management of the Lemsip labs."
Donald Buford, the chief executive officer of the Connecticut-based Jane Goodall Institute, a nonprofit group financing the rescue and relocation of chimpanzees in Africa, said: "All we're saying is put the brakes on. We're talking about the fate of over half of all the research chimps in the United States. There may be a better, longer-term solution than might be on the table at this time."
Lemsip's director, Dr. Jan Moor-Jankowski, said he was concerned not only with the fate of the chimpanzees but also with the future of a $705,000 endowment that is supposed to be used to care for animals once they have outlived their usefulness as research subjects. Dr. Moor-Jankowski expressed concern that the Coulston Foundation might find a different use for the money.
During a tour of Lemsip, Dr. Moor-Jankowski, 71, said he felt that New York University's decision to get rid of the laboratory was retribution of a sort. As members of a university committee reviewing animal experiments, he and Dr. C. James Mahoney, Lemsip's deputy director, had criticized other primate experiments run at a separate N.Y.U. lab.
Both men resigned from the committee when the experiments, which involved administering crack cocaine to monkeys, were allowed to continue. "For 28 years," Dr. Moor-Jankowski said, "Lemsip fit perfectly with N.Y.U.'s research program. Now suddenly it doesn't. This is what I get for speaking out."
University officials vehemently denied that the decision to seek a new owner for Lemsip had anything to do with that incident. Dr. David Scotch, an associate dean of the university's medical school, called the decision economic. "It doesn't take much to realize," he said, "that given what the health-care situation is like in New York, the Medical Center has to concentrate on what it does best."
Dr. Mahoney said he was puzzled by N.Y.U.'s determination that the laboratory no longer matched the medical school's research agenda. As he sat in a rocking chair in the nursery, cradling Cory, a 4-month-old chimpanzee, he said, "What could be more current and applicable to human needs than research on AIDS and hepatitis?"
Officials at New York University said the laboratory would require millions of dollars in renovations to meet increasingly stringent Federal standards. Despite the praise it has received for its relatively humane approach to its primate colonies, Lemsip is old and has been cited for overcrowding of animals.
But Dr. Moor-Jankowski contended that he had raised extra money to build a retirement home of sorts for older chimpanzees, which would rectify the space problem. He added that the university's depiction of Lemsip as a money loser was false.
"The laboratory has always been self-supporting," said Dr. Moor-Jankowski, explaining that its $4 million annual budget is covered by drug companies or other research institutions that have contracts for particular projects.
The Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, a laboratory in Manhattan affiliated with New York University, had also proposed taking over Lemsip, said Dr. David D. Ho, the center's director."But N.Y.U. has already gone very far with Coulston," he added. "It's virtually a done deal."
Hoping to prevent the transfer of the laboratory to the Coulston Foundation, Dr. Moor-Jankowski, Dr. Mahoney and Dr. Preston Marx, who directs the AIDS projects financed through the Aaron Diamond Center, have proposed a "friendly takeover" in which they would raise enough capital from corporations and donors to buy the laboratory.
For now, however, the Coulston Foundation appears to be the leading contender. Dr. Scotch of the medical school said no final decision had yet been made, but he added: "I believe the Coulston Foundation will rectify the violations that they have been cited on. I think that the Coulston Foundation is a perfectly suitable candidate."

An ambitious survey by Conde Nast Traveler zeros in on the wallets of readers.

BYLINE: By Deirdre Carmody 

 BODY:
Richard D. Beckman, publisher of Conde Nast Traveler, is releasing today one of the largest studies ever done by a single magazine on the buying habits and tastes of its readership.
The magazine industry has long been dependent on what is known as syndicated research, which provides vast amounts of information based on interviews with thousands of readers of magazines and helps advertisers make decisions about where to place ads. 
 What has been nagging at Mr. Beckman is that only a very small number of Conde Nast Traveler readers are included in syndicated research. Of the 20,083 respondents whose questionnaires were tabulated recently by Mediamark Research Inc., for instance, only 315 said they were readers of Conde Nast Traveler.
Because the magazine has a circulation of 900,000, Mr. Beckman thought information about 315 people was inadequate to try to project the tastes and buying habits of all the magazine's readers. So he decided to conduct his own survey.
Conde Nast Traveler, which is owned by Advance Publications, sent a 12-page questionnaire to 400,000 subscribers in its April issue. Within four weeks, readers returned 75,000 questionnaires, of which 50,564 were eventually used in the survey.
The results will provide advertisers with unusually detailed information about the magazine's readers. More than 14,000 respondents, for instance, explained what they had purchased and why from a long list of men's and women's apparel designers, where they shopped and how they rated stores, how many airplane trips they took for business and how many for pleasure, and so on.
For advertisers, of course, this kind of information is pure gold. Several, however, said it could not take the place of syndicated research.
"In principle, we will certainly look at it, and we applaud anybody's initiative to try and shed greater research light on solving our clients' problems," said Mark Stewart, senior vice president-media director at McCann-Erickson, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. "But remember, no publisher has ever related primary data without showing their publication in a favorable light."
Alan Jurmain, executive director of media services at Lowe & Partners/SMS in New York, a unit of The Lowe Group, said that there was a general lack of information about affluent consumers and that he thought many media directors at advertising agencies would find the Conde Nast Traveler study useful.
"We don't believe in a single magic box, but usually we have to make lots of inferences from limited resources," he said. "The more fresh data we have from sizable samples just makes us smarter and our insights sharper."
Mr. Beckman said he spent 25 percent more on his survey than it cost him to participate in syndicated research conducted by the Simmons Market Research Bureau. Although Mr. Beckman declined to give specific figures, sources at the magazine said it spends about $90,000 for each syndicated research study.
Mr. Beckman has dropped Simmons but still participates in syndicated research conducted by Monroe Mendelsohn Research and Mediamark. And Mediamark's custom division tabulated the new Conde Nast Traveler study.
"I think syndicated research was never meant to be particularly effective in evaluating upscale magazines," Mr. Beckman said. "The onset of this research was in the 'Father Knows Best' days, to show that mass magazines could compete with television."
Wealthy, well-educated readers like those who subscribe to Conde Nast Traveler make up only a small percentage of the total number who show up in the overall syndicated research. Of 22,051 respondents to the latest Simmons study, only 622 said they read the magazine. And out of 11,704 tabulated by Monroe Mendelsohn Research, only 890 said they read Conde Nast Traveler.
Mr. Beckman said he was also troubled by the fact that syndicated research includes information about total audience -- in other words, including anyone who reads someone else's copy of a magazine or who picks it up in the doctor's office -- and does not give more weight to the people who actually buy a magazine.
The Simmons study estimates the total readership of Conde Nast Traveler to be 2.5 million people.
"If syndicated research focused more on the primary subscriber, I think you would have a tremendous improvement in value," Mr. Beckman said.
Conde Nast Traveler, which was started in 1987, has become one of the most successful travel publications, having weathered the recession and come out intact.
And its "truth in travel" editorial stance has frightened away only a few advertisers. Last year, the magazine reported that Delta Air Lines Inc. led the list of airlines that were fined by the Federal Aviation Administration for maintenance violations. Delta immediately yanked the remaining $95,000 of its ad budget for 1994. The airline did not say the move was in retribution for the article but called it a needed trimming of its ad budget.
Rebecca McPheters, president and chief executive of Simmons, praised the Conde Nast Traveler study and said the magazine had gotten a wealth of information from a large base of its readers.
"I applaud what they have done, but it's not a substitute for syndicated research," she said. "The principal value of a syndicated study is that it allows for fair comparisons within the media."
And, she added, "I haven't given up on getting Conde Nast Traveler back in the fall."

HEADLINE: China: Kind Words, Little Effect

 BODY:
For weeks, the Clinton Administration choreographed a fence-mending meeting between Secretary of State Warren Christopher and China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen. When the two met last Tuesday in Brunei the rhetoric was diplomatically polite and the spin resolutely upbeat. Unhappily, any optimism they may have generated about the relationship was doused when Beijing expelled two American military officers for alleged spying.
The Pentagon says the two men were engaged in legal surveillance. Mr. Christopher complains that their ill-timed snooping needlessly compromised his mission. Nice try. The string of incidents that have repeatedly tripped up relations between the United States and China this year cannot all be dismissed as bureaucratic accidents. 
 Washington set off a predictable furor in Beijing when it correctly granted a visa to Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui. China responded with intentionally provocative missile tests near Taiwan. It deliberately roiled Washington by detaining an American citizen, Harry Wu, charging him with the capital crime of espionage and restricting his access to consular officials.
Two Administrations have struggled for six years to try to restore the smooth course of United States-China relations that prevailed before the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. But despite the countries' mutual interest in diplomatic cooperation and economic exchange, the fundamentals of the relationship have changed in ways that make a return to easy harmony unlikely.
The most explosive issues are human rights and Taiwan. To restore harmony, both countries will have to find a satisfactory way to reconcile America's belief in democracy and human rights with the authoritarian cruelty of Chinese Communism, which 16 years of economic reform have not significantly softened. They will also have to find a way to exclude the threat of military force from China's relations with Taiwan.
Washington cannot impose its own idea of capitalist democracy on China. But neither can it turn its back on Chinese citizens who peacefully struggle for internationally recognized human rights. Tensions over the succession to Deng Xiaoping make this a period of particularly harsh and arbitrary repression.
As for Taiwan, Washington has long accepted Beijing's view that it is part of China, a view that Taipei officially shares. But reality is more complicated. Taiwan is becoming an affluent democracy while China, even with its huge economic gains, remains a largely impoverished dictatorship. As Taiwan grows more democratic, its political leaders have had to bow to public desires for a more distinctive international presence.
That puts America in an awkward predicament. It cannot and should not disavow democratic Taiwan, which currently buys twice as much from the United States as China does. But neither should Washington provoke China by embroiling itself in the Taiwan independence issue.
Washington is struggling to walk a narrow path on the democracy and Taiwan issues, at once principled and pragmatic. Beijing has concluded that what Washington is really trying to do is undermine the Communist regime. Nothing could be further from the truth, but Beijing, feeling threatened, has resorted to belligerent diplomacy, heightened repression and military muscle-flexing.
In this atmosphere, Mr. Christopher's soothing words cannot have much lasting effect. Clashes over human rights, and now Taiwan, occur with increasing frequency and rancor. All the more reason, then, for the Clinton Administration to resist China's demands for concessions it cannot make without antagonizing public opinion and touching off a Congressional revolt. That means insisting on Washington's right to grant visas to Taiwan's leaders and refusing to invite China's President to Washington while Harry Wu remains in jail.

The Race for an Even Bigger Bomb

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:

DARK SUN
 The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb
 By Richard Rhodes
 Illustrated. 731 pages. Simon & Schuster. $32.50.
In the closing pages of his prize-winning history "The Making of the Atomic Bomb" (1986), Richard Rhodes wrote that immediately after the successful testing of the A-bomb, Edward Teller and Enrico Fermi "renewed theoretical work on the problem of thermonuclear ignition," the explosive force of which was expected to be 10 megatons, or 1,000 times the yield of the Hiroshima bomb. 
 A reader might anticipate, then, that in his sequel, "Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb," Mr. Rhodes would begin his narrative in 1945 or thereabouts, and trace the events that culminated at 7:15 A.M. on Nov. 1, 1952, with the successful testing at Enewetak atoll of the thermonuclear device known as Mike.
But no. In his new book, Mr. Rhodes goes back to January 1939, nine months before the outbreak of World War II, when "a letter from Paris alerted physicists in the Soviet Union to the startling news that German radiochemists had discovered a fundamental new nuclear reaction." He then traces the events leading to the Soviet testing of a nuclear-fission bomb at Semipalatinsk on Aug. 29, 1949. ("Did it look like the American one?" shouted Lavrenti Beria, the director of the project, to one of his subordinates who had witnessed a United States test at Bikini atoll in the Marshall Islands.)
Not until page 455 does Mr. Rhodes take up the dramatic technical details involved in the design of Mike, which he finally describes in these words: "Steel, lead, waxy polyethylene, purple-black uranium, gold leaf, copper, stainless steel, plutonium, a breath of tritium, silvery deuterium effervescent as sea-wake: Mike was a temple, tragically Solomonic, evoking the powers that fire the sun."
Why does Mr. Rhodes take this seemingly roundabout approach, which is not even hinted at in his title? Because in his view the story of the hydrogen bomb is only secondarily a technological one. What mainly drove American physicists to design the more powerful bomb was the news that the Soviet Union possessed an atom bomb. And the reason the Russians had achieved the bomb was mainly spying, Mr. Rhodes insists. So his story of the H-bomb is not so much technology as the interaction of politics, diplomacy, war, espionage, theoretical and practical physics and paranoia.
Mutual distrust seems to have been the key to the story, or so it appears from the author's two-sided view of the arms race between the two cold-war antagonists. By matching up newly published Russian espionage information with the records of the F.B.I. and the confessions of Klaus Fuchs, Harry Gold, David and Ruth Greenglass and Alan Nunn May, Mr. Rhodes makes a persuasive case that Julius Rosenberg was guilty of espionage (Ethel's culpability remains elusive), and that the Soviet nuclear program benefited hugely from the country's extensive network of spies.
Espionage supplied the Russians with critical details of concepts, materials and design. Of Mr. Greenglass's crude sketches, Mr. Rhodes writes, "It was a long way from imploding cylinders to three-dimensional lensed implosion systems, but in fact the two-dimensional experiments proved crucial to the design of the small device at the center of the implosion system -- the initiator -- that produced a burst of neutrons at the right time to start the chain reaction."
After all, as Mr. Rhodes makes clear, the Russian physicists were far from unsophisticated. In fact, what he says held them back was Beria's insistence that they shun pure physics and model their project after what espionage supplied. As a result, writes Mr. Rhodes, the first Soviet atom bomb was a copy of the bomb dropped on Nagasaki, and the first Soviet nuclear reactor was almost exactly the same as a classified American reactor. Still, despite Beria's strictures, Andrei Sakharov managed to come up with the right design for a hydrogen bomb even before American physicists did.
What held the Americans back from developing a hydrogen bomb, in Mr. Rhodes's view, was a relaxation of vigilance brought on by the end of World War II and an attempt by the nuclear establishment to place all discoveries under international control. Then, when Teller undertook to develop what he named the Super, he impeded the program by setting his sights on megaton yields, which "blinded him to the promise of incremental achievement that Andrei Sakharov immediately recognized."
But paranoia eventually defined the conduct of both sides, in Mr. Rhodes's view. Stalin, fearing American intentions, lowered his iron curtain on Eastern Europe and demanded that his scientists give him the bomb. President Truman, in response, unleashed Gen. Curtis LeMay and his Strategic Air Command, and decided on purely political grounds to press ahead with the development of the hydrogen bomb.
J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atom bomb, raised moral objections to building the bigger bomb. For his trouble, Mr. Rhodes says, he was expelled from the nuclear establishment by having his security clearance removed. To this event Mr. Rhodes devotes an entire chapter, his own arresting version of Rolf Hochhuth's famous documentary drama "In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer."
But if Mr. Rhodes is critical of the way both the United States and the Soviet Union abandoned morality in the rush to embrace their doomsday weapons and of their near use of them in the Cuban missile crisis, he is restrained in his final judgment of the nuclear arms race. Was it really necessary to put the United States $4 trillion in debt and to trigger the collapse of the Soviet Union's economy? he asks.
"From a longer perspective, the arms race was a process of communication and of learning," he concludes, "paced as all progress is paced by the limitations of human intellect. The discovery in 1938 of how to release nuclear energy introduced a singularity into the human world -- a deep new reality, a region where the old rules of war no longer applied. The region of nuclear singularity enlarged across the decades, sweeping war away at its shock front until today it excludes all but civil wars and limited conventional wars."
In short, so far, so good, with huge question marks looming on the horizon. But if the history of nuclear energy is still very far from complete, Mr. Rhodes has made a powerful drama of the messy events that have occurred up to now.

HEADLINE: MUSIC REVIEW;
Brightness And Light, Earnestly

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND 

 BODY:
German music's incorporation of French and Italian cultures is borrowed sunlight. The juxtaposition of Bach and Telemann with Albinoni and Vivaldi said as much at Thursday's Mostly Mozart concert. The players were the members of Tafelmusik, the period-instrument orchestra from Canada; the place was Avery Fisher Hall.
Here was Bach, the admiring student and transcriber of Vivaldi's scores, transforming Italian models into something dark and serious. The Violin Concerto (BWV 1041) is in A minor, a key the composer reserves for heavy pondering under overcast skies. Telemann's suite, "Musique de Table, III" offers a clever gloss on French dance styles of the late Baroque. The virtuoso writing has its own wit, albeit a wit more subdued and self-conscious than the originals on which it is based. This is a paradox of the German mind, which yearns for the Gallic and the Latinate while clinging to its own consuming earnestness. 
 If Goethe's famous Italian journey was, as he described it, a passage from northern gloom into incredible brightness, then Albinoni's Concerto for Two Oboes just before intermission helps explain what Goethe meant. Lighter than air and gracefully formed, this is delightful entertainment, possessing not a hint of instruction or moral purpose. Vivaldi's D-Major Concerto for Four Violins is more dramatic but viscerally so, filled with high-pitched brilliance and vivid gesture.
The evening's best moment was a concocted Suite by Handel, in which an overture from "Radamisto" and dances from "Il Pastor Fide" serve as resources. Tafelmusik has chosen well, for nowhere else in this concert did profound inventiveness mix so easily with bright light and uninhibited vigor.
Tafelmusik, 16 years old and 18 musicians strong, is an orchestra of admirable reliability though not of blazing individual virtuosity. John Abberger and Washington McClain were the excellent oboists. David Greenberg, Kevin Mallon, Christopher Verrette and Thomas Georgi played competently in the Vivaldi. Jeanne Lamon, Tafelmusik's leader and first violinist, played the Bach with determined seriousness but had her struggles in the finale.
Fisher Hall in an odd way solves the problem of where to play period-instrument concerts for modern audiences. Its size offers many seats to sell, thus promising a little more economic viability; the bright acoustics reflect the intimate older sounds with some presence and clarity.

HEADLINE: U.S. Message to Vietnamese: Freedom Pays

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Aug. 6

 BODY:
The sons and daughters of those who prevailed in the Vietnam War met Secretary of State Warren Christopher today, and he told them in surprisingly stark terms that independent courts, a free press and an end to authoritarianism were their best hope for achieving prosperity.
In a 45-minute speech today at the Vietnamese Government's top foreign-policy school, the Institute for International Relations, Mr. Christopher described at length the democratic changes that have swept through parts of Southeast Asia over the last two decades and made it clear that Vietnam was far behind. 
 Before a clearly attentive audience of several hundred -- mostly students who listened to his English delivery directly even though they had access to a simultaneous translation over earphones -- Mr. Christopher explicitly linked progress in human rights to Vietnam's hopes of joining the booming market economies of Asia.
"Sustained economic development is more likely where courts provide due process, where newspapers are free to expose corruption, and where business people can make decisions with free access to accurate information," he said, describing conditions that are in drastically short supply in this authoritarian -- but increasingly nonideological -- Communist nation.
"Indeed, the reality of Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Thailand tells us that the rule of law and accountable government are the bedrock of stability and prosperity," he said. "The reality of Burma and North Korea tells us that repression entrenches bureaucracy."
In a more ordinary setting, such comments would hardly have seemed surprising. But Mr. Christopher gave the address shortly after meeting the general secretary of the Communist Party here, Do Muoi, and it was clearly intended as a signal that Washington will raise human rights issues as Vietnam seeks a far broader economic relationship with the United States.
Mr. Christopher might well have included Vietnam on his short list of repressive nations. Political dissent is still a serious crime here, and even the publication of essays urging political or constitutional reform has resulted in detention and imprisonment; religious activity is also controlled in this country of more than 72 million people.
He did not mention the cases of any political prisoners today, and he carefully avoided direct criticism of the leaders with whom he signed an agreement normalizing diplomatic relations on Saturday.
Nonetheless, Mr. Christopher was speaking in the heart of Hanoi, where today he formally raised an American flag over a new United States Embassy. And in the course of his talk, Mr. Christopher, 69, essentially urged the students to bring about fundamental change in a system that owns every outlet for information, controls the country's property and generates more than its share of corruption.
It is not the kind of classroom instruction that students are accustomed to receiving in this country, where most of the population is under the age of 25.
"When you hear American talk about freedom and human rights, this is what we mean," he said. "Each of you ought to have the right to help shape your country's destiny, as well as your own."
Throughout his weeklong trip through Asia, Mr. Christopher and his aides have argued that economic and cultural engagement with Vietnam is the quickest way to bring about changes in its human rights record. The same argument has been made in the case of China, although so far the evidence of success is slim. Clearly, the Vietnamese Government is betting the opposite: that it can follow a Chinese model, liberalizing its economic system without giving up too much social or political control.
The students appeared to have been chosen largely from the institute, although the United States Embassy here encouraged local employees to bring their friends. The audience looked unsurprised by the Secretary's message, and there were no provocative questions, except for one asking what Mr. Christopher planned to do about Bosnia.
The students seemed less interested in his comments about human freedom than in his discussion of economic issues.
"If Vietnam wants to grow, it has to change its thinking about the economy," one student, Tran Van Thuy, said afterward. "The more foreign investment comes to Vietnam, the more jobs that are created."

HEADLINE: Affirmative Action, on the Merit System

BYLINE: By Orlando Patterson; Orlando Patterson, professor of sociology at Harvard, is author of "Freedom."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
For years Americans have complained about government programs for the disadvantaged that do not work. Now, however, we are on the verge of dismantling affirmative action, the one policy that, for all its imperfections, has made a major difference in the lives of women and minority groups and has helped us achieve the constitutional commitment to the ideal of equality and fairness.
In utilitarian terms, it is hard to find a program that has brought so much gain to so many at so little cost. It has been the single most important factor in the rise of a significant, if still economically fragile, black middle class. 
 So it is hard to understand why it has become the most contentious issue in the nation. One would have thought that a policy that so many politicians denounced would have adversely touched the lives of at least a substantial proportion of those opposing it.
The facts show just the opposite. A National Opinion Research Center survey in 1990, still applicable today, found that while more than 70 percent of white Americans asserted that whites were being hurt by affirmative action for blacks, only 7 percent claimed to have experienced any form of reverse discrimination. Only 16 percent knew of someone close who had. Fewer than one in four could even claim that it was something they had witnessed or heard about at their workplace.
So what was the source feeding all the outrage? The vast majority of those interviewed claimed to have heard about the problem either through the press or from other second-hand sources, like their political leaders.
Of course, such data would not matter were affirmative action something inherently evil. But this could hardly be the case, because for more than 15 years leaders of both parties, including Senator Bob Dole and Gov. Pete Wilson of California, both Republican Presidential candidates, supported this initiative. Indeed, they lauded it, as both morally defensible and the only effective means of remedying the intolerable exclusion of disadvantaged minorities and women from opportunities to train and apply for the better-paying working- and middle-class jobs.

What happened? How did so manifestly worthy and effective a program lose the support, including that of some people who stood the most to gain from it?
Blaming the media or the cynicism of our leaders will not do, the transparent opportunism of Mr. Dole and Mr. Wilson notwithstanding. Several factors account for the collapse of support for affirmative action.
The first is that the largely erroneous arguments of neo-conservative and other right-wing critics somehow carried the day. Merit, we were repeatedly warned, was being undermined, resulting in both individual inequities and, worse, severe threats to our economy and the demands of a high-tech society.
Nonsense, both. Only a minuscule number of whites, we now know, are affected by affirmative action, and of this small fraction, a still smaller percentage are able to claim genuine grievances.
The claim that our economic efficiency is being threatened is simply laughable. Oddly enough, the problem right now is not a shortage of highly trained manpower but an oversupply, demonstrated by a saturated market for scientists and engineers. An alarming number of them are becoming lawyers (the overdependence on which being perhaps our biggest waste of manpower resources).
White men still control more than 99.9 percent of all the important top positions in private and public institutions, as well as the vast majority of middle-level and high-paying jobs. They will continue to do so until well into the next millennium.
There is also the argument that affirmative action has done nothing for the underclass and poor but favors people already in the middle class. Although rhetorically it is extremely effective, it is deliberately misleading. This point figured prominently the recent broadsides against the University of California's affirmative action policies from Governor Wilson and an influential university regent, Ward Connerly.
But affirmative action was never intended to help the poorest and least able. It is, by nature, a top-down strategy, meant to level the field for those who are capable of taking advantage of opportunities denied them because of their sex or race.
For the underclass and the working poor, an entirely different set of bottom-up strategies are called for, although no one seems to know what these might be.
The University of California's experience with affirmative action demonstrates beyond doubt the shallowness of the politicians' criticisms. Over the past 12 years, it has achieved its goal of incorporating students from disadvantaged minorities.
But far from experiencing a decline in standards, the university has not only fulfilled its mandate of selecting students from the top one-eighth of the state's graduating class, but has increased its eligibility requirements five times during this period. It is now a far more selective institution than before the introduction of affirmative action, with improved graduation rates for both black and non-black students.
Nothing could be more hypocritical and contradictory than the spectacle of a Republican governor demanding that his state's university system rely solely on the crude instrument of test scores to select 70 percent of its incoming students.
Republicans never tire of saying that what made America great are the virtues of honesty, courage, initiative and imagination, integrity, loyalty and fair play, all best demonstrated by a person's track record and especially his or her perseverance in the face of adversity. Why then are conservatives vilifying universities for taking these values seriously in selecting the next generation of leaders?
Race, we are told, should have nothing to do with the assessment of these virtues. Race, however, refers to several aspects of a person. It refers to physical appearance, and this, every African-American would agree with Senator Dole and Governor Wilson, should be a matter of no importance.
But for African-Americans, race also means surviving an environment in which racism is still pervasive. It has to be taken into account in assessing the content of any black person's character, and to assert that this amounts to a divisive glorification of race is as disingenuous and as absurd as claiming that we are divisively glorifying poverty and broken families when we take account of these factors in assessing a white student's character.
There is a third important meaning of race, and it is here that we enter tricky ground.
Blackness also connotes something positive: the subcultural heritage of African-Americans that in spite of centuries of discrimination has vastly enriched American civilization out of all proportion to the numbers, and treatment, of the group creating it. The University of California, like other great institutions of learning, rightly has seen the exposure of all its students to this important minority culture as part of its educational mission.
This is a noble goal, but it is fraught with dangers. What brought me around to support affirmative action after some strong initial reservations was not only its effectiveness as a strategy for reducing inequality, but also its possibilities for cross-pollinating our multi-ethnic communities. In the process, it could promote that precious, overarching national culture -- the envy of the world -- which I call ecumenical America.
But the promotion of diversity has done nothing of the sort, as Governor Wilson and Mr. Connerly were able to argue with devastating impact. To the contrary, both on and off our campuses affirmative action seems to have been distorted by its beneficiaries into the goal of balkanizing America both intellectually and culturally. One has only to walk for a few minutes on any large campus to witness the pervasiveness of ethnic separatism, marked by periodic outbursts of other chauvinisms and hostilities.
No group of people now seem more committed to segregation than black students and young professionals. Their motto seems to be: separate, yes, but make sure there is equality, by affirmative action or any other means. To a lesser extent, the tendency of the new black middle class to segregate itself residentially and to scoff at the norms and values of the ecumenical mainstream is the off-campus version of this lamentable betrayal and abandonment of the once cherished goal of integration.
Ethnic separatism has also had deleterious academic consequences. In an experiment conducted at the University of Michigan by two psychologists, Claude Steele and Richard Nisbett, a group of disadvantaged minority students who were encouraged to be part of the campus mainstream, and made to understand that the highest standards were expected of them, consistently performed above the average for white students and the student body as a whole. Members of a control group who took the familiar route of ethnic solidarity and consciousness-raising performed well below the average.
At its best, affirmative action compensates for one of the greatest disabilities of minority members: their lack of access to vital networks and other social capital which white men simply take for granted, whether it is the construction worker who mobilizes his neighborhood ties to get on a high-paying work crew, or the upper-middle class manager who draws on his grammar school and Ivy League contacts to land the vice presidency of some budding company.
Once in, however, too many minority workers and women felt entitled to automatic promotion and were too quick to use the accusation of racism or sexism when it was denied. Too many supervisors practice a patronizing racism or sexism. The cynical promotion of unqualified people, even if it happens only occasionally, damages the legitimacy of affirmative action since it takes only one such mistake to sour an entire organization.
Also damaging were clearly illegal practices like using blacks and women as entrepreneurial fronts to gain access to preferential contracts.
These are all correctable errors. Universities and businesses should return to the principle of integration, to the notion that diversity is not something to be celebrated and promoted in its own right, but an opportunity for mutual understanding and the furtherance of an ecumenical national culture.
The President should remain firm in his principled resolve to defend a corrected version of affirmative action. And if we give it a time limit of 10 years, it might still be possible to save this troubled but effective and badly needed policy.

HEADLINE: Growth Rate Slows for Consumer Credit

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Consumer credit grew for the 25th straight month in June, the Federal Reserve reported today, but the rate of increase was the slowest in four months.
Borrowing grew by $9.6 billion in June, compared with $13 billion the previous month and $11.5 billion in April. The latest increase was the smallest since a $4.7 billion rise in February. 
 "It looks like growth in consumer debt is starting to tail off a little bit," said Roseanne Cahn, chief economist at the CS First Boston Corporation in New York. "Consumer debt is not at worrisome levels. The statistics show credit-card spending as increasing in market share, but it's partly because it's being used as a substitute for cash."
Analysts said June's slower rate of increase in borrowing might also reflect the fact that there had been unusually large borrowing in April and May to help pay tax bills.
Consumer spending, meanwhile, has risen at a slower pace this year, though lately it has shown some signs of picking up moderately.
The Government previously reported that spending rose at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the second quarter, compared with a 1.6 percent rate in the first three months of the year.
The growth in consumer spending had slowed as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates seven times over a one-year period ending in February. The Fed reversed course in July and lowered short-term rates to stimulate the faltering economy.
The Fed said today that consumer credit rose in June at an annual rate of 12 percent, compared with 16.6 percent in May and 14.8 percent in April. Credit-card purchases and car buying accounted for nearly all the increase in debt.
Auto loans rose $3 billion in June, compared with $3.9 billion the previous month. That amounts to an annual growth rate of 10.9 percent in June and 14.4 percent in May.
Credit-card debt grew at an annual rate of 19.7 percent, or $6 billion, down from a 24.9 percent rate, or $7.5 billion, in May.
The category that includes loans for mobile homes, education, boats, trailers and vacations rose in June by only $604 million, or at an annual rate of 2.8 percent. That compares with a $1.7 billion increase in May, or a 7.9 percent rate.
Over all, outstanding consumer credit, which includes all household debt not secured by real estate, rose to $967.9 billion from $958.3 billion.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS: THE IMPLICATIONS;
Balkan Opening: To Peace or More War?

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Now that Croatia's lightning offensive has redrawn the map of the Balkans, the question is whether this is an unexpected opportunity for peace or the prelude to another round of war.
The cautious optimists, including some European and American officials, hope that Croatia's emergence as a muscular regional power, combined with NATO's recent ultimatum against the rebel Serbs in neighboring Bosnia, offers the best chance in recent years for a negotiated settlement. 
 But other officials warned that Croatia's triumph might just as easily have the opposite effect in the volatile Balkans. The Serbs' disarray could harden the attitudes of the Bosnian Government, emboldening its leaders to turn down a peace agreement they might have accepted just a few weeks ago.
The rout of the Serbian rebels in Croatia adds tens of thousands of soldiers to a Bosnian Serb army whose main weakness was its lack of manpower. And an overconfident Croatia might be tempted to attack Serbian-held territory in the eastern part of its country, a move that would almost certainly bring the Yugoslav Army into the fray.
In an interview tonight with National Public Radio, President Clinton reflected the ambivalence of his advisers and American intelligence analysts. He said the addition of more troops to the Bosnian Serb forces could have a "destabilizing effect," but he added, "No one knows for sure."
"I'm hopeful," Mr. Clinton continued, "that this will turn out to be something that will give us an avenue to a quicker diplomatic resolution, and not a road to a longer war."
The new balance of power means new calculations for all sides. In Sarajevo, the Bosnian Government has to weigh whether to agree to something like the pending Western map for Bosnia, which gives the Serbs control over 51 percent of the country. That is significantly less than the 70 percent they now control, but more than some hard-liners in the Government will accept.
"The greatest single concern of American policy makers," a senior Administration official said, "is that the Bosnian Government will overshoot the mark, and try for more than they can bite off, provoking a Serb counterattack."
Perhaps the most significant calculations are those being made in Belgrade by Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Serbia and a canny opportunist.
For the last four years, Mr. Milosevic has resolutely pursued the dream of uniting all Serbs in one state, a Greater Serbia that would emerge from the breakup of Yugoslavia. He backed Serbian rebels when they carved out the Serbian Republic of Krajina from Croatia in 1991. Six months later, he provided the supplies, ammunition and essential support that allowed the Bosnian Serbs to seize 70 percent of the newly independent nation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
But Western nations made Serbia pay a price for those victories: crippling economic sanctions. About a year ago, Mr. Milosevic began asking for the sanctions to be lifted, and offered himself as peace broker in Bosnia. He promised Western nations to deliver the Bosnian Serbs' support for a peace plan worked out by the five-nation "contact group."
That has not happened yet. Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political leader, defied Mr. Milosevic, saying he would not relinquish at the bargaining table what his troops had won on the battlefield.
Croatia's lightning victory may break that impasse. Mr. Karadzic tried over the weekend to demote Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb military commander. Field officers have rallied to support General Mladic, and American officials said Mr. Karadzic might be ousted.
Paradoxically, a military coup might bring peace closer. American officials believe that Mr. Milosevic has more influence over General Mladic. Until the struggle is resolved, there will be no serious diplomacy. "We don't know to whom we should be talking," an American official said.
Even if there is a settlement of the Bosnia conflict, American and European officials see a long-term danger that a resurgent Croatia and the Serbs will eventually carve up Bosnia between them.
President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and Mr. Milosevic held a series of secret meetings in late 1990 and early 1991 in which the two discussed dividing Bosnia between them, with only a tiny enclave in the middle left to the Muslims.
Those talks broke down, and rebel Serbs backed by the Yugoslav Army seized one-third of Croatia.
There are signs that Mr. Tudjman has not given up on his idea. The Times of London today published a map of Bosnia 10 years from now that Mr. Tudjman hand-sketched for the leader of Britain's Liberal Democratic Party, Paddy Ashdown, at a banquet in London three months ago.
With a big S, the Croatian leader split Bosnia top to bottom, with Croatia getting everything to the western side of the S, including Sarajevo, and Serbia everything to the east.
There is an important constraint on Mr. Tudjman, whose journey from Communist general to nationalist leader bears some resemblance to Mr. Milosevic's: He wants his country to be seen as a responsible member of the world community. In Mr. Tudjman's vision for Croatia, his nation eventually joins the European Union, and enjoys all the privileges that other Central Europeans nations have at international institutions like the World Bank.
American and German officials have made it clear he can have all that and more -- as long as he does not attempt a land grab in Bosnia or allow his military forces to perpetrate the atrocities that have characterized the fighting in the Balkans for the last four years.
Several American and European officials acknowledged the peril to the Bosnian Government of an ascendant Croatia.
"The stronger the Croats, the more dangerous it is for the Bosnians," an American official said.
The official added that Bonn and Washington could restrain Mr. Tudjman's impulses to slice more territory out of Bosnia, saying, "Tudjman's desire to be a responsible member of the world community is our only card, and so far it's been working."

HEADLINE: France Takes Lead in Worldwide Arms Sales

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
France surpassed the United States as the leading arms dealer to third-world countries last year, probably signaling the end of American dominance in the $25 billion-a-year weapons market to developing nations, a Government study reported today.
Sales from the United States to what the study defined as developing countries fell to their lowest levels in eight years, to $6.1 billion last year from $15.4 billion in 1993, while sales from France jumped to $11.4 billion from $3.8 billion, the Congressional Research Service said. 
 France had a banner year selling jets, ships and submarines to Pakistan and Middle Eastern countries, while the United States had only one large deal, the sale of up to 25 F-15's to Israel.
The American share of sales to third-world countries fell to 24 percent last year from 61 percent in 1993, while France's share increased to 45 percent from 15 percent. More than 70 percent of the arms sold worldwide go to the third world, mainly to the Middle East and Asia.
Arms control advocates expressed surprise at the figures but cautioned that they might show only a brief hiatus in larger American weapons sales. "The French are catching the U.S. in a year where some of its major purchasers are just catching their breath," said Caleb Rossiter, director of The Project on Demilitarization and Democracy, an arms control group in Washington.
United States military contractors also cited the boom-bust trend of big deals in the international arms bazaar, but also seized on the figures as evidence the Clinton Administration should increase assistance to American companies competing with government-subsidized European competitors.
"We're not asking for a lot," said Joel L. Johnson, international vice president for the Aerospace Industries Association, who noted that American industry has been seeking an export credit mechanism.
Overall, arms sales to third-world countries dropped slightly to $25.4 billion last year from $25.5 billion in 1993, continuing a steady decline since the end of the cold war in 1990.
Richard F. Grimmett, a senior analyst who prepares the report each year, said that since 1990 and the stunning success of American high technology in the Persian Gulf war, the United States had established itself as the world's preeminent arms merchant. France, Britain and Russia formed a second tier of arms dealers to the third world.
But Mr. Grimmett said that pecking order was up for grabs.
"As competition over a shrinking international arms market intensifies, it is likely that suppliers in these two tiers will regularly shift in their rankings relative to one another," the report concluded.
The Clinton Administration announced a new policy in February that approved the continued sale of arms to its important allies and friendly nations. This policy, which made explicit an approach that had governed arms transfers since the Reagan Administration, followed an 18-month debate within the Government about whether the United States, as the world's largest weapons exporter, should promote a global policy of export restraint.
Mr. Clinton sided with advocates of using arms sales to promote foreign policy goals. But Mr. Clinton also put more weight on domestic economic gains.
"The Clinton policy publicly elevates the significance of domestic economic considerations in the arms transfer decision-making process to a higher degree than has been the case in previous administrations," the congressional report concluded.
But last year, France reached the biggest weapons deals with third-world buyers: Pakistan bought Agosta 90-class submarines, Qatar bought Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets and Saudi Arabia purchased La Fayette-class frigates.
"The lesson is that U.S. market dominance and unwillingness to lead the way in multilateral restrictions on arms sales has cleared the way for France, Britain and other countries to get what they can," said Lora Lumpe, a senior official at the Federation of American Scientists, which advocates restraints on conventional arms deals.
The Middle East remains the largest arms market in the third world. Saudi Arabia, despite its financial problems, led all developing countries in arms purchases in 1994, concluding new deals worth $9.5 billion. China was a distant second with $2.5 billion. Israel ranked third with $2.4 billion.
Arms control advocates said the sales tend to promote nondemocratic governments. "The more these countries spend on military equipment, the less they are investing in their own economies," said Thomas A. Cardamone Jr., who monitors conventional arms sales for the Council for a Livable World Education Fund. "It's not a way to create democratic governments or stronger economies in those countries."
Indeed, the Project on Demilitarization and Democracy in a study also issued today concluded that 85 percent of American arms sales to developing countries in the last four years went to nondemocratic governments, as defined by the State Department.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
For $1.27 Billion, NBC Accomplishes An Olympic Sweep

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
NBC fired a remarkable pre-emptive strike at rival networks yesterday by agreeing to pay $1.27 billion for the television rights to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, and the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
With support from General Electric, which owns it, NBC executed a nifty triple play: it shut out Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which owns the Fox Network, from acquiring the Summer Olympics in the magnate's homeland; prevented the Walt Disney Company, which agreed to acquire Capital Cities/ABC last week, from making a quick splash in sports television, and ended CBS's run as the home of the Winter Olympics at three. 
"It's symbolic in a competitive sense, but it's probably a bigger blow to News Corporation, with its global reach, than to Disney," said Harold Vogel, a media analyst for Cowen & Company. "It's a well-timed and appropriate move."
Olympic rights fees have traditionally been subject to competitive bidding among all the networks. But by striking a deal with such speed, NBC short-circuited the bidding process and, in turn, startled its opponents.
NBC is paying $715 million for the Sydney Games, 56 percent more than the $456 million it paid for next year's Summer Olympics in Atlanta. It is paying $555 million for the Salt Lake City Games, exceeding by 47 percent CBS's winning bid for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.
"As part of the arrangement, we'll also be selling NBC to the I.O.C.," joked Robert Wright, president and chief executive of NBC, referring to the International Olympic Committee, which sells worldwide Olympic television rights.
The total sum is extraordinary, even given the rights-fee inflation in sports television, because it pays for just the rights to two weeks of programming per Olympics. By contrast, Fox's $1.58 billion contract for National Football Conference rights covers four seasons. CBS's $1.725 billion, seven-year extension of its rights to the National Collegiate Athletic Association men's basketball tournament is for a monthlong extravaganza.
But an Olympics can dominate prime-time ratings for two weeks, as the Winter Olympics from Lillehammer, Norway, did for CBS last year.
With the Sydney Olympics taking place later than usual, in September, NBC can use the Games to counter its rivals' new-season programming.
Even at such extraordinary financial levels, Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports, said the network would at least break even because of the strength of the sports-advertising market and the ability to sell two Olympics at once.
NBC's $715 million offer for Sydney includes $705 million in cash and $10 million in what is known as an "in-kind" contribution. That may include NBC giving the Sydney Olympic Organizing Committee $10 million for tourism-related television advertising.
According to executives familiar with the situation, the I.O.C., which negotiates all worldwide television rights for local organizing committees, felt confident about accepting NBC's bid after Fox indicated that it would pay $701 million in cash.
Vince Wladika, a Fox spokesman, said: "We don't comment on speculation."
"What Fox would or wouldn't do is moot at this point," said Dick Pound, the chairman of the I.O.C.'s television committee.
NBC's desire to buy two Olympics at once persuaded the I.O.C. to forgo next month's planned four-network bidding process for the Sydney rights. Olympic rights fees have sometimes been the subject of intense competition among the networks, and that has helped drive up the price. This time, NBC's price was already high enough.
"This was too good a deal for us not to say yes to," Mr. Pound said. NBC's offer placed two conditions on the I.O.C.: ABC, CBS and Fox could not be told, and it had to be accepted by Sunday night.
"If it was not accepted, we'd withdraw it and we wouldn't bid on Sydney at the same level," Mr. Ebersol said.
Privately, the emotions of NBC's rivals yesterday ranged from acceptance to disappointment. Publicly, they were nearly mute.
David Kenin, the president of CBS Sports, said: "Congratulations to NBC. This is their deal. We won't have any further comment." ABC's comment echoed CBS's.
Mr. Wladika of Fox added: "The Olympics is a great event. We wish NBC well."
All three rival networks had reason to want one or both Olympics.
Mr. Murdoch was believed to be keen about broadcasting the Summer Olympics of his native land to his adopted home. CBS wanted to broadcast its fourth straight Winter Olympics. ABC wanted to re-enter the Olympic game, from which it has been absent since the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics.
There is no assurance of profits for a network telecasting the Olympics. NBC and Cablevision Systems split a $100 million loss on the 1992 Summer Games because of their ill-fated pay-per-view Olympics Triplecast. The 1988 Seoul Olympics reported losses at the network level, although the loss was recouped with profits made by the stations NBC owns.
"You assume the robust ad network," Mr. Ebersol said. "But one Olympics is five years away, the other seven years. The markets go up and down. There are cycles."
Until last week, NBC had not anticipated making a dual Olympic bid. NBC even discussed making a joint bid for the Sydney rights with ABC before Disney acquired the network. "It was one of several options," said Mark Mandel, an ABC spokesman.
NBC executives were, in fact, skittish about going overboard on a bid for Sydney, despite greater-than-expected success in marketing next year's Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where advertising sales have exceeded $615 million.
"We had a hard time getting our hands around Sydney as a stand-alone," Mr. Wright said.
But as late as last Wednesday, Mr. Wright and Mr. Ebersol were continuing to discuss a Sydney bid alone.
"The numbers were supportable for a bid, but not quite," Mr. Ebersol said. "Then Mr. Wright said, 'Why don't we go for two?' " The idea gained quick approval from Jack Welch, G.E.'s chairman. Mr. Ebersol flew on the General Electric jet to Goteborg, Sweden, to get a go-ahead from Juan Antonio Samaranch, the I.O.C., chairman, and then back across the Atlantic to Montreal, to make the deal with Mr. Pound.
Rights fees are divided by the I.O.C., the national Olympic committee of the host country and the local organizing committee, with the local committee getting about a 60 percent share.
Executives of the Sydney and Salt Lake City Olympic committees were delighted with NBC's offers. Sydney was projecting 43 percent less than the $715 million; Salt Lake City expected only $400 million, 38 percent less than the $555 million NBC bid.

HEADLINE: Stocks Move Higher in Price, With Dow Climbing 9.86

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market moved higher yesterday as traders bought shares of companies expected to show higher-than-average earnings increases in the months ahead.
Cyclical issues that are sensitive to moves in the economy led the Dow Jones industrial average higher by 9.86 points, to 4,693.32. General Electric rose 1 1/8, to 58 3/4; Goodyear, 1 1/8, to 43 1/4; Alcoa, 1, to 57 5/8, and International Paper, 1 1/8, to 86 3/8. 
 "The market did not have too much to feed on, although there was more of a positive slant than a negative one," said Peter G. Grennan, senior vice president of Smith Barney. "Even since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates on July 6, the Dow has just stagnated."
Analysts noted that many investors were wary about the Treasury Department's quarterly auction of $42.5 billion in bonds and other securities, which begins today. They said the stock market was waiting to see whether Japanese institutions took advantage of Tokyo's loosened rules on overseas investing and participated heavily in the Treasury auction.
Broader market indicators advanced along with the Dow. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.09 points, to 560.03; the Nasdaq composite index rose 4.13 points, to 995.22, and the American Stock Exchange's market value index picked up 0.66 point, to 524.86.
Advances on the New York Stock Exchange topped declines by 1,208 to 971. Trading on the first Monday in August was relatively light, with 277.1 million shares changing hands, compared with 314.7 million shares on Friday.
Some of the well-known technology stocks followed through on their recent advances. Texas Instruments rose 1 7/8, to 146 1/2; Intel, 1 1/2, to 63 1/2; National Semiconductor, 7/8, to 26; Bay Networks, 1 1/2, to 42 7/8, and Cisco Systems, 1 3/8, to 55 5/8.
Multiline insurance companies also gained as institutional investors rotated their interest to this sector. Aetna jumped 1 1/2, to 64 3/8, and Travelers increased 7/8, to 48.
An analyst's downgrading apparently caused a 4 3/4 decline in Lattice Semiconductor to 32 7/8. Digital Equipment, which last week posted disappointing fourth-quarter results and whose personal computer chief resigned soon thereafter, sank 2 3/8, to 41 7/8.
Firstier Financial slumped 2, to 37, after First Bank System said that it will buy Firstier for $37.96, less than its closing price of $39 on Friday. First Bank, meanwhile, gained 3/8, to 43 3/8.
Among other issues, Mid-South Insurance agreed to be acquired by Trigon Blue Cross-Blue Shield and jumped 4 1/8, to 14 1/4. Nike rose 2 1/2, to 96 1/8, following two positive reports from security analysts raising the likelihood that the company will split its stock. Addington Resources, which announced that it will sell its nonenvironmental businesses, climbed 4, to 14 1/4.
And Piedmont Management, which reported sharply higher second-quarter profits, rose 2, to 12.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Up; Japan Buying Is Watched

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved a little higher yesterday, on optimism that a stronger dollar will increase foreign demand this week at the Treasury's auctions.
But many in the market are skeptical that Japanese buying in the quarterly auctions, at which $42.5 billion of United States securities are being sold, will be stronger than ususal, despite last week's announcement by the Japanese Finance Ministry that it was loosening rules to encourage Japanese institutions to invest more overseas. But few expect the demand by Japanese investors will be anywhere near the level they exhibited in the 1980's. 
 "The market is becoming more skeptical that the Japanese are going to rush in and buy," James Blumenthal, an economist with MCM Moneywatch in New York, said. "The market, I think, is overly optimistic. I expect when it comes it will begin with a gradual increase in participation, especially with the dollar being weak."
A stronger dollar would make dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities more attractive, and less likely that they would abandon the financial markets here to limit foreign exchange losses.
Traders said activity was muted yesterday, with no new inflation news expected before Thursday and Friday, when the Producer Price Index and Consumer Price Index numbers are released; few market participants moved to establish substantial new positions before the start of the refunding and ahead of more data. some see a potential for a rally at the end of the week if the inflation data are favorable.
The 30-year bond rose 8/32 , to a price of 1098/32 to yield 6.89 percent, down from 6.91 percent on Friday.
The Treasury's quarterly auction begins today with the sale of $18 billion of new three-year notes. At yesterday's weekly bill sale the Treasury sold $25.2 billion of new three- and six-month securities at average rates of 5.41 percent and 5.40 percent, respectively.
Ahead of today's three-year note auction, dealers were offering the new issue at a price to yield 6.02 percent, while the five-years were offered at a price to yield 6.45 percent, with the 30-year bond at a price to 6.84 percent. All showed improvement of a few basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, in yield from last week.
Typically the major bond dealers drive prices lower to raise investor interest in the auctions. But the firms will not have to push yields much higher to get that demand, said Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment strategist at the First Albany Corporation. "But we could get a real kick from an increase in foreign demand," he said, forecasting that the long bond would stabilize between 6.80 percent and 7 percent.
Michael Englund, chief economist at MMS International in San Francisco, said huge participation by the Japanese private sectors is probably "more story than reality."
He added, "Japanese central bank intervention has been huge this year, and they no doubt would appreciate the Japanese private sector to pick up some of the burden."
Asked if he had any clues about Japanese participation at this week's auction, Peter Hirsch, managing director and head of the government trading desk for Salomon Brothers said, "If one could get the answers, they could get rich."
In the municipal bond market yields were up modestly, as the market prepared to sell about $4.8 billion of new issues this week, a gain of $1.7 billion over last week's total.
Some investors have been reluctant to buy tax-exempt securities recently, for fear tax laws would be changed, and bond funds have seen an outflow of cash.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price 	98.632 	97.270	Discounted Rate 	5.41% 	5.40%	Coupon Yield 	5.58%	5.64%	High Price 	98.635 	97.270	Discounted Rate 	5.40% 	5.40%	Coupon Yield 	5.57% 	5.64%		 	 	Low Price 	98.632 	97.270	Discounted Rate 	5.41% 	5.40%	Coupon Yield 	5.58% 	5.64%	Accepted at low price	29% 	50%	Total applied for 	$53,654,153 	$62,009,075	Accepted 	$12,673,122 	$12,675,664	Noncompetitive 	$1,546,403 	$1,439,194

HEADLINE: Don Patinkin, Israeli Economist and University President, 73

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Don Patinkin, an eminent American-born Israeli economist who served as president of Hebrew University, died yesterday in Jerusalem. He was 73.
The cause of death was lymphoma, some friends in the United States said. 
 Mr. Patinkin is best known for his book, "Money, Interest and Prices," published in 1956. "Patinkin wrote the definitive work on money -- the book Keynes never wrote," said Paul A. Samuelson, the Nobel-prize winning economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
But his most enduring achievement may well be the establishment of serious tradition of economics scholarship and respect for free markets in socialist-minded Israel, his adopted home.
Mr. Patinkin was born in Chicago, the son of an emigrant from Russia. He graduated from the University of Chicago in 1943, the same year he completed a decade of study of the Talmud at the Chicago Yeshiva.
But Mr. Patinkin chose economics rather than religion as a profession, finishing a Ph. D. at the University of Chicago in 1947 and staying on as a faculty member. A deep commitment to Zionism led him to immigrate to Israel in 1949.
When he assumed the post of lecturer at Hebrew University, there was no modern economics department at the university and little attention to the discipline anywhere in the new nation. "He was the Abraham of Israeli economics," Mr. Samuelson said, the teacher of virtually all the economists who have in turn made Israel a center of the profession.
Mr. Patinkin's most important research was an extension of his doctoral thesis. At the time, there was still a great division between an older school built on the premise that the quantity of money in circulation simply affected the average level of prices, and post-Depression scholars struggling to find the links between money, production and employment.
Mr. Patinkin parsed the issues in ways that even admirers describe as Talmudic. Thus while he accepted the new analytic framework created by John Maynard Keynes, he rejected the key Keynesian idea that unemployment would not eventually fall along with wages and prices in a depression.
Later in his career, he became a scholar of the history of economic thought. His most distinguished contribution was a painstaking review of the intellectual revolution after World War I that shattered classical economics. Paradoxically in light of his critique of Keynes's research, he debunked the notion that Keynes's contemporaries rather than Keynes himself deserved much of the credit for the sea change in economic theory.
Mr. Patinkin's highest academic position, the presidency of Hebrew University from 1983 to 1986, brought him no joy. He resigned abruptly, taking responsibility for the deterioration in the university's finances that had been hidden by Israel's bout of high inflation.
Mr. Patinkin is survived by his wife Devora, a research biologist at Hebrew University, and his son, Aran, and his daughters, Na'ama, Ilana and T'mira, all of whom live in Israel.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Mark Declines and Dollar Rises On Hopes for German Rate Cut

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar surged to a three-week high against the German mark yesterday as hopes again grew that the Bundesbank would reduce interest rates in Germany this week.
With a series of United States Treasury auctions also scheduled this week, the dollar was little changed against the Japanese yen. The Treasury's quarterly auctions will provide a chance to judge whether Japanese corporate investors will buy more United States bonds, bolstering the demand for dollars. The Treasury plans to sell $42.5 billion in securities, starting today. 
 In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.4070 marks from 1.3972 marks on Friday. It slipped to 91.30 yen from 91.43 yen.
Many currency traders expect the German central bank to trim the key money market rate, the 14-day securities repurchase rate, tomorrow. That could foreshadow a cut in the discount rate as early as Thursday, when the bank's policy-making council returns from its summer recess.
Lower German rates often help the dollar by making German deposits less attractive.
Expectations of another German rate cut grew on Friday when the vice president of the Bundesbank, Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, expressed surprise that money market rates had not already fallen. Many analysts took his remarks as a sign the bank wanted to steer the repurchase rate lower.
"I think a small repo rate cut, of three to five basis points, should be expected, with no change in the discount rate," said Marc Chandler, senior analyst at the Deutsche Bank Securities Corporation in New York. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The Bundesbank last trimmed the repurchase rate -- to 4.50 percent from 4.51 percent -- on June 7. It last reduced the discount rate, which acts as the floor for German money market rates, to a six-year low of 4 percent on March 30.
Speculation that German rates might fall also drove the mark down against other European currencies. It declined to five-month lows against the Italian lira and the Swedish krona, to a seven-month low against the Spanish peseta, and a seven-week low against the British pound.
Not everyone expects a repurchase rate cut. "The Bundesbank takes pleasure in a firmish currency," said Sean Bovenizer, senior vice president at Norddeutsche Landesbank in New York. "I don't think it's a given there will be a repo rate cut."

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Fears Take Big Toll On Broadway Stores' Shares

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Shares in Broadway Stores Inc. lost nearly half their value today amid speculation that the department store company might have to sell assets or seek protection under the bankruptcy laws.
Several credit companies have refused to guarantee payment to companies that supply Broadway Stores, and several suppliers, including Jones Apparel Group Inc., Guess and Esprit de Corp., have stopped shipping merchandise to the company. 
 Broadway Stores, formerly Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., operates 82 stores under the Weinstocks, Emporium and Broadway names.
 "There is a lot of competition here and they don't have a niche," said Sanford Paganucci, an analyst with Collins & Company. "Management is floundering."
 Broadway Stores' shares fell $1.375 today, or 46 percent, to $1.625 on the New York Stock Exchange. On Friday, the stock declined 14 percent. The company's shares traded as high as $12.125 on Nov. 21.
 The Standard & Poor's Corporation placed the company's $144 million in debt on Creditwatch today with negative implications.
Broadway Stores said on Friday that it was exploring alternatives for financing its business. The company has been in talks to sell its Emporium and Weinstocks stores in Northern California to the May Department Stores Company.
 Broadway Stores' president, David Dworkin, said in Friday's statement that he knew of no defaults by the company on loan agreements.
 The company did not return phone calls today.
 In February 1991, the company, then known as Carter Hawley Hale, obtained court protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws.It emerged in October 1992 as Broadway Stores after a restructuring by the real estate magnate Sam Zell's Zell/Chilmark Fund, with Mr. Zell holding 54 percent.
 Broadway Stores recorded a profit for 1992, but the slumping California economy, stiff competition and a lack of identity with shoppers caused it to post losses for the two most recent fiscal years.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
An American Tempest at Fund Created for Russia

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Two years ago, President Clinton and Congress joined hands to create two investment funds that were to be the primary tools for pumping American money into Russia's ravaged economy and teaching the American way of doing business.
But the lessons the two funds have been offering lately are surely not ones the Americans intended: about board room fights, wounded egos, invective and angry resignations. And some people say the ultimate lesson may be that the formula for success on Wall Street does not always work in public and nonprofit operations. 
 The trouble erupted after the two funds were merged in May, and A. Robert Towbin, the 59-year-old investment banker who was chief executive of the fund for small businesses, was not named chief executive of the merged fund.
Mr. Towbin, who became a Wall Street star in the 1970's and 80's doing initial public offerings for Intel and Compaq, was so angry at being passed over in favor of a 35-year-old former investment banker that he quit his job as vice chairman of the merged fund and began a campaign of invective against the man responsible for passing him over: former Secretary of the Treasury W. Michael Blumenthal, the chairman of the merged fund.
Mr. Blumenthal passed over Mr. Towbin largely because members of Mr. Towbin's board, Federal officials and some lawmakers, who provide the money for the fund, were frustrated that Mr. Towbin's Russian-American Enterprise Fund was investing in Russia by the thimbleful when they thought a flood of investment was urgently needed.
Mr. Towbin responded that he was the victim of impossibly high expectations and that his critics failed to appreciate how hard it is to do business in Russia.
He was especially galled that the job he sought was given to Austin Beutner, who had worked with Mr. Blumenthal on the other fund.
In January 1994, Mr. Towbin had taken the job as chief executive of the small-business fund because, he said, the time was right to give something back to society. After more than a quarter-century in investment banking, he had his 94-foot-yacht, his country house in Provence and his million-dollar-a-year job.
He spent much of the year running around Russia, and with each passing week, grew more convinced that he was doing the right thing, providing desperately needed seed money and his own investment-banking expertise so that entrepreneurs could take root in the land of Lenin.
His fund, which had $340 million to invest, had a varied portfolio: $8 million went to a supermarket chain in the Russian Far East, $700,000 to a jeans maker in Nizhny Novgorod and $5.6 million to a plywood manufacturer.
Seventeen months after Mr. Towbin took the helm, the Clinton Administration decided to merge Mr. Towbin's small-business fund with the $100 million Government-sponsored Fund for Large Enterprises -- a merger that had Mr. Towbin's blessing because it was expected to cut overhead by more than $2 million a year.
Little did he suspect that Mr. Blumenthal, the chairman of the fund for large businesses and later of the merged fund, would not pick him as chief executive of the consolidated fund. Instead Mr. Blumenthal chose Mr. Beutner, a former investment banker with the Blackstone Group.
Mr. Blumenthal's effort to soothe Mr. Towbin by offering him the vice chairman's job only stoked his anger. "They threw me a bone," said Mr. Towbin, a proud man accustomed to getting his way. "I'm angry because it was done in such a Machiavellian way. I don't understand why this happened because I didn't do anything wrong. I told him I'm going to fight this."
First, he urged Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who oversees Russia policy, and the Agency for International Development to overrule Mr. Blumenthal, but they refused. Then he started his letter-writing campaign, which included a letter to President Clinton.
Mr. Blumenthal, who has made plenty of personnel decisions as Treasury Secretary and as chairman of the Bendix Corporation and of Unisys, appears stunned by Mr. Towbin's outrage. He said he sees it as a case of sour grapes.
"I'm obviously a little surprised he feels so sad," Mr. Blumenthal said. "I'm not surprised that he thinks he would have been the better man."
Mr. Towbin, he continued, "is a good man and did a fine job."
"At the same time Mr. Beutner did an equally good job," he said. "All things considered, I decided Mr. Beutner was the right choice."
Mr. Blumenthal said that he had canvassed the fund's board and officials in Washington and they indicated support for choosing Mr. Beutner over Mr. Towbin. "It was not a decision that I imposed," he said. "The new board of the merged fund unanimously concurred." The Russian members of the board agreed because they thought the move would speed up the flow of money.
Some board members of the Russian-American Enterprise Fund were less charitable about Mr. Towbin's performance, unhappy that in his nearly 18 months at the helm, he had invested only $30 million in Russia of the $340 million promised in a period of just over three years.
"Bob worked his backside off, but things weren't going fast enough," said Sharon Tennison, a board member who is president of the Center for Citizen Initiatives, a San Francisco-based group promoting business in the former Soviet bloc. "He wanted to operate the fund like a Wall Street fund, but Russia isn't Wall Street. You have to be willing to take larger risks."
About one-fourth of the enterprise fund's 24-member board regularly complained about Mr. Towbin, faulting him for micromanaging, for not having enough offices outside Moscow, for doing too little for very small businesses, and for building a staff of 54 employees when so little money was flowing to Russia.
Mr. Towbin is an affable, square-jawed man with shaggy white hair, who takes an almost parental pride in describing investments like the $280,000 he put into a 40-employee skirt manufacturer in Podolsk, south of Moscow, where the fund taught computer skills and Western accounting methods.
"I could have always gotten money out the door faster, but I was worried I would look like a fool a year from now," he said. "I was worried people would say that I dumped all this money down the drain and the people you invested in ran away with 100 Mercedes-Benzes. There would have been hell to pay in Washington."
His most important defender is E. Gerald Corrigan, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who served as chairman of the Russian-American Enterprise Fund until he resigned in April.
"I at times shared the frustration of wanting things to go faster," Mr. Corrigan said. "but realistically what Bob and the whole staff did in a short time frame was heroic, extraordinary. Some people might say our due diligence was too conservative. My answer to that is, so be it."

HEADLINE: I.B.M. and Toshiba Expected To Announce a $1 Billion Plant

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Joining a multibillion-dollar international rush to increase production of computer memory chips, I.B.M. and the Toshiba Corporation were expected to announce plans today to invest more than $1 billion in a new plant in northern Virginia, people familiar with the announcement said.
The two companies, which already conduct joint semiconductor research in East Fishkill, N.Y., and have a joint venture that produces flat-panel color screens in Japan, would split the cost of the new plant, which is expected to come on line in 1997, according to those familiar with the deal. The new plant would produce the latest generation of dynamic random-access-memory chips, which are mostly used in personal computers. 
 I.B.M. and Toshiba spokesmen declined to comment on the expected announcement, as did state officials in Virginia. But a press advisory issued by Gov. George F. Allen said yesterday that the Governor would be attending a "historic economic development announcement" today in Manassas, outside Washington. The statement said the announcement would concern a project that could be the "largest single economic development" in the state's history.
I.B.M. has an industrial site in Manassas it had been trying to sell. Now, said those familiar with the plans, I.B.M. and Toshiba would build the new semiconductor plant there.
Because chip-making operations are so expensive to build and the yen is so strong compared with the dollar, many Japanese manufacturers have joined with partners in the United States.
I.B.M. makes memory chips in Burlington, Vt., and in France. Speaking to financial analysts last month, Jerome B. York, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer, said the company was currently selling all the chips it was making. Asked about the company's capital spending plans, Mr. York said I.B.M. "may decide to push capacity up to a point where we might need another foundry."
But he expressed reservations about covering the cost of a new plant, which he estimated to be $1.5 billion.
The demand for memory chips has surged in recent years, driven mostly by rising sales of personal computers. Industry analysts expect the demand to continue growing as memory chips are used in an increasing number of products, from telephones to toys.
"We don't see supply catching up to demand until about 1997," said Mario A. Morales, an analyst at Dataquest, a market research firm in San Jose, Calif.

HEADLINE: Florida Insurers Still Face A Gap in Disaster Coverage

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT 

 BODY:
As Florida residents sigh with relief over the mildness of Hurricane Erin, insurers are alarmed at the holes that remain in the financial safety net created by the state after Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
Bankers in New York are near completion of two credit agreements totaling $2.5 billion that would help insurers pay claims after a big storm. But those agreements are not enough to cover the losses possible from the most severe storms. 
 "The insurance companies are still on the hook, and they don't like it," said Sean Mooney, chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute. "The insurance system is just not built to handle the once-in-a-100-year event with $50 billion or $100 billion of losses," he said, noting that disasters of that size could put even the largest companies out of business.
Hurricane Andrew in 1992 caused about $16 billion of insurance losses and led to the failure of a half-dozen insurance companies.
Since then, insurers have tried to reduce their business in the riskiest parts of the state, particularly coastal areas. At the same time they have pushed -- unsuccessfully so far -- for Federal legislation to lend insurers money after a giant catastrophe.
To accommodate homeowners who are unwanted as policyholders by private insurers, Florida created the Joint Underwriting Associaton, which is now the state's third-largest home insurer, with 730,000 customers. But with only $200 million of cash, the association wants access to bank loans to pay claims quickly after a big storm. It has negotiated a $1.5 billion line of credit from J. P. Morgan & Company.
The association is paying 45-hundredths of a percentage point, or about $6.8 million a year, to keep the bank line available. In addition, any loan it takes will carry an interest rate of 1.25 to 1.75 percentage points more than the cost of bank deposits in the wholesale market.
Eric Altman, a managing director at J. P. Morgan, said that such a price was "orders of magnitude cheaper than the cost of reinsurance" for a similar amount. Money to repay the loans would come from an assessment on insurers in the first year, followed in subsequent years by assessments on its customers.
A similar $1 billion line of credit for the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association, which provides hurricane insurance in some risky counties, is being arranged by Chase Manhattan Bank.
Another part of the state's safety net is its Catastrophe Trust Fund, which now collects about $425 million annually from insurers. Earlier this year, the fund received a key ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that it would not have to pay tax on money it earns from investments. Assuming no big claims this year, the fund expects to have nearly $1 billion on hand at the end of 1995.
"Every year that we have no claims we get stronger," said Jack Nicholson, chief operating officer of the catastrophe fund. Insurers pay for the first $3 billion of losses, with the catastrophe fund paying about 80 percent of additional losses. To pay those losses it would use its reserve fund, plus about $4 billion of bonds that it might issue. The bonds would be backed by an emergency 4 percent assessment it could charge on premiums for most kinds of property or liability insurance in the state.
Estimating probabilities of infrequent events is always risky, but Mr. Nicholson said the fund could now cover the $10 billion of residential losses from another storm similar to Andrew judged to be a catastrophe that occurs once every 30 years.
But the fund is still short of covering losses from a catastrophe that might occur once in a 100 years. It is estimated such a storm would cause about $18 billion of residential losses, with another $11 billion of losses on commercial property.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Panel Backs Rises In Subway and Bus Fares

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
The Finance Committee of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved a broad package of fare and toll increases yesterday, but the fate of transit passes for 500,000 students remained up in the air.
With barely a month left until school starts, Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson and M.T.A. officials agreed yesterday morning to meet before the day was over to try to save the passes. But by day's end, there had been no meeting, and it was unclear if City Hall and the transit agency were any closer to resolving their impasse over the passes. 
 The dance around the subject of meeting, complete with each side's insistence that it had been willing to do so all along, came as the M.T.A. board's Finance Committee took the first step toward enacting a financial plan that would eliminate the passes, raise the subway and bus fare to $1.50 on Nov. 1 and increase commuter railroad fares and bridge and tunnel tolls. On a 5-to-1 vote, the committee sent the package to the full M.T.A. board, which meets Thursday. Bernard B. Beal voted no.
Mr. Dyson said at yesterday's meeting that M.T.A. officials were afraid to sit down with city officials to analyze the true cost of transporting students, "because people want to use the children as political pawns."
Taking up the challenge, Daniel T. Scannell, the board's vice chairman and acting chief executive of the M.T.A., said, "We're willing to move when you're ready to set your people up with our people."
"We're ready this afternoon," Mr. Dyson said.
"We'll do it," Mr. Scannell answered.
Leaving the meeting, Mr. Dyson, a Giuliani appointee to the M.T.A. board, said it was up to transit officials to go to City Hall. At the end of the day, Mr. Scannell said the M.T.A. was still awaiting a call from Mr. Dyson. Calls to Mr. Dyson were not returned.
As if in testimony to the power of the passes as a political issue, the panel members said barely a word about the fare increases, focusing almost entirely on the matter of whether to charge almost 500,000 students the full price of a token to get to school. While the proposed fare increase is almost three months away and would require public hearings, the board could do away with the passes at any time, and the impact would be felt sooner.
The city had subsidized the passes, at a rate of $128 million a year, until last October, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani cut off the money.
Assemblyman Steven Sanders, Democrat of Manhattan, said yesterday that he planned to sue the city this week on the ground that the city is legally required to pay for student transportation. The M.T.A. has filed a notice of claim with the city, a precursor to a possible lawsuit, on much the same grounds.
Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Dyson have been careful to portray the elimination of student passes as the work of M.T.A. bureaucrats, though it was part of the financial plan proposed last Thursday by E. Virgil Conway, the M.T.A. chairman, who was appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki. Mr. Giuliani is still trying to repair his relationship with Mr. Pataki, after having endorsed his opponent, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, in last year's campaign.
There has been a bitter public debate over the passes in recent days, and even though Mr. Dyson and Mr. Scannell indicated a willingness to talk, there was still much anger over the issue.
Committee members accused the city of shirking its responsibility toward students, while Mr. Dyson, who is not on the committee but who attended the meeting, said that the problem lay with mismanagement at the M.T.A. and with authority budgets that he said "range from fairy tale to fantasy."
Much of the meeting dealt with the contention of the Mayor and Mr. Dyson that it costs the Transit Authority little or nothing to transport the students, a point that both men repeated yesterday.
"There's no cost to the M.T.A. in providing the free passes for the students," Mr. Giuliani, who was not at the meeting, said. "The subways run anyway, the motormen are there, everyone else is there."
The argument is a new one for the Mayor, who issued a financial plan last October that said, in a reference to student passes, "The actual cost of a subway or bus ride is about twice the cost of the fare." Rather than claim that carrying students cost nothing, the plan said the student pass subsidy was being eliminated because the city had a deficit, because the Transit Authority had a surplus, and because the state should foot the bill.
Transit officials insist that there is a very real cost to transporting the students, who account for more than 20 percent of weekday bus riders during the school year, and almost 5 percent of subway riders. They say that the Transit Authority runs more buses and more subway trains, particularly after school, specifically to accommodate students. And they note that fewer buses and trains run in the summer, when school is out.
Mr. Scannell charged that the Giuliani administration had reneged on a decades-old commitment, and was simply trying to deflect the blame it has taken for the announced end of the student passes. "I suspect that your tack now is that the best defense is a good offense," he said to Mr. Dyson.
Of the passes, Mr. Dyson said, "This is the political lever designed by the staff of this agency to pry more money out of the Governor and the Mayor."
Mr. Dyson's comments drew heated retorts from other board members, including Barry L. Feinstein, a Cuomo appointee, who accused the Deputy Mayor of pretending "that the subsidy that was taken away wasn't really taken away."
James Simpson, newly appointed by Mr. Pataki, called Mr. Dyson's logic "dangerous" and said that if students make up 20 percent of the riders, they should be thought of as accounting for 20 percent of the costs.
Another Cuomo appointee, Mr. Beal, said that Mr. Dyson was basing his conclusions on something "very different from the kind of economics I learned in college and in graduate school."

HEADLINE: A Modest Step to Save the Fish

 BODY:
It is hard to believe that at some point in the future there will not be enough fish in the sea for those countries that depend upon them for protein and for the fishermen who make their living from them. But the truth is that the world's fisheries are in poor shape. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, once an ardent booster of highly mechanized fleets that sweep up fish by the ton, now says that virtually every commercial fish species is either declining or at serious risk.
It took a long time and a lot of work by environmental organizations to get that fact across to the people who write the laws of the sea. But the truth has finally sunk in. Last Friday, after two years of protracted and bitter negotiations, delegates from 100 countries meeting under the auspices of the United Nations approved the first international treaty to regulate fishing on the high seas. 
 This is not a perfect treaty. For one thing, it provides real safeguards for only 20 percent of the ocean's fish stocks -- so-called "straddling" fish that migrate from coastal waters to the high seas. It does not cover the far greater volume of fishing that occurs in territorial waters within each country's 200-mile "exclusive economic zone." As the environmental group Greenpeace noted last week, there will still be "too many boats chasing too few fish."
Still, this was an action of signal importance, a rare moment of clarity, good will and common sense among international bureaucrats who often find it difficult to agree on anything.
For the 20 percent of the fish population covered, the treaty contains tough protection. It requires signatories to minimize the appalling waste generated by fishing fleets, which annually dump millions of tons of dead "bycatch" at sea. It also establishes enforcement procedures that will allow inspectors to board and search vessels. The inspectors could order the ships into port if they are found to be exceeding allowable quotas and using illegal gear -- nets or other equipment that do not fish "selectively" but instead sweep up all living things in their path, with colossal collateral damage to species like porpoises, sea turtles and whales.
There are three tasks left. The treaty will require ratification by at least 30 nations, a figure that seems within reach despite what is almost certain to be fierce parliamentary debate in the six countries -- Japan, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan and Poland -- that send their fleets deep into international waters and account for 90 percent of the world's catch on the high seas.
The second task is for individual countries to strengthen their own laws governing fishing practices within the sovereign, 200-mile limits -- the territorial waters not covered by the treaty. Although the United States Senate will almost surely approve the treaty, it could send a strong signal to other countries by also reforming the basic American law -- known as the Magnuson Act -- when it comes up for re-authorization later this year. As unemployed cod fishermen in New England and out-of-work halibut fishermen in Alaska can attest, this country does not excel in fish management.
Finally, governments everywhere should rethink their old but now discredited practice of bailing out bloated and overcapitalized fishing fleets. By U.N. estimates, fishermen lose about $20 billion each year despite worldwide sales of $70 billion. The difference is made up by government subsidies.
The U.N. conference has taken an important first step. But much remains to be done to end a self-defeating assault on an increasingly unsustainable resource.

Ready For the Last War

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
When you heard the Senate had voted to spend $1.5 billion to buy another Seawolf submarine you doubtless said to yourself, "The Seawolf -- isn't that the gigantic submarine built to keep the Soviet Union from conquering the free world?"
Then, unless I miss my guess, you said, "Sure it is, but hasn't the Soviet Union gone with the wind?" 
 If you are careful like me you thought to yourself, "I'd better check on that," and after doing just that you probably shouted: "By George, I thought so! The cold war is over, the Soviet Union is kaput, and the free world is safe at last."
Went to bed feeling terrific, didn't you? Maybe had a nightcap before turning in. "Just a little toddy to celebrate the end of the cold war," you probably said to a spouse.
Then you woke up at 3:30 A.M. Sat right up in bed. Remember what you wanted to yell? "Why are we spending $1.5 billion on a submarine to fight a defunct menace?"
For weeks you'd read about cutting. Cut spending for life's losers. Cut this, cut that. Cut, cut, cut. Cutting was chic. Great -- as long as they weren't cutting you. Great! So why buy a $1.5 billion submarine for a war that was over and won?
So you woke a sleeping spouse, saying, "I'm going to break down and cry." Probably babbled a little: "Superfluous sub. Defunct Soviet menace. One and one-half billion dollars."
And that calm spousal voice said, "If you'd read the newspapers, darling, all would be clear, for you would know that Senator Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, has said the Seawolf submarine 'will insure continued undersea superiority, a position the United States cannot give up.' "
Talk about making one thing perfectly clear! How right the Senator was. The United States must never yield undersea superiority to anyone. Suppose Qaddafi or Saddam or some ayatollah, some Captain Nemo in a tarboush was out there in the deep at this very moment with a submarine right out of Jules Verne.
We already have two Seawolf subs to stop him, but this third one with the $1.5 billion price tag -- hah, Qaddafi! -- you'll think long and hard now, my friend. After this you probably slept like $1.5 billion.
I'm not sure, though, that you're as humane as I am. Maybe you didn't wake up next morning as clear-headed and warm-hearted as I did. With night's fog lifted from my brain I clearly saw that the $1.5 billion Seawolf vote was not about submarines at all. It was about keeping working people from losing their jobs.
Building unnecessary submarines provides work for thousands of people in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Stop the Seawolf and all those families suffer. Like a lot of Pentagon spending these days, the Seawolf is a government make-work project.
In the Depression when Washington spent heavily to make jobs that might save families from despair, conservatives denounced this sort of thing as "boondoggling." It is the very essence of the big-hearted old New Deal in its assumption that government ought to try to help victims of its economic policies.
My question next morning, however, as I silently applauded the Senate's decision, was whether $1.5 billion couldn't buy us something more useful than a submarine.
For instance: I had just cut my hand trying to open a cardboard milk carton with a butcher knife. You know these milk cartons. "To open," they always say, "Push up here." Sometimes they open when pushed up there, often they don't, so you have to go in with cold steel and fingernails.
Surely an industry that can build those magnificent submarines can provide America with an easy-to-open cardboard milk container.
Another obvious need: My car has developed a sound suggesting the entire bottom is about to fall off, but its source is a mystery. These great New England sub builders, so wise in the art of sound detection, should easily be able to design and build a mysterious-car-noise detector which fits into an auto dashboard and instantly points to the exact location of any untoward sound.
Thousands of such useful industrial miracles ought to be rolling out of refitted defense plants where ingenuity and skill are now frittered away in boondoggles. Is the Government afraid that if it doesn't kill, America can't make it anymore?

HEADLINE: Loans for Microentrepreneurs Make Sense

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Grameen Bank has indeed been successful in having an impact on millions of families in Bangladesh by making available small amounts of capital to individuals ("Global Grass-Roots Banking," editorial, July 27). 
 Grameen has 2.1 million loans with the cumulative amount lent of more than $1.5 billion.
Your focus on "low interest rates" is important: Grameen charges 20 percent annually. This rate is substantially less than the 10 percent a month charged by village money lenders, but well above the commercial bank rate of 12 percent annually.
From previous work at Grameen and visits to more than 60 microfinance programs in 30 countries, it is clear that an interest rate that covers the full cost of doing business is essential to a successful, self-sustaining microfinance operation.
The cost per dollar for managing and collecting very small or "micro" loans is higher than the cost per dollar lent for larger loans.
For this reason, low-income entrepreneurs, especially women, can rarely access working capital from other than moneylenders, suppliers and pawnbrokers.
The borrowers we've met are concerned with quick, ongoing access to credit, and they are willing to pay its full cost.
Sustainable lending and savings programs provide microentrepreneurs the opportunity to be respected partners in development. This type of aid programming is well invested, and it works.

HEADLINE: Cost of G.O.P.'s Medicare Plan Draws Criticism

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
White House officials today contested Speaker Newt Gingrich's assertion that the Clinton Administration was trying to scare the elderly with false claims about Republican proposals to save money on Medicare.
The officials said the Republican plans would cost Medicare beneficiaries even more than they had originally estimated. 
 To make their case, the officials released an analysis by an executive branch agency, the Office of Management and Budget, that assessed a list of options prepared by House Republicans for trimming projected Medicare spending by $270 billion over the next seven years.
The budget office analyzed the savings that could be made through each option and found that $101 billion, or about 35 percent of the savings the Republicans sought, would come from reducing payments to hospitals and others providing health care.
About 65 percent of the savings would come from changes in the part of the program that pays for visits to doctors, according to the budget office analysis. These include such measures as increasing the Medicare deductible, now $100, that beneficiaries pay each year; raising it to keep up with inflation in medical costs, and increasing the Medicare premiums for people with higher incomes.
The Republicans had outlined $183.7 billion in such reductions, the White House said, or slightly more than needed to meet their overall savings goal.
White House officials said this amount of savings would mean that beneficiaries would shoulder more than half the cost-cutting, well more than the White House had assumed when it previously calculated that on average an elderly couple would pay an additional $5,650 more for medical services over the next seven years under the Republican budget.
"The facts show that the Republican plan will require massive cuts in benefits to the elderly," said George Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser to President Clinton. "Those are the facts, despite the Speaker's rhetoric."
A deputy press secretary for Mr. Gingrich, Lauren Sims, said she had not seen the budget office study and so could not respond to it.
With both parties recognizing that reductions in projected spending on Medicare are the most politically incendiary part of the Republican plan to balance the budget, Republicans and Democrats are each mounting advertising campaigns and holding town meetings on the issue during the Congressional recess.
On Monday, Mr. Gingrich delayed his own appearance at one such session in Atlanta when 100 trade unionists appeared in the hall to accuse him of seeking to cut the program to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. Later in the day, he returned to the hall to denounce Clinton Administration forecasts about how the elderly would be affected by Republican plans.
"In an Administration whose capacity for truth is highly limited," he said, "their recent effort to scare senior citizens, I think, is among the most despicable I have seen, and it is patently false."
While the Republicans have agreed to seek $270 billion in savings in Medicare, they do not intend to make public their plans for doing so until September.

HEADLINE: A Little-Known Candidate With a Big Issue

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

DATELINE: CLAREMONT, N.H.

 BODY:
Members of the New Hampshire Christian Coalition had been listening to Alan L. Keyes for almost 40 minutes when they began to nod and murmur, "Amen."
"In a society where you have a Christian community, you shouldn't need a welfare system," Mr. Keyes said. 
 "That's right," called a voice from the back of the room.
"There is a God, and we are not Him," Mr. Keyes continued. "That simple insight is, I think, the insight that is most fundamentally lost in our society."
"Yes!" another voice said.
"Let's look at this issue of abortion," Mr. Keyes went on. "Their pro-choice position is based on the notion that a woman has a choice. If she wants the baby, then it's human and she has to respect its life. And if she doesn't want it, it's not human and she doesn't have to respect it. We are placing that human choice in the place of God's authority. That means, my friends, that we are exercising authority in such a way as to cut the ground out from under our claim to be free."
"Amen!" someone responded.
Mr. Keyes, a former Reagan Administration official who is now the host of a radio talk show, is seeking the Republican nomination for President -- according to the party's research, the first black in the nation's history to do so. In a group of nine candidates -- several of them, like Representative Robert K. Dornan of California and Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana considered long-shots -- Mr. Keyes is usually ranked ninth.
But his relentless focus on abortion and what he calls moral issues has granted him an influence that far exceeds his expected vote tally.
"I think that Alan's presence in the race insures not only that there will be an abortion question in every debate, but that the other candidates won't be able to duck that question," said Bill Kristol, a Republican strategist and a friend of Mr. Keyes's from graduate school at Harvard University. "He makes life uncomfortable for the nominally pro-life candidates who aren't comfortable discussing the issue."
Many Republicans, who remember the damage done by the 1992 convention's focus on these social issues, believe that this kind of influence is exactly the sort that the party does not need. A few months ago, Mr. Keyes gave a luncheon speech to contributors to Gopac, the political action committee founded by Speaker Newt Gingrich, that led to a series of testy exchanges afterward. Several audience members suggested that his message could tear the party apart and cost it the White House in 1996.
Mr. Keyes, however, pronounces himself unfazed by such criticism and responds to it in a tone laden with contempt. "Elections are not about what we need or what the party thinks it needs," he said in an interview conducted in an aide's car during a furious New England thunderstorm. "Elections are about what this country needs. So I frankly don't care who thinks it's a problem. I'm going to talk about what I think is important to this country."
At the heart of Mr. Keyes's campaign is the proposition that problems that may seem diverse -- poverty, crime, out-of-wedlock births -- can all be traced to the same root cause: the breakdown of what he calls "the marriage-based, two-parent family." Often at public appearances, Mr. Keyes, 45 on Aug. 7, shows off his own "marriage-based" family: his wife, Jocelyn, and their three young children.
"It turns out we don't have many problems in America," he told the Christian Coalition gathering here in late July. "We have one problem that has many very expensive, very tragic consequences. Our family structure is eroding and some cases in a state of total collapse, and the result is a disaster for this entire society."
In response to these grave problems, Mr. Keyes advocates a variety of unorthodox measures. He recommends, for example, restricting subsidized mortgages to couples who have been married for several years. He favors a form of what he calls indentured servitude for men who father and then abandon children. And, for the most recalcitrant bachelor fathers, he proposes public paddling.
"I don't see any problems in having them have a little interview with some folks who have gone to Singapore to learn the delicate techniques for getting their attention," he said.
On the stump, Mr. Keyes liberally cites both the Bible and the Declaration of Independence, weaving theology and American history into one unified, if often idiosyncratic, political philosophy. He opposes abortion, for example, not only on religious grounds, but also because, he argues, it violates the principles set forth by the Founding Fathers.
"Literally, the whole abortion culture is really the culture of a concept of freedom based on selfishness," he said. "Our society's all about freedom. If we define that freedom wrongly then we have at the heart of this nation's existence corrupted the source of what we are. And downstream the river's going to be polluted if the source is poisoned."
Black and Catholic, Mr. Keyes is an unlikely candidate of the Christian right, a movement that is virtually all white and largely evangelical Protestant. Indeed, at this point, members of the Christian right appear to be divided over whom to support in 1996. Yet of the nine declared Republican candidates, Mr. Keyes has a platform that most closely mirrors theirs. Unlike Patrick J. Buchanan, whose agenda is crowded with a variety of issues, including free trade and immigration, Mr. Keyes's campaign is almost exclusively centered on the issues that the Christian right has championed: introducing school choice, giving communities more control over education, changing the tax code and outlawing abortion.
Probably the biggest boost Mr. Keyes's campaign has received came from James Dobson, host of the syndicated Christian radio show "Focus on the Family." Twice the show broadcast segments of a speech Mr. Keyes had delivered in February in New Hampshire. Mr. Dobson told listeners that he was so moved when he first heard the speech that he wept.
Mr. Keyes's eloquence is much talked about even among Republicans who are not planning to vote for him. "Alan Keyes has probably the best delivery of any speaker you will hear," said Richard Kennedy, a New Hampshire State Representative who is committed to Mr. Buchanan. "He makes Jesse Jackson sounds like he stutters."
An Army brat who grew up on bases around the United States and in Italy, Mr. Keyes has been championing conservative causes since adolescence. At 16, he became the first black elected president of the American Legion Boys Nation, delivering ringing pro-Vietnam War speeches.
As a freshman at Cornell University, Mr. Keyes studied with Allan Bloom, author of "The Closing of the American Mind." After black militants seized the student center in 1969, Mr. Keyes left Cornell, went to Paris for a year and then spent the better part of the next decade at Harvard, where he earned a doctorate in government.
Mr. Keyes was a functionary in the United States Embassy in India when he was discovered in the late 1970's by Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, who when she later became chief delegate to the United Nations brought him to New York as the Ambassador to the United Nations Economic and Social Council. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan appointed him Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, a position he used to become a leading spokesman for the Administration's opposition to economic sanctions on South Africa.
After quitting that post in 1987, Mr. Keyes ran for both of Maryland's United States Senate seats, and both times he was badly defeated. In his 1992 campaign against Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Mr. Keyes paid himself a salary of more than $8,000 a month from his campaign fund, a move that although legal was widely criticized. A few days before the election, Mr. Keyes accused Republican leaders of shortchanging his campaign because of his race, suggesting that the national party should bear some responsibility for his showing. He ended up with just 29 percent of the vote.
This time Mr. Keyes, who is an opponent of affirmative action programs, is avoiding most racial issues, saying his campaign transcends race.
Republican Party officials in Maryland, speaking on the condition of anonymity, recalled Mr. Keyes with a distinct lack of affection, and have for the most part stayed far away from his Presidential campaign.
Some Republican Party officials, indeed even some of Mr. Keyes's allies, suggest that he is running for President mainly to boost his name recognition and to promote his syndicated radio show, "America's Wake-Up Call."
Mr. Keyes, however, said he is running precisely to talk about the topics on which the Republican Party would prefer his silence.
"I think some elements -- big elements, I'm afraid -- of the party leadership were convinced by the post-1992 propaganda that somehow or another the Republican Party stance on the moral, social issues hurt us," he said. "Well, I think that's a lot of bunk."

HEADLINE: Vietnam's Budding Market: What Role for U.S.?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Aug. 7

 BODY:
The American flag finally flies in Hanoi now, over a new embassy that symbolizes the end of the argument in Washington over whether and when to recognize Vietnam. Hanoi, stultifying and lifeless just five years ago, is suddenly the new magnet for entrepreneurs seeking one of the few frontier cities left in Asia.
Gracious but decrepit French town houses are suddenly fetching prices in the millions, and already ads for Carrier air conditioners and Caterpillar tractors are popping up in villages that American pilots once bombed. 
 But as the visiting American delegation, led by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, discovered over the last few days, it is hardly a foregone conclusion that the logic of economic self-interest will now bind together once-bitter enemies.
A generation after the war ended, Washington is once again out to win the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese -- this time to persuade them to privatize their desperately inefficient state-run industries, allow free emigration, adopt labor policies assuring minimum rights of workers and create an independent legal system that will give foreign investors recourse to the courts. Without those steps, Mr. Christopher and his aides told Vietnam's leaders, Hanoi will get few of the economic benefits that it hoped would flow quickly from diplomatic recognition by the United States.
Clearly such requirements are already viewed as a threat to many in the Government here, whose leaders harbor dreams of transforming their country into a far larger version of Singapore: a booming free market, combined with strict political control.
Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Manh Cam, said on Saturday that the key to the new relationship between Washington and Hanoi would be "noninterference in each other's internal affairs." If they had not known before, Mr. Cam and his colleagues discovered in the last few weeks that American foreign policy has changed a lot since the days of the Vietnam War. With the cold war ended, Washington these days is far less concerned with domino theory than with deregulation and open markets, and that often means involving itself in a trading partner's economic and social policy.
So on Sunday, a day after signing the accord formally establishing diplomatic ties, Mr. Christopher was already beginning to lecture his hosts that nothing short of radical change in their domestic economy is needed to prosper in trade with the United States. "I would ask you to look at economic reform as a passage over a ravine," he said. "You cannot do it by taking several little steps; only one giant leap will get you across."
A senior Administration official involved in Asian policy said here the other day: "The hard part of the relationship is just beginning. I think the Vietnamese had a lot of expectations that after the political relationship was established, the floodgates would open. The reality is that it's going to be slow going, and we're concerned that their very high expectations could turn into a very negative reaction."
Vietnamese officials are already chafing that after an initial burst of enthusiasm, American companies, which have been permitted to invest here since February 1994, have only trickled in. To step up the pressure, they have begun conspicuously awarding contracts to non-American bidders, and the Vietnamese Communist Party chief, Do Muoi, just returned from a tour of Australia and New Zealand, which are actively seeking a slice of the market here.
The old Hanoi, a dour place that once seemed to lack the energy that marked Ho Chi Minh City, has been vanquished. A visitor here five years ago had a hard time finding anything open past the dinner hour. But this weekend, the streets were still jammed at 11 P.M. Small stores were selling compact disks and audio tapes -- almost all of them pirated copies, some being copied in clear view on hundreds of whirring tape decks -- along with Samsung microwave ovens and Sony televisions.
Five years ago, bicycles ruled the roads of Hanoi, making the Vietnamese capital one of the handful of Southeast Asian cities spared, chiefly by poverty, the choking pollution and unrelenting development that has overtaken places like Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur. The streets are now noisily alive with the roar of the Honda "Dream," a motor scooter that has become so popular on the streets here that it is almost a cliche.
"It's quite a snappy model," observed Mr. Christopher, not a man ordinarily known to enthuse about such things, after a tour of the city.
But Vietnamese officials understand that what they need is foreign investment, not imports. So while Mr. Christopher was raising flags and talking to college students over the weekend, the State Department's top economic official, Joan Spero, was holed up with Vietnam's powerful Chairman of State Planning, Do Quoc Sam, offering a quick rundown of how a country like Vietnam gets a credit rating and what it must do to meet Congressional requirements for preferential trade status.
"At one point he looked up from his pad and asked me, 'What about human rights?' " Ms. Spero recalled of her meeting with Mr. Sam. "He took a lot of notes -- no reaction, just copious notes."
Vietnamese officials are clearly eager to please on the regulatory requirements: Tax and investment laws are already being issued here so fast that no one seems quite certain what they say. Privatization of state industries is a far more complicated issue, because much of the political control over the country is based on the state ownership of factories, land and agricultural products. So instead of "privatization," Government officials here are using another term, "equitization." It suggests that they will sell some equity in the state industries, but retain majority control.
What Vietnam lacks today is the presence of anyone in the higher reaches of its Government with a working knowledge of international commerce. "We have been isolated for so long," a senior official of the Foreign Ministry said, "that we don't even have economists."
Vietnam's other problem is likely to be the Republican-controlled Congress in Washington. Getting a trade treaty passed -- the first step before any other significant agreements can be negotiated -- and securing most-favored-nation status for Vietnam will require Congressional approval.
Already, human rights advocates and others who say the Clinton Administration has played down Hanoi's continued repression of dissidents have begun pressing for inserting human rights requirements on any accord with Vietnam. Some in the House, in early votes on the Federal budget, have sought to deny funds to operate the United States Embassy in Hanoi, and Administration officials fear that it could take months to win confirmation of an American Ambassador to Vietnam.
Over the weekend, Mr. Christopher announced that he would appoint a longtime Asia hand in the State Department, Desaix Anderson, to act as charge d'affaires. Mr. Anderson, one of the department's leading Japan experts, speaks Vietnamese and was stationed in South Vietnam as an adviser at the height of the war. He later became the director of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodian affairs in Washington.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Doubts From Treasury Auction Cause the Dollar's Gains to Fade

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar pared its gains against the yen yesterday after disappointing results from a United States Treasury auction raised doubts about Japanese demand for the securities.
But the dollar was supported by continuing expectations that the German central bank would lower an interest rate today. 
 The dollar surged in early trading as traders bet that Japanese investors would buy large amounts of Treasury securities yesterday in the first of $42.5 billion in auctions this week. Such purchases would help the dollar because Japanese investors must sell yen to acquire the dollars necessary to buy United States bonds.
But the average yield on $18 billion of three-year notes at the auction was 5.997 percent, at the high end of expectations. Prices and yields move in opposite directions.
Jim Phoenix, vice president of currency sales at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in New York, noted how the dollar "had a good rush up first thing this morning" but lost some strength later in the day.
"You could blame that on the three-year auction," he said. "There was not a great bid-to-cover ratio." That ratio -- bids received divided by securities sold -- was 2.09 in the auction yesterday, compared with a ratio of 2.6 for the previous 10 note auctions. The low ratio spurred speculation that Japanese investors were reluctant to invest in American bonds.
After touching a high of 91.90 yen yesterday, the dollar settled at 91.49 yen in late New York trading, still up from 91.30 yen on Monday.
The dollar edged up to 1.4082 marks, from 1.4070 marks on Monday. Many currency traders expect that the Bundesbank will cut its 14-day repurchase rate today. Lower interest rates hurt a currency by making bank deposits denominated in it less attractive.
"There is a good chance in the mind of the market that the Bundesbank will do something on rates this week," said Richard Vullo, manager of currency sales for Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank in New York.
The Bundesbank last reduced the repo rate on June 7, to 4.50 percent from 4.51 percent.
The policy-making council of the Bundesbank will meet tomorrow, after a four-week vacation, and some market participants speculate that it will cut the discount rate, which serves as the floor for German money-market rates. The discount rate was last reduced on March 30, to a six-year low of 4 percent, from 4.50 percent.

HEADLINE: Lackluster Treasury Refunding Takes Spark Out of Stocks

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Stocks wound up on the fence yesterday, with the market focusing for much of the day on the disappointing start of the Treasury Department's quarterly refunding.
"The Dow was flirting with 4,700 at one point," said Edward Nicoski, managing director of Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. "But as it became apparent that the refunding would not go that well -- and it did not -- equities came down with it." 
 Traders were hoping that there would be strong demand from Japanese investors during yesterday's auction of three-year Treasury notes, which would have pushed down yields. But the price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose just 2/32 , with its yield barely off to 6.88 percent, from 6.89 percent on Monday.
"The recent upward move in interest rates could very well be signaling a hiatus, at least, in the 1995 bull move," said David Shulman, chief equity strategist of Salomon Brothers. "Without bond market support, stocks will find it difficult to maintain their upward momentum."
The Dow Jones industrial average finished unchanged -- the second time in less than three weeks -- at 4,693.32. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inched up 0.36 point, to 560.39, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.90 points, to 997.12.
Declines on the New York Stock Exchange narrowly exceeded advances, 1,156 to 1,015. Trading was quiet again, as Big Board turnover amounted to 306.1 million shares, compared with 277.1 million shares on Monday.
One of the strongest sectors yesterday was biotechnology stocks. The group was spurred by a report of a smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss by Cephalon, which was aided by a payment from Chiron, its collaborator on a new drug that recently completed a successful trial.
Cephalon advanced 3 1/4, to 27 1/4, and Chiron gained 113/16 , to 77 5/8. In addition, Amgen rose 3 1/4, to 87 5/8, and Biogen increased 1 1/4, to 47 1/4.
Technology issues moved higher for the third consecutive day. Intel closed at 64 3/4, up 1 1/4; Micron Technology closed at 59 1/8, up 1 1/8; Adobe Systems closed at 59 1/4, up 2, and National Semiconductor closed at 26 3/4, up 3/4.
Disappointing earnings from the Limited Inc. and other retailers raised concern about slowing consumer spending. Shares of the Limited fell 1, to 19 1/4. Lands' End Inc. declined 1/4, to 15 1/8, and Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse fell 1/4, to 13 1/8. But shares of Ann Taylor rose 1 7/8, to 21 7/8, even though the company reported a larger-than-expected quarterly loss.
Energy stocks continued downward. Mobil fell 7/8, to 95 1/2; Chevron, 3/4, to 49, and Texaco, 5/8, to 65.
Profit taking helped to depress the automobile issues. General Motors closed at 48, down 3/8, and Chrysler closed at 50 1/2, down 3/4. Ford was unchanged at 29.
Oxford Health Plans rose 1 7/8, to 51 1/2, after reporting a 90 percent jump in earnings for the second quarter. And Osborn Communications increased 2, to 11, following news that it had received a waiver of the Federal Communications Comission's cross-ownership rules.
On the other hand, Railtex plunged 7 3/4, to 21 1/2, on an announcement of lower-than expected second-quarter profits. And Novacare slumped 1, to 8, on problems in its contract therapy unit, as well as lower-than-expected net income.

Poorly Bid Note Auction Proves Drag on U.S. Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The Treasury's auction for three-year notes was poorly bid yesterday, dashing hopes that a recent easing of Japanese investment regulations would spur greater interest in United States Government securities.
The market -- which had played up these expectations days before the auction -- showed its disappointment by selling off much of its earlier gains once the results were made known, to end little changed. 
 Traders said yesterday's auction, the first leg of the Treasury's $42.5 billion three-part quarterly refunding, was supposed to be the easiest.
Most market participants had expected the three-year auction to go well and set the tone for the remainder of the refunding. Instead, the average yield on $18 billion of three-year notes at the auction was 5.997 percent, at the high end of expectations, with prices at the low end. Now it looks as if the real key test for the market may be the harder-to-sell 10-year notes today and 30-year bonds tomorrow.
In an effort to weaken the yen, the Japanese Government introduced a package of measures last week meant to encourage investment abroad. When Japanese institutions invest in foreign securities and assets, they must sell yen and buy dollars and other currencies, weakening the Japanese currency. By easing foreign investment, the Government hoped to push down the yen, whose strength has hurt the Japanese economy.
Among other things, the measures allowed Japanese banks to take more aggressive positions in foreign exchange trading; made it easier for insurance companies to make loans denominated in yen and other currencies; eased accounting rules on foreign bonds held by Japanese companies, thereby providing an incentive to buy more such bonds, and removed restrictions on the purchase of Euroyen bonds by Japanese institutions.
But as some have come to realize, the package was not an order for Japanese investors to buy United States Treasury securities.
Theodore Ake, Government trading manager at Kemper Securities in Chicago, said the auction also did not have the hoped-for retail participation.
Mr. Ake said the "cover" -- the ratio of bids to actual purchases -- at yesterday's auction was 2.09, less than an average auction. Also the noncompetitive bids, a gauge of retail participation, was low. "It showed there wasn't interest in this auction from anybody other than the street," Mr. Ake said.
"The market did not get the widespread demand, nor the Japanese buyers it expected," he said. "It makes you wonder about how much interest there will be in the 10-year note auction. That is going to be a tougher sale."
He said the market was completely focused on the auction and did not react to any of the reports released yesterday, including productivity and the Johnson Redbook report on retail activity.
The 30-year bond rose 2/32 of a percentage point, to a price of 109 11/32 ; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, was 6.88 percent, down from Monday's 6.89 percent. Traders said the price had been up as much as 11/32 during the session, for a yield of 6.86 percent.
Thomas E. Donne, vice president and a senior portfolio manager of the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said the Japanese did do some overnight buying. "Rumor had it that some insurance companies had bought a fairly sizable amount, to the tone of a couple of billion dollars," he said.
Furthermore, Eric Hamilton, senior fixed-income analyst for Technical Data in Boston, said the market started off the session with strong Japanese buying in the three-year notes for nearly $1 billion, forcing short-covering in shorter maturities in the morning. "But it was a different story at midafternoon," he said. "The low bid-to-cover ratio was an indication among other things that not too many investors, Japanese, or otherwise, showed for the actual bidding."
He said today's auction of 10-year notes could come under selling pressure. Despite the disappointment over less Japanese buying than expected, the Japanese are still definitely part of the equation.
Elsewhere, in the municipal bond market, relatively high yields on some of yesterday's $1.7 billion in new issues helped attract investors, traders said, so prices then rose.
The heavy supply of new issues is seen as the reason behind the rise in yields. Investors are pulling money from tax-exempt bond funds and being attracted to investments elsewhere.
Yesterday's largest offering was a $746.9 million revenue bond issue by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. The bonds, which are tax-exempt at the Federal level and in most states, are triple tax-exempt for residents of New York City. They were priced through Bear, Stearns for a maximum yield of about 6.283 percent for a bond due in 2025.
For shorter-maturity issues, yields on serial bonds ranged from 3.90 percent in 1996 to 6.10 percent in 2012. Other long-bond yields included 6.20 percent for a bond due in 2015 and about 6.282 percent in 2021. The bond offering is rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A- by Standard & Poor's, except for issues due in 1999 through 2007, which are insured by the Municipal Bond Investor's Assurance Corporation and rated triple-A.
The day's second-largest sale was a $483.5 million water and sewer system revenue bond issue by the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority, which was priced through underwriters led by Paine Webber, with a maximum yield of 6.21 percent for a bond due in 2025. Shorter maturity serial bonds were priced to yield from 3.90 percent in 1996 to 5.60 percent in 2007, with other yields on long issues at 6.35 percent in 2023, 6.30 percent in 2020 and 5.85 percent in 2009.
Underwriters said the issue was rated A- by S.& P., and that they expected a single-A rating from Moody's.

HEADLINE: Journey to Hanoi

 BODY:
Twenty years after the fall of Saigon and one month after President Clinton established diplomatic relations with Hanoi, Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to Vietnam last weekend was an important step in the painful process of reconciliation. Mr. Christopher set just the right tone on a journey he said he had long hoped to make.
There would normally be nothing unusual about a Secretary of State visiting the capital of an East Asian country of 70 million people that eagerly courted American investment and was a leading military power in a region made nervous by recent Chinese belligerence. In this case, no United States Secretary of State had ever gone to Hanoi before. 
 The President's decision to open an American Embassy in Hanoi, which was the formal occasion for Mr. Christopher's trip, serves national interests and was long overdue. But it remains opposed by some Republicans in Congress, who now stubbornly threaten to withhold funds for operating the new embassy.
Veterans' groups worry that Washington may slacken its efforts to learn more about Americans missing in action since the Vietnam War. Human rights groups are nervous that the Administration is getting too cozy with one of the world's few remaining Communist police states.
Mr. Christopher used his principal public speech in Vietnam to address these legitimate concerns. He reminded his audience of young Vietnamese foreign service trainees that determining the fate of missing Americans remains Washington's primary concern with Hanoi and that continued progress on this issue will be the key to a closer relationship.
On human rights, he insisted on a formal government-to-government dialogue, and appealed positively to Vietnamese self-interest, pointing out that economic growth is usually smoothest when accompanied by the rule of law and creative freedom. Directly addressing the young Vietnamese before him, he defined America's ideal of freedom and human rights with simple eloquence. "Each of you," he said, "ought to have the right to help shape your country's destiny, as well as your own."
In separate meetings with government officials, his aides pointedly noted that many of the special economic benefits Vietnam seeks from the United States, including preferential trade status and subsidized loans, depend by law on human rights performance.
Hanoi's culture of political repression is deeply entrenched. Foreign companies have found their activities plagued by bureaucracy, copyright piracy and an unreliable legal system. For these and other reasons, diplomatic and economic relations between America and Vietnam are unlikely to progress as rapidly or smoothly as Vietnamese authorities hope. But Mr. Christopher has gotten them off to a sound and principled start.

HEADLINE: Senator Dole's Welfare Defeat

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole withdrew his welfare bill from the Senate floor yesterday, unable to muster enough support for passage. That is fortunate because the Dole bill would have made the welfare system, with all its flaws, markedly worse. Mr. Dole's retreat could allow for a better bill in September -- but only if President Clinton takes a decisive stand to shape its contents.
The Dole bill is better than the harshly punitive measures already passed by the House and proposed in the Senate by Phil Gramm, whose Presidential ambitions depend on attracting the party's hard-core conservatives. Yet Mr. Dole's bill is bad enough. It would end a 60-year Federal commitment to increase aid for states with rising poverty. It would allow states to stop spending their own money on the poor. It would allow states to strip benefits from unwed teen-age parents and legal immigrants. It threatens innocent children yet does little to put dysfunctional parents to work. 
 Come September, Mr. Dole might be able to marshal 51 votes for a welfare bill. If not, he has threatened to wrap welfare provisions into a large "reconciliation" package that would also include changes to other entitlement programs and the tax code. That tactic might pick up the extra votes Mr. Dole needs but would prevent consideration of welfare reform alone on its merits.
Mr. Clinton needs to inject himself into this debate, but his increasingly callow statements give cause for alarm. Key advisers are warning against a veto that could taint him as a foe of welfare reform during the 1996 campaign. In recent statements Mr. Clinton appears more intent on assuring Mr. Dole that they can reach compromise along lines dictated by the Senator than on acknowledging that the Dole bill trashes the principles Mr. Clinton set out in his election campaign.
Rather than reassurance, the White House needs to wield its veto weapon, which on this issue the G.O.P. probably cannot overcome. The President needs to designate provisions in the Dole bill that will guarantee a veto. He could insist that Congress preserve the entitlement status of food stamps so that no poor people go hungry. He could insist that poor parents get help paying for child care so they can afford to go to work. He can insist that Congress cut aid to states that reduce spending on the poor or knock enrollees off the welfare rolls rather than find them jobs.
President Clinton knows that the country already has a good welfare law, which he helped write. But Congress has never put enough money behind the 1988 Family Support Act to make it work. States that have experimented under the law with welfare-to-work programs have produced modest reductions in welfare dependency, which is better than anything the Dole bill could yield. The truth is that welfare-to-work is enormously expensive and, by cutting Federal aid, the G.O.P. plans almost certainly will not succeed in putting the poor to work.
Mr. Clinton can do more than acquiesce in the weakening of welfare. He must become at least as boisterous in defense of his principles as Mr. Gramm is of his.

Brazil Looks North From Trade Zone in Amazon

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: MANAUS, Brazil

 BODY:
Years ago, the black-and-white photograph undoubtedly drew chuckles from business executives in Brazil's industrial south. Gathered under a banner hailing the Amazon's new duty-free industrial zone, perspiring men stood solemnly in a freshly bulldozed jungle clearing in front of a thatched hut.
Today, no one is laughing. 
 Last year, 300 factories in the Manaus Free Zone manufactured a record $10 billion in products and the area has become South America's largest producer of products like motorcycles, television sets and videocassette recorders. The Honda Motor Company's motorcycle plant here is the company's largest, helping make the zone the biggest industrial complex between Caracas and Sao Paulo.
Brazil is moving north aggressively, taking advantage of a reluctance in the United States to broadly expand the North American Free Trade Agreement.
With Brazilian diplomats working overtime to negotiate trade pacts with its northern neighbors, Manaus is expected to emerge as an export platform for Brazil's conquest of markets in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Central America.
Seeing the export potential, the Samsung Group of South Korea plans to start producing television sets and audio equipment here in September, its first foray into Brazil. Another huge Korean corporation, Daewoo, is studying a plan to build television tubes, a project that could involve an investment as great as $250 million. And Sony is expanding its production here of consumer electronics.
Although recent high interest rates have reduced Brazilian consumer spending, Manaus benefited from the Government's successful move against inflation a year ago. Breaking records last year, factories here produced half a million microwave ovens, a million tape players, and five million color television sets. In the first automotive venture, Mitsubishi Motors has started to assemble pickup trucks.
Already, Manaus has Brazil's second-busiest air cargo terminal, after Sao Paulo, the nation's largest city. Strengthening air links with the Andes will be easy. Manaus is closer to Caracas, Bogota, Quito and Lima than to Sao Paulo, near the Atlantic coast. And to further promote regional trade, work is starting here on what is to be South America's largest customs warehouse -- a 237,000-square-foot enclosure and showroom.
The free-trade zone, which had been protected by Brazil's import barriers, went through a severe crisis when tariffs began falling radically five years ago. About 80 factories closed here, including subsidiary operations of Bosch, Ericsson, Westinghouse and Thomson. Employment dropped in half in 1992. Duty-free tourism collapsed as shoppers from southern Brazil either stayed home or flew to Miami.
But many corporations remained and sought to raise productivity levels to world standards. They invested in automation, cut payrolls and adopted more efficient manufacturing techniques.
Productivity gains have translated into price cuts. Over the last five years, average prices of videocassette recorders have fallen to $300 from $1,000, color television sets to $380 from $780, faxes to $360 from $2,500, and 18-speed bicycles to $180 from $500.
"In 1992 we almost closed. Today we are producing twice as much with less than half the number of employees," said Cristovao Marques Pinto, resident director of BASF da Amazonia S.A, a subsidiary of the big German chemical and pharmaceutical group. In the last year, BASF has closed tape factories in Germany and the United States. It now exports tapes from here to Europe, Latin America and the United States.
To open the way to international trucking, state governments are paving a 375-mile gap in a road that will link the landlocked Brazilian states of Amazonas and Roraima with Venezuela. Rains now often render this long gravel stretch impassable for weeks.
Once that bottleneck in this 1,100-mile international highway is paved, probably at the end of next year, Manaus will be a four-day trip by truck from Venezuela's Caribbean ports. Long cut off from the outside world by hundreds of miles of rain forest, the efficient industrial complex here will be within striking range of Andean, Caribbean and Central American markets.
"The highway is going to open the Caribbean market to products from the Free Zone," Amazonino Mendes, the state governor of Amazonas, said in an interview. "It will be the economic redemption of Amazonas."
For the moment, about 98 percent of the zone's production is sold in Brazil. Manaus, traditionally isolated from its neighbors, exported twice as much to Singapore last year as to Venezuela.
"We are going to save a lot of time," said Nelson Azevedo dos Santos, director of Moto Honda da Amazonia. "We already export to the Caribbean, but we are forced to go through Santos," he said, referring to Sao Paulo's port, now 10 days from here by truck and boat. It costs more to ship a ton of cargo from Manaus to Santos than from Japan.
With assembly lines here paying wages on a level with Mexican plants on the Texas border, executives believe that the paved road will make the industrial zone a strong player in regional trade.
Otto Fleck, executive director of a local industry association, said of the state governor's promise to pave the road, "If Amazonino does not come through on this, he will not be elected to anything again."

Who Lost The Arts?

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH; Thomas L. Friedman is on vacation.

 BODY:
What if Barbra Streisand had not defended the National Endowment for the Arts at Harvard? What if Bill Clinton had defended the N.E.A. as vociferously as he did public broadcasting? What if Christopher Reeve, the most driven celebrity lobbyist for the arts, had not fallen from his horse? What if Time had run Robert Hughes's take-no-prisoners defense of Federal arts funding on its cover before rather than after the crucial Congressional votes? What if Melanie Griffith had not only lobbied Newt Gingrich but accepted a pouting-sex-kitten role in the screen version of his novel?
Now that Congress has almost gutted the Arts and Humanities Endowments -- in the House's case cutting their budgets by up to 40 percent and setting a two-year deadline for the N.E.A.'s extinction -- it's fair to ask: Did this drama have to reach this dire climax? An informal survey of some on the barricades suggests that while the battle to save the N.E.A. was often scattershot, the agency never stood a chance once it became the designated scourge of the religious right. 
 There were some heroes, including, arguably, Ms. Griffith; the literary fellowships she defended to the Speaker may be the only individual grants to survive the purge. Among others who made a difference: Isaac Stern, an energetic lobbyist; Jodie Foster, who made a public-service announcement, and Michael Greene, the music-industry executive who turned the Grammy Awards show into an N.E.A. jamboree.
But George Searchinger, a documentary film maker, had a real point when he wrote a letter to The Times last month asking, "Where are the television network leaders, the movie moguls, the opera impresarios, the great commentators now that we need them?" The powerful TV and movie industry barons whose products are often made by N.E.A. alumni were too apathetic to speak up. Press commentary on the N.E.A., especially on Sunday TV talk shows, was often scant and flip, as if the only thing at stake were the future of chamber music.
Robert Bennett, a conservative Utah Republican who was among those trying to improve the N.E.A.'s lot in the Senate yesterday, says that classy cultural icons might have made the case on the Hill better than flashy Hollywood stars associated with liberal causes. But such figures were only intermittently mobilized. The arts world has its advocacy groups, but it is too poor and compartmentalized to create a focused Washington presence to match the National Rifle Association.
And what about all those Republican fat cats who sit on the boards of N.E.A.-funded institutions? The president of the Metropolitan Museum, William Luers, who joined with blue-chip business and cultural leaders to form Americans United to Save the Arts and Humanities, found that in the end "not enough of them had the courage to call Newt on this."
The dispirited Mr. Luers, like others I spoke to, also soon discovered that the endowments' fate was not tied to "a rational, intelligent debate over what the arts and humanities do" in any case. No argument -- esthetic, economic, educational or even patriotic -- could save the N.E.A. as long as it was on the religious right's hit list.
You need only read the American Family Association's fund-raising letters to see that the assault on the N.E.A. was never about the Federal role in the arts or the budget; the agency was merely a symbolic target. The actual targets? It's not happenstance that virtually every artist demonized in such mailings is either black, gay or outspokenly female -- or better still, some combination thereof -- even if that requires digging up artists long gone and never directly funded by the N.E.A., like the undying Robert Mapplethorpe.
Now that the endowment is on life support, the Republican leadership can cut to the chase and go after the religious right's real nemeses rather than the tiny agency scapegoated as their surrogate. Indeed, that's already happening, as Congress's newly passed abortion restrictions and the far-right tilt of the welfare-reform debate attest.
Given the enormous wealth and power of the real forces arrayed against it, you can only marvel that the N.E.A. is even standing. And you can only thank those arts advocates, however outgunned, who served as the first line of defense against an intolerant social revolution that will soon engulf us all.

HEADLINE: Worker Productivity Up, Costs Down, U.S. Reports

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
Growth in worker productivity accelerated during the second quarter as more goods were produced with fewer workers, the Labor Department said today.
Labor costs moderated, helping keep inflation under control. And the average number of hours worked fell by the largest amount in 15 years as businesses shed jobs. 
 "Computers have replaced people in a lot of jobs," from switchboard operators to assembly line workers, Astrid Adolfson, an economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York, said. "Plus people who have jobs are working harder."
Productivity, which measures the time, effort and cost of providing goods and services, increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3 percent in the second quarter, faster than the revised pace of 2.5 percent in the first quarter. The gain in the first quarter was initially reported as 2.7 percent. The productivity data do not include the farm sector.
Increases in productivity gains are essential for businesses to hold down prices and stay competitive. As labor costs remain in check, companies are able to absorb higher material and production costs without passing them on to their customers by investing in technology.
The Labor Department report showed that unit labor costs, which account for about two-thirds of overall business costs, rose six-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter after increasing 1.6 percent in the first quarter. Hourly wages adjusted for inflation rose two-tenths of 1 percent after increasing 1 percent in the previous three months.
Worker output increased at a pace of six-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, well below a gain of 4.5 percent in the first quarter. The number of hours worked decreased 2.4 percent, the largest drop since the second quarter of 1980, as companies dismissed or furloughed employees. In the first quarter, hours worked rose 2 percent.
On the inflation front, the implicit price deflator, a measure of price increases tied to the productivity report, rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter after climbing 1.3 percent in the first quarter.
"The labor market isn't really adding to inflation; in fact, it's just the opposite," said Dan Friel, a senior economist at Nationsbanc Capital Markets Inc. in Charlotte, N.C.
Still, the Labor Department said unit nonlabor payments, which include such items as taxes and rental payments, climbed 1.3 percent in the second quarter after increasing seven-tenths of 1 percent in the first quarter.
In a separate report today, figures released by the Commerce Department showed that unsold goods continued to pile up at wholesalers' warehouses during June, suggesting manufacturers must further reduce production. The biggest buildups were in big-ticket goods like automobiles and furniture, where demand has been sluggish.

HEADLINE: Bank Study Says Consumer Fees Soar

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
Many fees consumers pay for checking and savings accounts rose more than twice the rate of inflation in the last two years, a period when banks racked up record profits, a study released today said.
The United States Public Interest Research Group compared fees of 271 banks in 25 states and the District of Columbia with a similar study of 23 states the consumer group performed in 1993. The group said its survey included 37 percent of the country's 300 largest banks and 41 percent of the total deposits in commercial banks. 
 "The bankers still have their hands buried deep in our wallets," said Ed Mierzwinski, a co-author of the study.
These were among the study's findings for the years from 1993 to 1995:
*The annual cost for an interest- bearing, or N.O.W., checking account rose by 11 percent, to $219. Monthly maintenance fees rose 14 percent, to $8.64. By contrast, the inflation rate during the study period, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, gained 5.5 percent.
*For regular checking accounts, the annual cost rose 10 percent, to $202, while monthly maintenance fees rose 22 percent, to $7.11.
*Average monthly balance requirements, which consumers must meet to avoid annual checking fees, rose 30 percent, to $1,242.
*The cost of no-frills checking accounts rose 6 percent to $144 a year.
*Automatic teller machine costs rose 6 percent, to $1.01 for local networks, and by 7 percent, to $1.18 for national networks.
The study found that Maryland has the highest annual regular checking account fees in the nation at $222, 10 percent above the national average of $202. Hawaii, Idaho, New Mexico, Maine and Washington state were among the lowest.
Virginia Stafford, spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association, criticized previous surveys by the group as biased toward large banks.

HEADLINE: AT WORK WITH: The Art Guys;
In Performance: Life Imitates Art Imitating Life

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
MEET the Art Guys. Here in Houston, it's impossible not to.
There they were one recent day, working as clerks for 24 hours straight at the Stop N Go convenience store in Houston's museum district. They sold lottery tickets. They asked for patience when a customer couldn't get the gas pump to work and neither could they. "Hey, we're new at this," said Michael Galbreth, an Art Guy. They mopped the floor. 
 And they called it art.
The Art Guys are part Dada, part David Letterman, pushing the concept of performance art to the outer limits. Or maybe they're a cross between John Cage and the Smothers Brothers. Whatever. "That's the beginning and the end of the argument 'Is it art?' " said Jack A. Massing, the other Art Guy. "Well, yeah, it is -- because I'm an artist and I made it. So it is."
Groups from the National Endowment for the Arts to the Shell Oil Company Foundation seem to agree: last spring they supported "The Art Guys: Think Twice," a retrospective exhibition of the Guys' 13-year collaboration, at the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston.
In the exhibition's catalogue, Lynn M. Herbert, the museum's associate curator, placed the Art Guys "within a continuum larger than just art history": the history of jesters or fools.
"Historically, fools were employed by a royal court or a household," Ms. Herbert wrote. "Their role was to provide their masters with humorous entertainment, which more often than not commented upon the politics and social mores of the day. The tradition lives on today; fools have simply been modernized to adapt to changing times."
The Art Guys' 24-hour shtick is not new. They once commemorated the winter solstice by spending the entire day in a booth at a Denny's restaurant just off Interstate 10 here, sipping coffee and eating scrambled eggs.
"This is definitely dining, and that was our intent," Mr. Galbreth deadpanned before a news camera crew, one of several news organizations that, as often happens with the Art Guys, showed up to cover their event.
"This isn't performance," Mr. Massing said. "This is behavior."
Back in the studio, the news anchor said during a news broadcast that the whole thing reminded him of an Off Broadway play he saw, one that basically involved watching a typical family just carry out their lives on the stage.
"That was it," the anchor said to a colleague. "They were just there, living, and you went and watched them. It was the only play I could get tickets to."
Mr. Massing, 36, said the anchor's comment was actually "quite brilliant" -- Mr. Galbreth, 39, called it "sophisticated" -- because it went to the heart of what the Art Guys are about. Anybody can get tickets to the Art Guys. Whether they want them or not.
In a recent performance piece called "Art Guys Blow Through Town," the pair moved through Houston with leaf blowers. To some, the work may have only conjured up the essential absurdity of leaf blowers, which often seem to be used to blow debris from one yard to another and back again.
Looked at another way, though, the act was a literal sweep through Houston's ethnic mosaic: from the Hispanic East End to Chinatown and Little Vietnam, to the largely black, largely poor Fourth Ward to very white, very wealthy white River Oaks. And maybe the blower represented an artistic appeal for a little more intermingling of much more than leaves.
The Art Guys held a book signing at the Brazos Bookstore, but because they have never written a book, they signed other authors' books instead. In a piece called "Driving Two Cars to Galveston," Mr. Massing did drive two cars 61 miles to Galveston, driving one several hundred feet, then getting out, running back to the other and driving that one several hundred feet, then returning to the first car, and so on. It took a day and a half, and he sprained his foot.
The Art Guys do produce art that can be viewed in a museum -- elaborate sculptures made from things like pennies and nonprescription drug capsules and carrots and Pringles potato chips. Some of their work clearly borders on the obsessive, like "1,000 Coats of Paint," a seven-month project in which they painted a baseball, a toothbrush, a teddy bear, a computer keyboard and several other objects 1,000 times each.
They are also pyromaniacs. For the opening of last spring's show at the Contemporary Arts Museum, they assembled designs made up of thousands of wooden matches glued to a gallery wall like dominoes arranged on a floor. Ann W. Richards, the former Governor, lighted the first match while hundreds of onlookers watched, many wondering aloud if the whole place was about to burn down.
"Listen, children, don't do this," Ms. Richards warned the younger members of her audience. "Don't do this. This is crazy. They are crazy." One by one, the matches flared and then burned out, leaving singed designs on the wall. The building survived. The Art Guys had done it before.
Still, they are best known for their performance art -- or, in many instances, endurance art. Some of it is best explained verbatim from the catalogue accompanying videos of their acts: "The Art Guys field sports questions from the audience, then lie down on suspended boards wearing drum major hats. As their heads collide, they crack a suspended egg that falls into a frying pan. A television plays the Home Shopping Network as a soundtrack repeats the name Kiki Vandeweghe" (a former professional basketball player).
It is possible, of course, that the Art Guys are more con artists than artists. Texas Monthly magazine rather huffily dismissed them several years ago as "shameless promoters of themselves and their creations, which makes them the Home Shopping Network of the Texas art world." They even have a popular bumper sticker: "Visualize the Art Gize."
But the Art Guys defend their work: It's accessible. It's democratic. "There's been some sort of breakdown between the artist and society," said Mr. Galbreth, a tall, lanky man with a shock of dark hair. He met Mr. Massing in 1982 while they were studying with the sculptor James Surls at the University of Houston.
"It's easy to overintellectualize things" and to be obscure, Mr. Galbreth said, "saying: 'Well, you don't understand me. You don't understand my work.' Whose fault is that? I think it's possible to engage the intelligentsia but at the same time not lose everybody else."
The Art Guys insist that the things they do, however absurd at first glance, have a point. The day at Denny's, for instance, represented an attempt to contrast a celebration of the solstice with the elaborate ceremonies of ancient civilizations whose lives revolved around the harvest and intense knowledge of the rhythms of nature. Or so said Mr. Galbreth.
"This is how we get our harvest today," Mr. Galbreth explained. "It comes right to your table. It comes right to your table 24 hours a day, if you want it. It's totally artificial."
Mr. Massing added: "Then the question becomes, why are we doing this? Why are we building these restaurants, and why are we keeping them open 24 hours a day? What's the deal?"
At the Stop N Go here, customers filed in and out all day. Some were impressed. "Drawing, sketching -- that's not the only thing artists can do," said Larry Green, an unemployed man who was scavenging for aluminum cans in the trash bins as Mr. Galbreth came out to pump gas. "Maybe these guys are a new type of artist."
Others were not impressed. "I just wanted to get some beer," said Oscar Gomez, a carpenter, who bought a 12-pack of Miller Lite and a large bag of Lay's potato chips from Mr. Massing. "That's not art."
In the catalogue, Ms. Herbert described the milieu of the Art Guys as "a fool's paradise -- the nebulous and convoluted world of contemporary art."
"Amidst the hue and cry of 'My kid could do that!' and 'You call that art?,' who better to jump into the fray than the Art Guys?" she added.
The Art Guys say their mission is not to send messages or make statements, but to ask questions. "Our work is not didactic," Mr. Galbreth said. "We're in the world with everybody else and we put ourselves in absurd situations, and they open up intellectual doors. And once you really start investigating the issue of absurdity, that gets very complex."

HEADLINE: Welfare Rules Created for Cities Cause Trouble in the Countryside

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: FRIENDSHIP, N.Y.

 BODY:
This region of cornfields and shale-encrusted hills near the Pennsylvania border once seeped with wealth in the form of crude oil. Now the very same hills conceal pockets of poverty and welfare dependency.
In this town where oil barons lived in splendor 100 years ago, today an estimated 1 in 6 households is on welfare and 1 in 4 is poor, about the same percentages as in Brooklyn. 
 Yet amid this year's vigorous push in Albany to change the state's welfare rules, there was little discussion of the problems that afflict the rural poor. The debate focused almost entirely on one thing: reducing welfare costs in big cities.
But the way poor people here tell it, in tightening the rules, the Legislature created hurdles that are far higher for country people than for the urban poor. Paradoxically, upstate Republicans whose main goal was to curb what they considered runaway welfare fraud and abuse in New York City were the ones who championed those changes.
In one major revision, able-bodied adults will start losing their welfare benefits this summer if they cannot demonstrate that they have got in touch with five different employers a week, with no repeats in a month.
But in many mountain towns, welfare recipients might not find 20 employers within a 30-square mile area. So meeting the rule could prove impossible, for here, unlike in New York City, one of the biggest challenges for people trying to get off welfare is transportation.
"That's an onerous requirement for some of our folks, because of a lack of job openings and the lack of means to travel," said Joan Sinclair, director of social services for Allegany County.
New rules enacted into law this year will also impose tougher penalties on welfare recipients who miss even one day of their public work programs, known as workfare. One unexcused absence can lead to a 90-day suspension of benefits; four such absences can cause expulsion from welfare.
Welfare workers and recipients said those penalties, too, are likely to fall more heavily on rural people who, because of undependable transportation, are more apt to miss work, or appointments at welfare offices.
"It stinks," said Sharon DeBarge, a welfare recipient. "What are us people in rural areas supposed to do, if you don't have a license, or you don't have a vehicle?"
In Allegany County there are no public buses. Throughout the region, welfare recipients typically can't afford dependable cars, much less insurance. Those who do have good cars have to sell them: state rules say welfare recipients cannot own vehicles worth over $1,500.
"You don't have reliable transportation at that price," said Anne Erickson of the Greater Upstate Law Project, which lobbies for the rural poor in Albany. "In New York City, that's not going to be a problem. How many people in New York City own cars?"
Even welfare recipients who can keep their cars say that can be a mixed blessing. The cost of upkeep, insurance and gasoline for driving long distances can eat away at welfare checks.
Gertrude Riffle, 60, a welfare recipient who lives in a trailer park in Addison with her mentally retarded son, said that maintaining her 11-year old Pontiac Bonneville was one of her major expenses. "It always needs repairs," she said. "So I'm just getting by."
These problems can have devastating effects. Susan Lewis spent years refiling job applications along her town's four-block main street because those employers were the only ones she could reach on foot.
"You get embarrassed because you're letting people know you're still not working, week after week," she said. State social service officials argued that five job applications a week is not an excessive number for rural residents. "We believe there are a lot of jobs out there," said John Fredericks of the State Department of Social Services, in his office in Albany.
State officials have contended that tougher work programs in rural areas have reduced welfare rolls. But it remains unclear whether the people quitting welfare have found jobs or simply vanished from the state's view.
Senator Joseph Holland, chairman of the Senate Social Services Committee and an advocate of tougher welfare rules, said he did not think the new regulations would have a harsher impact on rural residents. But Senator Holland, a Rockland County Republican, acknowledged that the effort to tighten the rules was done with city, not rural, recipients in mind because "people think welfare is better controlled upstate."
He also said there is bipartisan agreement among legislators from outside New York City that more must be done to reduce welfare spending.
"I guess the people in need come to major cities because more services are there, so they have a different philosophy," the Senator said. "We are not separated by parties on this issue. We are separated by upstate and downstate."
In dozens of interviews, welfare recipients in Allegany and Steuben counties said they wanted to work but couldn't find accessible jobs.
Dan Barber lives in Belmont, a village of 1,000 people, one stoplight and a handful of stores. Though Belmont is the seat of Allegany County, Mr. Barber can visit all of its businesses in a day or two. Then he must go elsewhere to fulfill the job-search obligations.
Because he can't afford a car, Mr. Barber, 25, does his job canvassing by foot, sometimes hitching rides. On Fridays, his day off from a county workfare program, he rises at 3 A.M. to travel 30 miles to Olean, a city of 18,000, where he scans want ads for minimum-wage jobs at grocery stores and fast-food restaurants. He is worried that he won't be able to reach five employers a week, as the new welfare rules require.
Inevitably, the subject of transportation arises in job interviews. The typical exchange has become depressingly familiar, said Mr. Barber, who is single and has been on welfare since 1991 when he severely injured his foot in a work accident.
"They ask how I got there, I tell them I walked," he said. "After that, the interview doesn't go any farther."
David DeBarge lives in a three-bedroom trailer home on a wind-swept bluff overlooking Addison, population 2,700, with his wife and three children.
Last March, he found full-time work as a machine operator in a metal stamping plant in Elmira, 40 miles away. His driver's license had been suspended three times since 1991, and he could not afford the $500 needed to reinstate it. So he relied on two co-workers for transportation, an arrangement that worked well for a few months.
Earning $5 an hour and working full time, he managed to pull his family off welfare. "I was scared to death," he said of the decision to exchange a steady public assistance check for the vagaries of private employment. "But you've got to take that leap sooner or later."
But then in June, he lost one ride after arguing with the driver. The next month, a second ride stopped traveling to Addison. With no buses available during his night shift, he stopped going to work. His bosses told him they would hire someone else to fill his job.
Now Mr. DeBarge, a tall, coarse-voiced man of 33 with tattoo-covered arms, is debating whether to reapply for welfare for his family. If he does, they may have to wait three months for their first check. Then he will face the same transportation problems as he tries to meet the rule requiring five job contacts a week. "I'm a recovered alcoholic," he said. "Now I know why people relapse."
In Albany, the welfare debate has pitted urban Democrats against upstate Republicans, who contend that cities are sponges for tax dollars.
Statistics from the Department of Social Services show that New York City, with 40 percent of the state's residents, receives 72 percent of its welfare spending, over $2 billion this year.
But a recent study commissioned by the Republican-led Senate found that in several poverty indicators, the state's rural areas were losing ground to its metropolitan regions. Rural areas have higher unemployment rates, lower per-capita income and a smaller percentage of adults with college educations, according to the report by the New York State Commission on Rural Resources.
Moreover, between 1950 and 1990, most rural areas experienced faster growth in the number of families living in poverty, the report found. It concluded that a continuing decline in manufacturing jobs had left rural areas with low-paying service jobs that rarely provided benefits like health insurance.
Allegany County regularly ranks near the bottom of the state's 62 counties. It has the third lowest per-capita income. The 1990 Census found that it had the fifth highest percentage of families living in poverty: 15 percent of its 55,000 residents, lower than the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan, but significantly higher than Queens and Staten Island. That same year, 10 percent of Allegany County's households received public assistance, just below Manhattan's 11 percent.
In Allegany County, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats by more than 2 to 1. Several welfare recipients who are Republicans said they thought Republican lawmakers had overlooked the possible damage that sharp cutbacks in welfare might cause.
"You'll start seeing things here that you only expect to see in New York City," said Susan Lewis, who spent several years on welfare.
Ms. Lewis, 28, is one of the success stories of the welfare system. In late 1989, her boyfriend was laid off, and she went on welfare.
In 1992, the county placed her in a workfare program, training her in secretarial skills. Her break came late last year, when she was hired from a pool of 30 applicants for a receptionist's job at a home health-care concern. She earns less than $5 an hour and receives no health benefits, but with her boyfriend's income, it is enough.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS: TV SPORTS;
Hello, Sydney? This Is Going to Be Big, Really Big

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
NBC swept its rivals away on Monday by paying $1.27 billion for the television rights to the 2000 Summer Olympics and the 2002 Winter Olympics, while Universal was reported to be paying Sylvester Stallone $60 million for three films.
Coincidence or trend? Trend. Entertainment companies want blockbuster programming, worldwide stars and global amusements to make more piles of money. 
 And here's an interesting coincidence. Last Monday, Fox Network executives flew to Montreal to see Dick Pound, chief of the International Olympic Committee's television committee. They made a $701 million bid for the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, homeland of Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns Fox.
Murdoch's offer was big enough to be pre-emptive. But it would not be.
The next day, Bob Wright, NBC's president, and Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports, began skull sessions about their Sydney bid. By Wednesday, Wright and Ebersol had conceived the idea of packaging a $715 million Sydney offer with a $555 million bid for the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
By Friday, in Montreal, NBC had wrapped up its deal with the I.O.C., having imposed a strict deadline and a confidentiality requirement on Pound & Company
That left Fox Sydney-less. Fox may not have practiced safe bidding. It is believed not to have imposed deadlines or confidentiality on the I.O.C.
Could someone have leaked Fox's bid to NBC? "Absolutely, categorically, unbelievably untrue," Ebersol said. "The beauty of making sports bids is in the guesswork and in the risk."
Pound refused to discuss Fox's bid, but said cryptically: "When you're in a position to get two pre-emptive bids, you don't shop them around."
Pound was in a pickle. If the I.O.C. didn't accept NBC's bid by Friday -- limited time, and limited time only! -- the network vowed not to revisit a package deal. If that happened, NBC then might not have offered more than $620 million for Sydney, and the Salt Lake bidding may have been put off until 1997.
Perhaps Pound could have told NBC and Fox that he appreciated their eagerness, but he wanted them to await the auction for Sydney scheduled for next month. Unlikely. That auction was for one Olympics; the I.O.C. would have been foolish to resist NBC's $1.27 billion simply to follow past bidding protocol.
Why say no to NBC, a network the I.O.C. is cozy with after two Summer Olympic telecasts and a third coming next year? The I.O.C. was comfortable enough with NBC to refuse any chance of continuing with CBS, which, after the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, will have spent $913 million on three Winter Olympics.
Ebersol has crafted many creative deals (not all succeed, like The Baseball Network), but packaging both Olympics in one may be his best.
He guaranteed big-event sports at NBC through 2002, and provided financial stability for the Sydney and Salt Lake Olympic committees.
The Salt Lake organizers had predicted the rights would yield $400 million. Waiting two years may have yielded more than $555 million. "But it's less important to have a few more dollars than certainty in planning," Ebersol said.
Pound wanted to wait when the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games -- hobbled by slow sponsorship sales and needing money to start construction -- pressed Pound to auction television rights in July 1993, eight months earlier than Pound had planned. Pound wanted all bidders to bask longer in a roaring economy for advertising sales. "If we waited, we could have gotten more," he said.
While people paid to wonder about such things wonder whether NBC can make its risk pay off, Ebersol vows to break even. He has support from a man he feuded with about soaring rights fees: Neal Pilson, the former president of CBS Sports.
"You're talking about numbers that are within the capability of General Electric to absorb," Ebersol said, referring to NBC's parent company. "But it's time to stop evaluating every sports deal on a dollar-by-dollar basis. NBC's presence at places like Atlanta, Barcelona and Wimbledon is used for NBC's and G.E.'s corporate purposes. G.E. is a $50 billion company. Does it matter if they make $10 million or lose $50 million?"
 
A Good Investment
 In 1979, Getty Oil paid Bill Rasmussen, ESPN's founder, $43,000 for an option to buy 85 percent of the cable sports network. Now, ESPN has given birth to ESPN2 and is valued at between $3 billion and $5 billion -- a sizable chunk of the $19 billion the Walt Disney Company is paying to acquire Capital Cities/ABC, which owns 80 percent of ESPN.
Rasmussen was paid by ESPN through 1980, then cashed out, with family members and other investors, for $36 million in 1984 when ABC bought ESPN.
"What ESPN is worth now astounds me," he said. "I'm amazed at the appetite for TV sports. It's staggering. In 1980, sports fanatics knew us, but we were barely in six million homes when I left. I get a lot of reflected enjoyment watching it now. It's like a baby grown up."
Rasmussen now runs a Naples, Fla., company that installs computerized energy, security and lighting controls in residences. "I don't even have to get out of my chair to see who's at my door," he said.
Great. Another Rasmussen company that encourages couch potato behavior.
 "You're talking about numbers that are within the capability of General Electric to absorb. But it's time to stop evaluating every sports deal on a dollar-by-dollar basis. NBC's presence at places like Atlanta, Barcelona and Wimbledon is used for NBC's and G.E.'s corporate purposes. G.E. is a $50 billion company. Does it matter if they make $10 million or lose $50 million?"

CORRECTION-DATE: August 11, 1995, Friday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, the TV Sports column on Wednesday, about the ability of General Electric and its subsidiary NBC to handle a $1.27 billion payout for Olympic rights, misattributed a quotation. It was Neil Pilson, former president of CBS Sports -- not Dick Ebersol, president of NBC Sports -- who said:

HEADLINE: The Condos Are Eating Our History

BYLINE: By Geraldine Brooks; Geraldine Brooks is author of "Nine Parts of Desire: The Hidden World of Islamic Women."

DATELINE: WATERFORD, Va.

 BODY:
The backhoes arrived a few weeks ago on the farm near my home, where Washington's sprawl finally surrenders to a wide hazy view of the Blue Ridge Mountains.
The backhoes and the little piles of earth mean a developer is testing the land to see how many houses it can carry. Next year, the hay bales won't be there, lit up by the afternoon sun. The hedgerow with its tangle of blackberries and bishop's lace will have been bulldozed for site access. And the thread -- the fine, frail thread that binds here and now to there and then -- will have been frayed just a little bit closer to breaking point. 
 It's considered elitist to lament those backhoes, just as it is to oppose a Disney theme park or a Wal-Mart. People need houses, after all. They even need malls. And for sure the struggling cattle farmers here are entitled to a profit on their land after years of eking a bare living from it. But to me it's far more elitist to feel an inalienable right to change a landscape that has a long history, to feel that our needs -- now, this minute -- count for more than the needs of future generations to know America as it was.
The city kids who come to our town's annual fair tell me the amazement in their eyes when they tour my old house. I show them the Civil War belt buckle dug up in the garden and the trap door in the kitchen ceiling, where the children of the house used to be hoisted on their parents' shoulders to sleep in the small, stove-warmed crawl space.
The property-rights movement says I'm entitled to put dry wall over that trap door if I feel like it or even to tear the house down. To me, that's elitism. We have owned this house less than two years; to my mind, that conveys very few rights to a structure that has stood for almost two centuries. Even if we own it for 20 years, I will still see myself as just one in a line of its custodians, carrying this little piece of America's heritage safely into the future.
Waterford, settled by Quakers in 1733, has history written into the stones of buildings much older than mine. There are houses that stood when Virginia was a colony, whose pacifist Quaker inhabitants abhorred the Revolutionary War. When Virginia was a rebel state, some Quakers fought for the Union because the evil of slavery outweighed the evil of battle. The church still has bullet marks in the brick from a skirmish. Confederate and Union dead lie side by side in the village graveyard.
The one-room schoolhouse built just after the Civil War to educate the African-American children still functions as a school. Third and fourth graders who visit the place experience what it was like to be educated in the segregated slate-and-pencil world of the 19th century.
And yet what makes this village most special is its link with the surrounding farmland. One step out of Williamsburg's colonial center and you're hard upon the neon 1990's. But walk the Water Meadow behind Waterford and you can gaze for 360 degrees on a village among farms that looks like America looked way back when. What is preserved here isn't the grand and the exceptional like Monticello or Mount Vernon but the domain of ordinary lives.
If the march of the condos continues -- and with a million acres of American farmland disappearing each year there's no reason to think it won't -- Waterford and its history will become just a collection of quaint houses, hemmed in by sprawl, robbed of history.
Can't America afford to keep even a few places as they were? Surely it makes as much sense to compensate farmers with public funds for not developing their land as to compensate then for not growing too many soybeans. If the worry is taxes, we will pay them anyway when the condos are built, because the extra revenue from a bigger population in rural areas never, ever covers the cost of providing the new services it demands.
Even setting aside our duty to history and to the future, this place is worth keeping on economic grounds alone. There is a growing hunger in us for a taste of the world's older, quieter places. Waterford, too, can be a field of dreams: if you don't build it, they will come.
Already, for one weekend every October our tiny village -- a general store, a post office, a population of 250 -- is host to 30,000 at its annual fair. We give each a ticket that reads: "America's heritage belongs to everyone." If only it were true.

HEADLINE: Revival of Economic Growth Is Scant So Far, the Fed Reports

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
While the sluggish American economy may be poised for a rebound, the much-anticipated return to higher rates of economic growth in the second half of the year has not yet happened, the Federal Reserve said in a report issued today.
Although the report does not specifically address interest-rate policy, its slightly pessimistic tone about growth, coupled with the playing down of inflation risks, suggests that the central bank will have room to cut rates further later this year. But most economists expect Fed policy makers to leave short-term interest rates unchanged at their next meeting on Aug. 22, waiting for more data to become available in September. 
 The economy "is expanding, but at a slow rate," said Richard B. Berner, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "Having eased cautiously once, if the Fed continues to see inflation subsiding, they may ease again -- I wouldn't think in August."
At their last meeting on July 6, Fed officials shaved one-quarter of a percentage point from one of the interest rates they control.
At a breakfast meeting with reporters today, Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin expressed confidence that the economy would be in better shape a year from now, when the Presidential election campaign will be in full swing. "The most likely set of conditions a year from now is probably solid growth, moderate inflation," he said.
Mr. Rubin also predicted that unemployment late next summer would be around 5.6 or 5.8 percent. It was 5.7 percent last month.
The Fed's experts were less enthusiastic, though, about the economy's current health. Today's report, prepared for the Aug. 22 rate-setting meeting, was cautious in tone about economic activity in the 12 regional districts into which the Federal Reserve divides the country.
"Most districts continue to report economic expansion, although in some areas the rate of expansion has moderated recently," the report said. "The upper Midwest, Southeast and West continue to expand. Other areas are experiencing little or no growth."
The national economy grew at a paltry annual rate of one-half of 1 percent during the second quarter, the Commerce Department announced nearly two weeks ago. Most private economists predict slightly faster growth this quarter, followed by a return to a growth rate of around 2.5 percent by the fourth quarter.
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Alan S. Blinder, the Fed's vice chairman, have attributed the economy's weakness this summer to a move by companies to sell off part of their big inventories of goods before ordering more output from their factories. Today's study suggested that this pattern could be coming to an end, laying the groundwork for stronger growth in the months ahead.
"Orders are up in some districts, and inventories generally are considered to be at acceptable levels," said the report, commonly known as the beige book because of the color of its cover.
The report also repeated the recent theme of senior Fed officials that inflation seems to be slowing but has not been extinguished. "Nearly all districts note that price pressures remain on materials and supplies, with reports of increasing prices generally outnumbering reports of flat or declining prices," the document said. "Over all, though, the rate of increases appears to be moderating."
The Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Dallas and St. Louis reported slowing growth in their regions, while the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Richmond, Philadelphia and Minneapolis reported steady or mixed signs of economic strength in their nearby states. The Fed regional banks in Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, Kansas City and San Francisco noted strong or strengthening economies.
Some of the states now prospering or recovering, notably California, were among those hardest hit by the recession in the early 1990's. At the same time, the economy in the Midwest appears strong despite an overall loss in manufacturing jobs in July reported by the Labor Department last Friday.
As a result, the regional economies of the United States seem to be converging around a more moderate pace of growth, said David Kelly, a senior economist at Lehman Brothers. "In general, there is no one region of the country going down the tubes at the moment, and that's important," he said. "Right now, it's a slower pace but a tighter pack, and that probably leaves the economy" at less risk of a recession.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that in its region, announcements of large job gains in June and July were balanced by announced job losses at other companies. Retail sales rose moderately in June in the region, and the midtown Manhattan commercial real estate market improved as vacancy rates edged down.
The regional bank's district consists of the state of New York, 12 counties in northern New Jersey and Fairfield County in Connecticut.

HEADLINE: At K.K.R., the Glory Days Are Past

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company. In the late 1980's, the name became synonymous with corporate gtakeovers and all the glory and terror they implied. Representatives of some of America's largest companies jetted into New York to seek an audience at the firm. Some came to seek its help in buying control of companies from their shareholders, and the $30.6 billion buyout of R.J.R. Nabisco in 1989 made Kohlber, Kravis the king of the huge deal. Others came merely to urge the firm to leave their company alone. The firm's name partners became celebrities of sorts, symbols of the pressure on American managers to make their companies more profitable or yield to someone who would.
 How times have changed. 
 Kohlberg, Kravis in now scrambling even to find much smaller and apparently less profitable transactions, and sometimes being passed over then. And annual returns from its investments, which some times ran close to 50 percent in the late 1970's and early 1980's, are now bouncing around the teens - lower than returns at some lesser-known firms and this year, even below the gains of broad stock market gauges like the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
 Kohlberg, Kravis's acquisition of the Brunu's Inc. supermarket chain last spring illustrates the deal maker's more humble existence these days.
 The firm pursued Bruno's, rather than the other way around. Indeed, Bruno's turned to Kohlberg, Kravis only after talks with another firm had fallen through. And rather than granting an audience to Bruno's executives in New York, two Kohlber, Kravis partners - Paul E. Raether and Jamie Greene - flew to the company's headquarters in Birmingham, Ala, to see them.
 The deal they struck was smaller, and will probably be less profitable to Kohlberg, Kravis and its investors, than earlier deals by the firm.
 What happened? To some extent, Kohlberg, Kravis is a victim of its own success. Many companies heeded its warnings and those of others, and overhualed themselves, leaving fewer dinosaurs vulnerable to a takeover.
 "Pay off debt, getting rid of divisions that are not up to snuff - companies can do that for themselves now," said Steven N. Kaplan, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago's graduate school of business. "It's very hard for a leveraged buyout of a large public company to add values as it could 5 or 10 years ago."
And when companies do seek a buyout, it often involves a less attractive deal for Kohlberg, Kravis and its investors.
In a typical Kohlberg, Kravis deal, known as a leveraged buyout, the firm acquires a company from its shareholders mostly with money lent by banks and with high-yield, or junk, bonds. The firm owns most of the company's stock; the company's management owns the rest. As the bonds and bank loans are paid off, and as the company improves its performance by cutting costs and reorganizing its business, the value of the company's stock rises dramatically, paving the way for a very lucrative sale. .
In the 1980's, buyouts generally involved more borrowing than they do today, meaning that there was proportionately less stock. That meant that the value of each share of stock could rise dramatically. By contrast, the higher proportion of stock these days means less profit potential.
Meanwhile, competition has gotten tougher. In the last decade, the number of buyout firms like Kohlberg, Kravis has grown to 214 with $93 billion under management, from 40 with $7 billion under management, according to Venture Economics Information Service, a Boston company that follows the business.
All this competition means that Kohlberg, Kravis must offer companies more attractive terms to do a deal -- in short, lower its fees and cede some of its potential profits.
Executives at Kohlberg, Kravis acknowledged that its returns were not what they used to be, but they said the firm was making the right moves to adjust to a more difficult economic environment. They noted that the leveraged-buyout business was cyclical, with the current bull market in stocks making buyouts both more expensive and often less attractive compared with other investments.
But the executives said that Kohlberg, Kravis was taking the long view. They said that the stock market might have a good year like the current one, but cannot offer the sustained annual returns of more than 40 percent that a good company buyout can. The executives also emphasized the conservative approach of the firm, its vast experience, its ability to adapt, its skill in ferreting out deals and its consistent investment of $400 million a year in equity since 1991 despite the volatility in the markets.
And Kohlberg, Kravis's defenders say the firm is showing sparks of its old inventiveness, shopping in Canada and Europe and delving further into an acquisition strategy called leveraged buildup. This involves setting up a management team in an industry with growth potential, then building a company through acquisitions. For example, the firm hired three former Macmillan Group executives in Feb. 1989 to create K-III Communications Corporation to expand into the media and publishing businesses.
Analysts say the firm is sufficiently confident that it is planning to approach investors in the coming months for a new buyout fund, its seventh since Kohlberg, Kravis was founded in 1976. The firm declined to comment on that report.
Even so, many investors are shying away from Kohlberg, Kravis, citing high fees and high risks given the current returns.
Kohlberg, Kravis officials declined to disclose the firm's returns. But some other buyout firms such as Clayton Dubilier & Rice and Forstmann Little & Company have returns that in some years are well above, and may even be double, those at Kohlberg, Kravis, analysts said.
Kohlberg, Kravis calculates its returns by determining a current value for its investments and then comparing that with the value of the original investment, then subtracting fees and interest costs. In cases where a company in which the firm invested is sold, the increase in value is easy to calculate; the valuation of a company in which the firm still holds a stake involves more guesswork.
Part of the drag on returns was the RJR Nabisco takeover, hailed in 1989 as a bold stroke. It has knocked down Kohlberg, Kravis's overall returns by a full 10 percentage points since its inception, analysts said. Kohlberg, Kravis shed the last of its RJR Nabisco investment last March, swapping its remaining $4 billion stake in the tobacco and food conglomerate for ownership of Borden Inc., the food company.
RJR Nabisco "wasn't a rewarding investment for the original investors," said David J. Adelman, an analyst with Dean Witter, Discover.
Kohlberg, Kravis is also lagging when it comes to the diversity of its staff. It doesn't have a single woman professional, and there is little, if any, ethnic diversity among its managerial staff. In its recent recruitment of a handful of executives, Kohlberg Kravis just was not able to find women who met its requirements, according to one executive at the firm.
None of this is to say that Kohlberg, Kravis is dead on its feet. While not involved in any of this year's megamergers in the entertainment, health care, banking or railroad industries, it has spent more than $2 billion on acquisitions.
Applying assets from a fund it set up in 1993, it bought Canadian General Insurance Group Ltd. in January for about $160 million, and Neway Anchorlok International Inc., a maker of brakes and suspension systems, in February for $105 million. It acquired Bruno's in April and bought Reliance Comm/Tec, a telecommunications equipment supplier, from Rockwell International Inc., in June for $475 million. Last month, it paid $340 million for the Medco Behavioral Care Corporation, a specialty managed care unit of Merck & Company.
"The level of activity has definitely accelerated recently," said Mr. Raether, who joined Kohlberg, Kravis in 1980. The firm now has about $7.8 billion in equity investments in 21 companies, he said. With offices in New York and San Francisco, the firm has recently hired five associates and four analysts, increasing its staff to more than 70.
Insiders at Kohlberg, Kravis, and advisers working with the firm, said two of the founding partners, Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts, who are cousins and both 51 years old, remained in charge. (Jerome S. Kohlberg Jr. left the firm in 1987.) These people deny speculation that Mr. Kravis has slowed down, saying he attends important meetings, works hard and keeps informed of the firm's affairs.
The two partners have played an important role in the firm's overseas forays. In Europe last year, Kohlberg, Kravis backed Ian A. Martin, a former deputy chairman of Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., the big food and beverage company, helping him to set up the Glenisla Group, which is looking at prospects for buyouts and buildups, but has yet to announce a deal.
Jon R. Vanderploeg, who oversees investments for the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, praised the firm's team as exceptional, adding, "They are as good as it gets." Still, the board did not invest in Kohlberg, Kravis's 1993 fund, its most recent.
John B. Fewel Jr., senior equities investment officer for Oregon, which has invested in Kohlberg, Kravis funds since 1984, added: "Our annual returns from inception to date have averaged about 20 percent overall, with realized returns in excess of 40 percent. The returns have been quite attractive."
Other investors, with more funds from which to choose, have put pressure on the firm to reduce its management and investment-banking fees. "The investing institutions have gotten a lot smarter in terms of the due diligence they're doing about fees and charges," said Jesse E. Reyes, a director of Venture Economics, the Boston research firm.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Selling the family silver cheaply just to pay for tonight's dinner.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
NOTICE: Going out of business. Debt-ridden Government seeks buyers for dams, power plants, irrigation canals. No unreasonable offer refused.
Well, it may not be quite that bad. But in their search for gimmicks to balance the budget, both Congress and the White House are contemplating the sale of California's Gargantuan Federal water system for pennies on the dollar. For those who have spent years struggling to balance the interests of farmers, urban water districts and the state's heavily stressed wildlife, it couldn't be a worse idea. 
 "If the rules were fair, we wouldn't oppose it," said Thomas Graff, senior attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund in California. "But this would be a rip-off of the taxpayer and a rape of the environment."
The Central Valley Project, a crazy quilt of reservoirs, dams and canals that bring water from the mountains of Northern California to the arid valleys in the middle of the state, was designed during the New Deal and largely completed in the 1950's. The project transformed California into the nation's premier producer of farm crops. But it is also a textbook example of the temptation to waste inherent in public works dominated by private interests.
The water is a great bargain for those lucky enough to get in on the deal. Under the terms of the Congressionally mandated pact, local irrigation districts control the water, paying only maintenance costs plus interest-free, bite-size installments on the initial investment. "You'd like to buy your house that way," said Robert Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
But it is not just the sweetheart aspects of the financing that offend economists and environmentalists. Indeed, the implicit subsidy is perhaps the least of their objections.
Super-cheap water has led to its profligate use. The most dramatic waste is seen in the spread of low-value crops to the desert -- alfalfa for cattle feed, for example -- while California's coastal cities scrounge for drinking water from drought to drought. Environmentalists are even more concerned about the damage to rivers and estuaries by dams and reservoirs, as well as the concentration of toxic chemicals from irrigation runoff water.
In 1992 Mr. Graff's Environmental Defense Fund helped broker a legislative compromise with more than a little assistance from senior Congressional Democrats.
Farmers, facing the end of their contracts for Federal water, got long-term renewals along with the right to sell limited amounts of their allotments to urban water districts for whatever the market would bear. In return they agreed to pay somewhat higher rates, with the extra cash going into a fund for protecting the regional environment. The deal also included formal set-asides of water for sustaining wildlife habitats during droughts.
But with the fall of the Democratic majority in Congress and the new push to sell off Federal assets to balance the budget, the agribusiness interests that dominate the Central Valley now see an opportunity to renegotiate the terms.
Some 60 water districts -- mostly those serving farmers in the San Joaquin Valley -- have formed the Central Valley Project Authority, which is offering to buy the water system outright. Smith Barney, commissioned by the farmers to estimate its value, came up with the figure of $826 million. This number, the investment bankers calculate, is the lump-sum equivalent of the $2.1 billion in remaining construction costs that water users would otherwise be obliged to pay over the next 35 years.
The farmers' enthusiasm for the bargain basement deal is understandable, since estimates of the replacement cost of the system run as high as $15 billion. "It would capitalize their subsidy for all time," Mr. Reischauer explained.
So is the Environmental Defense Fund's dismay. If Washington loses leverage over the Central Valley Project, wildlife may lose its priority access to water. And the danger is more than theoretical: Mr. Graff points out that Smith Barney is assuming there will be far more water available to sell than others are projecting.
More puzzling, perhaps, is the willingness of both the Clinton Administration and responsible conservatives in Congress to count revenues from the proposed sale against the deficit. In fact, Mr. Reischauer notes, the exchange would be a wash: if the $826 million were used to reduce the national debt, the reduction in future interest liabilities would equal the reduction in future payments from the farmers.
But in the Government's Alice-in-Wonderland accounting system, the only thing that matters is today's cash. Thus the $826 million would allow Washington to support programs that might otherwise end up being cut. The deal would thus be equivalent to selling the family silverware to pay for tonight's dinner.
The environmentalists recognize they can't win this battle alone. Instead they are hoping that divisions among the farmers themselves will derail the deal. Agribusinesses in the northern Sacramento Valley are worried that San Joaquin farmers to the south will hog the spoils. And with Washington in a panic to balance the budget, those opposed to the transfer cannot afford to be picky in choosing allies.

HEADLINE: CLINTON TO SEEK NEW RESTRICTIONS ON YOUNG SMOKERS

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
President Clinton has decided to let the Food and Drug Administration begin the process of declaring the nicotine in tobacco an addictive drug, a step that would clear the way for the most significant Government regulations in the history of the tobacco industry.
Clinton Administration officials said the President's decision stemmed from his judgment that the F.D.A. had successfully made a scientific and legal case for the addictive nature of nicotine. 
 They said the White House was still reviewing precisely what new restrictions the agency should try to impose, but Mr. Clinton is to announce at least some of them on Thursday.
These early proposals, intended to curb teen-age smoking, will include restrictions on vending machine sales and on advertising that reaches children. They specifically avoid any restrictions on adult smoking, Administration officials said.
Still, the F.D.A.'s action would amount to a landmark change in the Government's approach to cigarettes. For the first time, the Government would be asserting jurisdiction over the product itself as opposed to cigarette advertising, whose regulation by the Federal Trade Commission already bars cigarette commercials on television and requires the industry's print ads to carry a warning about the hazards of smoking.
Indeed, the new move would open the door to future regulation that might someday bring an outright ban on cigarettes, although the F.D.A. has insisted that it has no such current intent.
The agency's assertion of jurisdiction over tobacco, and any proposed restrictions that result, will be subject to the usual Federal regulatory process: publication of the proposals, a period of public comment and then final adoption. This process generally takes only a few months, but in the case of tobacco years of legal and legislative wrangling appear likely.
In a glimpse of the battle that will surely ensue, Brennan Dawson, a spokesman for the industry's Tobacco Institute, said the tobacco companies might well go to court and would certainly appeal to Congress.
"The F.D.A. does not have jurisdiction and should not be regulating tobacco products," Ms. Dawson said. "That would lead down the road to prohibition."
Ms. Dawson also said that to avoid regulation, the industry, which has long professed opposition to teen-age smoking, was willing to take steps to help curb it, perhaps by keeping vending machines out of grocery stores and other places where children have access.
Under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the F.D.A. has the power to classify as a drug under its jurisdiction any commercial substance that is marketed with the intent to affect the structure or the function of the human body. The heart of the debate is thus whether nicotine, which has a powerful effect on the body, is being used by the industry as a major element in the marketing of cigarettes.
In any case, the law provides that the agency's assertion of authority can be challenged in court. And Congress may write laws to steer the agency's action if enough votes can be garnered in both houses to overcome a Presidential veto.
Tobacco-state lawmakers have already promised a bitter fight over any effort to regulate the industry. Last week, for instance, Representative Charlie Rose, Democrat of North Carolina, said that if the Government and the industry could not reach a voluntary agreement curbing youths' access to cigarettes, "some Republicans here are licking their chops for that one -- they want to go head to head with the White House."
As Administration officials discussed the new plans today, Mr. Clinton was in Charlotte, N.C., where, in a speech centering on family values, he touched briefly on the dangers of teen-age smoking.
But he did not disclose his support for the F.D.A's new role. That was due in part to the urging of North Carolina politicians, whose constituencies include many tobacco workers and executives and who had implored the President not to make the proposals the focus of his remarks.
In his speech, to the Progressive National Baptist Convention, Mr. Clinton called smoking one of the greatest threats to young people, listing it with violence, teen-age pregnancy and illegal drugs. He said curbing tobacco use among young people would be "the cheapest, easiest, quickest thing you could ever do to change the whole dynamic of health care in America."
The President said that he recognized the importance of tobacco to the economy of North Carolina and other Southern states but that recent increases in smoking among teen-agers were too pronounced and dangerous to ignore.
"Every single day," he said, "3,000 young people become regular smokers, and nearly 1,000 of them will die prematurely as a result."
The President said that "there are some things we can do at the governmental level," but he added: "No matter what you do with the law, people have to change inside. And somebody has to help them change inside. And we have to do it in an organized, disciplined way."
Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said the President might try to work with Congress to embody new tobacco regulations in law. But he made clear that Mr. Clinton had squarely rejected the voluntary approach, suggested by some members of Congress, in which cigarette makers would undertake an anti-smoking public relations campaign or help states enforce existing laws, now often loosely applied, against sales to minors.
Instead, White House aides suggested, the President would be willing to force Congress to overturn new regulations if it wanted to, on the political ground that defending the tobacco industry is a losing proposition among voters nationally. Mr. Clinton's political support in many Southern states -- like North Carolina, which he lost narrowly in 1992 -- is already shaky for a host of other reasons anyway.
Mr. Clinton mentioned smoking only at the tail end of his 50-minute speech, in which he largely reiterated themes he had sounded in recent weeks about the importance of family values. Back in Washington, Presidential advisers were concerned that this might be interpreted as a softening of his resolve against teen-age smoking, and so Mr. McCurry announced that Mr. Clinton intended to deliver details on Thursday.
White House aides acknowledged that North Carolina officials, whom they would not identify by name, had urged the President not to go into detail today, in part because the local media attention to his visit would have forced them to answer questions on smoking all day.
The first step in the President's action -- permitting the F.D.A. to assert legal jurisdiction over the nicotine in cigarettes -- is a historic one that previous Commissioners of Food and Drugs have considered in previous Administrations but always rejected. Several elements in the political and scientific mix have changed since then, however.
One was President George Bush's appointment of Dr. David A. Kessler as Food and Drug Commissioner. Dr. Kessler is a pediatrician who is an expert on food and drug law.
Even as Dr. Kessler has pushed for regulation, volumes of internal tobacco company papers have been made public, and many more have become available to the Food and Drug Administration, showing that tobacco companies carried out extensive research into nicotine's pleasurable and dependence-producing effects.
Most important, a wave of anti-tobacco sentiment has swept the country in recent years, resulting in enactment of hundreds of local antismoking ordinances.

HEADLINE: Boston Banks Lend More To Minorities, Study Finds

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Six years after a series of studies portrayed Boston as rife with racial discrimination in lending, banks there have greatly improved their records in lending to minorities and residents of low-income neighborhoods, a study released today finds.
The study, by James T. Campen, an associate professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, was financed by a grant from the Massachusetts Community and Banking Council, a group of banks and community groups. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, which produced critical studies in 1989 and 1992, cautiously endorsed today's report. 
 "We've reviewed the study and found the methodology to be straightforward and the conclusions to be sound," said James E. Mahoney, the vice president and secretary of the regional Federal Reserve bank.
Willie M. Jones Jr., a community activist and member of the council sponsoring the study, said local banks had made great progress in hiring bilingual loan officers and in approving more home mortgage applications in low-income neighborhoods.
"They've done some things that are for real," said Mr. Jones, who is a director of the Roxbury/North Dorchester Neighborhood Revitalization Corporation, a nonprofit housing development group in Boston. "Is that to say they've figured it out? I'd say the jury is out."
One prominent member of the Massachusetts Community and Banking Council is the Fleet Financial Group, a big banking company that is buying another New England banking company, the Shawmut National Corporation. Some community activists have contended that the merger may limit the availability of loans in low-income neighborhoods, and have persuaded the Federal Reserve to extend its usual deadlines for public comment and to hold public hearings in New England later this month before deciding whether to approve the deal. Thomas L. Lavelle, a spokesman for Fleet Financial, welcomed today's study. "It's certainly a trend that we applaud, and are glad to be a part of," he said.
Mr. Campen's study found black applicants received 20.1 percent of the home mortgages approved in Boston in 1993, up from 16.2 percent in 1990. By comparison, 23.8 percent of Boston's residents are black, the study said.
The percentage of black applicants denied mortgages plunged in the same period, to 17.5 percent from 32.7 percent, while the percentage of white applicants denied mortgages fell less sharply, to 11.7 percent from 16.4 percent, Mr. Campen said. National figures also show a narrowing of the gap in mortgage denial rates, but not so dramatically.
For Hispanic home buyers, the improvement has been less pronounced. Their share of approved mortgages edged up to 5.7 percent from 5.1 percent, and remained well below their 10.8 percent proportion of the population, the study found.
Mr. Campen said that the overall improvement in bank lending to minorities and residents of low-income neighborhoods reflected pressure from community activists, lawmakers and regulators. "Banks have responded in a positive way, rather than being defensive," he added. The Boston Fed's studies inspired some of the pressure.
Today's study was less comprehensive than the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's controversial 1992 study, for which researchers obtained the loan files for more than 3,000 mortgage applicants and evaluated them based on more than 40 criteria. That study found that even after the credit histories and other financial details of applicants were taken into account, black and Hispanic applicants were less likely to be approved.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago produced a study this summer, based on the same data from 1990, concluding that banks did not distinguish between white and minority applicants with good credit histories but that minority applicants with bad credit histories were less likely to be approved than white applicants with similar backgrounds.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Mexican Peso Fall Leads To Auto-Sales Standstill

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON 

 BODY:
In the aftermath of the peso crisis, Mexico has turned into an incredible shrinking market for new-car sales, and world auto companies are scrambling to adjust.
Mexicans are not buying cars. The peso's slide cut deeply into their buying power while interest rates on car loans hover around 46 percent. In the first half of this year, new vehicle sales dipped by 70 percent from the corresponding period in 1994. 
 The scene at dealerships across Mexico is the same: Auto lots are full and sales offices are empty. Volkswagen has been the worst hit; its sales crashed by 85 percent. The venerable Volkswagen Beetle is still the most popular model in Mexico, but mainly among the working-class Mexicans who have suffered the most in the slump.
Before the peso collapsed last December, the five major auto makers in Mexico -- Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Nissan and Volkswagen -- had expected a thriving market there to give a small lift to profits.
Now those companies are looking for ways to minimize losses. They are increasing exports from Mexico where they can, while taking advantage of cheaper labor costs after the peso devaluation and fewer restrictions since the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. They are propping up their dealers and cutting costs, hunkering down to wait for a return to growth.
So far this year, auto exports from Mexico are up 25 percent. But this does not represent a dramatic shift. Ford was the only auto maker that managed to increase production in Mexico. Ford had planned before the peso fell to build some of its new Contour and Mercury Mystique models at its plant near Mexico City for the more friendly market in the United States.
Volkswagen's exports also surged. But VW was well placed to step up export production because it already builds in Mexico all the Jetta sedans and Golf compacts it sells in the United States. The company decided in February to take thousands of Jettas and Golfs it had hoped to sell in Mexico and ship them north of the border..
"It was pretty effortless," said Maria Leonhauser, a spokeswoman for Volkswagen of America.
Other companies had less flexibility.
"We were aiming to take advantage of the higher growth in Mexico with more sales there," James D. Donlon, a Chrysler vice president, said. Just this year, Chrysler began to make the stylish Dodge Stratus for the Mexican market. Chrysler had decided to reorganize production to build this model for the American market, but it was tricky and time-consuming to get the right parts, Mr. Donlon said. Chrysler is relying on the brisk American sales of its Mexican-made pickup trucks to shore up its operations there.
General Motors was also focused on building and selling cars in Mexico, according to Robert W. Hendry, vice president for North American operations. Now G.M.'s strategy is to battle for the biggest share of a withered market and hang on until sales come back.
"We are still very bullish on Mexico," Mr. Hendry said. "The growth was set back a few years, but the basics are still there."
In Mexico, auto makers are trying to save their desperate dealers from going under, and some are providing more generous help than anything they have done in the United States. Chrysler, which has lost 20 of its 150 dealers this year, is extending credit to its dealers well below Mexican loan rates "on an individualized basis," Mr. Donlon said.
Ford has lost only one of its 136 dealers by providing them with cars to sell on credit for as long as five months, Ford executives said. The dealers pay the company only after selling a car.
"How do we do it?" said Carlos Hernandez, Ford's spokesman in Mexico. "It's costing us money. But we built up that distributor network over many years and we don't want to lose them."
The big companies are leaning hard on their parts suppliers in Mexico to renegotiate contracts for price cuts that reflect lower labor costs.
"In the new world order, the companies are not bashful about going to the suppliers and saying there's been kind of a windfall here, pal," Mr. Donlon, the Chrysler official, said. Most suppliers are "playing ball," he said, adding that a handful who have resisted "will find themselves over time with other long-term relationships."
Exports of car parts from Mexico to the United States took a jump as well. Small Mexican companies not tied to global manufacturing networks are the beneficiaries, especially those that moved quickly into the surging market for replacement parts.
The American parts maker Delphi Automotive Systems, a unit of General Motors, is one of the largest private employers in Mexico, with 45,000 workers. But J. T. Battenberg, the Delphi president, said he was not rushing to realign production to make more parts for export from Mexico.
"We don't view Mexico as Mexico per se," Mr. Battenberg said. "We have operations in 32 countries around the world. We don't just move in and out of Mexico, because it's such an integrated piece of our global network." A cluster of dashboard wires Delphi strings together in Mexico is tied in the assembly stream to sophisticated instruments it makes in the United States. So it does not work for Delphi to accelerate production in Mexico alone.
"For the short term you ride the bumps," said Gary Corrigan, a spokesman for the Dana Corporation in Toledo, Ohio, which makes auto parts in Mexico with two big Mexican partners. "For the medium term you begin to look at exporting, but only to help American plants that are stretched. The goal is not to have a negative impact on employment in your companies in the States."
Some of the biggest losers in the industry are American workers who were looking forward to thousands of new job opportunities stemming from a rise in American exports to Mexico as a result of the free trade agreement, according to Robert E. Scott, an economist at the University of Maryland. American car imports to Mexico have ground to a virtual halt. Mr. Scott estimates 45,000 jobs that would have been there for American auto workers did not materialize because of the peso's decline.
Analysts expect it will be at least three years before the vehicle market rebounds. This year, in the first quarter alone Nissan reported unspecified losses as a result of the peso devaluation, which industry analysts estimated at $300 million. Dana announced losses of $15 million because of peso loans. But manufacturers have remained optimistic about the free trade accord and Mexico.
"This is just a disruption," said James G. O'Connor, executive director of Ford's export operations. "We are a long-term player in Mexico, and we think the long-term outlook remains strong."

Since the peso crisis, many Mexicans have been unable to buy cars, so auto makers are trying to increase exports. Only Ford has been able to raise its output in Mexico.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ebbs Against the Mark After Half-Step on German Rates

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar drifted lower against the German mark yesterday in languid trading as dealers scaled back expectations for cuts in key German interest rates.
But the currency remained well supported against the Japanese yen after the Treasury's auction of 10-year notes, the second leg of the Government's record $42.5 billion quarterly refunding, attracted better than expected demand from investors. 
In late New York trading, the dollar was at 91.63 yen, up from 91.49 yen on Tuesday. It was at 1.4063 German marks, down slightly from 1.4082.
Although the dollar had a rather muted response to the auction of $13 billion in notes, analysts said the favorable outcome helped remove a negative factor for the currency, after a disappointing three-year note sale on Tuesday. Many said the market was on hold in anticipation of today's auction of $11.5 billion in benchmark 30-year Treasury bonds.
Traders had hoped that the auction would draw foreign investors who would have to exchange their currency for dollars to buy American assets. In particular, the market is looking for participation by Japanese institutions after Tokyo's move last week to change regulations to encourage overseas investment.
"The dollar has a firmer tone, but we are not roaring away here," said Dave Glowacki, senior trader at NBD Bank in Detroit. "We have had one not-so-good auction and one good one. So now, the market is just waiting to see what the final auction is going to show."
Traders said the dollar had also been bolstered against the yen by the aggressive buying of hedge funds.
But few were betting on dollar gains against the mark. The German central bank trimmed its 14-day money market rate yesterday, but analysts said it was likely to delay cuts in the key discount and Lombard rates.
"About 75 percent of people were expecting the Bundesbank to cut rates," said Bruce English, vice president at ABN-Amro Bank, "and that had given the market the incentive to buy dollars and sell marks. But we aren't seeing that anymore, and we've come off a bit." Still, Mr. English said, the market was wary of selling the currency too heavily.
Against some other currencies, the dollar was slightly lower yesterday, at 1.1635 Swiss francs, compared with 1.1670 on Tuesday. The British pound traded at $1.5987, down from $1.6023. The Canadian dollar sold for 73.58 United cents, compared with 73.66 cents on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Panel Denounces Council Over Deal With Pathmark

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
The City Planning Commission yesterday voted to denounce a deal the City Council struck with Pathmark Stores last month to build a large supermarket in Springfield Gardens, Queens, in which the company agreed to donate more than $400,000 to other merchants and to youth groups in the area.
The commission's view was bolstered by a letter from the city's Corporation Counsel, which calls the deal an illegal tax on Pathmark because the $400,000 fund has no connection to the zoning changes Pathmark wants from the city. The Mayor appears prepared to veto the deal if it goes forward. 
 Last month, Councilwoman Juanita E. Watkins, a Democrat, brokered the deal under which Pathmark would donate $400,000, a sum that would be distributed over 20 years to merchants who would be Pathmark's competitors.
These merchants had expressed concern that the huge supermarket would damage their businesses. Ms. Watkins represents that area, and without her approval it seemed unlikely that the Council would have approved the zoning change Pathmark needed to build the store.
Under the arrangement, the money would be used to renovate facades of stores in the community, for example, and make other improvements. Community groups would also be eligible for money to pay for projects like youth programs. A seven-member advisory panel controlled by Ms. Watkins would administer the fund through a community organization, which has yet to be named.
But several Planning Commission members referred to the arrangement as "extortion" -- particularly because the $400,000 would be distributed by a task force controlled by Ms. Watkins and not by a city agency.
Ms. Watkins stood by the deal, saying she hoped the City Council would still vote to approve the arrangement at its meeting next Thursday. Yesterday, the Planning Commission voted almost unanimously, with 10 votes for approval and 1 abstention, to send a letter urging the Council to reject the modifications Ms. Watkins negotiated -- changes that were approved last month by the Council's Land Use Committee.
The Planning Commission's move is merely advisory, but the city's Corporation Counsel, Paul M. Crotty, said the city would sue to stop the deal if the City Council approves it.
"We've made that very clear," Mr. Crotty said. "And based on what the Mayor has said about these kinds of arrangements, the Mayor would veto it."
Last week, when the Mayor gave his final approval for a Pathmark store to be built in East Harlem, he said he opposed any deals requiring businesses to create economic development funds to assist other local businesses.
"That's inappropriate," Mr. Giuliani said. "There's no reason to exact additional taxes from businesses that want to do business in this city. That's a way to discourage business." Without mentioning Ms. Watkins by name, he said arrangements like the one she negotiated "should be part of the past of New York City, not the future, where businesses are expected to make side payments and side deals."
David Parmet, a spokesman for the City Council, said the Council had received the commission's letter and added, "We understand the objections, and we're taking them under consideration."
Ms. Watkins said she did not know how the Council would vote on the proposed deal, an agreement that was all but assured approval before the actions of the Planning Commission and the Corporation Counsel.
"Anything is possible at this point in time," she said. "I have eight days before the vote, and a lot can happen in eight days."
Planning Commission members said they objected to Ms. Watkins's arrangement with Pathmark because it was negotiated as a condition for the Council's approval of Pathmark's request to build the 65,000-square-foot commercial building in an area zoned for industrial uses.
"This was bad policy," said Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the Planning Commission. "It was inappropriate, and it's something that shouldn't be done in the future." He said similar land-use requests involving proposed Caldor and Kmart stores in the city were scheduled to come before the commission and the Council in coming months.
Mr. Rose said that commission members were sympathetic to the Council's concerns that a large Pathmark supermarket could hurt small businesses in the community.
"But there are ways of addressing the Council's concerns without trying to use the routine land-use review process as a way of squeezing funds out of individual stores that are trying to invest in the city," he said. He noted that the Planning Commission had studied the economic impact of a large supermarket in Springfield Gardens and had determined that it would not have any negative impact.
Pathmark officials declined to take any position on the controversy. "We just hope the issue can be resolved between the Council and the Mayor's office," said Stan Sorkin, a spokesman for Pathmark Stores, based in Woodbridge, N.J.
Calling the deal extortion, Alexander Garvin, a member of the Planning Commission, said the increased project costs would eventually be passed on to customers through higher supermarket prices.
He said other undesirable outcomes included "influence peddling" and the possibility that the deal would scare away other potential developers.
"When government demands amenities not related to a specific development," Mr. Garvin said, "the perception will be that no developer can be certain a project can be approved, even when it complies with zoning requirements."
Other commissioners, however, took less strident stands.
Still, Ms. Watkins was clearly shaken by the accusations. She denied having any hidden agenda when she made the agreement with Pathmark. "It is the epitome of arrogance on the part of certain commissioners to have assumed that there was some ill-begotten gain or some self-serving means," she said.
"There is no harm in disagreeing with people," she added. "But I do have distinct distaste and displeasure for people who cannot disagree without being disagreeable, ornery and ugly about it."

HEADLINE: Stocks End Day Mixed, With Dow Retreating by 21.83

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday, as blue chips faltered in response to a weakening in the bond market. But once more, technology issues bounced ahead.
Though the Treasury Department's auction of 10-year notes had better-than-expected results, there was little follow-through and prices slipped. The 30-year Treasury bond dipped 12/32 and its yield rose to 6.91 percent, from 6.88 percent on Tuesday. 
 "It was a kind of blah stock market," said Peter J. Anderson, senior vice president of American Express Financial Advisers. "I suspect we're setting some sort of top."
In such a setting, the attention of many investors was focused on the first day of trading in Netscape, which was issued at twice its original offering price and yesterday zoomed 30 1/4, to 58 1/4. That surge marked one of the market's most stunning initial public offerings in recent years.
"We were all ga-ga over the Netscape deal," Mr. Anderson said. "We're in a speculative phase, particularly in the I.P.O. and O.T.C. markets."
The Dow Jones industrial average closed near its low of the day at 4,671.49, down 21.83 points. The Philip Morris Companies, one of the best-known stocks in this average, dropped 1 3/8, to 73 1/2, amid reports that President Clinton planned to support Food and Drug Administration efforts to declare nicotine a drug and make the sale of cigarettes to minors subject to new regulation.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also finished down, easing 0.68 point, to 559.71. But the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index gained 7.98 points, to 1,005.10.
Technology issues were the market leaders, stimulated by yesterday's Justice Department announcement that it would take no antitrust action against the Microsoft Corporation before the Aug. 24 introduction of its Microsoft Network on-line service. Microsoft shares jumped 3, to 96 1/2, and was followed by shares of such companies as the Intel Corporation, up 1 3/8, to 66 1/8; the Compaq Computer Corporation, up 1 7/8, to 52, and the Oracle Corporation, up 1 1/16 , to 41.
Drug stocks also advanced in a growth-oriented marketplace. Among them, shares of Pfizer Inc. increased 3/4, to 50 1/8; Merck & Company, 7/8, to 51 1/8, and Schering-Plough, 3/8, to 47 1/8.
Cyclical issues, whose earnings typically rise and fall in keeping with interest rates and the economy, wound up lower. Alcoa shares dropped 3/4, to 56 3/4; those of the International Paper Company, 1/2, to 84 3/4, Caterpillar Inc., 1 1/8, to 65, and the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, 1/2, to 42 7/8. The Morgan Stanley index of cyclical stocks declined 2.63 points, to 348.34.
The regional Bell telephone companies were lower because of profit taking after sharp rises earlier resulting from Congressional action on telecommunications deregulation. Shares of U S West Inc. fell 1 1/8, to 43, and those of the BellSouth Corporation fell 1/2, to 66 1/2.
Another sector that weakened yesterday was the retail stocks, with some analysts indicating concern that profits will continue to sink. Shares of the Dayton Hudson Corporation closed at 75 5/8, down 1; Sears, Roebuck & Company closed at 1/4, down 32 1/2, and Home Depot Inc. closed at 42 3/8, down 1 1/8.
Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange edged above advancing stocks, 1,166 to 1,036. Big Board volume was almost at Tuesday's level, with 303.4 million shares traded, compared with 306.1 million shares the previous day.

HEADLINE: China's Anti-Graft Drive Grows; So Does Graft

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 9

 BODY:
On a rainy Sunday morning this week, 10 rusting luxury cars were lined up in a parking lot outside Beijing's Municipal Library and auctioned off. The presiding official, Yang Baojing, called it a shining moment in China's fight against corruption.
The cars, Mr. Yang said, were confiscated from senior officials in a display of the leadership's determination to rein in excesses in the upper ranks of the Communist Party, which long ago lost its reputation for purity. 
 Yet the auction was probably more an ordinary money-making procedure masquerading as government virtue than an indication of any zeal in cracking down on corruption. Nearly all the cars, three of them Mercedes-Benzes, had over 100,000 miles on their odometers, and each had seen better days.
Despite what Mr. Yang said, they appeared to be cars that senior officials -- complying with a new regulation that officials use domestically produced cars -- would be eager to trade in for a new Chinese-made Audi, the current favorite among the leadership.
If the anti-corruption campaign is netting bigger fish this year than ever before, Chinese officials and Western businessmen say, it is more an indication of corruption's growing pervasiveness than of any official determination to alter the situation that allows graft to flourish.
"The network of gift-giving and favors involves the families of almost every senior leader," a mid-level Chinese official said. "So anyone who tries to move against them immediately runs into resistance."
Traditionally, those disciplined for corruption have been people who run afoul of officialdom, while those who preserve connections with ranking officials go unpunished no matter how bad their crime. Since investigators and court officials take instructions from party officials, no prosecution can proceed without approval from the senior authorities, either at a local or central level.
With an economy growing at breakneck speed and officials involved in many stages of business ventures, corruption has accelerated greatly in the anything-goes economic atmosphere in recent years, the official said.
Small examples abound. A Chinese chief representative of an American company in Beijing complained that she ran into corrupt practices every week. Getting a telephone installed, having an operating license approved and even registering her office all involve cash payoffs, the executive said.
"It's everywhere," the executive said. "I hate it. It's getting worse and worse."
Last week the authorities announced that more than 47,000 officials had been disciplined on corruption charges in the first half of this year, an increase of 7.8 percent over the same period last year. Of those punished, official news reports said, more than 1,801 were division chiefs or magistrates or higher, a 44 percent increase.
Large cases are more common, too. In July, investigators publicized the outline of the largest corruption scandal yet in 46 years of Communist Party rule, a case involving central Government as well as provincial officials.
A well-connected woman in Wuxi, 100 miles west of Shanghai, bilked Government officials and private investors of more than $380 million over five years in a pyramid scheme built on imaginary investments, an official account said.
The woman, Deng Bin, 57, was accused of running an operation that bribed officials in dozens of cities to invest in her company, Xinxing Industrial Corporation, sometimes offering profits in advance. The operation even reached into Beijing's Municipal State Security Bureau, where a senior official lured high-ranking customers into the scheme, before it collapsed last summer when the Wuxi authorities arrested Ms. Deng. She now faces the death penalty.
An even more explosive corruption case came to light in April when the Deputy Mayor of Beijing, Wang Baosen, was found dead in a ravine in Huairou, 35 miles north of Beijing, apparently a suicide.
Mr. Wang was later accused of embezzling $37 million, but a second Chinese official said investigators might find even more by the time they finish looking into a series of Beijing construction projects under Mr. Wang's control that apparently involved huge payoffs to staff at the Beijing Municipal Communist Party Committee, headed by a Politburo member, Chen Xitong.
"It's hard to separate corruption from politics in this case," the official said. "No one doubts that Chen Xitong was dirty, but if only he and the people around him are charged, it will look very political."
Mr. Chen has been a rival of the Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, since the latter won his post in 1989, and is said to have complained in meetings that he was better suited for China's top position than Mr. Jiang.
Mr. Chen's arrest, announced in early July, aroused speculation that Mr. Jiang would open a far-reaching crackdown on corruption, both to clear out political enemies and to earn respect from ordinary Chinese, who almost uniformly express disgust with the level of graft that has spread throughout Chinese society. Yet no more officials have been charged.
It is not clear why Mr. Wang chose to kill himself in Huairou, where the nongovernmental forum of the United Nations Conference on Women is being held next month. But a popular theory in Beijing is that he chose Huairou because he had arranged several villas for senior Chinese leaders there, and wanted to send a signal that if he was blamed for a huge corruption scandal, his superiors had indirect complicity as well.

HEADLINE: More in U.S. Are in Prisons, Report Says

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
The number of Americans under the control of the criminal justice system reached 5 million last year, including a record 1.5 million inmates in Federal and state prisons and local jails and 3.5 million convicted criminals on probation and parole, the Justice Department said today in the most comprehensive report ever done on the scope of law-enforcement network.
If the current trend continues -- as law-enforcement experts and criminologists interviewed today predicted it would -- the number of Americans behind bars or on probation or parole will soon approach the six million students enrolled full-time in four-year colleges and universities nationwide; within a decade the number of people behind bars will exceed the entire New York City population, currently about 7.3 million. 
 During 1994, the number of inmates in Federal, state and local prisons increased by more than 1,600 a week, and the number of people incarcerated at year's end had tripled since 1980, according to the study, by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a research arm of the Justice Department.
There are wide divergences among experts on how fast the prison population will grow, with estimates depending both on the crime rate and changes in legislation. This year, for instance, the Republicans' Contract With America calls for providing possibly billions of dollars in Federal financing for state prison construction if states lengthen the required amount of time inmates serve to at least 85 percent of their sentences, a provision that Florida recently met.
Criminologists and politicians today offered conflicting opinions about whether the large increase in the number of Americans behind bars had had any effect on the crime rate. The Federal Bureau of Investigation reported in May that the rate of violent and serious crimes had dropped 3 percent in 1994, the third consecutive year of decline. Some cities, including New York, have reported a significant decrease in homicide.
Representative Bill McCollum, the Florida Republican who is chairman of the House subcommittee on crime, called today's report "encouraging" and said it showed that Congress's efforts to stop crime by lengthening prison sentences and building more prisons were beginning to work.
"If you can get these violent criminals to serve more time, you will inevitably reduce the violent crime rate," Mr. McCollum said. "Anyone who is locked up will not commit a crime."
Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, acknowledged that the increase in imprisonment clearly removed some criminals from the streets and meant that fewer murders would be committed. But he said that since 1985 there had been only a 10 percent reduction in the homicide rate among adults over the age of 24, a disproportionately small gain when measured against the vast increase in the number of prisoners.
"We should think very hard about the trade-off" between the tripling in the prison population and the relatively small decrease in crime, Professor Blumstein said.
Today's report found that there were 95,034 people in Federal prisons at the end of 1994, with 958,704 in state prisons. The total represented an overall increase of 9 percent compared with 1993, which was the second largest yearly increase on record.
Allen J. Beck, an author of the report, said there were another 483,717 people locked up in city and county jails at the end of 1994. Most inmates in local jails at any given time are awaiting trial or have been sentenced to terms of a year or less.
There were widespread variations by region in rates of incarceration, the report found. Southern states had the highest per capita rate of incarceration, 451 per 100,000 residents, while the Northeast had the lowest rate, 285 per 100,000 residents. During 1994, Texas led the nation in the growth of its state prison population with an increase of 28 percent, followed by Georgia with a 20 percent increase.
The report offered conflicting evidence about whether many of those being arrested are simply drug users instead of serious, violent criminals, as some critics of America's crime policy have charged. The study showed that between 1980 and 1993, the number of people imprisoned for violent offenses grew by 221,200 nationwide, while those convicted on drug charges increased by 167,000.
But at the same time the report found that from 1980 to 1993 the percentage of drug offenders in state prisons rose to 26 percent from 8 percent, while the proportion of drug offenders in Federal prisons soared to 60 percent from 25 percent.
John J. DiIulio Jr., professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton University, said that the report had overlooked an important development: that violent criminals are gradually being made to serve a greater proportion of their sentences. In 1988, he said, violent offenders served only 43 percent of their sentences, compared with 51 percent today. "This is good news and will account for tens of millions of serious crimes averted," Professor DiIulio said.
But Jerome G. Miller, the director of the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives, said that today's report was discouraging because it showed that "the percentage of Americans going in and out of jails is phenomenal" and that "as you go down the socio-economic scale the percentage gets much higher." America, Mr. Miller asserted, is relying too heavily on imprisonment as a way to stop crime, and the criminal justice system is turning the majority of impoverished minorities in the inner cities into criminals.
Almost three quarters of the new admissions to prisons are now black or Hispanic, Mr. Miller said, and if present trends continue, he asserted, by 2010, "we will have the absolute majority of all African-American males between age 18 and 40 in prisons and camps."
Today's report, though not addressing the racial breakdown of new admissions to prison, confirms that between 1980 and 1993 the proportion of inmates in state and Federal prisons who were black rose to 50.8 percent from 46.5 percent, while the proportion of prisoners of Hispanic descent almost doubled to 14.3 percent from 7.7 percent.
"The effects of relying so heavily on the criminal justice system have not been looked at," Mr. Miller said, "but it explains a lot of things." When so many poor families have a father, brother, uncle or son who has been arrested at one time or another, Mr. Miller said, "It makes it very hard to organize them against the criminal element."

HEADLINE: Spy Photos Indicate Mass Grave At Serb-Held Town, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
The United States said today that it had spy photographs that it planned to make public of what appears to be a mass grave outside the Bosnian town of Srebrenica, where thousands of Muslim men and boys have been missing since they were rounded up after Bosnian Serbs seized the area last month.
The photographs, from spy satellites and U-2 planes, coupled with interviews with Muslim refugees who fled after Srebrenica's capture, provide the most compelling circumstantial evidence that Serbian troops executed at least several hundred military-age men and boys as part of an ethnic-cleansing campaign, Administration officials said. 
 "We've got some evidence from sensitive sources that tend to corroborate accounts of atrocities against the Bosnian men and boys who were prevented from leaving Srebrenica," David T. Johnson, a State Department spokesman, said today.
The chief United States delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, plans to present the evidence to the Security Council on Thursday. News organizations have reported refugees' grisly accounts of murders, rapes and other atrocities from Srebrenica. What are new are the reconnaissance photographs and a tip from a witness who knew of the mass graves, Administration officials said.
According to one American official who has seen the photographs, one shows hundreds and perhaps thousands of Muslim men and boys in a field near a soccer stadium about 5 miles north of Srebrenica. Another photo taken several days later shows a large area of freshly dug earth, consistent with the appearance of known mass graves, near the stadium, which is empty.
The International Red Cross has said at least 6,000 people are unaccounted for since the fall of Srebrenica. One senior American official said the graves in the aerial photographs could hold "many hundreds" of bodies. It is unclear how many of the other missing people are in hiding, dead or in refugee camps.
The timing of the Administration's disclosure of the photos, which Mr. Clinton discussed with his national security advisers on Monday, coincided with a new American plan to broker peace in the Balkans. Anthony Lake, the President's national security adviser, arrived in London today to begin talks with European allies.
One senior Administration official acknowledged that the photos "put some pressure on the Serbs and shows people we are watching them."
"People have to know what's going on," the official added. "We don't want people to think we're sitting on evidence."
The Administration said Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck had gathered evidence of Serb atrocities during a visit to central and northeastern Bosnia last week.
Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Shattuck "was presented with evidence of egregious human rights violations committed by Bosnian Serb forces in the aftermath of their attack on Srebrenica and Zepa."
"The Assistant Secretary heard eyewitness accounts of mass executions, beatings, rape and other flagrant violations of human rights and international humanitarian law," Mr. McCurry said, adding that the evidence would be turned over to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
The Central Intelligence Agency's Deputy Director for Intelligence, John Gannon, told a Senate hearing today that American intelligence had found a clear pattern of "ethnic cleansing" by the Bosnian Serbs since 1992.
He said that a C.I.A. analysis showed that more than 3,000 settlements, mainly in Serb-controlled areas of Bosnia, have been burned or destroyed and that up to 90 percent of non-Serbs will have no homes to return to.
As Administration officials in Washington discussed the reconnaissance photos, Mr. Lake and senior Defense and State Department officials prepared for talks with European allies on a new peace proposal for the Balkans.
American officials disclosed new details of the plan, which one top aide described as "a series of sticks and carrots" for the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Muslims.
While Washington still favors a plan that gives the Muslim-controlled Bosnian Government 51 percent of the territory, the new proposal would give the Serbs the last remaining eastern Government enclave, Gorazde, in exchange for more valuable territory around Sarajevo.
To entice the warring parties to settle, the plan would lift economic sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs and promise a "mini-Marshall plan" of post-war economic aid to the Bosnian Muslims, an American official said. The United States and other Western nations would also help the Government build a military strong enough to defend its new borders.
If the deal falls through and the allies blame the Serbs, the plan calls for lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government and launching air strikes against Serbian targets. If the Muslims are blamed for any failure, the United Nations peacekeeping forces would withdraw and leave the Muslims to their own devices.
If the new American peace effort succeeds, several thousand United States troops would be committed to a heavily armed NATO force to guarantee the plan, Administration officials said.
This planning has been in place for nearly two years, but until recently has not been much of an issue. But Croatia's successful military offensive against the Serbs and a split within the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs has presented an opportunity for a diplomatic settlement and forced the Pentagon to refine details on how to enforce it.
There are still several hurdles to clear before peace breaks out in the Balkans. Some Administration officials voiced skepticism that any deal was imminent. The European allies have to agree on the details. More important, the Serbs and Muslims must concur, which is far from certain.
"It has to be pursued in number of capitals," a senior Administration official said.
But if a durable peace is negotiated and Congress agrees to send troops, American forces would join a large NATO force to monitor Bosnian borders. Until the recent Croatian military offensive, NATO planners had estimated it would take as many as 35,000 NATO troops -- half of them American -- to enforce a Bosnia peace plan.
Pentagon officials said today that the loss of two eastern enclaves to the Serbs and the Croatian advances would mean there would be less territory to monitor and fewer troops, but they declined to say how many might now be required.
"Under the old plan, NATO would have done disarming and collecting heavy weapons," said a senior Pentagon planner. "This new initiative has much more limited tasks, like separating factions and providing some sort of protective envelope for the Bosnian Muslims."
The Pentagon official said the Administration "hasn't crystallized around any numbers, but it will be a smaller force with fewer missions."
"It all depends on how they the draw the map, where they put forces and what tasks would be assigned to them," the official added.
American officials say any NATO military involvement in Bosnia would most likely be measured in months, not years. "We are looking more to a Haiti model," a senior Administration official said.

HEADLINE: Severe Water Crisis Ahead for Poorest Nations in Next 2 Decades

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 9

 BODY:
In many of the world's poorest countries, a combination of industrialization without pollution controls, persistent population growth and the continued subsidizing of the cost of water for farmers is hastening the onset of a severe water crisis over the next decade or two, a World Bank study reported this week.
The report said 80 countries with 40 percent of the world's population already have water shortages that could cripple agriculture and industry. 
 "We already have 40 percent of the world's population living on rivers shared by more than one country," Ismail Serageldin, the World Bank's vice president for Environmentally Sustainable Development, said in an interview this week. "Many of the wars in this century were about oil, but wars of the next century will be over water."
Water supplies are increasingly contaminated in many regions, adding to the threat of disease. About 95 percent of the world's urban areas dump raw sewage into rivers and other bodies of water, the report said. Dirty water may be killing 10 million or more people every year and causing untold economic damage.
"Over the next 10 years, $600 billion to $800 billion will be needed for water projects in developing countries," said Mr. Serageldin, who is Egyptian. The World Bank, the largest spender on such projects, will be able to muster only $30 billion to $40 billion, he added.
The most dangerous situation is in the Middle East and North Africa, the report said. From 1960 to 2025, if present trends in population growth and water use continue, the water supply per capita will have fallen from 3,430 cubic meters to 667 cubic meters in that region. That would be an 80 percent drop in the renewable water supply in a lifetime.
In the industrial world, pressure from environmentalists is putting the largest strain on supplies. The report noted that in California, the fish and wildlife habitats, wetlands and recreational waters in lakes and rivers now use 45 percent of total resources, compared with 42 percent for agriculture.
Another recent report, produced for the International Food Policy and Research Institute in Washington, noted that California had introduced successful "water marketing" programs in problem years, during which farmers were given incentives to conserve water and sell the excess to cities.
Chile has also introduced water marketing programs, according to the same study. A Chilean farmer who can cut water use by less than a third on about 80 acres can earn up to $10,000 in extra income without reducing crop yields.
At the World Bank, Mr. Serageldin said developing countries should be encouraged to manage water resources more effectively from the grass roots up. He said pilot projects in Mexico and Pakistan had proved that incentives and powers delegated to local associations -- neighborhoods, farming cooperatives and other small-scale groups -- paid large dividends in conservation.
At the same time, the practice of providing cheap water through subsidies will have to be curtailed, Mr. Seralgedin said. Cheap water not only encourages waste but also takes pressure off governments to develop alternate supplies.
Mr. Serageldin said that in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, for example, the Government was still subsidizing well-drilling although the ground-water levels were falling every year. In the Punjab region, the heart of India's "green revolution," the once-rich agricultural land could begin turning to desert within two decades.

HEADLINE: Dole Courts Conservatives With Changes On Welfare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Senator Bob Dole said today that he was picking up additional Republican support for his bill to overhaul the nation's welfare system, would call it up again soon after Labor Day and would probably tack it onto sweeping legislation to balance the Federal budget.
While Democrats celebrated their success in forcing the majority leader to postpone action on welfare, Mr. Dole, the front-running candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1996, was negotiating today with conservative Republicans, hoping to attract their support with tougher measures to discourage out-of-wedlock births. 
 Mr. Dole said today that he had deferred action on the bill so he could "find enough Republican support" to pass the bill next month, either as a free-standing piece of legislation or as a part of an omnibus spending bill.
In an interview today, Ralph Reed, executive director of the Christian Coalition, said, "The Senate Republican leadership failed to fully appreciate the significance and centrality of the religious conservative constituency in this debate, and the depth of its commitment on the issue."
Senator John Ashcroft, Republican of Missouri, spoke for many conservatives and a few liberals when he said today, "Illegitimacy is a threat to the survival of our nation and our culture."
Mr. Ashcroft and Mr. Reed endorsed a bill sponsored by one of Mr. Dole's rivals for the nomination, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas. It would offer a bonus to states that reduce out-of-wedlock births and would prohibit states from increasing welfare checks for women who have additional children while receiving welfare.
But if Mr. Dole mollifies the conservatives, he risks alienating moderate Republicans who are demanding other changes in his bill, like more money for child care. They also want to encourage states to continue spending their own money on welfare, at current levels, as a condition of getting Federal welfare aid.
Rahm I. Emanuel, a White House aide coordinating strategy on welfare, said he was distressed to see Mr. Dole trying to placate the conservatives. "There is a potential bipartisan agreement to be found here," Mr. Emanuel said. "But every time Dole plays Presidential politics with welfare reform, it gets stalled."
Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, Democrat of Illinois, said: "I am delighted that the Republicans are squabbling among themselves and we've delayed consideration of this legislation. The best antidote to the majority leader's punitive, Draconian proposal is sunshine. Let the American people see what's in the bill."
In the stylized combat now common on Capitol Hill, senators today held three news conferences to debate welfare. At 11 A.M., the Democrats attacked the Republicans. Then at 1 P.M., the Republicans counterattacked. At 3 P.M., the Democrats hit back, saying Mr. Dole had misrepresented the Democratic proposals offered as an alternative to his bill.
Democrats denounced Mr. Dole's bill on the ground that it would require parents who receive welfare to take jobs without providing any guarantee of child care. The Democrats maintain that the Federal Government should require states to guarantee child care, for children under the age of 13, if parents are on welfare and need such care so they can take jobs.
The Democrats, like the Republicans, said they intended to impose a five-year limit on welfare payments to any family. But the Republicans said that the Democrats' time limit was virtually meaningless because their bill would explicitly exempt any family that "resides in an area with an unemployment rate exceeding 7.5 percent." As a result, Mr. Dole said, people in cities like New York, Detroit, Los Angeles and Washington could continue receiving welfare year after year, generation after generation.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, defended the proposed exception. "If you live in an area of high unemployment, exceeding 7.5 percent," he said, "you're exempt. You must work, but we are just saying that we won't throw you out in the street if it's likely that there are no jobs where you live."
After Mr. Daschle finished firing his salvos at the Republicans, Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, offered a cease-fire. "I promise not to trash their bill if they promise to quit trashing ours," said Mr. Breaux, and he proposed "high-level negotiations between the two parties."
Mr. Dole said that President Clinton "talked to me privately about working out something on welfare reform" a few weeks ago, but he gave no details.

HEADLINE: Timber Industry Ally Wields Power in Senate

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Senator Frank H. Murkowski has long been an advocate for the timber industry in his home state of Alaska. As the new chairman of the Senate's Natural Resources Committee, he is in a position of influence over the nation's forests unimaginable for a Republican when the Democrats controlled Congress.
Mr. Murkowski has seized the opportunity to introduce legislation that would increase logging in the Tongass National Forest, the vast expanse of islands and lush valleys that covers most of the Alaska Panhandle. The bill would also give a financial lift to a company in which Mr. Murkowski has a personal financial interest: the Ketchikan Pulp Company. 
 To help push the legislation through, Mr. Murkowski has hired as a Senate aide the former chief lobbyist for the timber industry, Mark E. Rey, who now heads the staff of the subcommittee on forests.
The atmosphere in Washington has seldom been more favorable toward business. Some critics said today that Mr. Murkowski's bill provided a clear example of the heightened influence of business interests in the drafting and passage of legislation.
Mr. Rey, the former vice president of the American Forest Products Association, sat next to Mr. Murkowski today at what was to have been a hearing on the legislation. Mr. Murkowski had downgraded the session to a "workshop" late Tuesday night after the Governor of Alaska, Tony Knowles, a Democrat, issued a statement denouncing the bill. Because the session was not an official hearing, no record will be made of either the statements of support or the angry denunciations of opponents, who were furious that they had flown in from Alaska for an event that turned out to have little significance.
Whether Mr. Murkowski will be able to push the legislation through in the face of formidable opposition not only from the Governor's office but from some local officials, fishermen and others worried about wildlife and pollution from some in his home state was unclear today.
He seemed to have underestimated the strength of the opposition or overestimated his newly acquired power. And his personal and political ties to the timber industry have provided his opponents with the ammunition to raise a thicket of ethical questions.
"Obviously, this is a direct conflict of interest and we recommend that he put a distance between himself and this legislation," said Bart Koehler, the executive director of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council. "He shouldn't be working on legislation that directly benefits this pulp mill."
Mr. Murkowski declined to discuss his stock holdings today when he was asked about the matter by a reporter.
Financial disclosure statements filed with the Senate show that on May 1, 1992, Mr. Murkowski bought $1,001 to $15,000 worth of stock in the Louisiana Pacific Corporation, which owns Ketchikan Pulp, now the only timber processer in the area. That stock is now worth $15,001 to $50,000, according to Mr. Murkowski's latest filing.
The Tongass bill, sponsored by Mr. Murkowski and Alaska's other Senator, Ted Stevens, would require the United States Forest Service to provide enough timber to support 2,400 jobs in southeast Alaska, where the state's timber industry is centered. Employment in the industry has fallen to about 1,500 since 1990, when comprehensive legislation on management of the Tongass was passed.
The Murkowski-Stevens proposal is highly unusual because it would force the Forest Service to put jobs ahead of all other considerations, including pollution and wildlife concerns. If enacted, the proposal would make the Tongass the only national forest where jobs were the pre-eminent consideration.
Mr. Murkowski said today that he had canceled the hearing on the bill because it was clear that there was widespread misunderstanding about what the legislation would do.
Mr. Murkowski has apparently violated no Senate rules or broken any laws in relation to the Tongass issue and his finances. He has publicly disclosed his personal holdings on his annual statements to the Senate each year. He also has reported holdings of more than $1 million in the First Bank of Ketchikan, whose overall health is dependent on the area's economy.
"Even if it is not illegal, senators should consider it unethical if they fail to recuse themselves from doing anything but voting on issues that affect their personal assets," said Michael Calabrese, the director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch.
"In an era when we have widely held and diversified stock funds, I see no reason why members should have large individual stock holdings," Mr. Calabrese said. Those who do should refrain from acting on issues that could affect their stocks, he added.
More troubling to some is an apparent increase in the involvement of business interests in the drafting of legislation. Such influence has been a fact of life to some degree since Congress passed its first law.
"It seems to be happening much more commonly and brazenly," Mr. Calabrese said. Not only are members of the new majority turning to the lobbyisyts to write the legislation, but also hiring lobbyists directly on staff to shepherd it through."
The practice has come to be known as the "reverse revolving door."
Mr. Rey said his background with the timber industry was irrelevant to his new job in the Senate. He said his appointment to the committee staff was "no more or less appropriate" than the Clinton Administration's appointment of George Frampton, the former head of the Wilderness Society as Assistant Secretary of the Interior.
"We were hired to be public servants," Mr. Rey said, "and that is what we are.

N.B.A. Owners Settled Rather Than Risk More

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
When he announced the deadline-beating deal between the National Basketball Association and its union, Commissioner David Stern said the agreement was riskier for the owners than the first deal the two sides made in vain in June.
The economic risks Stern sees for the owners, though, would appear to be potentially less damaging than other risks they would face without an agreement. If the league and the union can sell the six-year agreement to a majority of their players, it would kill decertification and antitrust litigation, two roads fraught with uncertainties larger than New York potholes in the winter. 
 The deal isn't the one Stern and the N.B.A. owners wanted, but it at least has plunged people active in the decertification movement into a wait-and-see posture. Arn Tellem and Marc Fleisher, two active agents in the effort to decertify the union, said yesterday that they will reserve judgment on the agreement until they see the details.
"Everyone at this point has an open mind," Tellem said by telephone from Los Angeles. "I'm not going to prejudge it in any way. I think that's how my players are. They're hoping it's a good deal. If it turns out to be a deal that the players feel positive about, my sense is decertification will go away."
N.B.A. negotiators did not press for some of their demands in a four-hour bargaining session Tuesday night, the first since talks broke off Thursday, because they wanted to make a deal, end their six-week lockout of the players and insure the playing of the coming season.
"We're confident that sometime in December or January we could make a much better deal than we made last night," said Russ Granik, the league's deputy commissioner and chief negotiator. "But we know what damage would be done to the business."
League officials had said repeatedly they would not lift the lockout and start the season without an agreement. The union leadership obviously took them at their word. But the dissident players would have forged ahead with decertification and with the antitrust lawsuit scheduled for an initial hearing in Federal court in Minneapolis Sept. 6.
Now, if the majority of players like the agreement, they will vote to maintain the union as their collective bargaining representative. Without decertification, the lawsuit almost certainly would die because court decisions have favored ongoing bargaining relationships between leagues and unions.
"It's wise for the league to have taken this tact," said a lawyer who works the union side of the labor fence. "First of all, they're a much more sympathetic defendant in a lawsuit, and they have a second shot at the players. The litigation route, for all their bravado about how players are getting bad legal advice, was not without very significant legal risk to them."
The league, the lawyer added, faced the risk of treble damages over the lockout. "Stern made a judgment," the lawyer said. " 'I'll sweeten the deal a little bit to end this so I don't subject myself to treble damages, the loss of revenue, public relations damage to the sport and legal fees.' "
While Stern emphasized the importance of playing the season and continuing the league's record of never having lost a game to labor strife, he said: "I didn't want to face the risk of what decertification would bring. What we need to be, players and owners, is successful. This is not about who's either stronger or more right."
Dissident players and their agents were vehemently critical of the June 21 deal, which the player representatives subsequently rejected by refusing to vote on ratification. They were uncharacteristically reserved in their reaction to the second agreement because they hadn't seen the details.
Fleisher said if the deal is good for the players, "we're all going to applaud the improvements in it." If, on the other hand, it's viewed as a bad deal, "the players will fight for decertification."
Tellem said he would evaluate the agreement on one primary issue: Is the payroll cap a hard cap? "If veterans have no ability to move from one team to another because of the cap," he said, "then I will recommend to my players that they oppose it."
After talking with some players, the agent said, he found that the issue on everyone's mind is "how will this affect free agency."
Keith Askins of the Miami Heat is not on the level of Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing, who have led the decertification movement.
"I don't know what Patrick or Michael want out of the deal," he said yesterday, "but for me, being one of the blue collar, middle class workers in this league, I think it's a good deal. I think it benefits everybody."
Askins said he had spoken to a teammate, Bimbo Coles, and reported that "he also likes the deal."
Simon Gourdine, the union's executive director, did not return a telephone call seeking comment on his plans for a players' vote on the agreement. Charles Smith of the Knicks, a union vice president, said he did not know if Gourdine planned to have a vote before the decertification vote Aug. 30 and Sept. 7.
"We plan on getting information out to the guys and see what happens from there," Smith said.
None of the players, though, has seen all of the details because they haven't been circulated.
The league eliminated the luxury tax that appeared in the June 21 agreement and agreed to three items the union leadership said the players wanted:
*A $1 million exception for teams over the payroll cap to sign free agents (a team can use the exception three times in the six-year life of the agreement but not two years in a row).
*Restoration of the exception that allows a team to replace an injured player at 50 percent of the player's salary, though only up to the league average.
*Addition of a modified Larry Bird exception for players competing two seasons with the same team (salary increase in the first year of a new contract would be the greater of the average salary or a 75 percent raise for a player already above the average).
The league dropped its demand for the minimum payroll to be 60 percent of the payroll cap, leaving it at the 75 percent ratio included in the June 21 agreement, down from 80 percent in the expired agreement.
The league reduced its previous position on adjustments to the cap if the collective payroll exceeds the players' percentage of the league's basketball related income. After the first three years of the agreement, if the teams exceed 50.13 percent of the income, the cap would be adjusted downward the following season up to $500,000 a team.
As an alternative, the owners could reopen the agreement after three years.

HEADLINE: SENIOR ARMY AIDES TO IRAQ PRESIDENT DEFECT TO JORDAN

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Two of Saddam Hussein's sons-in-law who were among the Iraqi leader's closest aides have defected to Jordan with their wives and a number of senior army officers, Jordanian officials said today.
The defections represented the hardest internal blow yet to the iron rule of President Hussein. 
 The defectors include Lieut. Gen. Hussein Kamel, the husband of President Hussein's eldest daughter, Raghad. General Kamel oversaw Iraq's buildup of missiles and chemical and biological weapons, and Iraq's nuclear research program.
Another defector is Hussein Kamel's brother, Col. Saddam Kamel, who is married to President Hussein's daughter Rana. Colonel Kamel was in charge of Iraq's special forces.
The Kamels are also cousins of President Hussein and members of the sprawling clan that forms Iraq's inner governing circle.
The defections underline serious and growing divisions among the sons, brothers, cousins and close relatives of the President who have come to rule Iraq since its defeat in the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
[President Clinton pledged that the United States would protect Jordan against any retaliation from Iraq, and he praised the King of Jordan for granting political asylum to the members of Saddam Hussein's family. Page A10.]
An Iraqi opposition figure said today that the defectors left Iraq on the pretext of an official visit to Bulgaria, which began with a 14-hour drive from Baghdad to Amman, apparently to take an onward flight. But it is not clear how such a large party escaped detection on the highway to Jordan, the sole land link that Iraq is permitted under United Nations sanctions.
Jordanian officials said the defectors fled on Tuesday, arriving here that night, and immediately requested political asylum, which King Hussein promptly granted at an audience in his palace.
"Two daughters of President Saddam Hussein and their husbands, Hussein and Saddam Kamel, met with King Hussein on Tuesday and made a personal plea for asylum, which was granted to them immediately," Jordan's Foreign Minister, Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti, said today.
[American officials in Washington said the defectors included some of Saddam Hussein's grandchildren.]
An Iraqi opposition figure, speaking here on condition of anonymity, said today that a third son-in-law of President Hussein, Maj. Ezzedine Mohammed Hassan, who is married to Hala, another daughter of the Iraqi President, had also defected, but this could not be verified.
Mr. Hussein has been very circumspect about his private life and little is known about his family. He is known to have two sons, Uday and Qosay, and the three daughters, of whom Raghad is the eldest.
Iraq made no comment today's on the defections. But the Government press agency did note that General Kamel had been dismissed this week as head of military industrialization.
And President Hussein sent his elder son, Uday, to Amman, where he met with King Hussein today, apparently to attempt a reconciliation or to find ways to limit the damage from the defections. In announcing the meeting, Jordanian television said that it was brief and that Uday Hussein had left to return to Iraq.
In announcing the defections, the Jordanian Government made a point of saying the Iraqis would have the protection of King Hussein, who is unrelated to the Iraqi President but who sided with Baghdad in the gulf war. In the past three years, King Hussein has distanced himself from Iraq, criticizing the Government's human rights record and calling for democracy.
The Foreign Minister, Mr. Kabariti, said he did not know the official reason for Uday Hussein's visit. But other officials expressed skepticism about the chance of reversing the defections or of getting much cooperation from King Hussein regarding sending the return of the defectors.
The whereabouts of the defectors was kept secret, but a large fleet of Mercedes Benzes with Iraqi license plates were seen this afternoon outside a Government guest palace.
The Iraqi press agency's announcement of the dismissal of General Kamel followed widespread reports of serious clashes with President Hussein's two sons. The President has allowed his sons' authority to displace that of other relatives in the ruling circle.
Uday Hussein has spread his role to all matters of policy, economy and administration; Qosay Hussein has taken over security services. The brothers are widely referred to in Iraq as the "Number 2" and "Number 3" in the Government.
In addition to the brothers, Mr. Kabariti said, "a large number of army officers was also granted asylum." In what appeared to be a warning to Iraq to refrain from any attempts to interfere, he added that Jordan had guaranteed the safety of all the Iraqis.
In the past, Iraq has sent agents to intimidate, monitor and sometimes attack defectors here. In 1992 a nuclear scientist who defected was assassinated on an Amman street.
About 30,000 Iraqis live in Amman. Many who fled for political reasons are Sunni Muslim technocrats, scientists and administrators who once formed the backbone of support for the Iraqi Government.
In recent months, despite high fees for exit visas, the flow of Iraqi refugees to Jordan, especially Sunni Muslims, has increased. Jordan allows Iraqis to enter without obtaining visas in advance.
"It seems the inner circle is deteriorating," said Kamel Abu Jaber, a former Jordanian Foreign Minister. "It's obvious the leadership is cracking."
Earlier this year, there were open clashes among the wider circle of supporters that has always formed the base of support for President Hussein's rule, particularly among Sunni Muslims and clans affiliated with his family. This group, which numbers in the hundreds of thousands, was the main source of staff members for sensitive positions in the army and intelligence and security services.
In May and June, after the execution of army officers from two major clans, the Dulaimis and the Jabours, military members of these tribes rebelled, demanding compensation and going so far as to mount small armed mutinies. President Hussein responded by ordering the arrest and dismissal of hundreds of men from these clans, further damaging his ties to an important component of his power base.
President Hussein has shown an increasingly unsteady hand in dealing with such rebellions, which have become more frequent as the economy has deteriorated under pressure of United Nations sanctions.
In a speech some weeks ago, President Hussein compared himself to the captain of a ship of mutineers, and vowed to deal ruthlessly with anyone challenging his authority. Last week he offered amnesty to political dissenters, but the opposition immediately dismissed the move as a ruse.
Some Iraqi opposition figures said today that General Kamel was such an important figure in Iraq that should he mount a political threat to President Hussein, the threat would be serious. But others maintained that General Kamel is widely hated in Iraq, and that he commanded no power base except among technocrats, who would be unable to mount a significant rebellion against President Hussein.
Furthermore, as a senior Jordanian official noted tonight, it is far from clear whether the Kamels or the daughters of President Hussein could ever cooperate with either the Shiite Muslims or the Kurds who actively oppose the Baghdad Government, or with Western powers that are trying to bring down President Hussein.
General Kamel could be of vital assistance to a United Nations team that is dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. But Rolf Ekeus of Sweden, chairman of the team, today deflected questions about whether he would meet with General Kamel.

HEADLINE: Newark Lures New Teachers By Hundreds

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Colleen Johnson had tried several times to get a teaching job in Newark's public schools, but before the state takeover last month, she had always been turned away.
"When you went to personnel you were told they were not accepting applications and they never advertised," Ms. Johnson said. "I always wanted to teach in Newark but I didn't know anyone, so I never made it." 
 She was not alone. Applicants had become so discouraged that the new state administrators who took over the troubled Newark public schools last month were not entirely sure how many candidates would show up for a one-day job fair aimed at filling the district's 130 teaching vacancies.
They were nearly swamped by the turnout today. Lines started to form around 7 A.M., two hours before the doors opened at the Rafael Hernandez Elementary School; by the end of the day, 1,400 teaching candidates had showed up. As the wait for a 20-minute interview stretched past four hours, state officials were on the phone begging the printers to rush them more applications and volunteers brought in to read brief application essays were instead pressed into service interviewing candidates.
Applicants hung on without benefit of lunch or even coffee, some pointing out that any jobs, much less jobs with a salary range of $31,000 to $69,000, were hard to come by in a city with an unemployment rate over 13 percent. Others said that they thought the takeover would allow them to do something good for children for the first time and that the wide-open application process showed a new leadership intent on ridding the system of the nepotism and cronyism that state officials have charged plague the schools here.
"This is the first year of the takeover so I want to be involved with the changes from the start," said Joseph McMorris, 26, an applicant who now heads the English Department at East Harlem Performing Arts, a Manhattan junior high school.
Dr. Beverly L. Hall, who took over as acting superintendent in Newark on July 17, toured the school today to inspect the application process, stopping at about half a dozen of the 60 tables in the library and the gymnasium where interviews were being conducted.
"This is unbelievable," said Dr. Hall, after joking that she was there to sign up. Dr. Hall said that the job fair was initially intended to speed up the process of finding enough teachers for school to start on time Sept. 11, but the fact that many excellent candidates were discovered meant that the emphasis had shifted somewhat.
"That is going to be the challenge, narrowing it down to the best, but it is good to have a choice," she said, noting that the job fair had attracted candidates from as far away as Washington, D.C. and Massachusetts.
Those to get positions will be called within two weeks, and an additional pool will be put on a waiting list to fill vacancies throughout the year, said Dr. Barbara Anderson, an assistant state Commissioner of Education who is part of the takeover team.
The takeover was the culmination of a 10-year monitoring process that showed an administration more interested in free cars and other trappings of office than in improving the low test scores and decaying buildings. Newark is New Jersey's largest district with 82 schools, 47,500 students and a budget of more than $540 million.
The people conducting the interviews said that the best candidates were those who answered the questions directly and brought a little spark to their responses. Questions included how they might react to teaching in an urban setting like Newark and how they would discipline unruly children.
Some impressed the interviewers by showing up with lesson plans or telling them about their own studies toward higher degrees. Those who were not likely to make it spoke in monotones or said things like they would discipline children by writing a report on them.
"A guy like that would not survive in Newark," said Houston Stevens, the head of the P.T.A. at University High School and one of about 60 parents participating in the interviews.
Newark parents said they were encouraged that the state administrators asked them to participate, with one parent sitting at each table along with an employee from the school district and one from the State Department of Education.
Sitting at one table, Ellen Blount said that while the two professionals focused on each candidate's credentials, she tried to figure out what parents would think about handing a child to the person.
Aside from listing their credentials and work experience, the applicants were asked to write a 100-word essay on one of two topics. The first was why they should be selected to work in the Newark public schools, the other was what kind of working relationship they would have with parents, administrators and other teachers.
One man said he would bring "energy, passion and creativity" to the job while on the second topic, another man wrote that giving any one group too much control over a child's education "tilts the equation to a rocky end."
"We want them to write a little from the heart instead of pat answers," said Barbara Scott, a senior Newark administrator who read essays for about 20 minutes before being switched to interviews because of the crush. She said about one in five were rejected for sentences that went on for half a page, wrong tenses or sentence fragments. Such mistakes were grounds for automatic disqualification, administrators said.
Applicants said the competition for teaching jobs in northern New Jersey is fierce, so despite the delays and crowds they were happy that everyone seemed to be getting an equal shot. There are 4,400 teaching jobs in Newark out of a total district staff of 8,000.
Joseph Del Grosso, president of the Newark Teachers Union, said he was surprised and pleased by the heavy turnout.
"In the past the procedure was that if you knew a board member you could get a job," said Mr. Del Grosso, a 26-year veteran of the Newark schools who became head of the union last June. "Before it was a political screening and not an educational screening. This opens up the process."
