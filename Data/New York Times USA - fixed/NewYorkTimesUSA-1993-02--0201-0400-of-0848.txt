HEADLINE: THEATER;
'Heidi Chronicles,' a Woman's Search

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

DATELINE: METUCHEN

 BODY:
IN 1970, Heidi Holland wandered into a women's consciousness-raising session, announced that she was just visiting and insisted that some things, like body hair and love affairs, were too personal to talk about.
Sharing, the buzzword of all groups, had limits for Heidi, who was more concerned with mattering as an individual than with being a member of a movement. Although she loosened up and got into the spirit of female bonding, Heidi never let go of her insistence that humanist was the label of choice, not feminist. 
 In "The Heidi Chronicles," Wendy Wasserstein charts a 24-year search for worthwhileness, from 1965 (when Heidi was in high school) to 1989, when Heidi is a prominent art historian on the lecture circuit.
In the play's professional New Jersey premiere at the Forum Theater Group, more than three years after it snared every theater award in sight, the Pulitzer included, the life-changing choice of Heidi as a single mother at the final curtain -- her wistful speculation that "things will be a little better" for her adopted child -- gains a new perspective. What seemed like an ending of tacked-on sentimentality to some is now right to the point and in step with a renewed sense of hope in the country.
"The Heidi Chronicles" was bracing for Broadway. That the play had a life in the theatrical marketplace is itself an affirmation of literacy and language in the big-time Broadway theater, where Ms. Wasserstein's new, glibber, less substantial play, "The Sisters Rosensweig," is to move next month -- a transfer, like "Heidi," from a small theater designated as Off Broadway.
That this one survives so soundly is an endorsement of the playwright's teasing wit and a generosity of spirit that allows equal time for the cause of two male characters -- the search for "self-fulfillment, self-determination, self-exaggeration."
Scoop Rosenbaum is Heidi's on-and-off lover, whose career as an editor progresses from the radical Liberated Earth News to the trend-setting Boomer magazine and whose character evolves from "charismatic creep" to unfilled idealist.
Peter, Heidi's friend for life, is gay, narcissistic, sarcastic and the leading pediatrician in New York under 40. If Heidi had it all, Peter would be her lover.
Ms. Wasserstein has both men asking for validation, for equal representation and value, and they get it. As Peter challenges Heidi with the question of his own liberation, it is clear that Ms. Wasserstein is not writing with the exclusivity of a single point of view.
And the playwright's deft turns of phrase don't distort her all-encompassing take on having it all, or her look back on protest marches, on those who were convinced that Ronald Reagan was going to be best for the economy, on the women who throw a "power shower" for a pregnant friend.
Ms. Wasserstein is writing from privilege: as Heidi talks of land in Litchfield County and Bucks County, Scoop's present to the baby is a silver spoon. But Heidi's careerism doesn't preclude her perception that "what makes you a person is also what keeps you from being a person" -- and the feeling that all those movements have left her "stranded."
And don't forget the play's crucial element: braininess. "My interest is in images of women from the Renaissance Madonna to the present," Heidi declares, referring to her research on neglected female artists. It is reassuring to find a contemporary play that combines respect for intellectual discipline with talent to amuse audiences.
For all its proven appeal, "The Heidi Chronicles" is a long shot for the Forum, where musicals or plays with Jewish themes are the usual bill of fare. Tossing aside autobiographical associations, Ms. Wasserstein has made a point of saying, "Heidi is not a Jewish girl." Still, the distant sounds of a hora waft through Scoop's wedding scene on a tape made just for Forum audiences.
Peter J. Loewy's passive staging and a passable professional cast serve but do not enhance a play that, thank heaven, can fend for itself. The colors of Heidi are missing in Lori Wilner's overly agreeable performance, and the charm of Scoop needs to be extracted from David Breitbarth's.
Dan Yates as Peter is more than a cliche but less than convincing. Anna Bess Lank, Susie Paplow, Lisa Heilbrunn and Tim Herman seem unfazed by their multiple roles, as is Angela Powers by her single one.
Michael Franklin-White's bland functional set design, topped by the obligatory period images (Richard Nixon, Janis Joplin, Robert Kennedy), provides its own summing up of "The Heidi Chronicles" at the Forum: a top-of-the-line product in a generic packaging.
"The Heidi Chronicles," by Wendy Wasserstein, produced by the Forum Theater Group, 314 Main Street in Metuchen. Performances run  through Feb. 21: Thursday through Saturday, 8 P.M.; Wednesday and Sunday, 2:30 P.M. Ticket information: (908) 548-0582.

HEADLINE: The New Auto Junkyard, Borne by Taxpayers

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
ACROSS the state, municipalities are struggling with a byproduct of the poor economy: the rusting hulks of abandoned automobiles that are littering the landscape.
In all Connecticut cities, officials say, the scene is repeated with increasing frequency: A person who has wrung the last mile out of a car -- often one that has been unregistered for a couple of years, so it is difficult to trace -- pulls up to a curb or drives into a vacant lot or municipal parking garage. The driver pulls off the license plates, removes the parts he wants to keep and walks away, leaving the city with a wreck that could cost hundreds of dollars for towing, storage and disposal. 
 Police departments are finding new crops of clunkers as fast as they can clean out an area, despite efforts in several cities to track down former owners and impose fines and handling fees.
 
'Sprouted Like Mushrooms'
 The traffic commander for the Hartford police, Lieut. Karl A. Spielman, said he had two officers working full time on the problem, towing 5,000 to 6,000 wrecks a year.
"One Monday after a long weekend, we came back to an area we had just cleaned up, and they had sprouted like mushrooms after a bad storm," Lieutenant Spielman said.
In 1990 the Bridgeport Police Department hauled 777 abandoned cars to the junkyard. By last year that number had risen to more than 1,300, and Officer Salvatore A. Licitra of the department's division of abandoned motor vehicles said the number wouldprobably increase again this year. During one recent week, for instance, he said, he picked up 89 abandoned cars.
"I had a 1990 Mercury we brought in recently," Officer Licitra said. "The woman had brought it to her dealer, and he told her it needed $4,000 worth of body work and a new engine, she had abused the car so badly. She never came back for it, and the dealer didn't want it, because the repairs are more than the car was worth."
He continued: "We're scrapping 1988 and 1989 cars regularly. People are running them right into the ground. These four-cylinder cars, if you don't maintain them well, they don't last, and it's expensive to maintain a car."
Occasionally the police see more than just cars. Mayor Frank J. Esposito of Norwalk said that in the last few months his officers have picked up an old house trailer, an abandoned wooden boat -- on a trailer -- and even an old oil-tanker truck.
Robert Smigel, title review officer for the State Department of Motor Vehicles, said about 25,000 abandoned cars were reported in Connecticut last year, but that includes cars left at dealers because the owners could not afford repairs and those that were left after thieves took them on a joy ride. The department does not break out the number that have been left by the side of the road with the license plates removed and the vehicle identification numbers scratched out.
The quantity of abandoned cars has been "increasing statewide about 5 percent or so a year, but I don't know what the reason is," Mr. Smigel said. "It could be just that there are more cars on the road. And I'm sure the economy has had something to do with it."
Municipal officials say the economy is the main reason for the increase. Years ago, junkyards would pay people for old cars so they could salvage the parts, Mayor Esposito said. But with environmental regulations proliferating, junkyards must often be paid to take cars that are only good for scrap.
"A few years ago, we had two companies willing to keep the streets clean and pay us $5 or $10 for every car we had them pick up," he said. "Then they wanted money to take them away. Then they were taking them free. It changes week to week, depending on scrap prices."
 
Price of Steel a Factor
 Lieutenant Spielman agreed: "When the price of steel is up, the cars don't show up. When the price is up, people don't drop them off. But you can tell just looking at the street when the price is down."
Mr. Esposito said: "People used to buy a new car every three or four years. Now people are keeping them for 10 years, until they're falling apart, and no one wants them. And there's no end in sight."
State laws on abandoned cars have changed as the problem has grown. Three years ago it might have taken several weeks and endless paperwork to scrap a car that had been left, stripped and burned, on the side of the road. New state laws expedite the process, making it easy for a town to get rid of cars of little value that are left in one place more than 24 hours. A state fund partly reimburses towns for towing fees.
"The intent was to prevent abandoned cars from becoming a public nuisance," said the Motor Vehicle Department's director of legal services, John Yacavone. "Before the laws were changed, no one wanted to take any responsibility for cleaning them off the street."
Lieutenant Spielman of the Hartford police said the new laws have been helpful. "We didn't have many towing companies that had the 15 or 20 acres they would need to store the vehicles all that time," he said. "There were a lot more administrative hassles for the cities under the old law."
 
Drivers Lose Titles
 But local officials are still frustrated by the growing number of abandoned cars. Police Officer Nick Rendeiro of Naugatuck said that the city's three-year-old towing program scrapped 70 to 80 cars last year and that it would probably be 100 or more this year. The city has also instituted a new program to trace ownership, and when the last owner is found, he is charged $99, plus towing costs and $5 a day for storage.
Officer Rendeiro said Naugatuck determined that some of the cars were abandoned because people had lost the titles and didn't want to go through the bureaucratic maze to replace them. Without the title, an owner cannot even give a car away to a junkyard.
"The junkyard doesn't want to get stuck holding a car that might have been stolen," Officer Rendeiro said. "If you bring a car to me, I can prove it's yours by checking in the computer. We've told people that if they can't get rid of the car, give us the title, pay for the tow service, and we'll take care of it from there."
Mayor Esposito said wrecks turn up everywhere, from Norwalk's finest neighborhoods, to the business district, to cul-de-sacs that see little traffic.
"I can take you into any neighborhood, and you'll find an abandoned car, sooner or later," he said. "One was stripped, left without wheels or anything, at the entrance to the parking lot of a church on a Saturday night. We had to get someone up there with a truck to tow it out, so people could attend services."
Lieutenant Spielman said he has learned to expect abandoned cars in some areas, like Ledyard Street in the south end of Hartford, just around the corner from a junkyard.
"Maybe they found out the junk dealer didn't want them, and they dropped them off rather than take them back home," he said.
Officer Licitra of Bridgeport said: "There are dead areas, places like on the sidewalk under an interstate, where no one sees people dropping them off. I have one street that we have to hit once or twice a week just to keep it clear. Before the holidays I went down that street -- 10 cars with no plates."

HEADLINE: Anticipating Survival After General Motors

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: NORTH TARRYTOWN

 BODY:
SQUARING his shoulders against the bitter wind that was coming off the Hudson River last week, Mayor Frank J. Rey looked down Beekman Avenue at the bustling village center. "Everybody keeps asking me, 'Will there be life after G.M.?' " he said.
"Well, of course there will be," the Mayor said. "And perhaps in the long run, it will be even better." 
 It has been almost a year since General Motors announced it would close its automobile assembly plant here, and Mr. Rey, with other members of a task force appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo last year, has begun looking at alternative uses for the 96.5-acre site, where Walker Steamer cars were produced about 90 years ago.
 
'We Do Have to Get Moving'
 They are also concerned about the fate of 2,200 blue-collar workers who now roll plastic-bodied minivans off computer-driven assembly lines but will be out of jobs once the plant's doors are shut.
"Nineteen ninety-five is coming up fast," the Mayor said. "It's not a crisis yet, but we do have to get moving."
Late last month, the task force met for the fourth time since it was created, and members conceded that their initial efforts to reverse the automaker's decision had failed.
In June, Vincent Tese, the state's director of economic development and chairman of the task force, sent a letter to Robert C. Stempel, who was chairman and chief executive of General Motors at the time, asking the automaker to reconsider its plans to close the factory.
 
Another Automaker May Be Sought
 The response was an unequivocal no, and Mr. Stempel's resignation last fall, along with news that leaders of General Motors had come under criticism for failing to close plants fast enough, further reinforced the decision that the task force would have to move ahead on other fronts.
"We're finally at a point where everyone is rolling up their sleeves and coming to grips with the fact that we have to find a post-G.M. future for North Tarrytown," said Steven Vitoff, a spokesman for Mr. Tese.
But Mr. Rey said the task force took too long and lost precious time reaching what should have been an obvious conclusion early on.
"Why did it take them until January 1993 to realize G.M. was really leaving?" he said. "And now what real plans do they have to offer?"
One option being considered by the task force is the sale of the current plant -- which occupies 2.5 million square feet, or one-and-a-fourth times the area of the World Trade Center in Manhattan -- to another auto manufacturer, although the "immediate buyer-seller dynamic for that is difficult," Mr. Vitoff said.
"It's hard to mount a sales pitch when what we're trying to sell won't be available for two and a half years," he explained.
Another option is legal action -- suing the automaker for pulling out when it obtained local tax benefits eight years ago in return for expanding the North Tarrytown site.
The township of Ypsilanti, Mich., initiated a lawsuit last month, seeking either to forestall closing of the automaker's Willow Run Assembly Plant or to win monetary damages because General Motors was given $13.5 million in tax abatements. But the automaker says that the tax agreement did not constitute a contract to continue operations.
A decision in that case is due shortly, and task force members here are watching it closely to determine whether they will recommend similar action.
The task force is also calling for an environmental assessment of the site, to be paid for by General Motors, to determine whether a clean-up will be necessary before plans for the future can proceed.
But Mr. Rey sees what he calls, "a lot of maybes and little firm action," coming from the task force. "I don't have time to waste," he said, "and, frankly, I feel like I am carrying this big weight all on my shoulders."
For the 52-year-old Mayor, who grew up here as the son of an autoworker, there have been many restless nights since he learned that the plant would close -- and much sifting through old memories.
 
A Gaping Hole Expected
 "I was raised here, and now I am raising my children in this village," said the Mayor, who remembers running down Beekman Avenue after school each day to meet his father as the plant let out and walking home together.
Mayor Rey also remembers how the village grew up around the factory and how the merchants along Beekman Avenue still earn a major part of their living from the trade of autoworkers who buy sandwiches at the luncheonettes and stop for drinks at the bars before heading home.
Not only for the shopkeepers but also for the 8,152 village residents, the automaker's departure will leave a gaping hole economically, the Mayor said. For residents, the plant closing will mean that, unless a new occupant is quickly found, the tax burden that General Motors once bore will soon be theirs.
Under a 1985 agreement that gave General Motors tax-exempt status in return for the company's expanding the plant, the company pays North Tarrytown a fixed amount each year in lieu of taxes. The agreement runs through 1994. For the current fiscal year, that contribution is $1.1 million, 19 percent of the annual budget, said William T. Regan, the Village Administrator.
 
Retraining at Issue
 The automaker is also paying the Union Free Schools of the Tarrytowns $1.8 million toward a $24 million yearly budget.
"The economic impact of the plant closing for us locally is tremendous," said Dr. Donald R. Kusel, the Superintendent of Schools.
Perhaps the greatest impact will be felt by the members of the United Auto Workers, Local 664, who may find it difficult to transfer skills to other jobs.
Although Robert P. Surowiec, a General Motors personnel director in North Tarrytown, said it was "premature" to be talking about retraining workers, a State Labor Department economist disagreed and said major re-education efforts should begin at once to help workers develop new skills in a rapidly changing marketplace.
"If these workers were laid off today, their re-employment prospects would be pretty dim, very poor indeed," said Frank M. Surdey, a regional economist for the State Labor Department, who recommended that the workers "set their sights now on vocational retraining."
 
Some Will Be in Demand
 The outlook for blue-collar jobs in the 1990's suggests that sheet-metal workers, tool and dye mechanics, auto mechanics, auto body repair workers, carpenters and plumbers, for example, will be in demand. And their services will command good hourly wages -- in some cases more than the $20 an hour many now earn with General Motors, Mr. Surdey said.
For an auto worker like Peter Donnelly, a 47-year-old electrician and a benefits representative for the union, the choices could include choosing an early-retirement package, training for a new career or both.
"But we're only talking about $600 a month in retirement," said Mr. Donnelly, who has worked for General Motors for eight years. "So that alone isn't going to be enough to live on. It won't even pay my mortgage."
"In a way, I'm caught in a bind," he said. "Too young to retire, too set to move away and too old to compete with younger workers on the outside. But whatever, if I have to wash dishes to survive, I will."
Some of the 2,200 workers still in North Tarrytown -- about 800 were laid off in August when the plant dropped its second shift -- will be offered the chance to move to other assembly plants, said Margaret G. Holmes, director of public affairs for the automaker's mid-size car division in Detroit.
 
Other Communities Studied
 But if even as few as 1,500 workers find themselves on the unemployment lines once the plant closes, Westchester's jobless rate will surge. Adding 1,500 workers to the 24,700 already unemployed in December, for example, would drive the rate up to 6 percent from 5.6 percent, "a sizable jump," Mr. Surdey said.
With layoffs from many companies expected to continue, Mr. Surdey said that the closing of the North Tarrytown plant is an example of why an economic recovery will "not proceed fully for some time to come."
Meanwhile, Mayor Rey -- along with a task force committee that he formed consisting of government leaders and business people -- is looking at other communities where General Motors has closed plants. The Mayor said he remains optimistic that "a company for the 1990's" will move to the North Tarrytown site.
In Norwood, Ohio, the old General Motors plant was demolished at the automaker's expense and the town built an information-processing center in its place. In Lakewood, Ga., the defunct assembly plant was purchased by a recycler.
"Here we are," Mr. Rey said, "on the shores of the Hudson River, near rail, road and water transportation, near major highways, near airports."
"How about an industrial park or a financial center? This is a great location. So, I ask the question again, 'Is there going to be life after G.M.?' Well, there's no doubt in my mind."

HEADLINE: U.S. WILL DRAW UP A STRATEGY TO AID EX-SOVIET STATES

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration intends to create a supercommittee in the State Department to shape a unified strategy toward Russia and the other former Soviet republics, but has no intention of immediately increasing foreign aid to the area, senior Administration officials say.
In an effort to avoid what it considers President Bush's haphazard approach to the problem, the Administration has chosen Strobe Talbott, a journalist and author who has written extensively about the Soviet Union, to head the committee in his capacity as Ambassador-at-Large to Russia and the other newly independent republics. 
 Although Mr. Talbott is said to advocate an aggressive diplomatic campaign to promote reform and reduce the threat of nuclear weapons, he prefers a cautious approach on committing new aid, officials familiar with his thinking said.
 
A Focus on Russia
 The Administration, despite its early attention to crises in Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti and Iraq, has already begun to characterize the fate of Russia as the country's most important national security problem in the next decade.
If Russia disintegrates, the argument goes, it could put 20,000 nuclear weapons into the wrong hands, unleash ethnic wars on Russian soil and destabilize the region, a crisis that could "make Bosnia pale in comparison," George Kolt, a top Central Intelligence Agency specialist on the former Soviet Union, told a Senate panel last week.
By defining the debate in this way, the Administration has hopes of eventually convincing a public focused on its domestic needs that new aid to Russia is essential to American economic and political well-being.
 
New Aid Criteria
 "You sell it as an investment in your own security, that if you don't do it, it's a missed opportunity and it makes the world a more dangerous place," said one senior Administration official.
Despite Mr. Clinton's criticism of President Bush during the campaign for not committing enough aid to Russia, the thinking in the new Administration is that it will not propose spending more money than is already committed unless three specific criteria are met: Any program must have the full support of Congress and the American people; it must have a concrete impact on promoting democracy and a free-market economy, and it must be accomplished through the Group of Seven industrialized countries and other potential aid donors.
Instead of pouring in new aid, the Administration will develop an approach that will blend political, diplomatic and technical assistance with ideas about how to do more with available money. Because of the urgency of the situation, the Administration aims to have the outlines of the new policy in place for Secretary of State Warren Christopher's meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev in Geneva on Feb. 25.
Senior Administration officials awaiting their Senate confirmation hearings have discovered in visiting key senators that although there is considerable rhetorical support on Capitol Hill for saving Russia, there is a great deal of resistance to adding more American money to accomplish that goal.
Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican, captured the sentiments of many of his Senate colleagues on the aid issue.
When asked about the prospects of persuading the American people to give more money to Russia, he replied: "Between extremely, extremely difficult and impossible. None of the ground has been prepared, and that takes a long time."
 
Loans, Grants and Credit
 Just how much aid the United States has committed to Russia and the other republics is difficult to calculate and subject to dispute because the aid involves outright grants, loans and credit guarantees, which may be subject to certain restrictions and distributed through multicountry programs. The United States has pledged $9.2 billion in aid to the independent republics of the former Soviet Union from 1991 through 1993. American aid in the current fiscal year will total about $3 billion.
Members of the still-to-be-announced Steering Committee on the former Soviet Union, as it is expected to be called, have been meeting informally in recent days as part of intensive brainstorming sessions. As chairman, Mr. Talbott, who has yet to be confirmed, would in effect be the Administration's policy director for the 15 former republics and would report directly to the National Security Council.
Mr. Talbott would have direct access to President Clinton, a close friend since their days as Rhodes Scholars at Oxford University.
"The object clearly was to give special prominence and attention to a very critical area, which is the newly independent states," Deputy Secretary of State Clifton R. Wharton Jr. said in an interview. "Given Strobe's very special background and knowledge and experience in this arena you could hardly find a better person to do this."
 
No Doubt on Clout
 Another senior Administration official put it more bluntly: "Strobe, as everyone knows, was Bill Clinton's roommate at Oxford. So there shouldn't be any doubt about his clout within the bureaucracy."
Although the Administration has yet to formulate its policy, trends in the thinking of Mr. Talbott and his team have emerged:
*President Boris N. Yeltsin's economic and political reforms are the best hope of reducing Russia's nuclear and conventional weapons arsenal, and the Administration will go out of its way to bolster him as a partner of the United States. The Administration intends to act as a broker on a range of issues, including persuading Ukraine to ratify the Start treaty and helping to resolve flash points in Tajikistan, the Caucasus and Nagorno-Karabakh.
*The Russian aid issue must be wrenched from the hands of what one official called the "economist gnomes and the arms-control nerds" and elevated to the level of high diplomacy. To that end, the Administration will increase pressure on the International Monetary Fund to treat Russia as a special case and loosen lending restrictions and will move to strengthen the Group of Seven industrialized countries on Russian aid issues.
 
Some Are Left Out
 *Embassies in the former Soviet Union should be transformed into outposts for promoting American businesses and helping Americans who are eager to invest but who are overwhelmed by the logistical headaches of doing business there.
*A higher priority should be placed on direct and technical assistance to help Russia dismantle its nuclear weapons and dispose of its nuclear materials; find civilian employment for nuclear technicians, and create housing so that demobilized soldiers can return home.
In a move intended to keep the committee small, but certain to be resisted, the C.I.A., the Commerce Department and the Council of Economic Advisers will not be part of the committee, but will be invited to participate.
Vice-chairman of the new committee will be Tobi Gati, the National Security Council's senior official dealing with the former Soviet Union. Other members will include Frank Wisner, the Under Secretary of Defense-designate for Policy; Lynn Davis, the Under Secretary of State-designate for Economic Affairs, and Lawrence Summers, the Under Secretary of the Treasury-designate for International Affairs.
Mr. Talbott's appointment has unleashed a wave of high anxiety in the ever-anxious State Department and has caused confusion over the organizational charts in the Bureau of European Affairs. That bureau will retain its office for the 15 former republics, and will still be responsible for Administrative and consular matters and for such multilateral issues as the relationship with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
But the office will report directly to Mr. Talbott on these matters. And all policy issues for the republics of the former Soviet Union will be handled by Mr. Talbott and his own staff.
The committee will retain the post now held by Richard Armitage, who was named the State Department's coordinator for humanitarian aid to the former Soviet republics by President George Bush. Mr. Armitage has been widely praised by Clinton aides but will be replaced shortly as Mr. Talbott puts his own team into place.
 
Pentagon Divided
 Complicating matters are splits within the Pentagon over how to divide responsibility for the former Soviet Union among six assistant secretaries, each of whom is entitled to parts of the portfolio, and over the extent to which the Pentagon will be willing to cede authority to Mr. Talbott.
At least for now, the new approach enjoys the support of key lawmakers who are determined to do more for Moscow.
"The Bush folks would say to us that our Government is not set up that way when we made proposals," said Senator Richard Lugar, the Indiana Republican who, with help from Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat, pushed through an ambitious aid program last year to dismantle Russia's nuclear weapons.
"Treasury had a different agenda -- not to spend money -- and all sorts of controls, and Commerce was more concerned about uranium-dumping on the American market than the importance of buying Russia's highly enriched uranium. The new team has to be able to do arms control and economics and politics simultaneously."

HEADLINE: Message and Morality;
Concerns Over Public Relations and Ethics Clash in the Crisis of Clinton's First Weeks

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
The capital is running a fever, gripped by the frenzy that sets in every so often when morality and expediency get tangled up.
This time, Bill Clinton is in the soup. Mr. Clinton, who came to Washington as a populist and economic savior of the middle class, has once again been diverted by questions of the ethical standards and calculated diversity of his Administration. 
 In a Presidential debut that could have been scripted by vengeful Republicans, the new President has lurched from one problem to another. First, gay issues dominated the agenda. Then, senior citizens were upset over an Administration trial balloon suggesting that Social Security benefits might be frozen. Now women are angry about possible double standards and the hash the Administration has made of its plan to name a woman as Attorney General.
The new President stayed home most of the weekend, perhaps pondering his scalding experience with one of the capital's truths, as set out by Lyn Nofziger, the former Reagan aide who once got caught in one of the town's seasonal ethical sandstorms: "Most of the moral judgments in Washington boil down to political judgments, and a lot of people suffer from it, unfairly."
The whole scene made James Carville, the Clinton campaign strategist who still offers advice to the White House, blanch. "It has been said by others and I'll say it again: no one ever satisfied the liberal interest groups," said Mr. Carville, who was working the phones in his office today trying to assure everyone that this, too, shall pass. "Maybe God is punishing us for not picking someone with a normal name, like Mary or Susan or Elizabeth."
 
Trying to Look Blase
 On Friday, George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's spokesman, had raced around, vainly trying to persuade reporters at the White House that the day's story was the signing of the family leave bill, not the abrupt way the White House had pushed Kimba M. Wood, a Federal district judge in New York whom Mr. Clinton had settled on for Attorney General, off the sled.
By today, the White House was trying to appear blase, and officials noted that after Dick Cheney became Secretary of Defense, no one remembered all the brouhaha about John G. Tower and his drinking and womanizing, and that after Anthony M. Kennedy became a Supreme Court Justice, no one cared any more about Douglas H. Ginsburg and his marijuana problems.
"I think there's too much hysterical instant analysis going on," said one top White House official. "We're going to get an Attorney General confirmed and everything will be fine."
Among historians outside Washington, however, there was surprise at the continuing White House confusion and fear that in this new era of electronic populism, officials were less worried about how to earn a profile in courage than how to avoid getting bashed on the Rush Limbaugh show.
 
'Moralistic on Tiny Things'
 "There seems to be a real dearth of serious moral reflection in Washington that existed through the 80's and is continuing in the Clinton Administration," said James Davison Hunter, a sociology professor at the University of Virginia and the author of "Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America." "The habit in Washington is to compensate for shallow moral reflection by being incredibly moralistic on tiny things. People go nuts over these little things."
In the latest incident, both Mr. Clinton and Judge Wood have suffered. Once again, the President was being criticized for needlessly hurting the reputation of a respected woman candidate for Attorney General. But while Mr. Clinton was scored for waiting too long to act in the case of Zoe Baird, this time around he was criticized for acting too swiftly, before the public had even weighed in.
Judge Wood and her defenders protested that the President had acted out of a fear of bad public relations and not because she had done anything to disqualify herself from the job. Ms. Baird had broken the law, they said, while Judge Wood had hired an illegal immigrant before it was illegal to do so, had filed all the proper papers and paid the necessary taxes.
"Given what happened to Zoe Baird it was all the more important that he stick by Kimba Wood once the White House had in effect announced the appointment, because she had done nothing wrong," said Alan Brinkley, a professor of American history at Columbia University. "He didn't have the courage of his convictions and that will make it much more difficult for women to be appointed to anything."
The White House says Judge Wood was disingenuous in failing to give the President and his aides the information about her child care that they were clearly seeking. Indeed, it appears that Judge Wood gave Mr. Clinton the same sort of answer that he himself specialized in during his campaign on the subject of marijuana, the draft and taxes: semantically correct but leaving out some information of vital interest to the listener.
"Bill Clinton was a little less than forthright on issues in his personal life during the campaign and now all of a sudden he's pointing at Kimba Wood and saying, 'You were too legalistic with me,' " said Mr. Nofziger, whose conviction on illegal influence peddling was overturned after the case took an enormous toll on his business, health and finances. "He could have at least stood up right away and said: 'Kimba Wood did nothing illegal. She and I don't see eye to eye.' Instead he let her go away under a cloud."
Strategists in both parties said the latest problem at the White House served only to reinforce the impression that Mr. Clinton is too intent on satisfying too many people and that he is too prone to cave in when faced with potential political consequences.
The events since Thursday have also made it clear that Mr. Clinton's White House has not yet developed smoothly running political and communications operations.
"If you have no strategic plan and if all you do is react to the media and various constituency groups, that just chews you up fast," said Edward J. Rollins, a Republican consultant. "First impressions matter, and in this case the impression is that people don't have their act together. Even their own Democratic team on the Hill is getting panicky."
Fred Greenstein, a historian at Princeton University who specializes in the Presidency, was also puzzled. "It's odd, given that Clinton seemed to be so ready to go, so facile and so bright at the Little Rock economic summit," he said. "Now there is no sense of momentum. It's almost as if they're thinking like children. After they wake up from their nap, life begins."

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Building Offices Despite Many Vacancies

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Although the nation's commercial real estate market remains glutted with vacant space, Congress is spending several billion dollars building new offices for Federal workers here and in other cities.
Most of this money is being spent on projects, like the Federal office building going up in Foley Square in Manhattan, that were in advanced stages of planning or under construction before the market turned sour. But as recently as October, Congress appropriated $626 million to start 35 projects. 
 The Government, supported by developers and unions, maintains that the new construction will create jobs and provide Federal workers with the most modern offices possible. But critics of the new projects, including landlords and urban planners, contend that many were approved simply as a favor to Congress when much cheaper space was available.
 
Slipped Into Budget
 In October, Congress approved construction of 15 courthouses with adjacent office buildings. It also approved 10 new office buildings, costing more than $75 million, that had never been reviewed by the General Services Administration, the agency charged with managing and constructing Federal office space. These projects, which were slipped into the annual Federal appropriations legislation by various lawmakers, include a $4 million Social Security Administration building in Chicago, which has a 22 percent vacancy rate, and a $10 million Federal building in San Francisco, which has a 12.5 percent vacancy rate downtown and 13 percent vacancies overall.
Congress also approved spending $1.2 billion on leases for buildings that are being erected for long-term Federal tenants here, where the downtown has a 17.1 percent vacancy rate, and in Atlanta, which has a 33 percent vacancy rate downtown and 23.6 percent rate overall.
Real estate experts and urban specialists say the construction program is wasteful, and even Federal auditors say the Government cannot justify the expense. The auditors say problems with the construction program fit a longstanding pattern of mismanagement by the General Services Administration, which spends about $10 billion a year on office space, telecommunications and computers in 7,400 Federally owned or leased buildings.
"Public buildings policy is in disarray, and the American taxpayer is certainly not getting value for the burgeoning dollars being spent," said L. Nye Stevens, director of Government business operations at the accounting office, the auditing arm of Congress.
The auditors also criticized the agency for having failed to buy a single office building available at bargain prices from the Resolution Trust Corporation or from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which have 9,000 office buildings for sale.
 
Congress Is Faulted
 David L. Bibb, an assistant commissioner for planning at the agency, said that many of the auditors' conclusions were faulty and that his agency could justify most of its projects. But he said members of Congress often authorized money for pet projects instead of the projects recommended by the agency.
The economic downturn has drawn attention to the Government's real estate practices. Federal construction projects, promoted by labor unions and real estate developers, help to create jobs, stimulate local economies and assure that thousands of Federal office workers remain in town.
But landlords who may lose Federal tenants, as well as real estate experts, public policy professionals and urban specialists maintain that putting up a building just to create temporary construction jobs ignores long-term harm to older downtown blocks. "This is the kind of strong medicine that is likely to further injure the already sick urban patient," said George Sternlieb, a retired professor of urban planning at Rutgers University.
 
Conflicting Policies
 Federal auditors say the General Services Administration is a poor manager, which also has to deal with conflicting political, economic and legal pressures. There are, for example, four conflicting policies that determine where Federal office buildings should be built. While one law says the buildings should be evenly distributed around the nation, another law says priority should be given to rural locations. A budget office directive requires regional offices of agencies to be located in 10 major cities, and an executive order signed by President Jimmy Carter says Federal buildings must be concentrated in urban downtowns.
"When policies cancel each other out, it means there is no policy," said Mr. Stevens, the Federal auditor.
A study in Atlanta conducted by the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen for the real estate industry estimated that a planned 1.8-million-square-foot Federal building will increase the vacancy rate downtown to 47 percent. The study also estimated that over the 27-year life of the lease the new building would cost taxpayers $166 million more than leasing vacant space in existing modern buildings and $505 million more than Federal agencies would spend on rent if they did not move.
But General Services officials said the Government did not want space in most older buildings. Since the mid-1980's, they said, it has been Government policy to improve working conditions for employees by moving them into new buildings with high-quality office space, even if it means moving workers out of renovated buildings.
 
Debate Rages for Months
 A public debate has been raging for months in Philadelphia over new Federal offices being built by the Postal Service and leased to the General Services Agency for use by regional offices of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies. None of the space will be used by the Postal Service, which was authorized to develop real estate for profit when it was created as a quasi-private corporation in 1991.
General Services officials say they need a single modern building, and local elected officials support the project.
Landlords say the Government could save money by keeping Federal agencies where they are, in several renovated buildings, or by scattering them among modern buildings that have two million square feet of vacant space.
Federal auditors say taxpayers will never know whether the Government is wasting money in Philadelphia because the General Services agency did not request proposals to compete with its new building.
 
No Bid Is Needed
 Because this development project is a deal between Federal agencies, there was no obligation to seek competitive bids for the space. Congress approved spending $490 million on a 20-year lease of the building, which is costing the Postal Service $192 million to build.
"Politics is driving this deal, nothing else," said Peter Linneman, director of the Wharton Real Estate Center at the University of Pennsylvania.
Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, was re-elected in November with the support of normally Democratic construction trade unions in Philadelphia, partly in recognition of his success in bringing this project and its 1,000 construction jobs to the city.
Mr. Specter said the project was economically sound. "I sat down with the G.S.A. people, and they are a very inarticulate lot," he said in an interview last week. "But if you dig out the facts, you can find out they have a very solid case for this building."

HEADLINE: SIHANOUK MOVING TO REGAIN POWER

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Twenty-three years after his ouster as Cambodia's head of state, Prince Norodom Sihanouk is moving quickly to reclaim power here, this time with the support of nations that he once considered his enemies to the death.
The United Nations is on the verge of revising the 1991 Cambodian peace accords to allow the election of a President as well as a legislature, a move that would all but guarantee the Prince's return to power this spring or summer. 
 Even before the revisions, the 70-year-old Prince has announced that he is a presidential candidate, although he insists his decision is not final. Friends say that his uncertainty appears to be a negotiating ploy. In a nation that has known only civil war or terror for a generation, there is no other figure in Cambodia with enough broad popular support to challenge him.
The prince is to return here within the next few days from Beijing, where he has been receiving medical treatment after a mild stroke in November.
 
'The Essential Cement'
 "Sihanouk is the only answer," said John Gunther Dean, a former American ambassador to Cambodia who has known Prince Sihanouk since the early 1950's and visits Cambodia frequently. "I have been known all my career as a defender of Sihanouk. I know that he is the essential cement in Cambodia."
The nations tacitly supporting him include the United States, which the prince has long suspected was involved in the 1970 coup that put his handpicked Prime Minister, Lon Nol, in charge.
Diplomats and other students of modern Cambodian history say there is reason to be concerned about Prince Sihanouk, saying his mercurial personality, political misjudgments and reluctance to share authority were at least partly to blame for the coup and the subsequent rise to power of the Maoist-inspired rebels of the Khmer Rouge.
The Khmer Rouge overran Cambodia in 1975 under the nominal patronage of Prince Sihanouk, setting off a four-year reign of terror that left at least several hundred thousand and perhaps more than one million Cambodians dead from starvation, disease and execution.
 
Alliance With Khmer Rouge
 Even after the Khmer Rouge were toppled by Vietnamese troops in 1979 -- and after the mass killings of the Khmer Rouge years were fully exposed -- the Prince aligned himself with the Khmer Rouge against the Hanoi-installed Government.
"It's a matter of there being nobody else; there is only Sihanouk," said a senior Asian diplomat here. "When Sihanouk ruled, he didn't tolerate the rise of a new generation of leaders. He didn't want rivals. And when the Khmer Rouge took over, anyone with leadership skills or talent was killed."
Whatever their misgivings, many in Cambodia agree that the Prince is the best hope for national reconciliation.
Operating from his homes in exile in Beijing and North Korea, Prince Sihanouk was the moving force behind years of negotiations that led to the October 1991 peace treaty. In November 1991, after spending most of a generation in exile from Cambodia, the Prince returned to Phnom Penh and took up his new role as chairman of the Supreme National Council created as part of the peace settlement to represent all factions.
Without a coalition government, Cambodia will face de facto partitioning, with a separate state under the control of the Khmer Rouge and the likelihood of continued fighting.
The Prince's hopes of returning to power may yet be dashed by either the Government, which is believed to be responsible for recent violence against the royalist political party led by one of Prince Sihanouk's sons, or by the Khmer Rouge, who are boycotting the election to protest what they call the continued presence of Vietnamese troops in Cambodia.
The United Nations, which maintains 22,000 peacekeepers here seems determined to go ahead with the election, whatever the threats.
The Khmer Rouge boycott has raised fears that the guerrillas will attempt to sabotage the balloting with violence. But Lieut. Gen. John Sanderson, an Australian who is the United Nations military commander in Cambodia, said that he believes the elections will be largely peaceful.
"They might be able to stop the election in certain places -- but not across the country," he said.
 
Opposition to Sanctions
 Some diplomats here are equally hopeful about the intentions of the Khmer Rouge, saying that it is in the guerrillas' best interests to allow the vote, then see what offer is made to them. The prince recently spoke out against proposals in the United Nations to impose new sanctions on the rebel group, insisting that the sanctions were of no use.
In an in interview conducted last month in Beijing with The Far Eastern Economic Review, Prince Sihanouk, who is rarely accused of understatement, lashed out at all four factions in Cambodia and suggested that he was the only hope for peace in this war-shattered nation.
"Everybody is rotten, everybody," he said. "People are very upset. They say only Sihanouk is clean; the only one is Sihanouk. He should be made to come back and take charge of everything."
He continued, "I absolutely wish, my only ambition before dying, before becoming senile, is to render a last service to my country."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. IS OPPOSED TO ECONOMIC PLAN

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Signaling that Republicans plan to oppose at least part of President Clinton's economic program, Senator Robert Dole, the minority leader, and three other Republican Senators said today that they disagreed with the Administration's plans for a short-term stimulus package because it would increase the deficit this year.
Mr. Clinton's economic aides have repeatedly talked about a stimulus program of $15 billion to $30 billion that would seek to create jobs and to insure that the economy does not slide back into the doldrums. 
 In a letter to Mr. Clinton today, the four Republicans said, "We fail to see how any short-term 'stimulus' package of $10 to $30 billion can have any significant impact on our economy that is now experiencing a solid recovery."
They added, "The economy already is experiencing a $320 billion 'stimulus' in the form of our annual deficit and such a package may simply add to that debt load."
 
'Spending Is the Problem'
 Besides Mr. Dole, the Senators who signed the letter were Don Nickles of Oklahoma, chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, and the two co-chairmen of the Republican Economic Policy Task Force, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico and Bob Packwood of Oregon.
"We think the economy is recovering," Mr. Domenici said today on the CBS News program "Face the Nation." "And I would remind listeners that in January it added 105,000 new jobs. That's about half of what anybody's major stimulus package was going to produce, spending $20, $30, or even $40 billion. What we are saying is, spending is the problem in the United States."
In attacking the stimulus program, the Republicans seemed to be asserting that the economy President George Bush handed over to his successor was in good shape, three previous years of anemic growth notwithstanding. In the fourth quarter of 1992, the economy grew by a fairly robust annual rate of 3.8 percent.
 
Fighting Unemployment
 Despite the Republican criticisms, Administration officials made it clear today that they were still tilting heavily in favor of a stimulus program.
Defending such a move, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, appearing on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" said: "The fact is that unemployment isn't down enough. There are still layoffs, still plant closings. We're pleased that some of the statistics coming in are looking favorable. We want them to keep looking favorable. And that's why a modest stimulus package is in order."
In an appearance on "Face the Nation," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said Mr. Clinton was elected to create jobs. "If it takes a stimulus package, well, then it's going to take a stimulus package," he said.
Mr. Reich said that the Administration was seriously considering three proposals that Mr. Clinton made during his campaign: raising the income tax rate on the wealthy to 36 percent, placing a surtax on millionaires and raising the alternative minimum tax.
 
Corporate Tax Mentioned
 He added that "an increase in the corporate tax" was on the table but it was unclear whether Mr. Reich was talking about raising the corporate income tax rate, currently 34 percent, or about increasing the collection of corporate taxes.
Mr. Clinton has repeatedly pledged to increase the amount of taxes collected from foreign corporations, asserting that they do not pay their fair share.
White House officials declined to say today whether Mr. Reich was broaching the idea of an increase in the corporate income tax. During the campaign, Mr. Clinton did not propose such an increase.
Asked to amplify Mr. Reich's remarks about an increase in corporate taxes, Jeff Eller, a White House spokesman, responded that throughout the campaign Mr. Clinton said that those who earn more would have to "pay their fair share."
"That applies to corporations and citizens," he said, adding, "What the President says today is no different from what President Clinton said throughout the campaign."
In their letter, Mr. Dole and the three other Republicans seemed to lay the groundwork to attack Mr. Clinton's economic plan if a significant portion of his deficit-reduction package comes in the form of tax increases rather than spending cuts.

HEADLINE: Clinton Keeping Foreign Policy on a Back Burner

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
During a meeting of the President's top economic advisers last week, the Deputy Budget Director, Alice M. Rivlin, was describing areas of the country that would be affected by the withdrawal of a Federal timber subsidy when she found herself being corrected by President Clinton over which trees were found where.
A short time later, Mr. Clinton's top foreign policy advisers were gathered in the Roosevelt Room poring over a map of Bosnia, in a nearly four-hour session intended to establish the Administration's policy for the Balkans, its first major foreign-policy initiative. The President did not correct anyone about details on Bosnia. He did not attend. 
 While Bill Clinton is being accused of stepping back from some campaign promises, there is one promise that for now he appears to be holding firm to: spending less time than his predecessor enmeshed in the nitty gritty of foreign policy.
When Mr. Clinton gathered his Cabinet and other top advisers at Camp David last weekend, some in the room were struck by what was missing when he ticked off what he viewed as the goals of his Administration for the first 100 days.
 
No Mention of Foreign Policy
 The list went like this: economic recovery plan, health care plan, welfare reform, political reform, national service. There was not a single mention of a foreign-policy objective. No wonder some lower-ranking members of Mr. Clinton's foreign policy team have confided to their colleagues working on economic and health policy about how jealous they are at the quality time the number-crunchers get to spend with the President, as compared with those dealing with foreign affairs.
"The President has basically told us all, if he can get an economic package through Congress and a health package through Congress, everything will be all right," said one senior Administration official. "If he can't, it won't be all right. I'm sure he's interested in foreign policy, but right now it's just not where he is focused. It's not where he is emersing himself in the details. None of us would accuse him of micro-managing it."
It is not that Mr. Clinton is ignoring the myriad problems that confront the United States abroad, say aides, but rather that he has essentially delegated foreign-policy formulation to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense Secretary Les Aspin, the national security adviser, W. Anthony Lake and Mr. Lake's deputy, Samuel R. Berger.
On domestic policy issues, Mr. Clinton is personally absorbed in the give and take. But on foreign policy he has basically asked these aides to work out solutions and then submit them to him to be approved or rejected.
 
Policies and Briefings
 Under broad guidelines set by Mr. Clinton, they worked out the policy on how to limit the influx of Haitian refugees and then briefed him about it; they worked out the compromise on the deportees in Lebanon and then briefed him about it, and they are working up the new policy for Bosnia and briefing him about it. They were also the architects of a more integrated approach to coordinating policy toward Russia and the other former Soviet republics.
Obviously, say aides, the President is kept abreast of all the internal discussions and weighs in when he wants -- which can be fairly frequently -- but foreign affairs is clearly not his passion, or his preoccupation.
"He is there to do things when asked," said one foreign-policy official. "But that is the extent of it."
Some top Clinton aides make no apologies for his priorities.
"That is why he is President and George Bush isn't," remarked one when asked why the President did not seem very deeply involved in foreign affairs.
Since coming to office Mr. Clinton has had phone conversations with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel. He has had brief meetings with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada and the German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel. Mr. Bush did more in an average day. Mr. Clinton still has not held a meeting of his National Security Council.
At least some who know the President well suggest that he still may be just a little intimidated by foreign matters. Some even go so far as to suggest that one of the reasons Mr. Clinton chose the 67-year-old Mr. Christopher to run his State Department is because he sees him as an elder statesman who can take care of the thorny foreign-policy matters that Mr. Clinton simply does not want to be troubled with now and is still unsure about.
"I think that the most interesting thing is that Mr. Clinton has not been present for a lot of the discussions," said one lower-ranking adviser. "My sense of it is that he does not like this stuff because he is not the master of it. He is not familiar with the details and he is not familiar with the people giving him the advice. He does not have that same well of knowledge to draw on that he does in domestic policy. Don't underestimate how raw he is."
Mr. Clinton, like his predecessors, begins his day with a briefing from a representative of the Central Intelligence Agency on developments overnight in world affairs, with Mr. Lake, Mr. Berger and Vice President Al Gore also present. The White House Chief of Staff, Thomas McLarty, also attends occasionally.
 
Marching Orders
 The briefing is followed by a discussion between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Lake over what the foreign policy apparatus will be concentrating on during the day, to make certain that they are moving in the general direction Mr. Clinton wants. Also during these sessions the President will occassionally seek some specific information about an issue.
And then they "go off and do it," said one official.
Whether Mr. Clinton will be able to maintain his approach to foreign policy will depend in part on whether a crisis abroad demands more of his attention and in part on the ability of his subordinates to design policies that work.
Mr. Clinton has been confronting some of the same problems delivering on campaign promises on foreign policy that he has in domestic affairs. He promised, for instance, to be more flexible than Mr. Bush in allowing in Haitian refugees seeking political asylum. That promise alone threatened to result in an outflow of people from Haiti, forcing his Administration to tighten Mr. Bush's restrictions by setting up a virtual naval blockade around the island while it tries to come up with a long-term political solution.
 
Looking at an Uphill Climb
 Where Mr. Clinton's advisers thought they could introduce early innovations in foreign policy, in places like Bosnia, they are finding it much harder going. And where they thought they could just count on continuity and inertia early on -- in the Arab-Israeli peace talks or with Iraq -- they are discovering that there is no possibility for progress without a major committment of time and energy by the new Administration.
These tensions were particularly apparent in the case of Bosnia, where Mr. Clinton vowed to take a more activist approach than Mr. Bush in limiting Serbian attacks. That instinct prompted his Administration to reject the peace plan drawn up by the United Nations and European Community mediators, Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen, on the grounds that it gave too much to the Serbs. But the rejection came before there was a credible alternative.
That alternative is now being drawn up. But the problem the Clinton advisers have encountered is that any alternative would require a much more active role by the United States, not only at the negotiating table, but also in the form of diplomatic, economic and possibly even military pressures to coax the warring parties in Bosnia into a deal they all might accept. That has prompted some internal disputes over just how deeply the new Administration should get involved.
Charles William Maynes, editor of the magazine Foreign Policy, said, "The Administration is trying to reconcile its campaign positions with reality, and the fit has not always been very precise."

THE ENDURING LEGACY OF ARTHUR ASHE
If a place in New York City evokes Arthur Ashe's spirit, it is surely the Harlem Tennis Center's makeshift courts, inside the cavernous 369th Regiment Armory building at 143d Street and Fifth Avenue in Harlem. It was there in 1968 -- the same year that Mr. Ashe became the first black to win the United States Open men's singles championships -- that the Harlem Junior Tennis Program was founded, to give minority children a chance to play a sport that had long been dominated by whites, until Mr. Ashe came along. The former tennis champion died Saturday afternoon at the age of 49. A1.
 
HOUSING PROGRAM STALLED IN WASHINGTON
Since the late 1980's, money from a Federal tax break for corporations has put thousands of low-income New Yorkers into new homes. Now legislation that would renew the financing is stalled in Washington, and that, coupled with state budget cuts, threatens plans for dozens of affordable housing developments in the state this year. A1. 

A RACIAL QUOTA UNDER ATTACK
In a recent court case that went virtually unnoticed at the time, an unusual racial quota sanctioned by New York City's government was declared unconstitutional by a Federal judge. The ruling -- arising from a suit that challenged a section of the the City Charter intended to make municipal government more representative -- challenged the legality of a 15-member commission that included at least one resident of each borough and members of racial and language minority groups that reflect the population of the city. Metro Matters, B2.
 
WEIGHING THE CHANCELLOR'S FATE
Since it became clear last week that the Board of Education might not renew Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez's contract, there has been tumultuous lobbying for the deciding vote, which will most likely be that of Carol Gresser, the Queens representative. B3.

SHOOTING RANGE UNDER FIRE
In the hills of Cortlandt, in the backwoods of Westchester, the county government 31 years ago chose to locate a public firing range that defies the genteel golf and tennis image the nation has about the area. Over the years, hunters and shooting enthusiasts have pierced countless bull's-eyes and shattered innumerable clay pigeons, and their spent ammunition has dropped a mother lode of lead in the moist black soil of the range. That lead -- 500 tons by some estimates -- has now been called a danger to the health of children and wildlife by Federal and state authorities, and it has become the center of a local dispute that is echoed in many of the 8,000 recreational ranges elsewhere in the nation. B7.
 
COLLEGE AID PROGRAM IN THE RED
A New York State program that helps low- and middle-income residents pay their college tuition is running more than $100 million in the red for a second year in a row because of the lingering recession, a state budget official says. As layoffs have reduced many two-income families to one income and people with jobs have been forced to take pay cuts or work fewer hours, more students from these families have become eligible for grants from the Tuition Assistance Program, or T.A.P., according to the state's Budget Division. The same factors, a spokeswoman said, make more students eligible for full, rather than partial, grants. B7.

HEADLINE: College Aid Program Is Threatened by Cuts

 BODY:
A New York State program that helps low- and middle-income residents pay their college tuition is running more than $100 million in the red for a second year in a row because of the lingering recession, a state budget official said yesterday.
As layoffs have reduced many two-income families to one income and people with jobs have been forced to take pay cuts or work fewer hours, more students from these families have become eligible for grants from the Tuition Assistance Program, or T.A.P., said Claudia S. Hutton, spokeswoman for the state's Budget Division. The same factors, she said, make more students eligible for full, rather than partial, grants. 
 The increases led to a $100.7 million shortfall in T.A.P. in the 1992-93 fiscal year, which ends March 31, following a $111.8 million shortfall in the 1991-92 fiscal year, Miss Hutton said.
To cover the red ink last year, the State Legislature approved extra money. It also reduced the maximum grant and tightened eligibility requirements. The Budget Division is now preparing another request to the Legislature to cover the shortfall, Miss Hutton said. She said that this year's shortfall had been anticipated, and the funds to cover the gap had been subtracted from an expected surplus in the state budget.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposed a $30 million cut in T.A.P. in his 1993-1994 state budget released last month. The cuts would mostly affect middle-class families, with some students receiving T.A.P. grants nearly $1,000 smaller, Miss Hutton said.
Nearly 300,000 students receive grants that will total $614.4 million in the current fiscal year.

HEADLINE: U.S. Businesses Turning to Vietnam

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
Almost 18 years after United States diplomats fled Saigon before the advancing Communist troops, American capitalists are trickling back, hoping to employ their former enemies and ready the country for a corporate invasion.
A trade delegation of about 30 American business people arrived in Hanoi this weekend, one of the first concrete results of a Bush Administration decision in December to permit American companies to open offices in Vietnam. 
 The decision allows companies to obtain licenses from the Treasury Department, which permits them to open offices and take the first steps toward doing business in Vietnam. The companies may hire staff and sign contracts that could be put into effect only when Washington ends the embargo that was imposed after the war.
Licenses have been granted to about 15 companies, the Treasury says, and about two dozen more are in the pipeline.
With Japan, Singapore and South Korea bursting with international corporations elbowing each other for market share, American companies are looking hungrily at Vietnam as an emerging market. The attraction of Vietnam for corporations is simple: The country's 70 million people are one of the last unexplored consumer markets in Asia -- as well as a well-educated, hard-working and extraordinarily inexpensive labor pool.
Taiwan, Hong Kong and France have taken the lead in investing, followed by Australia, Britain and Japan. Tokyo reopened broad economic ties in November, leaving the United States as the only nation that preserves an embargo against Vietnam.
While investment is not risk free, because of Vietnam's deteriorating infrastructure and widespread corruption among officials, American companies have been pressing for an end to the embargo. They say they are at a terrible disadvantage in a nation that opened up to investment in earnest in 1988. But some think the game is not yet completely lost, partly because of a somewhat paradoxical Vietnamese admiration for Americans and also because of Vietnam's history.
"It is clear that the Vietnamese have set aside a range of projects for American business, not only to hopefully enjoy beneficial access to our market, but also because they have very strong and not positive resonances with respect to centuries of French, Japanese and Chinese colonial influence," said Donald Alford Weadon Jr., a senior partner at Dickstein, Shapiro & Morin, a Washington-based law firm that is opening an office in Vietnam.
Several of the American companies -- advertising agencies, law firms, real estate brokers -- that have received licenses will not be offering services or products to the Vietnamese. Rather, they are positioning themselves to provide help for corporate giants when the embargo ends. That awaits a decision in Washington that Vietnam is cooperating fully in the search for servicemen still missing from the war.
Among the large American companies believed to be hoping to explore business in Vietnam are Mobil, Chevron, Amoco and Exxon; Northwest and United Airlines; Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and Bank of America; Hewlett-Packard, Compaq Computer and Honeywell, and Bechtel, Boeing, General Motors, Caterpillar, Pepsico and Coca-Cola.
The December decision set telephones ringing off the hook at trade organizations with contacts in Vietnam. "Since the announcement, the flow of calls seeking information on questions like who would be a potential partner in Vietnam has tripled," said Virginia B. Foote, director of the U.S.-Vietnam Trade Council, a Washington group that coordinates information on investment.
Among the businesses that have received licenses to open offices in Vietnam are the Channel Marketing Corporation of Dallas, an international sales and marketing consulting firm; the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency; Vatico, a small consulting company based in Washington; Dickstein Shapiro & Morin, and Colliers International, a real estate group based in Boston.
Relations between Vietnam and the United States are governed by a "road map" the Bush Administration gave to Vietnam in April 1991, which uses a carrot-and-stick approach to gain Vietnamese cooperation on a number of issues, like fully accounting for the war's missing, in return for American steps to lift restrictions on political and economic activity in Vietnam.
The Clinton Administration is not expected to change the road map, which at this stage requires that Vietnam give full cooperation in the search for the 2,264 American servicemen still listed as missing.
Ann Mills Griffith, director of the National League of Families, POW/ MIA, said that while the Vietnamese are increasing cooperation, for her group to support an end to the embargo, Hanoi needs to "fulfill the criteria specified in the road map -- rapidly resolving repatriation of remains, and resolving cases of last sighting" when a serviceman was seen alive.
At least one very small and vocal group, the National P.O.W. Strike Force, has gone much further in opposing trade with Vietnam, sending facsimile messages to some of the 30 or so companies that planned to join the trade mission that arrived in Vietnam this weekend.
 
 
'Destroy Your Company'
 Joe Jordan of Houston, the head of the strike force, said in a telephone interview that he told the businesses, "We will go out of our way to destroy your company because you want to do business with filthy Communists who are holding American prisoners."
Irwin Jay Robinson, the director of the Vietnam-American Chamber of Commerce and a senior partner in the law firm of Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim & Ballon in New York, said two companies had dropped out of the trip but he declined to name them.
Many business representatives who fear that other nations' companies are snapping up all the opportunities in Vietnam felt that the Bush Administration moved far too slowly on the issue. And now, there is concern that the Clinton Administration, with its plans to focus sharply on domestic issues, could well do the same.
Bill Beddow, a spokesman in Washington for Caterpillar, the big equipment manufacturer, said his company believed the embargo should be ended.
 
 
'Difference of Opinion'
 "I think everybody is interested in putting to bed remaining questions over the fate of the missing and the P.O.W.'s," he said. "There is a difference of opinion on the best way to make that happen. Caterpillar believes that when a country has been isolated, its Government has been able to remain more hard line, more restrictive and less forthcoming than countries that have not been kept isolated."
Some business representatives and diplomats say the question of the embargo may well be decided before the meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in April, when Washington will again be called upon to reconsider its veto of financial aid for Vietnam from these institutions. This veto, which the United States maintains alone, has blocked hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Vietnam, which would be used for infrastructure projects.
Any end to the moratorium on lending would be accompanied by opportunities for extensive contracts, which would go to foreign companies if the American embargo were not lifted.

HEADLINE: Overtime and Hirings Show Some Factories Picking Up

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Much of the nation's industrial sector is shifting into higher gear, though this is sometimes hard to discern in the dust kicked up by wounded corporate giants like General Motors, Sears and I.B.M.
The companies enjoying a surge in business are not suddenly putting out the call for thousands of new workers based on the last few months' growth, but many have stepped up production lines and some have turned on the green lights for expansion. 
 Throughout the Midwest and to a lesser degree in other parts of the nation, a growing number of factories like the Mossville, Ill., engine division of Caterpillar Inc., are piling overtime on their workers to handle the upswing.
Other companies, like Krementz & Company, a jewelry manufacturer in Newark, are rescinding schedules imposed during the recession that had cut their employees' work hours to less than 40 a week and trimmed paychecks.
In addition, there are many like the Hexacomb Corporation, a packaging company in Lincolnshire, a Chicago suburb, that have reached the limits of what they can comfortably handle with overtime.
"Both our shipments and our order rates are the highest they've ever been," said Douglas H. Walmsley, Hexacomb's president and chief executive. As a result, Hexacomb has been cautiously hiring handfuls of new production employees for plants in nearby University Park, in Kalamazoo, Mich., and North Haven, Conn.
Similarly, the Brunswick Corporation has begun hiring new employees for boat production plants in Topeka, Ind., and Murfreesboro, Tenn., to take pressure off workers now on overtime after production rates were jumped 10 percent twice in the last 30 days.
"There's a lot of pent-up demand," said Jack F. Reichert, Brunswick's chief executive, citing recent industry estimates that boat sales could jump nearly 20 percent, to 250,000 this year.
There are other changes, too, that are all but invisible though no less telling. Take the calls the Eskay Screw Corporation has been getting. "In December, we started seeing people in the home building and appliance industries who had left us searching for lower prices coming back and asking if we could supply them," said Morton Sennett, Eskay's president and chief executive.
So far, Eskay, a Wood Dale, Ill., subsidiary of the Trimas Corporation, has met all of the increased demand from inventories it built up gradually last year without altering its longstanding routine of running two nine-hour shifts five days a week. The returning customers, who need the screws to avoid costly shutdowns as their production lines get busier, are willing to pay enough to reward Eskay for having invested in its inventory.
"We anticipated the recovery," Mr. Sennett said.
The broad statistics make it clear that considerable momentum is building. Last Monday, for example, the latest monthly survey of purchasing managers concluded that new orders to all factories increased in January at the fastest clip since 1983 while production rose to the highest level in five years.
On Wednesday, auto makers reported that sales of new cars surged the last 10 days in January by nearly 25 percent to the highest level in two years. Thursday and Friday, the Government published a barrage of statistics showing productivity and factory orders rising while both unemployment claims and the nation's unemployment rate dropped.
 
Caution May Hurt
 The recovery may be muted by the continued reluctance of many bigger businesses to hire new workers, who would then have the paychecks to buy goods and services that would sustain the expansion. Economists cite companies like Honeywell Inc. of Minneapolis, which invested heavily in automation equipment in recent years.
Honeywell is seeing growth in thermostats and other home controls, along with switches, sensors, valves and similar components used in washing machines, dishwashers, autos and other durable goods. But it plans to meet that growth without adding to its work force.
The Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation is reopening a plant it closed in 1987 in Jackson, Tenn., but says it will be able to produce the same amount of fiberglass there with technically advanced systems that will require a staff of 80, where it once used 500.
Celentano Inc., a frozen dinner producer based in Verona, N.J., figures its automated equipment will allow it to expand output 15 percent on top of the recent 7 percent jump in orders it has seen without adding new employees. And at Inland Steel Industries in Chicago, mills are operating near capacity, backlogs are building and customers are being confronted with price increases. But plans call for continued work-force reductions.
 
Overtime Aplenty
 Over all, though, more people are likely to have more money to spend as the recovery progresses. Indeed, one side effect of the pressure on business executives to keep operations lean is that production workers who have jobs are more likely than ever to get overtime -- in some cases more than they want -- as the economy revs up.
At Caterpillar's engine group, where machine shop workers went on overtime last month and assembly workers are scheduled to join them working weekends this month, some workers dread the possibility of going to seven-day weeks even though it would add about $425 a week to the typical paycheck.
Richard Thompson, head of the engine unit, said that sales had taken off in recent months because of strong demand from the nation's heavy- truck builders. One visible sign: the number of trucks coming and going from Mossville's loading bays has jumped from 80 a day to about 100 in recent weeks. Mr. Thompson said that Caterpillar would shift workers from other units in nearby Peoria that are not so busy and farm out some operations if orders grew by an additional 20 percent.
Most pulp and paper companies also have some flexibility in how they will handle the upswing, the bittersweet side effect of how deeply they have been hit by the recession. For instance, the Boise Cascade Corporation has a long way to go before it needs to worry about adding new employees or equipment -- even though it is now running all its paper machines flat out and has a two-week backlog for its office products during what is traditionally a slack time.
The American Steel and Wire Company of Cuyahoga, Ohio, ran seven days a week through most of January to meet a jump in demand of more than 30 percent, said Thomas N. Tyrrell, president and chief executive. The company converts steel into rod and wire that other manufacturers make into springs, fasteners and other industrial components.
Profits are growing, though there is room for improvement. Further increases in new orders would allow for longer, more efficient production runs on individual items.
This week, in fact, production had to be cut to five days because of the general surge in economic activity. United States Steel, its supplier of high-grade steel, was caught short by rising demand and could not immediately fill American Steel's orders.
But other companies in industries that are benefiting from long-term growth trends are accelerating expansion plans because of the economic recovery. And it is clearly here that the recent job cutbacks at several big enterprises like I.B.M, Sears, Roebuck and the aerospace and military industries have been offset to begin to bring unemployment down.
AST Research Inc., a personal computer maker in Irvine, Calif., expects orders to grow by 28 percent in the current quarter, to 250,000 units. After initially resorting largely to overtime to handle the growth spurt that began last year, AST decided to double employment this month on its second shift to 500 workers and add a third shift by hiring 300 more workers.
"We've got to run this place 24 hours a day," said Richard F. Ottaviano, senior vice president in charge of administration. He noted that the company is also adding 30 new trouble-shooters to field telephone calls -- doubling that group of service personnel.
Similarly, a number of companies in Silicon Valley are expanding, although not always in the valley. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has seen capacity use of its local microchip plant jump from under 70 percent at the end of 1991 to about 90 percent and is now building plants in Japan and Austin, Tex. And the Read-Rite Corporation, which produces components for disk drives, is building plants in Japan and Thailand as well as Fremont, the town next to its Milpitas, Calif., headquarters.
"We are sprinting," said Cyril J. Yansouni, Read-Rite's chairman and chief executive.
Some companies whose growth is contributing to the recovery have a hard time feeling they are part for it. One, the Manitowoc Engineering Company, a maker of heavy-lift cranes in Manitowoc, Wis., went through periods in the 1980's when it had no orders. Now it has a record backlog stretching out to next summer and is scrambling for ways to make more than two of the $1.5 million machines a week.
Some 200 workers were hired in recent months and the company is looking at investments in new tools, according to Fred Butler, president of the Manitowoc Company, its parent. But almost all of the orders are from Asia and other foreign countries.
 
Big Growth in Yogurt
 By contrast, Stonyfield Farm, a small 10-year-old yogurt maker in Londonderry, N.H., has been booming without exports.
January sales revenues were $1.3 million for a four-week period, up about 25 percent from December when they were $1.2 million for five weeks.
Stonyfield has recently ordered approximately $800,000 in new capital equipment to expand plant capacity, and its 85-employee work force is operating on three shifts, five days a week. It may soon shift to seven days.
"We're in an unbelievable growth spurt, and we don't know why it's happening just now," said Gary Hirshberg, the founder. "We are wildly excited."
But at most older companies, the optimism is more tempered. "People have been through restructuring; they've seen the staff cut in half; they've seen their friends and co-workers leave," said Theodore L. Bonsignore, chief executive of Krementz, the jewelry company. "They want to see some stability. We all do."

HEADLINE: Delay on Tax-Credit Measure Stalls Projects to House Poor

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
Since the late 1980's, money from a Federal tax break for corporations has put thousands of low-income New Yorkers into new homes. Now legislation that would renew the financing is stalled in Washington, and that, coupled with state budget cuts, threatens plans for dozens of affordable housing developments in the state this year.
In New York City alone, the tax break, the Federal low-income housing tax credit, which uses money from corporations that buy tax credits to help pay for affordable rental housing, has supplied roughly one-third of the cost of rebuilding more than 5,000 apartments since 1989.
 
Using Abandoned Buildings
 Most of the units have been carved out of abandoned buildings that the city has taken from owners because of tax delinquencies. Of the apartments rebuilt with tax-credit money, 30 percent are set aside as permanent housing for homeless people. 
 At the state level, the proposed budget shows cuts of 25 percent in financing for two housing programs on which nonprofit housing groups depend for the affordable housing they help create. Cuts in appropriations to the Affordable Home Ownership program and the Housing Trust Fund, from $25 million to $18 million each, will mean, housing advocates say, that 1,800 fewer units of affordable rental and owner-occupied housing will be created in 1993.
Already the delay in the restoration of the tax credit, its proponents say, has slowed scores of public-private housing production machines that have in the last five years produced tens of thousands of units of low-income housing in the country.
"Spending for new housing production for low-income people was virtually eliminated at the Federal level in the 1980's," said Paul S. Grogan, president of Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a national nonprofit organization that provides financing for community development.
Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Housing Partnership, a nonprofit organization that assists with the development of homes sold to moderate-income buyers, said that if New York State's proposed budget stands, her organization will have to scratch plans for 800 homes for neighborhoods like Coney Island, Bushwick and the Atlantic Terminal area in Brooklyn, South Jamaica and Astoria in Queens, as well as the north shore of Staten Island.
State officials say there was no way of avoiding the cuts.
"We are aware of the desperate need for affordable housing," said Angelo J. Aponte, commissioner of the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal. "This year, for the first time, housing has been asked to participate in cost-cutting. We were not able to escape."
Mr. Grogan, whose organization, along with the Enterprise Foundation, has served in New York City as the managers of the tax-credit equity fund, said that "the work of building housing has been taken up by nonprofit organizations, tenant and community organizations and local public agencies."
 
Renewal Almost Certain
 The tax-credit bill has strong bipartisan support in Congress, making the eventual renewal almost certain. But the support it enjoys has been something of a liability. Lawmakers often use the tax credit, because of its support, to push through other less popular tax measures.
"We go through this every year," said Bart Harvey, vice chairman of the Enterprise Foundation, a nonprofit group in Columbia, Md., financed by the real-estate developer James Rouse. "The tax credit is always held hostage to larger political forces and used to carry through less popular tax initiatives."
Although renewal of the credit was part of a catchall tax bill approved by Congress last fall, President Bush vetoed it just before he left office.
Mr. Harvey said supporters of the tax credit are hopeful that it will be included in the second phase of President Clinton's economic stimulus package expected later this month. But they also worry that the debate this time around could be lengthened by political bickering over whether the tax credit should be permanent or renewable each year.
In New York, a project pending on 116th Street in East Harlem illustrates the impact of the delay in Washington.
For the last few years the pastor of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church pastor, the Rev. Peter Rofrano, has been trying to turn vacant buildings across the street into housing for the neighborhood. Now with a commitment from the city to turn the structures over to the church and its development partners, the final hurdle to a start on rebuilding is the part of the financing that is to come from the Federal tax-credit program.
"We were supposed to get started in January," Father Rofrano said. "Then the date was pushed to March or April. Now it looks like we won't get started until summer."
There are to be a total of 60 units carved out of the vacant 116th Street buildings and a third empty, city-owned property the church will take on 117th Street.
When financing for housing is delayed or cut, more than the bricks and mortar are lost. In many instances the new housing serves as the catalyst for the revitalization of neighborhoods after decades of neglect and disinvestment. And in the case of the tax-credit financing, the flexibility of the rules that dictate how it can be spent, allow it to be used to pay for more than just housing.
"The tax credit has been an important component in our 10-year housing plan," said Felice L. Michetti, commissioner of the city's Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, referring to the city's 1986 pledge to create 47,000 units of low-income housing. "The tax credit is used for development, but its value goes beyond that because the funds can be used for building operating expenses and social services like job training, and day care."
Ms. Michetti said that as part of the 10-year housing plan, so far 18,000 new units have been built and are occupied, and 17,000 units are under development. Tax credits have contributed to about 20 percent of what has been built.
Gus Rosado, executive director of El Barrio's Operation Fightback, a nonprofit community organization renovating buildings in East Harlem, said restoration of the tax credit is needed because it puts communities in charge of projects in their own neighborhoods.
"The partnership with the city and Enterprise Foundation," he said, "allows us to participate in the development of our own communities and makes us responsible for how well housing does in the future."
L.I.S.C. and the Enterprise Foundation raised $81 million for the New York City tax-credit equity fund in 1992. The money came from tax credits sold to companies like American Express and the Bank of New York. In exchange for investing in the housing, the companies receive reductions in their Federal income tax bills. L.I.S.C. and Enterprise distribute the tax-credit money to local community groups selected for their organizational skills and commitment to their communities.
 
Planning a Strategy
 Many of them, like the East New York Neighborhood Youth Corps, say their housing development divisions will be treading water if the tax credit is not restored soon. With help from the L.I.S.C., the Neighborhood Youth Corps has renovated 68 apartments in 13 buildings on some of the most troubled blocks of East New York. An additional 15 buildings with 51 apartments are nearing completion.
"We will be coming to a juncture soon where we will have to decide strategy for the next phase of development," said Carey Shea, director of the East New York organization, speaking from the office the group has renovated. "Without the tax-credit money, moving forward on our housing goals to renovate more buildings will be much harder."
The Housing Partnership, the state's largest user of the Affordable Home Ownership funds, would need $20 million in grants to meet its 1993 production goal, Ms. Wylde said. The proposed state budget would bring its share closer to $9 million.
The Partnership, which combines state and city money and bank financing to lower the cost of homes, helped develop 1,400 homes last year.
"Because the funding cuts are coming as we are using the last money of a special 1988 housing appropriation," Ms. Wylde said, "the actual impact on housing production will be greater than the 25 percent cut that has been proposed."

HEADLINE: Banks' Plan For Stimulus Is Questioned

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
After being cheered by the Clinton Administration's initial interest in their plan to loosen bank regulations as an economic stimulus, the nation's bankers are running into increasing skepticism about the merits of the plan.
The bankers officially kicked off a lobbying campaign against red tape in lending last week, timing it to closely follow the introduction of legislation to ease bank regulations by Senator Richard C. Shelby, a moderate Alabama Democrat. 
 The bankers cited stories about borrowers who were turned down by banks worried about failing tough new tests of lending standards. They presented statistics to back their assertion that the nation is in the grips of a persistent credit crunch.
 
'Half-Baked Arguments'
 But in a statement on Thursday, Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, brusquely rejected the bankers' evidence as "anecdotal stories and half-baked arguments," and warned Federal bank regulators against "swallowing the kind of shotgun claims the bank lobby has launched around town."
The bankers contend that unreasonable regulations and zealous auditors are harassing bankers to the point that they refuse loans even to good customers. This theme has struck a chord inside the White House, where President Clinton still remembers how many times small businesses and bankers told him the same thing on the campaign trail.
When William Brandon, the president of the American Bankers Association, told the President-elect in December at the economic meeting in Little Rock, Ark., that lending could increase $86 billion a year if regulations were eased, Mr. Clinton welcomed the prescription as the best kind of economic medicine: a stimulant that, unlike tax cuts or new spending programs, would have no direct effect on the Federal deficit.
Since then, top economic officials in the Administration have said they plan to re-examine banking regulations to see if loosening them will substantially increase the credit flow.
 
Pressed for Explanation
 But this week, Mr. Gonzalez struck back, asking Mr. Brandon for the evidence behind his $86 billion figure. After an exchange of statements by the Congressman and the banker, Mr. Gonzalez was not impressed by the banker's explanation.
The association's forecast, it turned out, is based on historical data comparing the most recent recession, during which lending stagnated, with previous ones in which banks continued to lend.
Bank lending in the last two years was 10 percent lower than in comparable business cycles, Mr. Brandon said. If lending could now be increased by just 4 percent, a number chosen more or less at random, there would be $86 billion in additional lending, he explained.
"Bankers from across the country, particularly those in the New England states, tell me daily that the adverse regulatory environment has forced a retraction in lending far above 4 percent," Mr. Brandon said. "It is, of course, impossible to quantify precisely how much credit could be freed up."
 
Stand Is Toned Down
 Mr. Gonzalez responded, "His claim was a shot in the dark, completely without foundation," to which Mr. Brandon issued a statement, calling the $86 billion valid.
But the banking association also seemed to do some embarrassing backtracking, first distributing a statement from Mr. Brandon that said "overly restrictive bank regulations are the primary reason" for the credit crunch, then within an hour dropping that assertion.
The second version instead said, "We believe that bank regulations can be reduced to free up lending without undermining bank safety and soundness."
Mr. Gonzalez and Federal regulators have conceded that some bank rules are inefficient and might be altered. In both the House and the Senate, for example, banking committee leaders plan to introduce legislation to create a single agency to regulate all banks, a job now done by several agencies.
 
Critics See Hidden Agenda
 But some critics say the banks have a hidden agenda, not to eliminate inefficiency and unnecessary paperwork but to undermine tough new standards imposed by recent banking laws to bolster the safety of the banking system.
"While the banks say their campaign will leave vital safety and soundness laws untouched, this is simply not so," said Michelle Meier, a lawyer for Consumers Union, a lobbying group that favors tight banking regulations.
The legislation the bankers support would, among other things, eliminate rules scheduled to take effect soon to require that a bank's outside auditors attest to its compliance with lending standards. The banks argue that the requirement will drive up costs and steer banks away from relatively risky small-business loans. The bankers also want to ease rules that could make directors and officers personally liable when risky loans turn sour.
Government studies suggest that factors other than regulations were foremost in holding down borrowing during the recent recession and the early stages of the recovery, which is now well under way.
And the Government's top auditor, Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, testified recently that weak loan demand, the collapse of real estate values, corporate belt-tightening and competition from nonbank lenders had more to do with the decline in commercial lending than red tape did.
"Congress, the Administration and the financial regulators should exercise great caution in considering short-term measures to encourage more liberal lending practices by insured institutions," he said.
 
Fed Credit Study
 A detailed study by the Federal Reserve Board, while not taking sides on the dispute, provides further ammunition against the bankers. The study found that "the restructuring efforts of borrowers and the modest financing needs in the current expansion are the principal reasons for the unusually slow pace of private sector debt growth this year."
The Fed acknowledged that stricter lending standards had posed problems for small businesses in particular, as the banks had emphasized. But, the Fed study said, "a growing number of indicators suggest that the period of credit tightening has ended and easing steps may be in train."
The Fed reported several pieces of data that further undermine the banks' arguments. For example, while banks across the country face exactly the same regulations, the pattern of commercial and industrial lending activities "varies considerably" from one region to another.
 
Shift in Concerns
 The Fed's own surveys of banks and small businesses "consistently indicate" that loan demand has not been strong and that credit has been available for worthy companies. Surveys in 1992 by the National Federation of Independent Businesses show respondents "not overly concerned" about credit availability, in sharp contrast to a decade ago, when it was found to be the leading problem.
Bankers said they could not produce any academic studies linking tight regulations with credit restrictions, with one exception.
Joe Peek, a Boston University professor who works for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Eric Rosengren, an economist at the Boston Fed, have issued studies showing that banks in New England reduced their lending after regulators forced them to maintain higher levels of capital.
But that is exactly the kind of regulation that Mr. Gonzalez and others on Capitol Hill say cannot be undone, and even the banks have not suggested that deregulation should mean cutting the amount of capital that weak banks must keep on hand to avert collapse.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
The Slimmer Side of a New and Sprightly Life

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
After more than two years of intense self-examination, Life magazine finally bit the bullet and made the decision to remain a monthly.
"We're through with the public hanging of the laundry," said Daniel Okrent, the new managing editor. "We have gone through a fundamental re-examination of the magazine, and we think monthly is a fine frequency." 
 Mr. Okrent, founding editor of the New England Monthly, which is now defunct, and a former assistant managing editor at Life, replaces James R. Gaines, who became managing editor of Time last week. Mr. Gaines was also publisher of Life, and in that post he has been succeeded by Nora McAniff, former New York advertising director for People magazine, another Time Inc. publication.
The naming of a separate managing editor and publisher restores Time Inc.'s cherished tradition of separation between the editorial and publishing sides of its magazines. In 1991 when Mr. Gaines, then managing editor, was given the additional title of publisher, critics saw it as another sign of the disintegration of a once-proud magazine.
 
Swinging the Ax
 Although they took over the reins less than two months ago, Mr. Okrent and Ms. McAniff have shown themselves firmly in command and ready to take tough measures to make Life more economical to produce.
Sixteen full-time staff members have been let go, although attempts are being made to place them elsewhere in the company. These include writers, reporters, researchers, proofreaders and members of the art and production departments.
The magazine has been trimmed from 10 by 12 inches to 9 by 107/8 inches. This not only saves paper, but makes the magazine a more standard size and potentially more attractive to advertisers. It will also enable it to go on the same press run with other Time Inc. magazines and to take advantage of advanced technology like ink-jet printing and selective binding.
Life will get back its own advertising sales staff. In recent years, the same advertising salespeople sold space for Life and People magazines, which Ms. McAniff said advertising professionals regarded as a weakness. She is in the process of hiring a staff whose sole job will be to sell space in Life.
In July, Life will cut the circulation rate base that it guarantees to advertisers to 1.5 million, from 1.7 million. This means that it will spend less to attract readers.
Life will also cut ad rates, a move that is expected to attract significantly more business. For instance, beginning in May, a four-color page will cost $49,500, instead of $76,605 now.
"It sounds like a really smart move," said Nancy Smith, executive vice president-director of print and media relations at Young & Rubicam. "The size reduction doesn't bother me. It sounds like it is going to help them in terms of better placement of ads. There will be more advertising in there, so the edit-ad ration will be more balanced."
There is evident relief in the decision, made in December, not to turn Life into a semimonthly, a biweekly or even a weekly, which was under serious enough consideration in 1991 that Life announced it was thinking of doing it. Mr. Okrent said the only option that was never considered was closing the magazine.
 
Middle America, and Proud of It
 Martin S. Walker, chairman of Walker Communications, a magazine consultant, remarked:
"The real issue is that Life is so imbued with the corporate culture and Henry Luce that it has a life of its own, and they tend not to make rational decisions about it. Basically, its problem has been in getting advertising -- it's a Middle America book; it's not hot; it's not exciting, and I don't know how much of it survives because advertisers are buying a Time Warner corporate plan."
Mr. Okrent said he was not considering any radical rethinking of the magazine. He wants the magazine to be topical but not necessarily news-ier, he said.
And he wants profiles to run in every issue, and even more pictures.
"Pictures are the vocabulary of the magazine," he said. "We use words to amplify pictures instead of pictures to illustrate stories."

HEADLINE: Next: Campaign Finance Reform

 BODY:
An unmistakable fog of political incompetence is beginning to form around the White House. The Bush and Carter Presidencies showed the danger of letting small droplets of error condense into an enveloping miasma. History also points out a quick fix uniquely available to Presidents -- change the subject by re-emphasizing a core promise. In President Clinton's case, one such promise is political reform.
No one can undo the mistakes of the past two weeks -- all the more reason for Mr. Clinton to get on with pushing ethics and campaign finance legislation on the Hill. But he must have the support of the Democratic leadership, and the unpleasant truth is that House Speaker Thomas Foley is still backpedaling on his pledge of swift action to clean up campaign financing. 
 The House has now approved two important measures vetoed by former President Bush: the voter registration reform nicknamed "motor voter" and the Family Leave Act. A good week's work all around. Yet Mr. Foley is reluctant to redress another damaging Bush veto killing last year's bill to overhaul campaign financing.
Mr. Foley has become the instrument of an inner circle of Democrats who believe that reform could loosen their grip on the House and who put partisan ambitions ahead of the nation's need for political reform.
His retreat represents a clear threat to Mr. Clinton, who looked weak after an inconclusive White House meeting on the issue last week with Mr. Foley and other Congressional leaders. Mr. Clinton cannot afford to leave the terms or timetable for a reform so central to the success of his Presidency to selfish members of Congress. He must grab the lead, and quickly.
Mr. Foley says he's committed to passing legislation that would reduce lawmakers' corrosive reliance on special interests and help restore competitive elections. But he won't set a timetable. That still sounds like Washington-speak for "we like our perks; the people can wait." True, the House did pass a promising reform package last year. But there wasn't anyone in the White House who wanted to sign it, much less make it tougher.
The Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, has put the campaign finance issue on a fast track, with the clear goal of getting reform legislation to the Senate floor by late next month or soon thereafter. Mr. Foley, who says he's "eager," also says he'll get around to the issue in the spring or maybe the summer. That's eagerness?
Ordinarily, a lag of a few months might not ring alarm bells. But to delay in this case could have heavy costs -- killing, for example, any chance that the reforms would apply to the 1994 Congressional elections. And it gives nervous incumbents and Washington insiders who profit handsomely under the system time to organize a fatal filibuster -- or to dilute the provisions until they seem more a collection of loopholes than serious reform.
The Speaker's excuse is that forcing members to cast tough votes on a campaign finance measure now could jeopardize Mr. Clinton's domestic centerpiece -- an economic package that will also require them to see beyond their own political needs.
He's got it backward. Swift enactment of a campaign finance measure incorporating Mr. Clinton's professed ideals of cleaner government would enhance the new President's battered standing with the public in ways that could only help make his economic arguments seem more persuasive.
With Mr. Foley's help, serious campaign finance reform could still be the crowning achievement of Mr. Clinton's first 100 days.

HEADLINE: Essay;
The Clinton Direction

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
Whither the infant Administration? We do not have to wait for the unveiling of the Grand Master Plan for the Economy, scheduled for Feb. 17, to find out. All a pundit needs is a handful of public signals, a few whispered tips and his handy-dandy divining rod.
Q: Which path will the new President take -- deficit reduction or economic stimulus? 
 A: Both.
Q: But wouldn't such policy resemble the pushmipullyu, the beast with heads at both ends?
A: Not a bit; here's how it works. Pick any number from 15 billion to 30 billion (the specific figure doesn't matter; Congress will change it anyway). That's the job-creating fiscal stimulus, a combination of new Federal spending ("investment") on electronic highways and computer-directed leafraking ("infrastructure").
Q: Won't such spending add to the deficit?
A: The deficit will start to be reduced, sometime next year, by an infusion of new taxes to help pay for the heavier spending in the works, pleasing liberals, with a small portion set aside for deficit reduction, pleasing conservatives.
Q: But if the economy is already making a strong comeback, why do we need the stimulus of increased spending? Won't that lead to inflation?
A: Let me let you in on a dirty little secret: No Democratic economist will ever admit this, but they don't think inflation of about 5 or 6 percent is such a bad thing. It would rescue real estate, which in turn would bail out banks and insurance companies now hung up on bad real estate loans; "reasonable" inflation would also allow government to reduce the deficit with cheaper dollars.
Q: Hold on, now -- if the Clintonites are going to raise taxes to pay for new spending, and even put a few bucks in the kitty to sop up some red ink, where's the stimulus? Won't it be a wash, and not contribute to inflation?
A: That's the theory. And the theory even steals a leaf from the supply-siders, holding that the coming boom will increase all tax revenues and reduce unemployment and welfare costs.
Q: If that's so, then why increase spending and raise taxes at all? Why not leave good enough alone, and let the pendulum swing back up to prosperity?
A: Ah-hah! You have come to the nub of the matter. The basic idea is redistribution: taking money (and the social services now bought with money) from the richer and giving it to the poorer, with a fresh fillip -- taking incentives away from old-fashioned industries and giving them to newfangled industries.
Q: What's so bad about soaking the richies, issuing health stamps and boosting the hackers?
A: Not enough richies. The surtax on incomes over $1 million will make populists feel they got even with successniks, and Ross Perot's notion of stripping Social Security benefits from successful working retirees will be adopted, but will produce relative pin money.
The increase in top rates first from 31 percent to 36 percent and later to 40 percent will generate more at first, but won't do the redistributive trick. That great day for sharing will come with the bite on the main source of the country's wealth -- the middle class -- which will be hit with energy taxes, sin taxes, and a pain-concealed value-added sales tax.
Q: How will this help growth industries doing their job-creating thing in clean exurban parks?
A: Redistribution of government incentives will begin with a capital-gains tax break that discriminates against old profits and old companies. And under the rubric of "managed trade," our chief protectionist will retaliate against foreigners who stand in the way of new-class companies.
Q: And redistributing healthwealth?
A: Hillary Robinhood Clinton has taken personal charge of this social equalization. Because the Republican alternative was accurately self-satirized at the Alfalfa Club in three words -- "Don't Get Sick" -- Democrats have a clean shot at removing the profit motive from health care, homogenizing treatment and killing the goose that lays the golden pills.
Q: Is this a new Democratic philosophy?
A: No; it's the old liberal redistribution dodge in designer jeans. But cheer up: the President proposes, Congress disposes; a little gridlock would be a healthy thing.

HEADLINE: The Law Can Recognize Sexual Harassment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Crying Wolf in Albany" (Op-Ed, Jan. 23), Sheryl E. Reich states that the charges of sexual harassment made this month by Earlene Hill, a member of the New York State Assembly, against some of her male colleagues did not constitute sexual harassment because those who perpetrated the acts had no power over her and "were not in a position to deprive her of anything to which she was entitled nor did they threaten to do so." 
 Ms. Reich claims these are nothing more than insensitive remarks to be brushed off or verbally responded to, unless they became so frequent and widespread that they prevent a woman from doing her job. (How long one should wait until the remarks are considered to be frequent, widespread and disruptive of one's work is left unanswered by her.)
If women want to enter the male-dominated areas of the legislature, courtroom and boardrooms, according to Ms. Reich, they should get used to loutish behavior. Charges of sexual harassment, when nothing more than rude behavior is involved, trivialize the issue.
It is Ms. Reich who fails to understand the nature, history and even the laws surrounding sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is a legal construction. It did not exist until sexual discrimination was included under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In 1977, in Tompkins v. Public Service and Gas, the courts made it clear that harassment of a woman would no longer be seen as a personal problem, but as sex discrimination, for which employers might be held responsible.
As women began to enter the workplace not merely as workers, but also as professionals, the definition of sex discrimination once again had to be redefined by the courts. Female physicians have reported sexually harassing encounters with male physicians who are not their bosses but their colleagues.
Dr. Frances K. Conley, a prominent female neurosurgeon at Stanford University, quit her position in 1991 to charge publicly that she had been subjected to 25 years of harassment in her male-dominated specialty. A court decision in Minnesota established that co-worker harassment was as inimical to a woman as that by a boss.
All law reflects the temper of the time. Law is dynamic and reflects the political and social conditions of the age. Our conception of sexual harassment has evolved to meet the changing social, political and economic conditions of our times.
Rather than offering women instructions in verbal retort to bad come-on lines, Ms. Reich would do well to check in with Assemblywoman Hill and other women who view law as the dynamic tool that it is, one that has been used to redress wrongs that those in power viewed as the way things have always been done around here.

HEADLINE: New York Has a Reasonable Labor Settlement

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Labor Agreement Will Haunt New York City" (letter, Feb. 2) by State Comptroller Edward V. Regan is fundamentally false and misleading. 
 The true cost of the contract is 8.25 percent, as we said when we announced the agreement. Contrary to the Comptroller's assertion, that figure of 8.25 percent includes not only the percentage increases city employees will receive in the next 39 months, totaling 7.16 percent cumulatively, but also the benefit increases and the present-value charge for the one-time $700 payment to employees.
Present value is a universally accepted method used by labor economists, auditors and accountants. The Comptroller's own office routinely uses this very technique in evaluating labor agreements.
Certainly, it is puzzling that the state's elected auditor cannot perform in this instance so simple a calculation. But beyond that, it is also discouraging that Mr. Regan so resolutely ignores how reasonable a labor settlement we have achieved for this city, well below the rate of inflation.
He even disregards the $1 billion to $1.5 billion saved by this settlement, compared with the costs he and his own staff predicted in a Dec. 17 report for the inflation-driven settlement they expected us to accept.
Moreover, the State Comptroller would have New Yorkers wrongly believe that no gains were made in achieving productivity in this contract. This is simply untrue. Laying aside the separate announcements by this administration of significant productivity initiatives in the Sanitation and Probation departments, this latest contract with municipal labor unions contains a historic first:
It provides for the first time ever for a binding process that will result in at least six productivity initiatives beginning by mid-1993. This is hardly symbolic.

HEADLINE: Social Security Won't Be Subject To Freeze, White House Decides

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Bowing to protests from retirees, the Clinton Administration has decided against freezing cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients as a way of lowering the Federal budget deficit, a White House spokesman said.
Mr. Clinton's decision went against the advice of his budget director, Leon E. Panetta, who had advocated a one-year freeze on the adjustments. The President had been warned by members of Congress that such an idea would go nowhere. 
 But the White House has still not ruled out increasing the taxes on Social Security benefits. Some Administration officials have suggested that this proposal would be more acceptable to the 30 million people who now receive monthly Social Security benefits, since it affects only those recipients who also receive substantial income from other sources.
 
'Special Contract' With Elderly
 Mr. Clinton has come under intense political heat over Social Security cuts since the White House floated the notion on Capitol Hill last month. Trying to mend fences at a White House meeting on Friday night, Mr. Clinton reassured leaders of the American Association of Retired Persons, an influential lobbying group, that he considered Social Security to be a special contract with the nation's elderly.
Mr. Clinton told the A.A.R.P. officials that he was also considering a plan to include the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare.
Asked today if Mr. Clinton was still considering a freeze on cost-of-living increases, George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said, "I think it's very unlikely it's something the President wants to do."
 
'Cut Government First'
 Mr. Stephanopoulos said curbing Social Security cost-of-living adjustments would hurt low-income people disproportionately and conflict with the principles Mr. Clinton is using to define his economic choices.
"The principles are, cut Government first, get the most from those who made the most, achieve both investment and deficit reduction and be fair," Mr. Stephanopoulos said.
In October, the Government announced that Social Security benefits would increase by 3 percent to keep pace with inflation starting with checks in January 1993. The increase meant the average Social Security recipient's check rose to $653 from $634.
A one-year freeze in cost-of-living increases next year would save as much as $15 billion in 1997, or about 10 percent of the total deficit reduction the Administration is seeking.
Mr. Stephanopoulos did not say whether Mr. Clinton might still propose an increase in the taxes on Social Security benefits. Under current law, retired couples with annual adjusted gross incomes above $32,000 and individual retirees with adjusted gross incomes above $25,000 must pay income taxes on half of their Social Security benefits. The Congressional Budget Office and others have suggested that one possible way of raising more money would be to make 85 percent of such income taxable.
 
Other Economic Issues
 As Mr. Clinton continued to lay the groundwork for the economic speech he will deliver to a joint session of Congress on Feb. 17, he has wrestled with a number of related issues that he hopes will allow him to set the stage for the bitter medicine he is expected to recommend.
On Tuesday, he will announce his plans to meet a campaign promise to cut the White House staff by 25 percent, and on Wednesday will announce a plan to cut administrative costs by 3 percent across the board, White House officials said.
But the President's announcement of staff or spending reductions in the White House will not be as sharp as Mr. Clinton promised during the campaign, and will not take effect until next fall, White House aides said.
In the meantime, the Clinton Administration plans to keep the White House staffed at Bush Administration levels, and is almost certain to request additional financing from Congress.
As recently as Jan. 12, Mr. Clinton told voters he would "present to the United States Congress a plan to cut the White House staff by 25 percent."
The announcement Tuesday will not precisely keep that promise, according to White House officials.
"We're biting the bullet on staff, with cuts virtually across the board," said one White House official. "But the final figure is going to be in the mid to high teens, not 25 percent." He added, however, that Mr. Clinton would announce a cut in overall White House spending, achieved through reductions in salaries and privileges, that "would be in the mid-20's."
Mr. Clinton said today that he had largely made up his mind about the elements of the economic package, which is expected to include tax increases for upper income individuals and consumers.
"I have made the decision on the general outline of the stimulus program, and I have made a lot of the specific decisions within it, but we're going to go back over it all one more time to refine it," Mr. Clinton said in a brief question-and-answer session at the White House.
For two days running, Mr. Clinton has been meeting with the members of National Economic Council to discuss spending and tax options. And he has been consulting with political advisers from his campaign, including Paul Begala, James Carville and Stanley Greenberg, on the best way to sell the plan he will present Feb. 17.
Today, the President announced plans to ask Congress to extend unemployment benefits for an additional 26 weeks beyond the 26 weeks now provided that end March 6.
"The old ways of doing business are simply not good enough anymore," Mr. Clinton said. "Unemployment compensation must now be both a short-term lifeline for workers and a long-term link to the skills that it will take for them to get where they want to be, back in the work force."
Mr. Clinton also announced today that he would abolish the Council on Environmental Quality and replace it with a new White House Office of Environmental Policy. That office, which would be about one-third of the size of the current council, will be headed by Kathleen McGinty, an aide to Vice President Gore who would assume the title deputy assistant to the President.

HEADLINE: Winning the Cold War and Losing a Job

SERIES: Peace Penalty: Connecticut's Morning After First of three articles.

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW LONDON, Conn.

 BODY:
Bill Sullivan sells cars for a living, but like everyone else here, he also counts submarines.
When Congress restored $2 billion last summer to the all-but-scuttled Seawolf submarine program at the Electric Boat shipyard just across the Thames River in Groton, Mr. Sullivan immediately felt the blip. His General Motors dealership ended the year selling more cars than any year since 1987, even as the recession deepened in Connecticut. But there was a troubling crack in that increase: much of it came from the used-car lot. Many new car lines plummeted 35 percent or more in one year.
 
A Shrinking Behemoth
 Similar fault lines are everywhere here, as the most Pentagon-dependent corner of the nation shudders and shakes toward a future after the cold war. In many ways it is a story of waiting for the worst. Unemployment is still lower than much of the rest of Connecticut, even though it has more than tripled from the 2 percent that was the norm through the 1980's to 6.5 percent as of December. 
 And the great sprawling behemoth of Electric Boat, with its chain-link ambiance and vast enclosed prefab submarine bays, remains open, though shrunken. More than 13,000 employees still cross the gate every day.
What is racking New London now is the certainty that nothing about this place, from the good union jobs and benefits in the weapons plants to the culture of life under the military umbrella, can be counted on to be the same, or even recognizable, by mid-decade.
 
200,000 Jobs Lost
 And similar dramas are being played out all over Connecticut, a state reeling from the twin demons of recession and cuts in military spending that have devastated the very foundation of its prosperity -- its manufacturing base.
Connecticut now has a work force of 1.4 million. In all, the state lost about 200,000 jobs, or one nonfarm job in eight, in just four years.
About one in six manufacturing jobs are gone, a casualty rate that rivals Michigan's in the early 1980's when the auto industry was going through its torment. And military cuts may eliminate another 30,000 jobs through 1997.
In the New London area, the implications of such cuts are everywhere.
From the Groton public schools, where nearly one of every two children has a parent in the Navy, to the city government, whose tax collections ratchet up and down with every change in Pentagon deployment schedules, to the real-estate brokerages, which saw home prices fall 10 percent in a matter of months last year as the Seawolf came under review, watching the vicissitudes of the military dollar is the local equivalent of tracking the stock market, and lately the only direction is down.
"People are pulling in, hunkering down, shutting in, shutting off -- it's a survival mode," said Christopher J. Emerson, senior pastor at the Mystic Congregational Church, where about 35 families in the 400 family-congregation have simply pulled up stakes and moved in the last two years.
At Family Services, a nonprofit mental health counseling service, the number of people seeking out-patient treatment rose 30 percent in 1992, including many people who had jobs but could not cope with living under the cloud of uncertainty. Counselors said that every mental health category from family violence to alcohol and drug abuse was up.
"What bothers me is that we're just beginning this cycle of down building," said Jay C. Bloom, the president of Family Services. "We've got three to four years ahead of cuts that will ripple through the economy."
 
Numbers Tell the Story
 The numbers tell much of the story. In 1990, the military accounted for almost 60 percent of the 110,000 jobs in New London County. But because such jobs pay so well, the military accounted for 81 percent of the total payroll in the county, according to studies of Federal figures by the state.
In 1989, the Pentagon spent $9,785 per capita in direct contracts in New London and its suburbs. That is more than three times what was spent in the second most military-dependent area in the nation, Dallas-Fort Worth, which received $2,852 per capita in direct contracts. Long Island, with Pentagon spending of $1,236 per capita, ranked fourth.
Those dollar totals are already just a memory even though the full effects have not yet hit home. The Navy, which once envisioned a fleet of 29 Seawolf subs, will now get only two. That has already pushed Electric Boat, which employed 18,000 people in Groton at its height in the mid-1980's, to shed nearly 5,000 jobs. Another 6,000 or more jobs are to be cut by 1997, even under the most optimistic scenario. In the worst case, Electric Boat will simply close.
The Navy has also begun shrinking its undersea warfare research laboratory, a sprawling 26-acre waterfront complex where submarine technologies and weapons systems are developed and tested. The lab had 1,400 employees last fall, 1,000 of whom will be gone within three years as the work is consolidated with another base in Rhode Island. Smaller suppliers have been battered and some have shut their doors.
"Everybody has come down to the attitude of 'I worked today, I got a paycheck Friday, I don't have any control over this,' " said Brian Cosgrove, a 36-year-old electrician at Electric Boat, who said his optimism rises and falls about whether he will have a job in six months. "The American dream is on hold," he said.
Mr. Cosgrove knows what that is like. He has 13 years on the job, and is vested in his pension plan, but he fell from a ladder several years ago, injuring his knee and keeping him on what is called a "light duty" roster. When the layoffs come, it could be by seniority, or it could be other criteria, like keeping only the able-bodied workers, he said. His fiancee, Paula Neas, is expecting the couple's second child in May.
 
The Past
Happy Marriage To the Military
 Putting dreams on hold is a mindset now increasingly common to this still-tough seaport city, which first rose and fell with the fortunes of the whaling fleets in the 1800's, and then rose again with a very similar working-class prosperity after World War II by building the new leviathans of undersea warfare for the Navy.
In interviews from City Hall, to shot-and-a-beer waterfront bars like the Sub, to Shalett Dry Cleaners, purchased in November by an optimistic couple moving here from Atlanta, the sense is repeated again and again that New London is a place apart. The clock was stopped here, residents say, at a time when skilled blue-collar union jobs were still the respected bread and butter of the community and where a child could and often did follow his father's footsteps as a welder, pipe fitter or painter down at the Boat, or E.B., as the Electric Boat shipyard is known.
Even if every other manufacturer in America fled overseas in search of cheaper labor, residents said, the Navy would not, if only for reasons of national security. Workers here were outside the commercial system, and so their sense of immunity and perhaps arrogance grew, even as much of the American economy was restructured in the 1980's.
"E.B. was always there, always the secure place to get a job," said Elaine M. Kuhn, a 48-year-old resident of neighboring Montville who was laid off last year from her job as buyer in the shipyard's purchasing department. "I thought, well, I'll go to E.B. and I'll probably retire from E.B."
So far, Ms. Kuhn has been unable to get a new job. She did find holiday employment, working about 10 hours a week as a sales clerk at two clothing stores, but those jobs withered with the end with the Christmas shopping season.
 
A Particular Local Culture
 Whether the particular local culture, with its mixture of blue-collar machismo and waterfront raucousness, will fade along with the military boom is also unanswerable. New London is a hard-edged place, where a compact and hilly brick downtown, built mostly in 1800's on whale-oil profits, abuts an industrial waterfront and a deteriorating seaside amusement park called Ocean Beach Park. Home to 29,000 people, it is the urban core of the region, and seems not to have changed much since Eugene O'Neill frequented the Dutch Tavern on Green Street, which still serves beer and burgers.
Music lovers say New London comes closest of any Connecticut city to having its own sound, a blues-influenced rock led by groups like Little Neil and the Vipers and the Savage Brothers, who play a six-nights-a-week schedule on a local club circuit that ranges from Moby Dick to El 'n Gee. If you want yuppie dance clubs and disco lights, go to Hartford. "Down here, they really like rock and roll," said Jill Mucciarone, a bartender at Moby Dick's.
The police say New London also has the most drug arrests per capita of any Connecticut city, and a reputation -- partly because of its location, midway between New York and Boston off Interstate 95 -- as a neutral ground for mid-level drug dealers from those cities to make their connections.
Other residents say the unchanging military presence also helped preserve the conservative traditions of the Irish, Italian and English immigrants and their descendants who make up a majority of the region's population, and those traditions are now the bedrock, for better and for worse, on which the region will have to rebuild.
"A lot of not wanting to change has been very positive, but a lot has been not very positive," said William T. Christopher, president of the small hospital here, Lawrence & Memorial. "This resistance to change has kept it dependent on things that are now not dependable, like the military."
As an institution, Mr. Christopher's hospital, Lawrence & Memorial, is preparing for a future of distinct limitations. The hospital's $50 million rebuilding plan, begun last year, envisions an aging population and little or no growth into the early years of the next century. Health services will be distributed through the county, with fewer beds and more out-patient geriatric services.
 
The Present
Jobs Are Fewer, And Pay Is Lower
 Skilled welders still make $16 or more an hour in the shipyard; pipe fitters average $13, and a secretary might make $14. And that does not include health benefits. In the world outside the military cocoon, that it is a package hard to duplicate. There have also been illegal fringe benefits like the theft of materials.
Hundreds of laid-off military workers are now croupiers, dealers and waitresses at the booming Foxwoods gambling casino operated by the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe just north of here in Ledyard. Out of about 1,000 laid-off military workers who got help with job searches over the last six months through a Federal grant program run here by the Southeastern Connecticut Private Industry Council, 200 of them ended up at Foxwoods, according to the Council's Executive Director, John A. Beauregard.
Most casino workers earn about $7 to $10 an hour, including tips, Mr. Beauregard said. By comparison, the laid-off military workers who have sought help from the Private Industry Council were making $12.40 an hour, a figure skewed by the larger numbers of higher-salaried white-collar workers who were in the first waves of layoffs. More recent groups of laid-off workers are weighted toward the blue-collar trades, he said.
Throughout the city and the region there are tales of people living without health insurance, and people like Ms. Kuhn who work from one short-term job to the next, and of people who simply moved away.
Luigi J. Fristachi may soon join that exodus. Mr. Fristachi, who is 58, and his wife, Lois, 54, both worked at Electric Boat and both lost their jobs on the same unforgettable day, Nov. 30, 1990 -- the first day of their midlife crisis, Mr. Fristachi said.
Trained in the military as computer engineer, he sent out more than 350 resumes, and received what are called "contingency" offers from two military companies: if the companies get a certain contract, Mr. Fristachi would get a certain job. In both cases, the contracts went elsewhere and Mr. Fristachi resumed his search. His unemployment checks, meanwhile, ran out more than a year ago. Mrs. Fristachi has gone through a series of temporary secretarial jobs.
"Our heads are just above water," he said. "But I refuse to get really depressed -- that's so self-defeating."
And there are winners, or at least people who feel that have broken even.
Albert Banks, for example, was laid off as a pipe fitter at Electric Boat in late 1991. Now he is a chef. Having graduated from the Connecticut Culinary Institute, he traded heavy labor on submarines for the more delicate art of judging the perfect medium rare at the Steak Loft restaurant in Mystic.
Down at Shalett Dry Cleaners on Bank Street, Bill Keeney also believes that bad times define the moments of keenest opportunity in business. He should hope so. Mr. Keeney and his wife, Bea, bought the 65-year-old company in November. They had a successful dry cleaners in Atlanta, the very center of the rising new South, but decided to sell to come home to New London where they both grew up, in belief that the place that gave the world the submarine sandwich will rise again.
"Sure, there may be some difficult times ahead," Mr. Keeney said. "We may just have to work a little harder, that's all."
 
The Future
Staying Optimistic Amid Uncertainty
 Local planning officials believe that one of the most dire clouds on the region's immediate horizon is not the retrenchment of Electric Boat and its chain of subcontractors, but rather the Navy's plan to move out its undersea warfare research laboratory.
In addition to the jobs that would actually be pulled from the area, development officials fear that many of the subcontractors who work in very close harmony with the laboratory will pull out as well, resulting in a loss by 1997 of more than 10,000 people, or about 6.3 percent of the region's total population of 167,000, from the naval underwater laboratory alone.
The Federal Government's policy of buying the homes of military personnel who cannot sell -- a likely scenario, city planners say, given the depressed housing market -- would then swamp the market with Government-owned properties that would have to be liquidated at fire-sale prices, further pulling down the region.
"We're really in a sort of never-never land -- we don't know what's going to happen," said Bruce G. Hyde, New London's director of Development and Planning. "So many things that would affect our future are out of our control."

HEADLINE: AIDES GIVE CLINTON BOSNIA PEACE PLAN

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Senior aides to President Clinton have presented him with a peace plan for the Balkans that includes the appointment of a special United States envoy to begin negotiations with the warring factions, senior Administration officials said today. They said the plan would also commit the United States to helping enforce any agreement, although it would not do so alone.
The officials would give few details of the plan, which they said the President had not decided whether to accept. They said no decision had been made on who the envoy might be, and it was not clear if enforcement efforts would involve American troops. 
 The officials presented what they called their "aggressive diplomacy" as an effort to complement the negotiations of the special international envoys Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen. They said the United States effort did not in any way mean that the Administration rejected or was trying to supplant the joint United Nations-European Community talks, which have been accepted by the European allies and Russia as the only alternative for peace.
By offering its own process, the Administration hopes to produce a settlement more acceptable to the Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to stave off a diplomatic blitz by the two negotiators to force the Muslims to embrace what they regard as an essentially flawed plan.
Mr. Clinton told the visiting President of Turkey, Turgut Ozal, today that he did not support the plan proposed by the two envoys and would present his own plan in "a couple of days," Turkish officials said.
 
No 'Punishing the Victim'
 In effect, Mr. Clinton has rejected the demand by Mr. Vance and Lord Owen that the Security Council impose sanctions on any party that does not embrace its plan. That would have required the United States to punish the Muslim-led Government of Bosnia, a move that an Administration official called "punishing the victim."
But the Administration plan, in what officials have disclosed about it thus far, does not seem to diverge from proposals made in recent days by Mr. Vance and Lord Owen on ways to improve their plan, which Mr. Clinton and his top aides consider impossible to enforce. Washington is also concerned that the Vance-Owen plan would reward Serbian aggression by dividing the country into ethnic enclaves but leave some territory acquired through "ethnic cleansing" in Serbian hands.
In addition to appointing an envoy who would meet the Bosnia Muslims, the Bosnia Serbs, the Serbs of what remains of Yugoslavia and the Croats, the Administration's plan would take these diplomatic steps:
*The creation of a commission to monitor human rights in Bosnia.
*The tightening of international economic sanctions against the Serbs.
*The creation of an international tribunal to try those accused of war crimes.
*The reiteration of the warning to Serbia by the Bush Administration that it will not be allowed to occupy Kosovo, a formerly autonomous province of Serbia with a 90 percent ethnic Albanian majority.
 
Turk Advises Arm-Twisting
 The American officials said Mr. Clinton was presented with the plan during a Cabinet-level meeting at the White House on Friday night that included his national security adviser, W. Anthony Lake; Mr. Lake's deputy, Samuel R. Berger, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
The Turkish officials said today that Mr. Ozal had advised Mr. Clinton to "twist the arm of the Europeans," who have been unwilling to enforce the United Nations-mandated ban on Serbian flights over Bosnian territory.
Mr. Ozal warned Mr. Clinton that if he embraced the Vance-Owen plan, which would divide Bosnia into 10 autonomous provinces, he would be approving Serbian "ethnic cleansing" of the territory. The Turkish leader added that the Vance-Owen plan, which he said would require an enormous commitment of ground forces, was ultimately unenforceable.
 
Fears About Kosovo
 The Turkish officials said Mr. Clinton had declined to reveal the details of the American plan to Mr. Ozal, but had assured him that the approach would be tougher on the Serbs. Mr. Ozal was said to reply, "If this killing continues, you will not be successful."
Mr. Ozal stressed during his meeting at the White House that the Serbs had already begun to move into Kosovo, Turkish officials said. He said Albania's President, Sali Berisha, told him in a telephone conversation on Sunday that the Serbs already had 120,000 troops in Kosovo, that every city had been surrounded with heavy weapons and that high schools and universities had been closed.
During his two-week visit to the United States, Mr. Ozal has been very critical of what he sees as Western paralysis and lack of will to stop the Serbs from "ethnic cleansing."

Bond Prices Fall as Auction Nears

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday as investors and traders prepared for the beginning of the quarterly auctions today.
The auctions begin with the sale of $15.5 billion of three-year notes today and follow with $10.75 billion of 10-year notes tomorrow and $9.25 billion of 30-year notes on Thursday. 
 The price of the 7.625 percent 30-year bond was down 14/32 yesterday, or almost half a point, to 1059/32 as the yield jumped to 7.19 percent from 7.15 percent Friday. The current 6.375 percent 10-year note dropped to 1004/32 , down 13/32 as the yield rose to 6.36 percent, up from 6.30 percent. And the price of the current three-year note dropped 6/32 , to 10116/32 , and the yield rose to 4.54 percent from 4.47 percent.
 
Other Sectors Affected
 Trading was light in both the corporate and tax-exempt municipal bond markets because of the coming Treasury auction. Traders said corporate bond prices were a little lower, while the prices of actively traded municipal bonds rose slightly.
Primary dealers, who do the bulk of the buying at Treasury auctions, often worry about the problem of "digesting" the billions of dollars of securities sold in the auctions. The fear is that the new supply will drive prices up and yields down.
In addition, before an auction many primary dealers sell some of the securities they already hold. One reason is to lighten their holdings so they can take on new issues. The dealers also hope that the selling will drive down the price of the new issues so that they can buy them for less.
But William M. Brachfeld, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities Inc., a primary dealer, said his firm was not interested in buying bonds now because the rally this year has already brought yields down to levels not seen in six and a half years.
He also said he was concerned that the rally had not been driven by economic fundamentals.
"My supposition," he said, "is that the market is trading on politics and not the economy, and that if Clinton does not say the exact right thing, this market could have a lot of problems."
Other traders seemed to be less worried. Some said yesterday that they expected the digesting of the new supply to be difficult but that there would be buyers. Still, the usual pre-auction caution was reflected by one relatively optimistic trader who said, "You always are tentative when you have a big run-up into supply."
When yields rose in the secondary market yesterday, the yields in the when-issued market for the auction also moved higher. But these yields were still lower than those in the secondary market.
Traders said this differential reflected good demand.
If the differential holds, it is still possible that the coupon on the 30-year bond will be either 7.125 percent or 7 percent, the lowest since the 30-year bond began to be issued regularly again between 1975 and 1977.
The yield on the 10-year note in the pre-auction market was 6.32 percent, up from 6.26 on Friday but still below the 6.36 percent on the current 10-year note. The yield on the 30-year bond was 7.15 percent, up from 7.11 percent on Friday but below the 7.19 percent on the current 30-year bond in the secondary market.
The yield on the three-year note was 4.69 percent, up from 4.62 percent Friday and well above the 4.54 percent on the current three-year note.
In the weekly auction of Treasury bills, the average discount rate for three-month bills was 2.94 percent, down from 2.97 percent last week. The average discount rate on six-month bills was 3.09 percent, down from 3.10 percent last week.
Following are the results from the Treasury auction yesterday of three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	99.257	98.438	Discounted Rate	2.94%	3.09%	Coupon Yield	3.00%	3.18%	High Price	99.259	98.443	Discounted Rate	2.93%	3.08%	Coupon Yield	2.99%	3.17%	Low Price	99.254	98.433	Discounted Rate	2.95%	3.10%	Coupon Yield	3.01%	3.19%	Accepted at low price	3%	4%	Total applied for	$48,802,900	$41,580,995	Accepted	$11,600,630	$11,623,730	N.Y. applied for	$43,727,790	$38,004,880	N.Y. accepted	$10,037,370	$10,441,015	Noncompetitive	$1,550,050	$1,106,325

HEADLINE: Florio Seeks $15.6 Billion In New Budget

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Faced with an electorate complaining about governmental gridlock, the Democratic administration outlined today a $15.6 billion budget with no big surprises for the next fiscal year and Republican legislative leaders made only pro forma objections.
Although the Republican leaders who control both houses of the Legislature made it clear that they reserve the right to cut both spending and taxes, the vow was more rhetoric than reality. In a tight-money year when Gov. Jim Florio and all legislators are up for election, both parties have an interest in producing a spending plan and avoiding the politically damaging specter of a government that can get nothing done. 
 The new budget proposal, which Governor Florio is to formally present to the Legislature on Tuesday, is about $900 million higher than the current year's, in part because the Florio administration expects a revenue increase from existing taxes because of an improving economy.
 
Cuts in State Workers
 In addition to the $15.6 billion, the budget includes a $150 million unappropriated surplus.
But the spending plan also foresees a further shrinking of state government, through attrition or early retirement, by about 4,700 employees this year, for a savings of $136 million. If that happens, said the State Treasurer, Samuel F. Crane, by the end of the next fiscal year, June 1994, the number of state employees will have dropped by 10,000 since Mr. Florio took office in 1990, from 71,000 to 61,000.
The reductions have been forced both by stagnation in the economy, which has reduced state revenue from taxes, and by the insistence of the Republican majority in the Legislature on cutting both taxes and spending.
Although Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian said today that he and his fellow Republican leaders in the Legislature would "go through the budget line item by line item and program by program as we did last year" seeking cuts, both he and Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, the chief Republican budget officer in the Assembly, agreed that a substantial understanding had already been reached on major budget items such as education aid and health care for the uninsured.
"I would hope there will not be the degree of acrimony there was last year," said Mr. Frelinghuysen, who was the Repubican point man last year on cutting $1.1 billion from the budget of $15.7 billion originally proposed by Governor Florio. With later additions, the budget for the current fiscal year is $14.8 billion.
 
Help from Washington
 Although Mr. Haytaian said, "my gut feeling is that there will be cuts" in the proposed budget, he did not pledge to cut either taxes and spending. Last year, at his urging, Republicans did both, leading to vetoes by Mr. Florio that were promptly overridden.
Trenton budget makers were helped out considerably this year by the new Clinton Administration in Washington. Only weeks after President Clinton took office -- helped in no small measure by New Jersey Democrats, who delivered the state to a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time in 28 years -- the Florio administration was informed that $412 million in disputed Medicaid payments would be forthcoming in time to be included in the current budget.
Another $96 million was also available for this year because the Federal Labor Department deferred for a year the payment of $96 million in unemployment insurance funds.
 
Republicans Urge Caution
 However, these pieces of good news were more than offset by other budget demands. Last year the state raised $900 million through revenue devices that cannot be repeated this year. And New Jersey faces another $900 million or so in increased costs for other items, including Medicaid, schools and corrections.
Furthermore, the budget is based on the assumption that the state is climbing out of the recession. To balance it, the Florio administration is counting on about a billion dollars in added revenues from increased tax collections resulting from expected economic growth.
The accuracy of those revenue forecasts was a subtext of today's news conference of Republican leaders. While Mr. Haytaian suggested that "a tax cut for the middle class" ought to be considered, he acknowledged, "I'm not sure that we can attain it."
And Mr. Frelinghuysen urged caution in assessing the new revenue projections, insisting they might be "too optimistic," in effect countering Mr. Haytaian's hint about a tax cut.
Noting the apparent conflict, Joseph V. Doria Jr., of Bayonne, the Democratic leader in the Assembly, said, "One would think they could at least see eye to eye on the matter of revenue forecasting, instead of subjecting the public to a good-cop, bad-cop routine."

HEADLINE: Eliot Janeway, Economist and Author, Dies at 80

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Eliot Janeway, the political economist and author whose career spanned seven decades, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 80.
Mr. Janeway had been in declining health for some years, suffering from diabetes and heart problems, his son Michael said. 
 Mr. Janeway was a vigorous critic of economic policies adopted by American Presidents from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan, a stock market forecaster whose gloomy predictions earned him the nickname "Calamity Janeway" on Wall Street, and a tireless commentator on the changing business scene.
 
Linked Economics and Politics
 Although he majored in economics at Cornell University and did graduate work at the London School of Economics in the early 1930's, Mr. Janeway did not champion any branch of economic theory. Rather, his writings stemmed from the hypothesis that political pressures determine economic and market trends.
"I'm the last person who could be accused of practicing economics in any sort of computerized vacuum," he once told an interviewer. "Political economy is not a science, it's a clinical art, like medicine."
Henry Kaufman, the former chief economist for Salomon Brothers who now runs his own money management firm, said: "He always tried to link politics and economics. I always found him very interesting and provocative."
 
'Colorfully Irreverent'
 Indicative of Mr. Janeway's ability to arouse attention is a recommendation in his last book, "The Economics of Chaos," published in 1989, in which he urged the Treasury Department to invest Social Security and other Government trust funds more aggressively, to generate greater benefits in the future. Such greater benefits, Mr. Janeway said, would in turn coax millions of workers in the underground economy to pay their taxes in order to reap the rewards of Government-sponsored programs.
Reviewing the book for The New York Times, Jeffrey E. Garten, an investment banker, said he found most of the suggestions unworkable but called the book "a colorfully irreverent and passionate essay."
Mr. Janeway's analysis and criticism of President Lyndon B. Johnson's handling of the Vietnam War was considerably more prescient. As an informal adviser during Mr. Johnson's career in the United States House of Representatives and the Senate, Mr. Janeway urged him to run for the presidency in 1956 and was an active fund-raiser for Mr. Johnson during the 1960 Democratic Presidential primary.
 
Breakoke With JohnsonLBJ Over Vietnam
 After Mr. Johnson became President in November 1963, Mr. Janeway disagreed with him on many points of fiscal policy, and broke irrevocably with the President when Mr. Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam in 1965.
"I was not arguing against the war itself; that is not my field of expertise," he once told an interviewer. "I said that putting it on the back of the economy without raising taxes and instituting controls would bring on disaster."
Mr. Janeway's writing career began at 24, when he wrote a series of articles for The Nation magazine predicting the 1937-1938 inventory recession and proposing a massive program of government investment in transportation and power equipment to cure it.
 
Hired by Luce
 "The Depression transformed economics from a subject of study into an obstacle to be overcome," Mr. Janeway said in the 1988 interview.
The articles attracted interest in the Roosevelt Administration and brought him some influence within its policy-making councils.
Another interested reader was Henry R. Luce, who hired Mr. Janeway to write part-time for Time and Fortune magazines. Mr. Janeway worked for the magazines until 1944, but for the next four years he worked directly for Mr. Luce, writing a private weekly economic and political advisory letter.
In 1948, he quit to write his first book, "Struggle for Survival," a study of the Roosevelt Administration's war-mobilization policies, published in 1951.
 
Economic Advisory Newsletters
 In 1955, Mr. Janeway started two weekly economic advisory newsletters that formed the heart of the Janeway Publishing and Research Corporation, a business he operated out of his five-story town house on East 80th Street.
In addition to his newsletters, in the 1960's and 1970's Mr. Janeway was a syndicated columnist for The Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate.
Over the years, Mr. Janeway never actually wrote his views. He dictated them.
"I don't think of myself as a writer," he once said. "I'm a talker who reduces some of what he says to writing."
 
Voracious Reader
 He tended to begin his days about 9 A.M. by reading a dozen newspapers, magazines and trade publications, and to finish around 3 A.M. by reading history, economics, biographies or novels.
His wife, the former Elizabeth Hall, is a novelist and essayist. They married in 1938.
Mr. Janeway was born in New York City on Jan. 1, 1913, the son of Meyer Joseph Janeway and the former Fanny Siff.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Janeway is survived by two sons, Michael C. of Evanston, Ill., and William H. of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
"H.H.S." used to be the Department of Health and Human Services. But now, employees say, the abbreviation stands for Hillary's Health Service.
And "H.C.F.A." used to be the Health Care Financing Administration, the agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid. But now White House officials say it means "Hillary can fix anything." 
 Not since the days when President Lyndon B. Johnson presided over the creation of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 has the White House taken so much interest in the department and its work.
To President Ronald Reagan, the agency was a great engine of Federal spending that had to be curbed. Under President George Bush, the department tried to strike a balance between compassion and fiscal prudence.
Under its new Secretary, Donna E. Shalala, the department has eagerly returned to its liberal roots. Officials say they are once again openly proud to work in office buildings named for champions of social welfare like Hubert H. Humphrey and Wilbur J. Cohen, an architect of Medicare.
"The poet William Blake once wrote that suffering has a human face," Dr. Shalala told employees the other day. "Thanks to you at H.H.S., service and kindness have a human face as well."
Dr. Shalala, the former chancellor of the University of Wisconsin, is not a "new Democrat" who tacks toward the political center but an old-style liberal, and proud of it. When Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative North Carolina Republican, opposed her nomination, Dr. Shalala said she regarded it as "a badge of honor."
Some insight into Dr. Shalala's politics can be gleaned from her selection of special assistants. As her chief policy adviser, she chose Patricia S. Fleming, who worked for 10 years as an aide to Ted Weiss, the liberal Democratic Congressman from the West Side of Manhattan.
In response to a question, Ms. Fleming said: "I'm certainly not conservative. I work for activists. After years of trying to push people to do the right thing about the AIDS epidemic, it's a joy to be here working for Secretary Shalala, who will make big policy changes."
Dr. Shalala's other special assistant is Sarah S. Kovner, another West Side Democrat active for many years on issues of social and economic justice. Mrs. Kovner, who attended Vassar College with Ms. Fleming, was a founder of the First Women's Bank and, more recently, the Community Capital Bank in New York.
 
Medical Association to Send Message to Hillary Clinton
 Clinton Administration officials promise to listen to outside voices in drafting legislation to overhaul the nation's health-care system. But so far the outreach has fallen short. Officials of the American Medical Association, in particular, feel neglected.
Dr. Raymond Scalettar, chairman of the association, said, "We have not had any direct contacts with Hillary's commission."
"Of course, we want a seat on the task force," Dr. Scalettar said. "We represent 292,000 to 300,000 physicians. We know how medicine is practiced. We can provide the input they need. It's disappointing that a physician hasn't been appointed to the task force to advise and guide and direct."
Dr. Scalettar said hundreds of doctors would come to Washington in late March to lobby Congress and Administration officials. They hope to meet with Mrs. Clinton.
"She'll get the message," Dr. Scalettar said.
 
Health Policy Tug-of-War Playing Out in Administration
 President Clinton says he favors a policy of "managed competition," in which networks of doctors and hospitals compete to provide high-quality care at low prices. But first he will have to manage the competition among health-policy experts vying for a role in formulating his policies.
At the White House, there is Ira C. Magaziner, a former Rhodes Scholar who met Mr. Clinton at Oxford University and made millions as a business-strategy consultant in Rhode Island. His emphasis on free-market forces has strained relations with Judith Feder, the health-policy coordinator at the Department of Health and Human Services, best known as the architect of a $69 billion health-care package proposed by a Congressional commission in 1990.
Paul Starr, a professor of sociology at Princeton University, wrote "The Social Transformation of American Medicine" in 1982. His book traced the rise of doctors as a sovereign, prosperous profession. Now, it seems, he himself may help transform American medicine.
Callers to his telephone in New Jersey get a message saying: "This is Paul Starr. As of Feb. 1, I am on leave from Princeton at the interagency Task Force on National Health Care Reform, chaired by Hillary Clinton."

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
Scarsdale Woman Helps Ease the Strain When Cultures Clash

BYLINE: By Joseph Berger

DATELINE: SCARSDALE, N.Y.

 BODY:
THOSE who fret about the strains between Japanese and Americans should meet Kuniko Katz. She is a living bridge over those troubled waters.
She is a Japanese woman married to Jeffrey Katz, a Bronx social studies teacher. Her two children, Danny, 15 years old, and Debbie, 13, attend Japanese weekend schools but they were also bar and bas mitzvahed. And she has located herself in a town where there have been some awkward misunderstandings between long-rooted Americans and the arriviste Japanese. 
 Two years ago, a magazine article spoke ominously of "The Japanning of Scarsdale" and it was illustrated by a photograph of a station platform dominated by somber-faced Japanese businessmen. Your time is over, the story seemed to say to non-Japanese residents of Scarsdale.
Many people here feel the article overstated whatever discord there was, that there was something essentially absurd about talking about "Japanning" when most Japanese families are here for three- or four-year tours of business duty. Still, the article struck a raw nerve because it came amid a national petulance over the Japanese economic invasion and because many of its vignettes hit the mark.
It is true that Westchester County's 20,000 Japanese have not made much of an effort to plunge into community activities, a feature of suburban life that some locales have practically elevated into a residential requirement. It is also true that Japanese youngsters sometimes feel ignored by their American classmates while American teen-agers see the Japanese as standoffish.
The article wounded Mrs. Katz, a slight, soft-spoken woman who can appear fragile to the uninitiated. She has had to raise children to meet the lifelong challenge of navigating two cultures. While she has made it her business to teach some basic Japanese to the town's police officers and librarians and has recruited Japanese women into the P.T.A.'s, those efforts were evidently not enough.
So recently Mrs. Katz resorted to a venerable folk remedy. She helped organize a get-to-know-your-neighbor festival. For the last four Tuesdays, Americans who live in Scarsdale have been attending lectures on the history, religion and mores of the Japanese at the Hitchcock Presbyterian Church, itself long a bridge between the two communities. "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About the Japanese but Were Afraid to Ask," her fliers trumpet. And on Wednesdays, Japanese have attended lectures on America's mysteries.
"I don't have a crusade kind of attitude," Mrs. Katz says. "I want my children to grow up to be decent human beings who understand different cultures, who don't develop any prejudices."
Still, the tensions are for her more than an academic exercise. Mrs. Katz was born Kuniko Koga in Kumamoto, Japan. She came here in 1969 to study physical therapy at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, and, when a roommate introduced her to Jeffrey, her life took an irrevocable turn.
She has come to know both cultures from her special vantage. Japanese standoffishness, she says, is really a tribal shyness. Unlike glad-handing, compulsively confessional Americans, Japanese are expected to grasp the delicacies of a situation without conversation.
"In Japan, silence is encouraged," Mrs. Katz points out. "Once you open your mouth, you show how ignorant you are."
In Japan there is no tradition of volunteerism, and women find the idea of leaving children with baby sitters to volunteer a sin verging on child abuse.
"Their entire existence is to make children get into a good college," says Mrs. Katz, her dark eyes twinkling wryly.
Such cultural incongruities have often been wrenching for Mrs. Katz, particularly in using her acquired American manners with her more traditional Japanese acquaintances.
"Sometimes I want to express my feelings," she said. "But if I express myself too strong then I get into trouble because they tend to be very polite. To harmonize, they don't want to say outright what they think. But talking to Americans you have to say what you think."
In such incongruities Mrs. Katz has also come to see opportunities. In their mad devotion to education, Japanese mothers, Mrs. Katz has found, are not all that different from Jewish mothers, who make up a sizable portion of Scarsdale's women.
"The mothers would do anything. They would stay up late while kids are studying for exams and make them snacks."
Yet as she tries to exploit such commonalities to narrow the cultural gulf, Mrs. Katz knows she is also chafing the bruises of her own paradox.
"I feel I belong here," she says, "but from an American point of view I'm an outsider. In Japan, also, you are in your own country but you still feel somewhere an outsider. I belong in both places. On the other hand I don't belong in either place."

HEADLINE: Morgan's Baton-Wielding Banker

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
By day, he is one of Gotham's mild-mannered international bankers. By night, dressed in dark tails and a crisp white tie, his passion is music. Yet most New York music buffs had not heard Richard Westerfield of J. P. Morgan conduct an orchestra until last week.
In what has turned out to be Lincoln Center's version of a Cinderella story, Mr. Westerfield is winding up a series of performances tonight with the New York Philharmonic. Last Wednesday, the 35-year-old conductor was tapped at the last minute to stand in for Erich Leinsdorf, the famed European conductor and a frequent Philharmonic guest conductor, who had to bow out of his scheduled performance because of a back injury.
 
Stroke of Gusto
 Enter Mr. Westerfield. With just three rehearsals, he led the 100-plus musicians of the Philharmonic through three pieces, including a complicated tone poem by Richard Strauss, to critical praise -- even if he accidentally tossed his baton into the audience Saturday night in an energetic stroke. 
 Despite that display of emotion, Mr. Westerfield is so modest about his debut that he requires prodding from his wife, Helen, to describe the response: several standing ovations, including one during which the orchestra remained seated to signal that the conductor deserved the credit.
"The orchestra played wonderfully," he said during an interview yesterday in his apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. "It was fantastic."
"The young American conductor," wrote Bernard Holland in his review in The New York Times, "has sound ideas on organization, an acute rhythmic sense, a clear technique and perhaps most important of all, he seemed to enjoy the confidence of the Philharmonic players."
It was not until last Wednesday that those players learned that Mr. Westerfield would be their maestro. For about a week and a half, he remained seated during rehearsals, fulfilling his backup role as "cover conductor" to Mr. Leinsdorf.
When Mr. Leinsdorf phoned in one day before opening night to say that he could not work, Mr. Westerfield stepped up to conduct last Wednesday's rehearsal. Still it was by no means a certainty that Mr. Westerfield would actually conduct the Philharmonic the following night; the orchestra could have decided to find a better-known conductor.
 
Vote of Confidence
 But after the rehearsal and a meeting among the orchestra's management and leading players, Mr. Westerfield was given the nod.
"We were impressed with the grace with which Mr. Westerfield was able to move into the rehearsal process on short notice," said Elizabeth Ostrow, the Philharmonic's artistic administrator.
"It was a wonderful opportunity, the decisive moment when everything changes," Mr. Westerfield said yesterday.
How much his career will change is unclear. The phone rang often yesterday afternoon in his apartment. And colleagues at J. P. Morgan & Company, the large banking institution, had been kidding him before he left on "vacation" about whether they would see him again, given his first love. "My passion is conducting and always will be," he said.
That passion was kindled when the New York native was 17 years old, and sang the lead role in the first high school production of Leonard Bernstein's "Mass" at Fox Lane High School in Bedford, N.Y. Five years later he would conduct his first orchestra, a group of students at Yale, where he received an undergraduate degree in music and economics and a graduate degree in orchestral conducting.
 
Studying with Masters
 He spent summers at the Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Mass., studying under Mr. Bernstein, Gustav Meier and Seiji Ozawa. He then taught conducting at Brown University for two years. During that time, he had the opportunity to conduct at Carnegie Hall.
As the lone musician in a business-minded family, his decision to enter business school at Dartmouth was roundly applauded by relatives. "Music is a very difficult way to earn a living," he said, particularly for a young family that now includes a 5-year-old son, Stephen, a 2-year-old daugther, Joanna, and his wife, a choral conductor he met in Europe while both were studying on Fulbright Scholarships. "Rather than waiting tables to keep myself going, I decided to develop a specialty in a field that was intellectually satisfying."
 
Third World Work
 His aptitude in finance won him a post at Morgan, which knew of his music interest from the start. "It has a culture of respecting people as individuals," he said. A year later, he was invited to join Morgan's Sovereign Group, where he has worked with the finance ministers of Argentina the Philippines, Uruguay and other countries, to get access to capital markets in the United States and Europe.
He says that he likes the work and feels he is helping to raise the standard of living in the third world. But the long hours have taken him away from his music, save for the occasional vacation and leave of absence to conduct.
But nothing, he said, can compare with conducting the New York Philharmonic. He feels he performed well, and laughs off the time when his baton went for a ride into the seats only to be passed back up to him by audience members and the principal viola. Through it all, Mr. Westerfield did not miss a beat. He was too preoccupied, however, to notice whether one of the dozens of Morgan colleagues in the audience helped ship the baton back up to the podium.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Traders See Strong Dollar Despite Mixed Performance

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar turned in a mixed performance on world currency markets yesterday, but the underlying tone remained bullish.
Gold prices were narrowly mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $328.90 a troy ounce, up 20 cents from Friday. The Republic National Bank said gold slipped 5 cents an ounce, to a late bid of $327.75. 
 The stage appeared set for a higher dollar following last week's cut in interest rates by Germany's central bank. Lower rates abroad make yields on United States securities more attractive in comparison.
But the dollar came under some pressure as traders cashed in on the currency's recent run-up.
Traders said the market shrugged off comments from German officials that their nation's economy did not warrant a rate cut.
 
 
'Market Took It in Stride'
 "It should have been bearish for the dollar, but the market took it in stride," said James Maccario, chief dealer at the Bank of Boston. He noted that with the United States economy continuing to show expansion, the foundation is in place for further advances in the dollar.
"It looks like we're developing into a bull market," Mr. Maccario said. "But how high we go is another question."
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 124.35 Japanese yen, down 0.38 yen from Friday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 123.96 yen. In New York, the dollar settled at 123.725 yen, down from 124.45 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.4397, from $1.4478 late Friday. In New York, it cost $1.4385 to buy one pound, less expensive than Friday's $1.4460.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.6565 German marks, down from 1.6590; 1.5350 Swiss francs, up from 1.5325; 5.6060 French francs, down from 5.6075; 1,527.75 Italian lire, down from 1,532.00, and 1.26275 Canadian dollars, up from 1.26155.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $328.05 a troy ounce, from $328.15 late Friday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $328.05, from $327.70 on Friday. In Hong Kong, gold rose 33 cents an ounce to close at a bid of $328.19.

HEADLINE: Lorenzo's Oil: A Movie Outruns Science

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
THE new movie "Lorenzo's Oil" tells how the parents of a child with a rare illness overcame indifference in the medical establishment and, by themselves, invented a cure.
The message is that medical science has become detached from the needs of those it serves, but that individuals can leap bureaucratic impediments to find new cures with their own faith and efforts. 
 The message is important, if true, because many medical interest groups have noted the example of AIDS activists who have argued that medical research can be inhumane and move at a snail's pace and who have succeeded in garnering Federal research funds and changing drug approval policy for their disease.
But the facts of the boy's case turn out to be significantly different from what is portrayed in the movie.
According to the movie and the account of the parents, Augusto and Michaela Odone of Fairfax, Va., they refused to accept doctors' advice that there was no hope for their son, Lorenzo, after they were told in 1984 that he was suffering from a rare hereditary disease known as adrenoleukodystrophy.
The disease, passed from symptomless mothers to their sons, relentlessly destroys the sheath around nerve fibers, impairing their ability to conduct signals. After the onset of the disease, children lose the ability to walk or talk, and death usually follows soon afterward.
Although the Odones had no medical training -- he was an economist and she was an editor -- they defied the medical establishment's pessimism, read obscure medical journals and figured that a mixture of two natural oils, known as erucic and oleic acids, would correct an important symptom of the disease. This mixture, they and the movie assert, proved to stabilize and partly reverse Lorenzo's otherwise inevitable decline.
But their claim to have invented the oil is disputed by Dr. William B. Rizzo, a researcher at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond, who suspected that oils might suppress certain fatty acids that build up in the blood of patients with Lorenzo's disease. He tested a variety of oils, one by one, in laboratory studies, showing that a certain class of oils, including erucic acid and oleic acid, could largely prevent cells from making long-chain fatty acids, the biochemical hallmark of adrenoleukodystrophy.
"The idea that monounsaturated fatty acids could be used therapeutically was derived entirely by me," Dr. Rizzo said. "It was not Mr. Odone's idea. To be honest, this whole thing started with that finding. Everything else was jumping off from that."
The Odones, stressing their own role, said they developed the rationale for combining oleic and erucic acids, found companies to produce the oils, tested the oil immediately in Lorenzo and in Mrs. Odone's sister, and demonstrated that it could lower the amount of fatty acids in the blood. "We saw he had made an interesting observation about what happened in the laboratory," Mrs. Odone said. "But the consensus was that it would not work in vivo. The scientists said, 'We know it cannot work.' This was from Mount Olympus. Period."
The Odones, Dr. Rizzo said, "have to deserve credit for not only finding companies that would synthesize both oils but also for pushing for oleic and erucic acid for their son."
"They get my accolades for sure," he said.
 
The Crucial Question
 But no matter who actually discovered the oil, the real question is, does it work? Dr. Rizzo and other scientists say that although the oil does bring down the level of long-chain fatty acids in the blood, a principal symptom, there is no proof yet that it changes or improves the course of the disease.
Dr. Rizzo began the first pilot study of the oil in August 1987. Six of 8 boys in the study deteriorated rapidly. The other two seemed to stabilize for a time, but one has now had a relapse and investigators have lost contact with the other.
In a study by Dr. Hugo Moser of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 70 children with the rapidly progressing disease used the oil from the time of their first symptoms until they lost sight and movement. The oil, Dr. Moser concluded, "did not make any difference."
Dr. Moser said that so far he had seen no evidence that Lorenzo's disease could be prevented in boys who were otherwise destined to get it.
But what about 14-year-old Lorenzo? Isn't he living proof that the oil at least prolonged his life? The Odones say he is. "He answers yes and no to age-appropriate questions by wiggling the fingers of his right hand to say yes and closing his eyes to say no," Mrs. Odone said. He also says "perhaps" -- his left fingers wiggle up a storm.
Mr. Odone said Lorenzo "has made progress that my common sense tells me, in the absence of any other explanation, is due to Lorenzo's Oil." He added, "It is reasonable to assume that almost every other kid who was diagnosed when Lorenzo was diagnosed is now six feet below the ground."
 
Others Still Living
 In the movie, the actor playing Dr. Moser tells the Odones that Lorenzo will be dead two years after his first symptoms in 1984. But Dr. Moser said he never said that. "I know of 12 patients who developed symptoms at the same time as Lorenzo who are still alive and in their teens or early 20's, even though they had no therapy," Dr. Moser said. "The fact that he survived is not an indication that the oil made a difference."
Dr. Moser said he also doubted that Lorenzo got any better because he had used the oil. He said the Odones had dedicated themselves to finding ways to communicate with Lorenzo. "The improvement may be due more to the subtleness of the testing than to the oil," he said.
How could an oil that corrects the biochemical abnormality fail to benefit patients? Researchers say they suspect that more than one gene is causing the disease. The long-chain fatty acids could accompany the disease but not be its cause.
One reason for doubting a crucial role for fatty acids is that about half the boys who inherit the gene for adrenoleukodystrophy never get Lorenzo's disease or develop only a mild form of it in adulthood, Dr. Moser said.
Some parents who used the oil say they were bitterly disappointed with the treatment and angry that the movie depicted it as a cure.
Cathy Barton of Milford, Conn., gave the oil to her son, to no effect. "It's not a cure," she said. "That's all there is to it."
Mrs. Barton and her husband, Mark, had no clue that their firstborn son, Colin, had anything wrong with him until he had a seizure in July 1990. As soon as the disease was diagnosed in him in October, they started giving him the oil. But it was to no avail. Even though his very long-chain fatty acids went down to normal, Colin deteriorated rapidly, and in February 1991 he was paralyzed, blind, deaf and unable to swallow. But he could scream, for hours at a time.
On Feb. 24, 1991, the Bartons admitted Colin to a hospital and asked that he not have a feeding tube. "That would only prolong his suffering," Mrs. Barton said. He died on May 9.
 
A Mother's Distress
 Mrs. Barton said she was very distressed by the movie. "My own brother called me up, not realizing Colin was on the oil, and said, 'Cathy, I don't want to upset you but there's a cure for this," she said. " 'There's this oil now.' I'm like, 'Michael, that's what Colin was on. From October until the second week of February I was pouring that stuff down his throat.' " She added, "I wonder what other people are thinking who know my son died of this disease."
But the Odones say they know of many children who have been taking the oil for years and never became ill. They insist that they have found an answer for desperate parents and that researchers are doing their best to discredit the Odones because they are not scientists. "There's a little bit of sour grapes," Mr. Odone said.
"We respectfully claimed the right to have an independent mind and to study everything available in the literature, formulate hypotheses and test them," Mrs. Odone said. "Interestingly enough, they turned out to be right."
The researchers "believe that science has its own pace and they believe it's a bit leisurely," she said, adding that she and her husband did not have the luxury of waiting.
The Odones say they hope people will come away from the movie with a powerful message. Mrs. Odone said: "Our message to parents is: realize that your interests and the doctors' interests are not parallel. You may have a motivation and a time limit that these people do not have."
But researchers and ethicists say they are deeply troubled by the way the movie so powerfully conveys the Odones' conviction that they invented a cure for Lorenzo's disease and that traditional science was no help when parents were faced with a suffering child.
Researchers say the case of one child cannot prove anything about the oil, nor can the stories of other boys who have taken the oil and not yet become ill. The only proof of benefit, or lack of it, they say, comes from the scientific studies that the movie and the Odones so deplore.
Scientists say that they, too, desperately want to cure deadly diseases. But they find they must fall back on the painstaking pace of science, the publication of results, and the disinclination to believe anecdotal evidence. Otherwise they have their own natural inclination to see benefit in new therapies, even when there is none. They say it can be hard to convince grieving parents of a child with an unrelenting illness that everyone loses when case histories are accepted as proof of benefit and the dispassionate evidence of science is discarded.
"Americans love a personal story," said George Annas, director of the law, medicine and ethics program at Boston University. "They cannot identify with a randomized clinical trial. They cannot identify with science. But they can identify with a real-life child." And when a movie dramatically conveys a message that researchers think is false and damaging, "it's scary," Mr. Annas said.
 
Myths Seen in Movie
 Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Minnesota, cited what he said were "three myths" perpetuated by the movie. First, he said, "the culture wants to believe -- desperately -- that cures can be found if only bureaucracy and red tape will get out of the way."
In addition, Dr. Caplan said, the movie "reflects the strong American belief that perseverance, hard work and love can conquer any ailment."
And, finally, he said, "there's the theme that mainstream science is indifferent" to the suffering of patients and their families. "There's a scary representation of slimy, scuzzy medical researchers," he said. "That reflects something the research community has to take seriously in terms of how mainstream Americans view their character and their conduct."

HEADLINE: A Teach-In on Nannies

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's rejection of a second female candidate for Attorney General has roiled the country, leaving a lot of people angry and frustrated. Yet the issues are different in the cases of Judge Kimba Wood and Zoe Baird. Unless the White House and the electorate start to draw some distinctions, appointment of high government officials will become mired in confusion.
The most immediate question is why President Clinton dropped Judge Wood when, unlike Ms. Baird, she had broken no laws. The distinctions between the two cases are important. Zoe Baird knowingly violated the 1986 immigration law by hiring illegal immigrants as household workers. She considered it a technical violation, consulted her own lawyer and was sponsoring her baby sitter for residency. Nonetheless, by openly breaking the law she forfeited her claim to a job that required her to uphold the nation's laws and oversee the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
 Judge Wood, on the other hand, hired an illegal immigrant as her baby sitter before the 1986 law went into effect. She did pay taxes and did attend to the requisite paperwork. If President Clinton dropped her primarily to avoid a public relations problem, he did her an injustice. But it is equally plausible that a loss of confidence in Judge Wood at the White House sealed her fate.
She asserted that when the President asked her whether she had a "Zoe Baird problem," she said no and did not volunteer until late in the process that she had hired an illegal immigrant when it was still lawful to do so. Her answer, while honest, may have led President Clinton to question her judgment and willingness to level with him. If the President lost confidence in their ability to work together, then his decision to drop her nomination was a legitimate exercise of executive prerogative.
But the Baird-Wood episodes raise broader questions about whom the President can name to be attorney general and to serve in other posts. Mr. Clinton's spokesman George Stephanopoulos said yesterday that all candidates for jobs subject to Senate confirmation were being asked if they had hired aliens illegally or violated tax laws on household help, and that if the answer on aliens was yes, that would probably be disqualifying.
Raising these questions is not going too far for an Administration that claims to represent a new dawn of fairness for women in America. After what Ms. Baird and Judge Wood have been through, it would be the worst hypocrisy for Mr. Clinton to now declare a moratorium on such inquiries just because the issue is starting to pinch men. Questions of adherence to tax laws, immigration laws, indeed any laws are always fair ones for people whose salaries are paid by taxes.
But once that threshold is reached, a series of more nuanced questions come into play -- questions that require Presidential intervention rather than another appearance in the briefing room by Mr. Stephanopoulos. It is time to hear President Clinton's views on the kinds of distinctions that apply in these cases. Does the President propose an absolute litmus test on all legal violations? Does it matter if the transgression was willful or negligent? Prolonged or transient? Involving large sums or small? Isolated or part of a pattern? Highly relevant to the job under consideration or marginal?
As a candidate, Mr. Clinton was full of hairline distinctions on such questions about his own personal life and professional record. As President he has an obligation to lead public opinion and stake out the standards by which he will govern. One reason he has gotten low marks in his first weeks is that it has been so hard to find him, or even his fingerprints, on important issues.
Once Mr. Clinton decided to seek women for high offices, it may have been inevitable that the issue of child care would arise, exposing the fact that so many child-care workers today are illegal aliens. Ms. Baird volunteered the information herself. Not everyone would have. And a man whose wife had hired an illegal immigrant probably would have survived nomination.
The perception that child care is primarily a woman's responsibility perpetuates a double standard. It's unquestionably healthy that all candidates for top Presidential appointments -- male and female -- will now have to provide the same information about household help.
As members of a generation with complex private and professional lives, Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, may want to take this as an opportunity for a national teach-in. If such an exercise worked for the economy, why not for an issue that has sparked a firestorm of debate in homes and offices, on the talk shows and at dinner tables?

HEADLINE: CLINTON NOMINEES WILL BE SCREENED FOR ILLEGAL HIRING

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
All candidates for the hundreds of Government jobs subject to Senate confirmation are now being asked if they had hired illegal aliens or violated tax laws on household workers, Clinton Administration officials said today, and at least a dozen people have been dropped from consideration over those issues.
Use of the new questions follows an uproar over the nomination of Zoe Baird to be Attorney General and the withdrawal of another candidate for the same job, Federal District Judge Kimba M. Wood of New York. George Stephanopoulos, the White House spokesman, said that in view of those events candidates for Presidential appointments in the Clinton Administration would probably be disqualified if they had hired illegal aliens in the last six years.
 
New Standards Imposed
 The hiring of illegal aliens was prohibited by a law adopted in November 1986. Asked if President Clinton would appoint any people who have employed illegal aliens since then, Mr. Stephanopoulos said, "I think it would make it very difficult, and it would probably be disqualifying, yes." Administration officials said Mr. Clinton would probably not nominate individuals who hired illegal aliens before November 1986 because people would find it difficult to distinguish between the two situations in political debate. 
 The White House imposed the new standards three weeks after it had said that Ms. Baird's employment of illegal immigrants as household help should not disqualify her from becoming Attorney General. Mr. Clinton later withdrew the nomination under pressure from Capitol Hill and public opinion.
It is not clear how the new standards will apply to people already in office. Current officeholders are being urged to comply with all relevant laws, Mr. Stephanopoulos said. He went on to say there was no reason for Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown to step down, even though Mr. Brown had said he failed to pay Social Security taxes for a household worker.
 
Under Criticism by Women
 Announcing the new test today, the White House seemed eager to rebut criticism of its decision to drop two women considered for Attorney General. The White House was also trying to counter accusations by women's groups like the National Organization for Women that it had been unfairly harsh on Ms. Baird and Judge Wood, or that there was a double standard working against women.
The more rigid standards -- routinely violated by hundreds of thousands of families and enforced only sporadically by the Government -- apply to candidates for hundreds of powerful posts, most notably the assistant secretaries who run Cabinet agencies day to day.
More than 1,100 Presidential appointments are subject to Senate confirmation, with about 680 being for full-time jobs. The rest are for boards and commissions.
Mr. Stephanopoulos did not say whether these candidates would automatically be disqualified if they had failed to pay Social Security taxes for household workers. But White House officials said questions about compliance with immigration and tax laws were now being routinely asked of all candidates for Cabinet and sub-Cabinet positions.
So far, White House officials said, at least a dozen people have been dropped from consideration because their answers were deemed unsatisfactory. White House officials refused to identify the candidates, but said they had been considered for jobs at the Interior Department, the Treasury and the Commerce Department.
President Clinton said today that he had not used a double standard in disqualifying Judge Wood.
"I think Judge Wood has been somewhat unfairly treated inasmuch as what happened to her happened in the ordinary course of the vetting process," Mr. Clinton said. "It's happened to many other people in the months that we have been working on this." He said all other nominations were being handled in an "even-handed" manner.
 
Differences Are Noted
 Even as the White House announced the new standard, it was somewhat imprecise about the effect of the new rules. Mr. Stephanopoulos said the cases of Mr. Brown and Judge Wood "aren't comparable in any way."
In describing his situation on Sunday on the NBC program "Meet the Press," Mr. Brown said, "I never employed any illegal aliens." But he said he did not pay Social Security taxes for a household employee until last month, when he said "most people found out that there was an obligation" to make such payments. The employee, he said, cleaned his home for three hours a week over the last four or five years.
Ms. Baird, who employed two illegal aliens as household workers and failed to pay their Social Security taxes, asked the President to withdraw her nomination as Attorney General after a public furor. Judge Wood, who was on the verge of being nominated for the same job, was pressured into withdrawing after the White House learned that she had hired an illegal alien as a baby sitter in March 1986, although that was not illegal at the time.
What is the distinction between Mr. Brown and Judge Wood? In the screening process for Presidential nominees, Mr. Brown was not asked about his compliance with immigration and tax laws. By contrast, Judge Wood was asked several times, and "she was not completely forthcoming," Mr. Stephanopoulos said.
Judge Wood said that she was asked if she had a "Zoe Baird problem" and that she interpreted that to mean had she ever hired an illegal alien when it was against the law and not paid Social Security and other taxes for that worker, as Ms. Baird had. She said she had replied truthfully that she had not.
 
'Everybody Complies With It'
 Mr. Stephanopoulos said the new test was being applied impartially to all candidates of both sexes. "All people who are nominees now are being asked the question," he said. "Since we became aware of this situation, we are insuring that everybody complies with it."
In deciding that the questions are relevant to all high-level Government positions, the Administration is going far beyond the criteria that the White House and Congress used in Ms. Baird's case.
Critics of Ms. Baird said that violating the law disqualified her to be Attorney General, the nation's highest law enforcement officer, and that the hiring of an illegal alien was relevant because the Attorney General supervises the Immigration and Naturalization Service. But Ms. Baird committed only civil offenses, not a crime.
Donald D. Roberts, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, estimated that 75 percent, or 1.5 million, of the 2 million households that employ domestic workers fail to pay the required taxes.
Some of those 1.5 million households include those of members of Congress. Representative David E. Skaggs, Democrat of Colorado, said: "After the Baird case, I was amazed to learn that parents owe Social Security taxes whenever they pay a baby sitter more than $50 in three months. This means I should have paid Social Security taxes on occasional baby-sitting for which I've paid, on average, a few hundred dollars a year. I'm in the process of computing the taxes and interest I owe and will pay that amount promptly."
A 34-year-old White House aide said he thought he was coming to Washington to work on the President's domestic policy, but found to his dismay that he was spending more time answering questions about his own "domestics policy."
Astrid E. Merget, chairwoman of the National Academy of Public Administration, a Congressionally chartered group of 350 government scholars, said the new test was "an overreaction in the wake of the Zoe Baird phenomenon."
 
Underground Child Care
 "Given the particular situation of most professional women and professional couples, it's probably common for people to hire child-care workers through the underground economy and not pay Social Security taxes," said Ms. Merget, a professor of public policy and management at Ohio State University, in Columbus. "That practice is troubling but common, and symptomatic of the problem of child care for working professionals."
Mr. Stephanopoulos said he did not know if Clinton appointees had complied with all tax and immigration laws in the past, but he promised that President Clinton would enforce compliance in the future. "The policy of the White House is very clear," he said. "All the Cabinet officers are supposed to comply with the law."
G. Calvin Mackenzie, a professor of government at Colby College in Waterville, Me., who has studied the Presidential appointment process for many years, said he saw nothing inherently unreasonable in the new test.
"It is reasonable to ask people if they've obeyed the law," he said. "But there is no objective standard of reasonableness here. Presidents live in a political world, and they have to play within the parameters of that world."
"The reason the Senate has a role in this process is that the people who wrote the Constitution could not write an objective standard," said Mr. Mackenzie. "They left the Senate to be the judge of fitness. Nowadays that means that if you have domestic help, you better pay their Social Security taxes."
Edward R. Meyers, program director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a coalition of labor unions and public interest groups, said: "It is not outrageous to expect people to abide by the law. Until the law is changed, people should comply with it."
Mr. Stephanopoulos said people who belatedly paid taxes for their maids might still, in some cases, qualify for Government jobs. "A lot of people were not aware of all the implications of the law relating to Social Security taxes prior to the Zoe Baird case," he said. "But now we are aware of it, and Cabinet officials are expected to comply."
In response to inquiries by The New York Times, Clinton Administration officials and members of Congress generally said they had not knowingly hired illegal aliens in recent years. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bensten "has never knowingly hired any illegal aliens," said his spokesman, H. Christopher Peacock.
 
Many Say They Complied
 Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said he "did have occasional household help over the years." But he said, "We made sure they were properly documented and paid Social Security."
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said he had felt a special obligation to obey tax and immigration laws because he was Attorney General of Arizona as well as its Governor.
Carol M. Browner, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said she had never employed undocumented aliens, "never had any regular household help" and sent her 5-year-old son to community day-care centers.
Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, never had occasion to violate the law, an aide said, because her housing and household workers were provided to her by her last two employers: the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where she was chancellor, and Hunter College in New York, where she was president.
Sam Bernsen, a lawyer who worked at the Immigration and Naturalization Service from 1939 to 1977, said tonight: "If an undocumented alien was hired before Nov. 6, 1986, clearly there was no violation of the law by the employer. It was not illegal, immoral or unethical. If the hiring occurred after Nov. 6, 1986, it was a violation of the law."
"But this law is making lawbreakers out of hundreds of thousands of people who are otherwise law-abiding citizens," said Mr. Bernsen.
 
 
 
CONGRESS AND ITS HOUSEHOLD HELP

 
SENATE:
Of 100 Senators, 89 responded through either their press secretaries or other aides to questions asked by the New York Times.
 
 89 said the Senator had not employed any illegal alien since 1986.
 
 88 said the Senator had never employed anyone without paying Social Security tax for the worker. The remaining Senator, Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said she had used numerous baby sitters over the years without paying Social Security taxes for them.

 Senate offices refused to answer the questions:
Jeff Bingaman, New Mexico
Dale Bumpers, Arizona
Carl Levin, Michigan
Ted Stevens, Alaska

 Senate offices did not returned several calls:
Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California
Alphonse A. D'Amato, Republican of New York
Lauch Faircloth, Republican of North Carolina
Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina
John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts
Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York
 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:
Of 435 Representatives, 406 responded to questionnaires, mainly through press secretaries or other spokesmen.

 406 said the Representative had not employed any illegal alien since 1986.

 398 said the Representative had never employed anyone without paying Social Security taxes for the worker.
8 said 'Yes,' 'Don't know' or a qualified 'no' to the question of paying Social Security taxes:
Tom Bevill, Democrat of Alabama: "Don't know." "Impossible to answer because over the years people have cut his grass or done yard work or baby sat for his children. Is the question addressed to these circumstances?"
Elizabeth Furse, Democrat of Oregon: "Yes." She has a small farm and hires two 'contract' grape workers each year for two days; they take care of their own taxes.
Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut: "Yes." She employed someone who cleaned her house once every two weeks.
Pete Peterson, Democrat of Florida: "Yes." Domestic help.
J.J. Pickle, Democrat of Texas: "Yes." Occasionally he hires a housecleaner and is not sure if this exceeds the $50-a-quarter limit. He does not pay Social Security taxes on these wages.
David E. Skaggs, Democrat of Colorado: "Yes." Mr. Skaggs faxed the following response: "After the Baird case, I was amazed to learn that parents owe Social Security taxes whenever they pay a baby sitter more than $50 in three months. This means I should have paid Social Security taxes on occasional baby sitting for which I've paid on average a few hundred dollars a year. I'm in the process of computing the taxes and interest I owe and will pay that amount promptly."
Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine: "No." She has hired 'LBJ' interns without withholding Social Security taxes, but she did not think this was a violation of House rules.
Maxine Waters, Democrat of California: "Yes." "Twenty-five or 30 years ago when I had kids my neighbors worked as baby sitters"

 9 Representatives' offices refused, for various reasons, to answer the questions:
Peter Hoagland, Democrat of Nebraska: "We don't respond to surveys."
David L. Hobson, Republican of Ohio: Refusal
Paul E. Kanjorski, Democrat of Pennsylvania: "We don't do surveys of any kind."
John W. Olver, Democrat of Massachusetts: 'We don't participate in polls from organizations outside our district."

Nydia M. Velazquez, Democrat of New York: Refusal
Robert S. Walker, Republican of Pennsylvania: Office policy is not to respond to polls.
Craig Washington, Democrat of Texas: "I don't think that's anyone's business even if I did. That's not the way the nation is governed."
Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California: Does not participate in surveys.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 10, 1993, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about the screening of Clinton Administration job candidates to determine if they had hired illegal immigrants or violated household employment tax laws referred incompletely in some copies to the most recent candidate for Attorney General. She is Judge Kimba M. Wood.
Because of another editing error, the article also referred ambiguously to Judge Wood's tax history. She did pay such taxes for her domestic help.

HEADLINE: CLINTON TRIMMING LOWER-LEVEL AIDES

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
President Clinton, saying he wanted a "leaner but more effective" White House, announced today that he was keeping a campaign promise to trim his staff by 25 percent. His cuts will save $10 million, a 5 percent reduction in White House costs, and fall most heavily on the staff's lowest paid employees, who do not hold political posts.
The cut of 350 jobs allowed Mr. Clinton to achieve the 25 percent rate because he exempted hundreds of military communications personnel at to the White House, as well as the Trade Representative's Office and the Office of Management and Budget. Both offices are part of the executive office of the President. 
 The budget office employs 558 people and the trade representative 163. Mr. Clinton said they would be covered by cutbacks in other agencies, which will be announced later. In the campaign, Mr. Clinton pledged to cut 100,000 of the three million Federal employees .
 
Possible Budget Request
 Besides fulfilling his campaign promise, the cutbacks were intended to lay political groundwork for the tax increases and austerity measures to shrink the budget deficit that the President is expected to propose to Congress on Feb. 17. Mr. Clinton will try to gain support for those sacrifices in his first televised "town hall" meeting on Wednesday at 8 P.M., Eastern time, in Detroit. [Page A20.]
Mr. Clinton announced the reductions -- 350 jobs of the 1,394 jobs that he inherited from Mr. Bush -- in a White House briefing buttressed by pie charts and graphics. That is 25.1 percent of the White House staff, when the budget office and the trade representative's staff are not counted. If they are counted, the reduction is one of 16.5 percent.
He said the cuts were in keeping with the austerity measures many households and corporations were now carrying out. "We in Government cannot ask the American people to change if we will not do the same," Mr. Clinton said. Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House chief of staff, acknowledged that before Mr. Clinton realized the $10 million in savings, a cut of 5 percent in the total White House budget of $200 million, he might have to ask Congress for an increase in this year's budget to pay for extraordinary transition costs. He said the savings would eventually be reinvested in improving the White House computer and telephone systems.
A third of the White House reductions come from the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The drug office, which coordinates the Administration's drug-fighting strategies, is being slashed to 25 people from 146, but Mr. Clinton said he would compensate for that by elevating his chief drug officer, who has not yet been chosen, to a Cabinet post. Clinton aides said the office had been used as a dumping ground of Republican political appointees in the Bush Administration and that none of the eliminated jobs were filled by drug agents.
Today's move by President Clinton was greeted with skepticism by Republicans.
John P. Walters, the acting director of the drug office who was a holdover from the Bush Administration, resigned in protest over the magnitude of the cuts, aides said. But Mr. Walters was scheduled to depart soon anyway. William J. Bennett, who headed the drug office for a time under President George Bush, said: "They have just destroyed the office. The Democrats fought hard to establish a drug czar and now they just gutted it and tried to compensate by creating a cardboard cutout Cabinet job."
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, said: "Let's face it, President Clinton's heralded cut in White House staff is primarily a symbolic gesture, especially when employees are merely being transferred and when he is reportedly requesting an additional $3 million taxpayer dollars to bring in dozens of new political appointees."
In two gestures of populism, Mr. Clinton said he was taking away official automobile privileges from three of the six top officials who now have them, and transforming the White House dining room, known as the White House mess, from the most restricted restaurant in Washington to a cafeteria for all employees.
 
Symbolism of Moves
 "There is symbolism involved here, which is probably valuable symbolism in trying to show a different approach and doing it by starting on your own home turf," said Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a public citizen's lobbying group.
Only the top aides involved in national security matters will be allowed to keep their door-to-door automobile service -- W. Anthony Lake, the President's national security adviser; Samuel R. Berger, the deputy national security adviser, and Mr. McLarty, who has declined the service.
The aides to lose their cars and drivers are Leon E. Panetta, Director of the Office of Management and Budget; Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and the White House chief of protocol, who has not yet been chosen.
Mr. McLarty said that 10 percent of the 350 positions due to be eliminated by Oct. 1 would be senior staff jobs, with the others ranging from staff aides, to letter writers, to postal clerks to secretaries. In addition, the White House senior staff will all be taking pay cuts of 6 percent to 10 percent from the levels of their Republican predecessors.
Among the improvements that will be made with the savings are the President's request for a direct-dial telephone on his desk, which his predecessor did not have.
 
Positions Being Eliminated
 He said the 350 staff cuts would be accomplished through dismissals, by not hiring new employees for current vacancies and by sending 70 employees detailed to the White House from other agencies back to their home departments.

HEADLINE: For Rostenkowski, Maybe Glory, Maybe Disgrace

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
In nearly 40 years in politics, Dan Rostenkowski has usually known where he is going, but now he cannot be sure what path he is on and where it leads in the history of Congress.
The road he hopes he is on, toward presiding over passage of a national health-care program, "would really be a tremendous trophy to hang on the wall of a so-called machine, city politician," he said. 
 The other road is surrounded by a wide-ranging investigation that began with his financial dealings with the House post office and has sapped his energy for months, a route that has been sprinkled with subpoenas and headlines and some public contempt and that could lead to indictment and disgrace.
A Rostenkowski on the first path would be an invaluable asset to President Clinton. As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, he controls the body that will deal first with Mr. Clinton's tax proposals and any trade measures he offers and that has a dominant role in legislating health-care changes.
Moreover, Mr. Rostenkowski is one of the President's foremost cheerleaders in Washington, chiding colleagues for lacking patience and for mounting pre-emptive attacks on ideas that they think Mr. Clinton may propose, like limiting cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits.
 
Committee Could Unravel
 But a Rostenkowski preoccupied with scandal, or even indicted, would be another story, for without his energetic leadership, the Ways and Means Committee could easily deteriorate into a snarling example of Congress at its greedy, rudderless worst.
His political origins are the source of both his strengths and his vulnerabilities. Mr. Rostenkowski was sent to Congress by Mayor Richard J. Daley in 1958, after an apprenticeship in the Illinois Legislature looking out for Chicago's interests there. He grew up in the Chicago organization when it was still organized, when it made the city work for people who voted and disdained the reformist elite, the Better Government Association or the editorial writers from The Chicago Tribune, who could call you names but could not hurt you.
That gave him a sense of the importance of keeping his word, of delivering what he promised and of sticking together, all important lessons for a committee chairman.
 
Grounded in Chicago
 But having grown up in the Daley organization, he sometimes seems to disdain tougher ethics rules within the House. That attitude sometimes makes him sound like a political dinosaur, not concerned enough with appearance to survive in the 90's, and beginning to worry about extinction.
Listen to him talk about his circumstances:
"My stomach is hamburger. What's next? They're sprinkling this so-called infield with subpoenas. Thirty-four years in public service, and some yahoo in the post office is saying you took money. I never even thought of those things."
He thinks the United States Attorney here, Jay B. Stephens, is out to get him. His lawyers have been skirmishing with Mr. Stephens over a leaky grand jury investigation that started with Mr. Rostenkowski's office buying an improbable amount of postage stamps. Now the inquiry seems to be expanding into questions about the cars his Chicago office leases and the way his well-heeled, re-election campaign spent its money, including renting office space from the lawmaker and his sister.
Fred Wertheimer, president of the public interest lobbying group Common Cause, seized on the last accusation, first reported by The Chicago Sun-Times, to demand an inquiry by the House ethics committee into whether Mr. Rostenkowski violated House rules by converting campaign funds to personal use. The committee has not yet responded to Mr. Wertheimer's request, which was made on Dec. 21.
But nothing that is publicly known has yet added up to a Federal case against him. Nor is it clear just what evidence Mr. Stephens has or what he is looking for. So far it has not added up to an indictment.
And friends of Mr. Rostenkowski say he seems to be getting more optimistic in recent weeks, accepting their argument that the flow of more and more subpoenas means that Mr. Stephens is having a hard time finding evidence.
Under the House Democrats' rules, any committee or subcommittee chairman must step down immediately if indicted. (The Republicans let their indicted lawmakers retain their position.)
If Rosty, as the 65-year-old lawmaker is known in the House, has to step down, the task of reaching agreements among the 23 Democrats on Ways and Means would become instantly harder. His successor would be Representative Sam M. Gibbons of Florida, whom House leaders say they do not consider the chairman's equal or even a vague approximation, at managing the fractious committee.
His colleagues discern a singular talent for knowing just how big a concession is needed to get each difficult but necessary vote.
 
Expert Deal Maker
 One admiring disciple, former Representative Thomas J. Downey of Long Island, says Mr. Rostenkowski was a dedicated teacher of such excellent deal-making principles as, "You want something, then you give." He also called him a consummate deal-maker and a consummate negotiator who is unafraid to use theatrical stunts like picking up his papers and walking out if a tough negotiation demanded it, and also insistent that once a deal was cut, everybody had to stay with it "not to deviate, to march."
It is clear that President Clinton recognizes his importance. He went to Mr. Rostenkowski's district for a speech in December, on a very rare moment spent outside Little Rock or Washington. Top aides like Leon V. Panetta, the budget director, and Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, keep the chairman in touch with Administration thinking on economic policy.
And Mr. Clinton himself maneuvered Mr. Rostenkowski into the chair of honor in the Oval Office recently before the television cameras were allowed in for the beginning of a important session on economic policy.
 
Returns Clinton's Compliment
 The chairman reciprocates the good wishes. On Thursday he told the American Association of Retired Persons that they needed to support Mr. Clinton on deficit reduction, even if the plan had to touch Social Security. "I supported Bill Clinton because I thought that change was necessary," he said. "I thought we'd have to have a President that was going to be bold about where he wanted to take the country."
The week before, he told the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors that he expected them to work with him to help "President Clinton create a better nation."
In the House, he is respected, but not always admired. About a fifth of House Democrats voted against re-electing him as chairman. He often comes across as gruff, and to younger members he seems like a gruff antique.
He has also had conflicts with other House leaders. Last year, for example, he went along only reluctantly with a symbolic Democratic bill to cut middle-class taxes and shed no tears when it was vetoed.
And when Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, tried to get Mr. Rostenkowski to help make another political point by pushing a Democratic health-care initiative, the chairman resisted. Mr. Rostenkowski said the votes were not there. Moreover, anything the Democrats might have agreed on would have been vetoed by President Bush. But Mr. Rostenkowski acknowledged, "I was not as active as I should have been."
Mr. Gephardt said he understood the chairman's reluctance. "He really is a legislator," the majority leader said. "He wants to do things that change things. He doesn't like to waste time with things that are symbolic."
That means a lot to the future of health-care legislation, because Mr. Rostenkowski has told committee members that he will back what Mr. Clinton proposes. And even with no Republican votes, he predicted, "What comes to my committee is going to come out of my committee."
 
Tough Bill to Pass
 At the same time he has told the President, he said, "you're going to spend all of your strength on health, lobbying congressmen eyeball to eyeball." To get health legislation through, he warns, requires overcoming very powerful interests, "The Cadillacs of lobbyists."
His concern has a personal element. A daughter lost a kidney and had trouble getting health insurance. She now pays $1,000 a month for coverage beyond what her employer's policy offers. But he tries to brush that personal factor off. "When I look at young kids who cannot buy houses or change jobs" because of health-insurance rules, he said, "their government should solve that problem."
The other motivation is his concern with his own legacy. When he became chairman of the committee in 1981, many old-timers said he could not handle the task. So every time he has passed an important bill, on Social Security, trade, tax simplification or welfare, he has proudly proved somebody wrong.
Despite the difficulty, or perhaps because of it, too, health legislation is the challenge he wants, as another way of surprising people who underestimate him. "I don't think because I didn't go to Yale or Harvard, I can't compete."
In fact, he went to Loyola University in Chicago, though he did not graduate. And he played minor league baseball in Sarasota, Fla., but quit when his father told him: "You'll never be a Babe Ruth. You're a late swinger."
He acknowledges he is still swinging late, but arguably not too late, on the last big issue before his committee. "We Democrats have been promising universal insurance for decades," he told the Association of Retired Persons. "It's time that we deliver."

HEADLINE: Reinventing Harvard: A New President Tries To Unite Its Schools

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Feb. 9

 BODY:
In 18 months as president of Harvard University, Neil L. Rudenstine has moved swiftly to reshape the campus's famously disparate schools into a more unified university, and he has pushed the faculty to focus on five major challenges confronting the nation.
"He is the first president at Harvard that I know who has tried to manage the institution," said Robert Keohane, a professor of government. 
 Working to unite Harvard's 11 schools -- including the law school, the business school and the medical school -- may seem a tame task, Mr. Keohane said. But it is a major departure for Harvard, which has long followed a decentralized policy known as "each tub on its own bottom," allowing each school to set its own policies and to take responsibility for its own budget and fund-raising.
The relatively weak authority of Harvard's president, compared with heads of other universities, is reflected symbolically in the location of the his office in a small red brick building, the oldest on campus, which also serves as a freshman dormitory. By contrast, the office of the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, often perceived as a more powerful figure than the president, is in a much bigger building across Harvard Yard.
 
5 Campuswide Themes
 For the 58-year-old Mr. Rudenstine, who came to Harvard after being provost at Princeton University for 10 years and executive vice president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, getting Harvard's schools to work together has several purposes.
He believes that it provides a better way to control costs and allocate resources at a time when most American universities are facing budget shortfalls.
But it also sets up a mechanism for another of Mr. Rudenstine's goals -- getting the faculty to agree on five key themes he believes Harvard's professors should pay special attention to in their research and teaching over the next decade: environmental studies, public school education, health-care policy, ethics and values in the professions and the rapidly growing field of the relationship between the brain and human behavior.
 
Era of Coalescence
 Mr. Rudenstine said he hoped that concentrated work by Harvard on these issues would influence the nation. "Not in any pretentious sense, because no one institution is going to solve them," he said. "But they are sufficiently large and urgent that unless one solves them, we aren't going to have a lot of other things to do with our lives in 20 years."
Unlike his predecessor, Derek Bok, who built up the John F. Kennedy School of Government as a physical legacy, Mr. Rudenstine has no ambitious plans to add another graduate school to Harvard. "I'm hardly going to add even a department," Mr. Rudenstine said.
Instead, he suggested, at a time of rising costs and shrinking resources, "I think what we need to do is to figure out how to get more out of what we've got, to coalesce more, rather than to add."
In fact, Mr. Rudenstine has quietly reduced the goal of Harvard's new fund-raising campaign to $2 billion from the original $3 billion goal set by Mr. Bok in 1990.
 
Charm and Orchestration
 With his personable, accessible style, Mr. Rudenstine has won virtually unanimous high marks from professors and students, who feel that his emphasis on better managing Harvard and on focusing its academic work on contemporary problems will help preserve its reputation as the nation's leading university
To get the deans of the separate schools to collaborate more, Mr. Rudenstine has employed a mixture of charm and carefully orchestrated planning meetings. "This used to be a place of independent entrepreneurial baronies," said Jerome Murphy, the dean of the Graduate School of Education. "The deans did little thinking about the good of Harvard as a whole. But Neil has this capacity to get people talking to each other because he is so open, so friendly and so accessible."
Mr. Murphy also strongly supports Mr. Rudenstine's emphasis on the five major themes. "I see Harvard thinking much more seriously about its role in the difficult problems of society, rather than just following the traditional pattern of every professor pursuing their own interests," he said.
"From the outside, this may not look like much," Mr. Murphy added. "But from the inside, it's a revolution."
 
Encouraging Cooperation
 The first concrete manifestation of Mr. Rudenstine's new focus is a new undergraduate major in environmental studies, to begin next academic year. In the past, many Harvard faculty members would have dismissed such a subject as too practical and not sufficiently academic.
The five themes also encourage more cooperation among Harvard's schools as they share teaching, research and even some fund raising. On the theme of public education, for example, the School of Education has begun working with the faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard's largest undergraduate college and graduate school, to develop a program to bring high school teachers to Harvard for refresher classes in math and science.
The School of Education has also been talking with the Business School about a joint graduate degree in business and education for business school students who would go on to become administrators of large public school systems.
In one of the biggest changes, John McArthur, the dean of the business school, Harvard's most affluent school, has volunteered to steer some of his largest donors to the School of Education when Harvard officially begins its fund-raising campaign next year.
 
A 'More Touchy-Feely Type'
 Mr. Rudenstine's personal style has also won him supporters among students. Last fall, when an undergraduate fell from a fire escape, Mr. Rudenstine abruptly left a meeting at the medical school to rush to Beth Israel hospital in Boston to visit the student. On another occasion, when an undergraduate found an anti-homosexual slur carved into his door, Mr. Rudenstine sent the student a handwritten note the next day.
Julian Barnes, the president of The Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, said that in contrast to Mr. Rudenstine's predecessor, the patrician Mr. Bok, Mr. Rudenstine "is a much more touchy-feely type of person. He's a 90's man, nurturing."
Mr. Rudenstine has also made a priority of improving the quality of undergraduate education. For years, students have complained that the famous professors they came here to learn from are too busy to teach them and that many classes were taught by inexperienced graduate students.
 
More, Smaller Classes
 Mr. Rudenstine, a graduate of Princeton who received his doctorate in English literature at Harvard, said, he has learned that Harvard has more students per professor than any comparable university. Moreover, certain departments, including English, history and economics, are chronically overcrowded.
In the fund-raising campaign, he said, he will make a priority of increasing the number of professors in those departments to try to guarantee more and smaller classes.
Criticism of Mr. Rudenstine so far has been muted. Minna Jarvenpaa, the co-chairwoman of the Radcliffe Union of Students, took advantage of Mr. Rudenstine's policy of holding office hours for students and went to ask him why only 8.2 percent of the university's tenured faculty are women.
"He didn't take any action, but he was very good at listening and gave me the sense that he was very concerned," Ms. Jarvenpaa said.
Some alumni have suggested that Mr. Rudenstine does not seem quite as "presidential" as Mr. Bok, that he is less elegant in appearance and that his public speeches have not been as eloquent.
 
Long, Hard Days
 Some of Mr. Rudenstine's friends worry that he works too hard, putting in long days, regularly entertaining for the university with his wife, Angelica, and traveling widely to raise money. One aide said he worries that Mr. Rudenstine will not have time for what President George Bush termed "the vision thing."
But Henry Rosovsky, a professor and member of the Harvard Corporation, the small, elite body that governs the university, said Mr. Rudenstine has already demonstrated that he has "a practical vision for Harvard" by bringing the deans together and pushing his grand themes.
Mr. Rosovsky was a member of the search committee that picked Mr. Rudenstine to succeed Mr. Bok, and he recalled that in talking to thousands of people across the country, the most constant concern was to find someone who would "bring Harvard together."
"The fragmentation of the university had become excessive," Mr. Rosovsky said.
After Mr. Rudenstine was inaugurated, Mr. Rosovsky admitted, he was skeptical that the new president would be able to fulfill this mandate. "The odds of succeeding seemed quite small," said Mr. Rosovsky, who twice served as dean of the faculty. "But Neil has forged the deans into a team, and that's something new for Harvard."

HEADLINE: Mitterrand, in Vietnam, Links Aid to Democracy

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Feb. 9

 BODY:
President Francois Mitterrand today became the first Western leader to visit Vietnam since 1975 and promised to double aid to the former French colony as long as Hanoi improved human rights.
Mr. Mitterrand also expressed hopes at a state dinner that Washington would end its economic embargo against Vietnam, saying it had "no raison d'etre." 
 France normalized relations with Vietnam in 1989, ending a boycott led by the United States and imposed after the Communists took over South Vietnam nearly 18 years ago. France resumed relations after Vietnam withdrew its troops from Cambodia, which it invaded in 1978 to overthrow the Khmer Rouge Government.
Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos were French colonies until the 1950's, but despite the bitter colonial legacy, economic and cultural ties between Vietnam and France run deep. Many older educated Vietnamese speak French, and France is a preferred destination for Vietnamese studying abroad.
 
Economics and Tolerance
 On the first day of his visit, Mr. Mitterrand stressed the need for an economic opening to the West, accompanied by increased civil liberties.
"The respect for human rights has become a universal demand," he said, "with its inseparable companion, economic development. Democracy and development are inseparable," the 76-year-old French leader said at the dinner, offered by President Le Duc Anh.
Vietnam has allowed foreign investment in order to revive a sluggish economy hamstrung by Communist bureaucracy. France is the third-biggest foreign investor in Vietnam, after Taiwan and Hong Kong, and French aid to Vietnam was more than $30 million last year.
The Vietnam radio said Mr. Mitterrand's visit showed that "at last the West has acknowledged Vietnam's open-door policy, the policy of renovation and its will to join the mainstream economy."
 
Presidential Schedule
 A 200-member delegation accompanied Mr. Mitterrand, ranging from Air France's president, Bernard Attali, to the film maker Pierre Schoendoerffer and Foreign Minister Roland Dumas. The streets were decorated with French flags and welcoming banners in Vietnamese and French.
Mr. Mitterrand is to visit Dien Bien Phu, where 14,000 French soldiers were killed, wounded or captured in 1954. The loss signaled the death knell for French colonialism in the region. He is also to fly on Wednesday to Ho Chi Minh City and on Thursday to Phnom Penh, Cambodia, for talks with the head of state, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, returning to Paris on Friday.
His wife, Danielle, a human rights advocate, was not traveling with Mr. Mitterrand because she is suffering from angina.

HEADLINE: States Cutting or Freezing Their Cash Welfare Benefits

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Faced with severe budget deficits, state governments have made sharp cuts in cash welfare programs in the last two years, weakening society's safety net and in some cases even promoting homelessness, according to a report made public today.
The report, by two private research groups, said the cuts in some states would "hit the poor more sharply" than the Federal reductions of the early 1980's. 
 Those Federal cuts fell more heavily on the working poor and produced a national outcry, the report said. By contrast, it said, the current cutbacks have hit more heavily on those who do not work and have attracted much less public attention.
"Part of this is probably a reflection of a hardening of attitudes toward very poor people," said Robert Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The center, a Washington research group with liberal politics, wrote the report with the Center for the Study of the States at the State University of New York in Albany.
 
Cuts and Freezes
 In surveying Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or A.F.D.C., the main cash welfare program, the report found that five states had cut benefits in 1992 and 39 others had frozen them, despite a 3 percent increase in the cost of living.
In Nevada, a recipient's purchasing power fell by 9.2 percent in 1992 because of inflation and a 6.4 percent cut in benefits. In California, the report said, two straight years of cuts had reduced the value of benefits by 16 percent.
Critics of the report said it presented an incomplete picture of antipoverty spending by concentrating on cash assistance. While benefits from those programs have declined, they said, other programs have expanded, most notably the Medicaid program, which provides health insurance to low-income people. In addition, the Federal Government has recently expanded tax credits and child-care programs for the working poor.
Noel Card, a spokesman for the American Legislative Exchange Council, a group of conservative state legislators, said the reductions in cash assistance "would probably be a hardship for a relatively small percentage of people."
 
No Outcry Over Some Cuts
 The report comes as the Clinton Administration, also facing big budget deficits, is searching for ways to constrain Federal spending and may propose other cuts in social programs. Budget officials briefly considered a freeze in cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security recipients, but backed off in the face of opposition from groups representing the elderly.
No such outcry has greeted the fate of the women and children who have suffered the recent welfare cuts. They have scant power in state capitals and have seen the purchasing power of their cash benefits decline 43 percent in the last two decades. Increases in food-stamp allotments have mitigated a little more than half of that decline.
The report said the cuts had been most severe in California, Illinois and Maryland. It said Connecticut, Oklahoma, Rhode Island and Wyoming had also enacted substantial reductions.
The report concentrated on three cash welfare programs.
The largest is A.F.D.C. which covers about 4.5 million families, mostly headed by single women. The House Ways and Means Committee found the average 1991 benefit for a mother with two children was $402 a month, rising to $623 when food stamps were included.
The report also examined general-assistance programs, which provide cash to about a million people, including single adults and childless couples. Only 28 states have such programs, which receive no Federal money.
Of them, 14 states cut programs in 1991 and 8 states cut them in 1992. After the cuts, the average for maximum benefits is $215 a month. The report said some recipients, like those living in welfare hotels, would be forced into homelessness as a result.
The third benefit covered by the report is Supplemental Security Income, a Federal program providing assistance to people who are elderly, blind or disabled. The basic Federal benefit in 1992 was $422 a month for an individual, but 27 states supplement that by an average of $32 a month. The report found that five states had cut the supplement last year and 21 others froze it.
Taken together the three cash assistance programs account for less than 5 percent of the average state's annual budget, and the report's authors argued that bigger savings could have been found elsewhere, with less human suffering. Some states compounded the effect by passing taxes that fall disproportionately on the poor, the report said.
Criticism of the report focused more on what it omitted than on what it said. Mr. Card, the spokesman for the legislators, said the state budget crises were now being driven in part by Federal Medicaid laws, which have required states to insure more poor people. Medicaid spending now accounts for 14 percent of the average state's budget.

HEADLINE: Wrestling Health-Care Costs to the Mat

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

 BODY:
From his third-floor office in a sleek building near the domed Capitol of California, Tom J. Elkin is a commander in the war against the ever-rising costs of health care.
"I know what is a reasonable price for a compact disk or a refrigerator," he said. "But what is accessible health care worth? I don't know yet what a fair price is for the product we're buying. That's what we're after." 
 Mr. Elkin has plenty of ammunition in this crusade to drive costs to rock bottom. Each year he buys $1.3 billion worth of health care as associate executive director of the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, which represents more than 875,000 state and local government employees and their families across California.
 
A Promising Prototype
 He has taken up the banner of "managed competition," a hotly debated approach for reorganizing the nation's medical care that has attracted growing support in Washington. In essence, the approach holds that costs can be controlled by forcing health providers to compete with one another under government supervision.
Calpers is a prototype for insurance-purchasing cooperatives, a concept that lies at the heart of managed competition. The cooperatives are envisioned as giant pools that smaller companies and individuals would join to gain leverage in buying coverage from competing health plans.
But Calpers has already shown promise, even without the benefit of the sweeping national changes in insurance, tax incentives and delivery of care called for by proponents of managed competition. Exercising the power of its numbers, Calpers shocked the health industry in California last year by freezing new enrollments for the state's largest insurer, Kaiser Permanente, because it refused to restrain its rate increases. Apart from Kaiser, Calpers was able to hold 20 other insurers it deals with to average premium increases of 3.1 percent in 1992, when the state industry average was 13.2 percent.
 
Favored by Clinton
 Today, Calpers is expected to announce what it considers another great success: average premium increases in the low single digits for 1993.
Promoting such competition has been endorsed in principle by President Clinton and has drawn support in both liberal and conservative circles. But the full-blown proposal for managed competition includes other major changes that are more contentious, and it is not clear how many Mr. Clinton or Congress will embrace.
Managed competition, as envisioned by the informal group of health economists who originated the concept, would require all employers to offer coverage to full-time workers. Tax incentives would push most people into health maintenance organizations or other groups that offer comprehensive care but limited choice.
On the other side, most doctors, hospitals and insurers would join health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.'s -- clinical partnerships that curtail their freedom but offer subscribers health care for a single overall fee. To promote comparison shopping, the Government would study each H.M.O.'s quality and cost of care, while a national board would decide what coverage should be mandatory and which medical procedures were wasteful.
Skeptics say managed competition, with its combination of regulation and free market innovation, is untested. In fact, it is being tried here in California to some degree, although these efforts cannot be fully effective in the absence of a comprehensive national scheme.
 
Insurers Forced to Cut Waste
 Pressure from Calpers, an early example of the kind of giant insurance-purchasing cooperatives called for in managed competition plans, is forcing Kaiser, Health Net and other insurers here to root out wasteful administrative costs, reduce unnecessary care and squeeze hospitals and doctor groups to lower their rates.
"The experience of Calpers is a preview of what the nation will encounter, given President Clinton's commitment to hold down health-care costs," said Gray Davis, the state Controller, who sits on the 13-member Calpers board. "Ultimately something has to give -- speed of access to elective surgery, the right to choose a doctor, the range of procedures that will be covered. Everybody wants the best care."
But Mr. Elkin maintains that far more fat can be trimmed away before consumers notice such effects. "You'd be amazed how low some of these plans will go with their rates before it goes to the quick," he said. "There is an astronomical amount of unnecessary administration and unnecessary procedures. We have not gotten fully into it yet."
 
Elective: a Point of View
 Yet one person's unneeded procedure -- a hip replacement, for example -- may be what another doctor and patient feel is necessary, illustrating how divisive any uniform national standards may become.
Calpers, a 57-year-old agency, administers health-care plans not only for the state government but also for 784 other public employers, including local school districts, cities and even tiny entities like the California Prune Board, which has eight employees. Joining the cooperative gives each employer bargaining power it would otherwise lack. Calpers offers its members a choice among 19 H.M.O.'s, with which it negotiates rates and services; it offers a traditional health insurance plan for members in remote areas not served by H.M.O.'s.
The agency was galvanized into creating an ambitious program to eliminate waste when fast-climbing premium increases peaked at 21 percent in 1990. With the advice of Alain C. Enthoven of the Stanford University Business School, a founder of the managed-competition concept, Calpers took a tough new stance starting in 1991 and began to standardize benefits among plans to make comparisons easier. It demanded detailed data from each provider so that the costs of services could be compared, then used that information to encourage carriers to cut waste.
For 1992, it set a zero increase as its initial negotiating position. When Kaiser, an H.M.O. that cares for about 345,000 Calpers members, insisted on increases of more than 10 percent, Calpers barred new enrollments in it.
 
A Bit of Consumer Choice
 "That served as an example that Calpers meant business," said Scott R. Kelly, vice president of major accounts at another major carrier, Foundation Health, a California Health Plan, which is a profit-making company based in Sacramento that serves about 78,000 Calpers members. Foundation settled for a 2.9 percent increase. (Kaiser said it was unable to go so low because it offered richer benefits.)
For the most part, the Calpers system appears to be well accepted by patients, although some younger, healthier workers have complained about rising premiums. Under the system, a member chooses among participating H.M.O.'s and may then pick a personal physician within the H.M.O. selected. If the patient seeks care outside the H.M.O., he must pay himself.
For all the new pressures, leaders of Kaiser and the other H.M.O.'s here say they prefer managed competition to alternative proposals because it maintains a measure of consumer choice and avoids the kind of government-run plan used in Canada, which leaves insurers with little role.
Indeed, any system that pressures more people to join H.M.O.'s stands to benefit large, efficient operators like Kaiser, which has 4.7 million members and 6,500 doctors in California.
"We are a strong exponent of managed competition," said Robert J. Erickson, senior vice president for government relations for Kaiser in California. He added that Kaiser expected to ask Calpers for "little or no rate increase" for the coming year.
 
Treatment by the Rules
 H.M.O.-type medicine has long been more accepted by patients and doctors in California than in some other areas, like New York City, and it remains to be seen whether Calpers's success could be matched in communities that resist H.M.O.'s. But even here, patients may soon find their care more closely managed in ways like these:
*Health Net is beginning an experiment this month in which neonatal nurses will make six monthly telephone calls to certain pregnant Calpers members to give them advice and encourage them to seek early maternal care. The results will later be compared to other pregnancies in which such calls were not made.
*The 80-doctor Bay Shores Medical Group in Torrance has installed a new computer system meant to thwart patients who visit different doctors within the group to get excessive prescription pain killers and other drugs or to seek redundant care. The system is also used to detect when doctors prescribe excessive diagnostic tests.
*Southern California Permanente Medical Group, which contracts with Kaiser to care for 2.3 million people, is developing strict guidelines for its 3,200 doctors to bring consistent care to its network of hospitals and clinics. For example, its medical director, Dr. Frank E. Murray, said the guidelines would probably eliminate routine mammography for women before age 50 because research had found no benefit in early testing.
Such tight management has forced a new reality on doctors. After eight years of private practice, Dr. Mark P. Schwartz, an internist, found his work dwindling as his patients joined H.M.O.'s. So he left his practice in 1990 and became a salaried employee of a group, Bay Shores in Torrance. "The handwriting was on the wall," Dr. Schwartz said.
The change was something of a shock. "In a setting like this, there's a great deal of attention to the dollar figure," he said. "So I had to reorient my thinking in terms of what can I spend for a test.
"The consensus is there has not been any suffering in patient outcome. But my big fear is how far this will be taken."

Table: "The Plan for Managed Competition"
 Managed competition would involve sweeping change in the organization of medical care, insurance and incentives.
 
HOW IT WOULD WORK
Doctors, hospitals and insurers would form partnerships, like health maintenance organizations, and compete on the basis of price, consumer satisfaction and medical success. A government agency would report publicly on medical performance and costs.
Cooperatives organized by states would give small businesses and individuals the same bargaining power as large companies.
A combination of employer mandates and Government subsidies would enable those now uninsured to join a cooperative.
A national board would set basic benefits to be offered.
Tax breaks for businesses and individuals would be limited to the cost of the most efficient partnerships. Those who want extra benefits would pay for them with after-tax income.
 
THE POTENTIAL ADVANTAGES
Government-guided market forces, rather than dictates and rationing, would hold down costs.
Public accountability would promote competition among providers.
Evolving national standards for appropriate care, and feedback to doctors on results, would reduce useless and wasteful procedures.
Individuals and employers would become more cost-conscious.
Discrimination by insurers against high-risk individuals and wasteful case-by-case oversight by insurers would end.
 
THE MAIN OBJECTIONS
Critics say the plan would not halt rapid inflation of medical costs. Some say the nation must also set and enforce a ceiling on medical spending, and some liberal critics also say a Federal takeover of medical care would be more efficient.
Some conservatives say that large purchasing groups and national boards would curtail choice by consumers and doctors, and would lead to costly bureaucracies and rationing. They would prefer ending the link between employment and health insurance, instead altering tax incentives to help individuals directly buy the coverage they want.
Achieving consensus on basic benefits and on which technologies deserve coverage may be politically impossible, some critics say.

HEADLINE: A Health-Care Theory Hatched in Fireside Chats

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD

 BODY:
The basic theory of managed competition in health care was developed by an informal group of health experts who call themselves the Jackson Hole Group, after the Wyoming city where they meet periodically at the home of Dr. Paul M. Ellwood, a doctor and leading health economist.
The main theorist has perhaps been Alain C. Enthoven, a professor at the Stanford University Business School. But over the last three years the concept has been refined around the fireplace of Dr. Ellwood's house, where guests have included academics, public officials and leaders of the insurance and health industries. 
 "This amounts to a radical restructuring of the health system while relying on conventional market forces." Dr. Ellwood said.
At the core of the plan are health maintenance organizations, or H.M.O.'s, partnerships made up of doctors, hospitals and insurers that supply health care to their members at a fixed annual fee. These partnerships would compete for the business of big companies and of big purchasing cooperatives organized by the states on behalf of small businesses and individuals.
 
Wide Appeal, Many Doubts
 Over the last several months, managed competition has emerged as central in the debate in Washington over how to revamp the nation's health-care system, now plagued by runaway costs while leaving 35 million people uninsured. Managed competition's promise of holding down costs and improving care has wide appeal, but doubts are also being voiced: Can it really contain costs, given the continuous introduction of expensive technology? Will competition come at the expense of innovation and patient health?
One criticism comes from Dr. Arnold Relman, former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine. While endorsing managed competition in principle, he fears that too much control over medical decisions will go to investor-owned insurance companies. He favors H.M.O.'s jointly owned by doctors and patients. "If doctors accept responsibility for living within a budget, they are in the best position to practice prudent medicine and do it efficiently," Dr. Relman said.
Other critics, like Dr. Steffie Woolhandler of Harvard Medical School, favor a nationalized system like Canada's, in which the government pays the bills and people keep their own doctors. "Managed competition totally disrupts the doctor-patient relationship," Dr. Woolhandler said.
President Clinton, while endorsing managed competition, has also endorsed a national cap on medical spending; the Jackson Hole Group rejects that as heavy handed. But some experts argue that costs will keep soaring unless the Government imposes an overall limit.
"New technology pushes costs up exponentially," said Dr. Alan L. Hillman, director of the Center for Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. "H.M.O.'s will say, 'We offer the latest and greatest.' "
 
A Not-Quite-Free Market
 A variation on the spending cap is gaining favor among Presidential advisers who believe that competition and budget limits can be married. This notion would impose no explicit national cap; instead, the regional cooperatives that buy health insurance for their members would be told that they could pay a fixed amount per person to the H.M.O.'s in each region. That payment would be set by a national health board. Individuals could opt for more extensive coverage but would have to pay the difference in costs.
A chief proponent of this approach, called capitation, is Paul Starr, a sociologist at Princeton University who is advising the Clinton Administration. Federal or state sanctions, he said, could be imposed on cooperatives that fail to conform to the mandated limit.
This idea is endorsed by the Jackson Hole Group, although they do not favor the comprehensive regulation that some want to accompany it. Professor Enthoven argues that excessive growth in overall costs should be controlled by specific actions aimed at the causes: reviewing new technologies, taking antitrust actions against H.M.O.'s, or altering the patients' deductibles or fees.
"We should do it through incentives rather than just trying to sweep costs under the carpet by imposing some lid," he said.

Learning 54 Languages With a Missionary's Zeal

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: PROVO, Utah

 BODY:
From distant countries they bring back fresh insights and a love of language and culture so strong that here at Brigham Young University, education is a great feast of language.
There are nearly 30,000 students at "the Y," as this Mormon university perched on the Wasatch Mountains is known, and at any one time about 10,000 of them are studying one of 54 languages. 
 Most Mormon men and an increasing number of women interrupt their educations to go on proselytizing missions for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Many go abroad after receiving an eight-week crash course in a country's language, culture and religion. They are expected to learn to converse in the language from the locals.
When they return after two years to re-enroll at Brigham Young, they have often acquired such a passion for the country they worked in that they decide to study the nation's language and culture in more depth.
That passion is fed by an elaborate technical support system comprising a language laboratory, recording studios, translating booths and computer programs written by the university's faculty members.
One recent afternoon, students in the language lab were found staring at television monitors in the study of Korean, Japanese, German, Russian, French, Spanish and Italian. A Japanese student studied Spanish; a Mexican studied Japanese.
Outside the lab, in the stairwell to the second floor, a yellow poster advertised a class in "business Chinese," accompanied by this note of caution: "Limited Space -- Register Now." It is a warning not taken lightly at a university where classes in Mongolian, Icelandic and Afrikaans are known to fill up quickly, and where Tongan, Tahitian or Samoan have been offered.
Brigham Young "has always been in the forefront in a wide variety of developments" in language education, said Phyllis Franklin, executive director of the Modern Language Association, a national organization of English and language teachers.
Ms. Franklin said Brigham Young's ambitious language program is rare at universities these days because budget problems have devastated many language departments.
Those cutbacks have worsened an already deteriorating picture of language study. Despite an increasingly global economy and a growing global consciousness, American college students are studying foreign languages less. Ms. Franklin said that in 1960, 16 students out of every 100 enrolled in college were taking a foreign language. In 1990, the rate had dropped to 8.5.
Brigham Young's language program stands apart from other big efforts, like those at the University of Wisconsin at Madison or Yale University, and not only because a third of its students are studying a foreign language at any time, or because 54 different languages are offered. Perhaps only at "the Y," most students start their formal study of a foreign language after they can already converse in it with ease.
The Mormon missions are the reason. Before embarking, Mormons get their basic language training at a center on campus that is run by the church but is independent of the university. What they learn in the crash course is barely enough to help them order groceries in a store. But they then spend two years abroad submerged in daily conversation, picking up a working knowledge of the local language and, often, a fascination with the culture.
The experience can transform them. "Before I got there the only thing I knew about Korea was 'M*A*S*H,' " said Paul Wulfenstein of Las Vegas. "I slaughtered their language for the first year; then I started to pick it up."
He returned from Korea in February 1991 to complete some courses at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas before transferring this semester to Brigham Young. He is enrolled in intermediate-level Korean classes and has declared Korean his major.
For Valerie Peterson of Pleasant Grove, Utah, learning the Japanese language broadened her world immeasurably. Before she went on a mission to Tokyo about two years ago, she lived close enough to the Brigham Young campus to commute.
She is now enrolled in intermediate-level Japanese courses in which she must be drilled on the elaborate pictographs she never had to master before. Sitting cross-legged and shoeless in the hallway at the Knight Building recently, Miss Peterson said she can speak Japanese with ease but still reads it at the level of a 5-year-old.
Miss Peterson has decided to major in Japanese. "It presents so many opportunities, I don't know where to start," she said. "I think I'll give translating a shot."

HEADLINE: 6th Match Game a Draw For Polgar and Spassky

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Judit Polgar and Boris Spassky agreed to a draw today after the 43d move in the sixth game of their exhibition chess match. 
 The 16-year-old Polgar, the world's youngest grandmaster, now leads the 10-game event by a score of 3 1/2-2 1/2. She and Spassky, a former world champion, are playing for a $120,000 winner's share of a $200,000 purse.
The next game will be on Thursday.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	LUCERNE, Switzerland, Feb. 9 (AP) - Where will the world championship be held next summer? Finding a site and a suitable purse for the match -- between Gary Kasparov, the champion, and Nigel Short, an English grandmaster -- has not been easy in this recession year.
On Monday, the International Chess Federation said it had received two bids. The larger, for $5.6 million, came from Jugoskandic, the Yugoslav sponsor of both the Polgar-Spassky match and the recent match between Spassky and Bobby Fischer; the site would be either Belgrade or Sofia, Bulgaria. The other bid, from Santiago de Compostela, Spain, was for $666,667. The purse for the last championship, in 1990 in New York and Lyons, France, was $3 million.

HEADLINE: Identity Crisis for London's Theater District

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Harold Pinter's drama "No Man's Land," which opened on Feb. 8 in the West End, is the latest longshot entry in the London theatrical sweepstakes that, over the last year, have seen more losers than winners.
More than a dozen ambitious plays and musicals have swept onto the West End stage -- some, like the Pinter play, coming off successful runs in London's small fringe theaters -- only to disappear without a trace, starved by half-full houses in spite of strong and often enthusiastic critical reviews. 
 "Grand Hotel," the Tommy Tune-directed musical that ran for two and a half years on Broadway, lasted barely four months here, and folded in November. The Beirut hostage drama "Someone Who'll Watch Over Me," starring Alec McCowen, Stephen Rea and James McDaniel (who are now appearing in the New York production), drew packed houses in suburban Hampstead, but closed in November in the West End after a run of only six weeks. And the Victorian romp "Trelawney of the Wells," which opened in early December to mixed reviews, closed abruptly last month, despite a cast that included Michael Hordern and Sarah Brightman.
The recession -- Britain's longest-running economic drama since the 1930's -- has clearly taken a toll on London theater, thinning the ranks of potential theatergoers, including foreign tourists who, in ordinary circumstances, fill nearly one of every three West End seats. Ticket prices, which have increased 24 percent since 1991, have had an effect, too, as producers try to recoup some of the higher cost of theatrical production in London.
 
Larger Issues at Stake
 But some critics and producers say the West End's difficulties are not merely the result of a downturn in economic fortunes, but rather a reflection of something much larger: the notion that the West End is struggling to redefine itself in the face not only of waning audiences but also of a nagging sense that truly innovative theater is being done elsewhere.
"The West End is in search of itself," said Nick Allott, the executive producer of the Cameron Mackintosh organization, who brought "Miss Saigon" and "Les Miserables" to the London stage, where they continue to be two of the West End's most enduring hits.
Mr. Allott says there is a broad belief that theater here has undergone a gradual restructuring over the last decade. As a result, new and original drama is now almost exclusively the province of the subsidized theater or regional theater, while the commercial theater -- the heart of the West End -- has become increasingly anodyne.
At the heart of the problem are soaring production costs. According to one estimate, the cost of putting on a straight play in the West End has nearly tripled in the last 10 years, to as much as $375,000 for a production with a small cast and perhaps one set change. (Such a play would cost about three times that much on Broadway). As a result, critics argue, London producers and theater owners have been forced to raise ticket prices -- which can be more than $30 for many straight plays and close to $50 for musicals -- to recover growing expenses. And, perhaps more importantly, they have become increasingly wary of taking risks.
Michael Billington, the theater critic of The Guardian, wrote last summer that the West End had become "a neon wasteland," filled with glitzy musicals and popular revivals. In an article on the West End, he fumed: "Too many tacky shows. Too little value for money. Too few drama producers with the Mackintosh flair. Too little investment."
Not everyone agrees with that assessment. The Society of West End Theaters, which monitors audience and ticket data and aggressively markets London's commercial and subsidized theater, argues that the situation is not nearly as bad as critics like Mr. Billington contend. In fact, the society argues, the constant churning among West End playhouses is a sign of vitality rather than of trouble.
There is also evidence, theater managers say, that a slight improvement in the economy is giving a second wind to a number of commercial productions that might not have survived only a few months ago. "Our Song," a melancholy ramble about male menopausal crisis, starring Peter O'Toole, has been playing to good houses; a revival of Noel Coward's "Hay Fever" that opened in November has extended bookings through May, and a production of Oscar Wilde's "Ideal Husband" has been playing to good audiences since it opened in early November.
Perhaps gambling on better times to come, the producers of "Kiss of the Spider Woman," which opened in the West End in October to critical acclaim (and won the Evening Standard's award for best musical), recently announced that they would accept ticket requests through September, though the show has been playing to less than full houses.
Moreover, theater managers argue that the number of flops and early closings was no worse than average last year. Of London's 50 commercial and subsidized theaters, 8 are currently dark.
Robert Fox, a producer who will bring Dame Maggie Smith to the West End in March in "The Importance of Being Earnest," said, "I don't think it is much different than it ever was, in terms of the plays that get to the West End." West End producers have always put a high premium on commercial value, he added. "It has never been an experimental forum, and that's why places like the National and Royal Shakespeare Company and Hampstead have funding," Mr. Fox said. "They can afford to be more daring, because the government is there to share the risk."
If many West End theaters do have trouble sustaining audiences, some producers say, the problem may be self-evident: too many theaters chasing too few theatergoers.
"You just don't have 40 great attractions playing at 40 different theaters that are going to persuade people to come out and spend money they are not willing to spend," said Duncan Weldon, a producer of two current plays, "Lost in Yonkers" and "Cyrano de Bergerac." "Especially not these days," he added, "when people have already cut down on their expenditures because of the economy."
Faced with so many empty seats, in fact, West End theaters in recent months have embarked on one short-term remedy: aggressive discounting schemes, including two-for-the-price-of-one ticket deals. Breaking a longstanding taboo, a few have also experimented with Sunday performances, in the hope of attracting more weekend trade.
But the more long-term result may be a gradual thinning of the number of working London theaters, because they can no longer survive if only half their seats are filled.
"In another five years, when it comes to a choice between having a dark theater and playing to half-full houses, I think we will have a situation here more like Broadway: more dark theaters," said Mr. Weldon.
It is a measure of the West End's stagnation, some critics argue, that the shows that draw the biggest audiences are the same ones that were drawing big audiences two and three years ago, notably Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals like "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera."
The popular drawing power of Mr. Webber's name and craft is such that lines stretched for two blocks along the Strand a few weeks ago when ticket sales opened for his newest production, "Sunset Boulevard." The top ticket for the show, which is to open in June, is a London record: the equivalent of $48.
It is when the Lloyd Webber and Mackintosh musicals and a handful of others are subtracted from London theater statistics that the West End's overall performance begins to look especially thin. Hilary Strange, an agent for Equity British Actors, the union for stage performers, said that life had become more difficult for actors.
"A few years ago, you had a reasonably good chance of getting a play that would have a year's run," she said. "Now you work in spurts, because most of the new stuff tends to last three months at most, and you have to then latch onto something else."
 
Bombing, Literally
 There are other explanations offered for the West End's problems in the last year. The Society of West End Theaters says that the Irish Republican Army scared away a lot of business during the fall, when they exploded several small devices in the West End, one of which killed a pub patron.
Others complain that new parking restrictions in central London have complicated the lives of theatergoers from the suburbs, and several critics ritually bemoan the aging, cramped theaters.
Thelma Holt, a longtime London producer, takes issue with those who argue that the West End is on the ropes, reduced to nothing but tourist theater. "That is an outdated view," she said. "The fact is, the fringe and subsidized theater and the West End all complement one another."
She pointed to several plays, like the new Pinter drama, which have moved to the West End from either the fringe or the subsidized theater. The most recent example was the Jim Cartwright play "The Rise and Fall of Little Voice," which earned good reviews and big audiences at the National Theater and just completed a very successful three-month run in the West End. And Peter Shaffer's "Gift of the Gorgon," which closes at the Royal Shakespeare this month, will reopen in the West End in March.
At the same time, however, no commercial producer has moved to bring to the West End such talked-about productions as "The Madness of King George III," which played to sold-out houses at the National Theater last year, or Tony Kushner's "Angels in America," which ran at the National's Cottlesloe Theater.
"People are always trying to kill off the West End," said Ms. Holt. "It's like the measles; it's one of those things that just comes around every so often."

HEADLINE: Blackstone Leads Group Bid For Canada Grocery Chain

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
In what would be one of the largest leveraged buyouts so far this decade, a unit of the Blackstone Group, an American investment bank, said yesterday that it and a Montreal-based group were seeking to acquire Univa, the second-largest supermarket chain in Canada, for about $1.25 billion in cash and debt.
Blackstone Capital Partners L.P. and Unigesco Inc., the Montreal group, are the principals in the transaction. Blackstone Capital is a New York-based investment fund. Unigesco is Univa's largest shareholder, with a 26 percent stake. 
 Under the terms of the transaction, Blackstone Capital would put up $300 million in cash for an 80 percent stake in Univa. Unigesco's equity investment would be roughly $75 million, for which it would receive the remaining 20 percent of the company.
 Sensitive to Canadian attitudes about foreign ownership of local companies, Blackstone Capital agreed to liquidate its interest in Univa in no more than seven years. At that time, the joint venture with Unigesco would be dissolved, and control of Univa would be vested in Unigesco.
 
A Tailored Transaction
 "We have tried to design the transaction to accommodate the needs of people in Canada," said Stephen A. Schwarzman, president and chief executive of the Blackstone Group. "We don't keep our investments for as long as seven years anyhow, and we have agreed to give Unigesco the right of first refusal on major asset sales."
In order to finance the balance of the purchase not covered by equity, Blackstone Capital and Unigesco will need to raise close to $900 million in bank loans and other forms of debt securities.
 Mr. Schwarzman said the partners were "far along" in obtaining commitments from several major American and Canadian financial institutions.
In a news release announcing the deal, Blackstone Capital and Unigesco said they expected that about 40 percent of Univa's capitalization after the transaction was completed would be in the form of either equity or debt bearing no cash interest for five years.
Mr. Schwarzman said bank debt to finance the transaction would be raised in Canada, and subordinated debt in the United States.
Univa, which had sales of more than $6.5 billion last year, has a 40 percent share of the supermarket business in Ontario and about a 45 percent share of Quebec's supermarket business, Mr. Schwarzman said.
"In the United States you don't typically get market shares that are this big," Mr. Schwarzman added. "This is a very well-positioned business."
Nevertheless, given Canada's current -- and continuing -- economic slump, people familiar with Univa said the Blackstone Capital offer was extremely rich.
More than 60 percent of Univa's stock is owned by three large shareholders.
 
 
Empire's Stake
 Marilyn Brophy, an equity analyst for the First Boston Corporation in Toronto, said that in addition to Unigesco's 26 percent interest, the Empire Company, another Canadian supermarket operator, owned 24 percent and Caisse Depot, Quebec's largest pension fund, owned around 13 percent.
Ms. Brophy said Empire, which had expressed interest in pieces of Univa's business in the past, might make a competing bid. Empire's board was scheduled to meet today to consider its response to the Blackstone Capital offer.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Good News Is Bad for Bond Prices

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The Treasury market got a light jolt of good economic news yesterday afternoon that was enough to push prices of notes and bonds down a little after the first of the Treasury's three quarterly auctions this week went well.
But the Treasury market has retained most of the big gains of the January rally despite the fact that President Clinton has yet to present a clearly detailed deficit reduction plan and now appears to be dropping some of the toughest ideas he has considered. 
 The economic news was the Johnson Redbook report that showed that department and chain store sales rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 3.7 percent in the first week of February. This showed that consumer buying continued to remain stronger than many analysts had thought.
 
Happy With Auciton
 "This is the first time the market has paid any attention to any economic news," said one bond trader, who argued that the recent string of data showing the economy moving at a nice pace should have been raising some concern about inflation and pulling Treasury prices lower.
The Treasury auctioned $15.5 billion of three-year notes at an average yield of 4.73 percent, and investors and traders seemed to be happy with the results. "It was an honest auction," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. "There seemed to be some solid demand from large institutional investors."
After the auction, the yield on the new three-year note, which has a coupon of 4.625 percent, dropped to around 4.68 percent, a sign that there was demand for the new notes. But the gains were lost after the report on department store sales, and the yield finished at 4.73 percent, the same as the average at the auction. The Treasury will auction 10-year notes today and 30-year bonds tomorrow.
Prices of current Treasury notes and bonds, which had been lifted by the three-year auction results, fell after the Johnson Redbook report. The two-year note was off 3/32 , with the yield rising to 4.20 percent, up from 4.17 percent Monday. The price of the current 10-year note fell 5/32 as the yield increased to 6.38 percent from 6.36 percent.
The price of the current 30-year bond was off 2/32 as the yield rose to 7.20 percent from 7.19 percent. The discount rates on six-month and one-year Treasury bills rose slightly, to 3.10 percent and 3.34 percent, respectively. The 2.92 percent discount rate on the three-month bill was unchanged.
But traders said they still thought there was a good atmosphere for the remaining two auctions this week, although some were worried about what President Clinton might say in his town meeting in Detroit tonight as he begins to sell his economic program. In late trading, the yield in the when-issued, or pre-auction, market was 6.34 percent on the new 10-year note, up from 6.32 percent Monday, and 7.15 percent on the new 30-year bond, unchanged from Monday.
A successful 30-year auction tomorrow could see the yield fall below the 7.10 percent low of April 1986, the lowest level since the Treasury began to issue 30-year bonds regularly in the late 1970's.
The quarterly auctions commenced yesterday as more of the details of Mr. Clinton's economic plan became public. And one factor that could begin to worry the bond market is that, as of now, there is more talk of new spending and tax increases than spending cuts.
For example, on Monday, Mr. Clinton announced a plan to extend unemployment benefits for 26 weeks at a cost of about $3 billion. His communications director, George Stephanopoulos, said the Administration was unlikely to propose any kind of freeze on cost-of-living increases for Social Security. But the Administration is still considering raising the taxes on Social Security benefits.
 
Waiting on Military Spending Cuts
 The major spending reduction to be outlined so far is in the military budget, a place Democrats have traditionally gone for spending reductions. And last week the Administration indicated that the package of tax cuts and spending increases to stimulate the economy would be about $31 billion, more than the $20 billion many analysts were counting on.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, Louisiana issued $602 million of general obligation bonds, including $477 million of series A refunding bonds and $125 million of series B improvement bonds. The series B bonds, with a coupon of 5.875 percent were priced to yield 5.90 percent in 2011, 2012 and 2013. The taxable equivalent yield is 8.55 percent. The lead manager was Merrill Lynch. The noncallable bonds are insured by the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation and therefore are triple-A rated.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS -- ADVERTISING;
Cigarette makers encourage smokers to wear their favorite brands on their sleeves.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
WHO'S going to clothe America this spring? Donna Karan, Ralph Lauren, Philip Morris, L. L. Bean, R. J. Reynolds . . .
Don't laugh. The nation's largest tobacco marketers are undertaking their most extensive efforts ever to entice Americans into wearing their cigarette brand names. It is estimated that they will spend upward of $300 million this year to persuade consumers to collect proofs of purchase or coupons redeemable for clothing and other merchandise. 
 Tobacco Road is beginning to look like Seventh Avenue as longtime give-away items like T-shirts and caps are being complemented by pricier jogging outfits, scarves, vests and belts. A black leather jacket from Virginia Slims V-Wear -- "the fashion collection with a streetwise attitude," a brochure gushes -- goes for 350 universal product codes from packs, while a pullover from the "Marlboro Adventure Team" -- "you won't want to take it off, ever," the Official Gear Catalog promises -- goes for 180 product codes.
Most of the garments are festooned with advertising imagery, as camels and cowboys replace polo ponies and alligators. For example, apparel promoting Benson & Hedges Special Kings bears its logo or its slogan, "Take the edge off." For some, like V-Wear, identification is generally confined to labels.
The promotions are at the heart of strategies intended to shore up sagging sales of full-price cigarettes, which are losing market share to discount smokes. Brands with unfamiliar names like Bristol, Misty and Bucks, priced up to a dollar a pack less than their higher-priced counterparts, have an estimated 30 percent of the $47 billion American cigarette market -- 10 times more than a decade ago.
"If you're going to make a good living in the tobacco business, you focus on full price for the same reason that Willie Sutton focused on banks," said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. in San Francisco. "That's where the money is."
While 80 percent of Philip Morris's American unit sales last year came from full-price brands, he estimated, those brands accounted for 95 percent of earnings; at Reynolds, the comparable figures were 69 percent of sales and at least 80 percent of profits.
So the promotions act as incentives to encourage smokers "to buy your cigarettes for reasons beyond price," he said. "You can give things away; you just don't want to give price away."
Lawrence S. Wexler, senior vice president of marketing at Philip Morris U.S.A. in New York, which is sponsoring the promotions for Benson & Hedges, Marlboro and Virginia Slims, said: "This is a way of adding value to our premium trademarks, and giving consumers looking for a reason to continue buying them a way to do that."
His counterpart at the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in Winston-Salem, N.C., agreed. "If you take $5 off a carton of cigarettes, the smoker perceives it as $5, and it costs us $5," said David N. Iauco, senior vice president of marketing. "But if you take merchandise with a perceived value of $5 that costs us $3, the economics are better."
For its popular Camel brand, Reynolds is introducing the third in a series of Camel Cash Catalogs, starring the Joe Camel cartoon character. Camel's gain in market share last year -- unusual for a full-price brand -- was in large part a result of the second catalogue promotion, Mr. Iauco said.
Even so, whether the tobacco industry's wearables will wear well remains problematic.
"We don't know if they will succeed at counteracting the fact that cigarettes are so expensive right now," said Laurie Petersen, editor of The Cowles Report on Database Marketing and Management, a newsletter in New York.
Another problem is the opposition of antismoking activists. The promotions are "yet again another way of making smoking appear glamorous and attractive," said Joy Epstein, administrator for Federal issues at the Coalition on Smoking or Health in Washington. In December, the coalition, representing health groups like the American Cancer Society, filed a petition with the Federal Trade Commission demanding the Marlboro Adventure Team promotion be withdrawn because it violated a voluntary industry code by associating smoking with physical activities "requiring stamina."
Opponents of smoking also contend that the apparel's brand identifications transform smokers, and sometimes youngsters below the legal smoking age, into walking billboards. Unlike actual billboards and other cigarette ads, the clothing need not carry health warnings.
"We get flak from the antismoking groups for anything we do," said Mr. Iauco, adding that parents who complained about Camel merchandise ordered by their children were asked to return it.
The promotions represent a more sophisticated version of previous marketing campaigns, known as continuity programs. In the earlier efforts, smokers could order merchandise similar to that carried by trading-stamp catalogues, rather than brand-related apparel. In 1932, Brown & Williamson introduced coupons on its Raleigh brand. Its catalogue, now in its 70th edition, according to a company spokesman, is on its way to outlasting the Sears, Roebuck catalogue.

HEADLINE: Study Sees Dip In Investment From Abroad

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
Foreign investment in companies and real estate in New York City slowed substantially in the early 1990's, although not as sharply as the decline experienced throughout the country, a new study shows.
The study, conducted for the Dinkins administration, found that there were 75 transactions involving foreign companies in New York City in 1991, the lowest level since 1977. Throughout the 1980's, there were about 100 such deals each year. 
 However, the city, which has lagged behind other parts of the country in recovering from the recession, did manage to increase its share of the business in comparison to other regions around the nation, the study, which was done by James Orr, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, found.
 
'Fairly Well Positioned'
 About 10.4 percent of the deals or transactions involving foreign direct investment in the United States in 1991 were in New York City, up from 7.5 percent in 1988, the study said. Still that figure is below the 12.5 percent hit during the national boom in mergers and acquisitions in the mid-1980's.
"Even though the total is down, the city has slightly increased its share of the national number of foreign investment transactions in key sectors for the city," Mr. Orr said. "This suggests that foreign investors in these key sectors still consider it important to be in New York. Indeed, the city seems fairly well positioned to benefit when foreign investment in the United States recovers."
Recessions abroad and in the United States are undoubtedly a big reason for the slowdown in foreign investment in recent years.
But the city has done particularly well in the areas most important to its economy -- namely financial, insurance and real-estate services, business services and retail trade, Mr. Orr said in an interview yesterday.
 
'Pretty Trustworthy'
 To be sure, the share of total investment deals or transactions is a crude measure. A better gauge would be the city's share of the dollar value of total foreign investment in the country. Conceding that, Mr. Orr said reliable data on the value were not available. He defended the use of the transaction figure, saying it was "a pretty trustworthy indicator of how the city is faring."
A new study by the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics also documented the importance of foreign investment to New York City. Relying on data from the fourth quarter of 1990, the bureau found that foreign-owned companies not only accounted for 208,544, or 7.2 percent, of the nongovernment jobs in the city but also paid higher wages than American companies do. "Foreign investment is a substantially more important source of jobs in Manhattan than in any central core of any major economic area of the country," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the bureau's regional Commissioner.
The studies were released as a city delegation of government, business and cultural leaders led by Mayor David N. Dinkins is preparing for a weeklong visit to Japan to promote New York. With his aides flashing business cards in Japanese and English and with Japanese dignitaries looking on, Mr. Dinkins yesterday announced the details of the Feb. 20-27 visit.
A main purpose of Mr. Orr's study was to help city officials to pinpoint the countries and companies most likely to invest in New York. And Mr. Dinkins cited it in discussing the importance of the trip. In terms of the number of transactions, the Japanese were the largest source of such investment in the second half of the 1980's and in the early 1990's.
 
No Quick Payoff
 The Mayor said that while he hoped that the trip to Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto would ultimately result in more Japanese investment and tourism, he did not expect a quick payoff. "No, I don't expect to come back with deals," he said.
With the Japanese economy in a slump and Japanese companies retrenching, one New York business leader at the City Hall news conference conceded that one goal of the trip was to insure that such companies did not abandon New York. "You want to make it clear that New York is not the one to pull out of," said Ronald K. Shelp, president of the New York City Partnership and the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Mr. Dinkins and business leaders went to Europe last spring to pay courtesy calls on companies with operations in New York City and to woo others, especially medium-sized concerns, interested in establishing or expanding operations in the United States.
It typically takes many months, if not years, for foreign companies to pick locations in the United States and to negotiate deals. And a weak European economy has undoubtedly caused companies to put expansion plans on hold. The Mayor said yesterday that the trip had not yet produced tangible results, but he seemed hopeful that deals might soon be struck.
 
'Serious Negotiations'
 Mr. Shelp said contacts with 280 mostly medium-size European companies had resulted in "serious negotiations" with 26 companies in industries like software, retailing, tourism and food processing. Some were arranging visits to inspect possible sites for operations in New York, he said.
In December, Mr. Dinkins unveiled a long-range economic "vision" for strengthening the city's economy that was billed as a mold for forming new policies. The need for strengthening the city's position as a leading international business center figured prominently in the vision.
In an interview, Barry F. Sullivan, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, said the the Dinkins administration intended shortly to step up "in a major way" programs aimed at cultivating closer relationships with foreign companies, business organizations and consulates in New York.
 
Biggest Share
 Of the 1,582 foreign direct investments in the city from 1974 through 1991, Britain had the biggest share, with 23 percent, followed by Japan with 18 percent, Canada and France with 9 percent each, Germany with 7 percent, Italy with 4 percent and the Netherlands and Switzerland with 3 percent each.
Of the transactions, 24.7 percent were in manufacturing, including publishing companies; 22.8 percent in wholesale and retail trade; 19.9 percent in finance, insurance and real estate services; 13.3 percent in other services, like advertising, and 10.6 percent in property.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that foreign-owned businesses employed 501,451 in the 26 counties in the metropolitan region, which was a larger portion of private-sector jobs than in the country as a whole -- 6.9 percent versus 5.2 percent. Foreign-owned companies also paid their employees 24 percent, or $684, more per month, than the average for all companies in the region.
Manhattan boasts the region's largest concentration of employment by foreign-owned companies, with 177,296 employees, or 35.4 percent of the regional total. Those accounted for 9.6 percent of Manhattan's private-sector jobs.
Other counties that had concentrations of 20,000 or more employees of foreign-owned companies included Nassau and Westchester in New York; Bergen, Essex and Middlesex in New Jersey, and Fairfield in Connecticut.

HEADLINE: Roosevelt Raceway Fraud Case Is Sent Back to Federal Court

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Feb. 9

 BODY:
After almost six years of controversy, a Federal court will hear claims that the owners of Roosevelt Raceway engaged in fraud when they obtained $54 million in tax-free development bonds to buy the property.
The owners had promised to continue operating the track, but within four years, they shut it down and put the property on the market for development. 
 Horse owners, horse trainers and track employees had accused the track owners of fraud and deception, and their case had been rejected by the Federal District Court. But a three-judge panel of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled late Monday that the track employees had a right to present evidence to support their claim under the Rackeeter Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act known as RICO.
The decision, written by Judge Ellsworth A. Van Graafeiland, sent the matter back to the Federal District Court.
The more than 3,000 horse owners, grooms, blacksmiths, parimutuel clerks and other racetrack employees affected by the raceway's closing are seeking $50 million in damages, which would be tripled under the Federal RICO statute, should the owners be found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the workers.
 
'Our Day in Court'
 Bernard Persky, the lawyer for the workers, described the decision, which was made public today, as "a major victory."
"We can now have our day in court," he said. According to court papers, the workers contend that the defendants are "guilty of a colossal fraud -- that they never intended to continue the track in operation, but planned instead to use the property for much more lucrative purposes."
But Anton J. Borovina, the lawyer for the owners, Roosevelt Raceway Associates, described the ruling as "narrow in scope."
"They still have the obligation to establish their claim." he said. "All of the agreements made by the owners were done so in public, so how can anyone claim they were deceived?"
The principal owners named in the suit are Charles L. Evans, William B. Hopkins, Barry B. Goldstein and David A. Stevenson.
They purchased the track in 1984 with $54 million in tax-free bonds issued by the Town of Hempstead Industrial Development Agency. At the time, the owners said they had no intention of closing the track and selling it to developers.
But citing hard times, the owners closed the track in 1988. The recession prevented a quick sale of the site, and the parcel -- the largest tract of undeveloped commercial property in Nassau County -- became a white elephant and a political embarrassment to Hempstead's Republican leadership when questions were raised by track employees about the issuance of the tax-free bonds.
 
New Plans for Site
 An inquiry by the State Investigation Commission released in December 1991 cleared the track's owners of criminal wrongdoing, but said that Hempstead did not adequately investigate the raceway purchase before issuing the bonds.
The state inquiry also cleared Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican and former Hempstead Presiding Supervisor, of charges that he improperly tried to seek Federal tax exemptions for the raceway.
Last year, Hempstead lifted a moratorium on development of the site, approved new zoning requirements and spurred commercial construction as a means to stimulate Long Island's economy.
The Hempstead Town Board then approved plans for a major retail development by Wal-Mart and Sam's Club. Together they will employ 1,000 construction workers and create 650 permanent jobs once completed.
 
Rezoned for Mixed Use
 Construction is now under way, and officials do not expect the court ruling to interrupt plans for the 162-acre site, according to Anthony J. Santino, a spokesman for the town.
"This is a matter between the track owners and the former employees of the raceway, and has nothing to do with the town, so we have no comment," Mr. Santino said.
The arrival of Wal-Mart and Sam's Club will complete the first step in the redevelopment of the raceway site, which was rezoned for mixed use, including 555 housing units, a 10-screen movie theater, an office complex and hotel and conference center. Down the street to the west is Roosevelt Field, one of the largest shopping malls in the New York area. To the north is Fortunoff's and the newly built Price Club Plaza.
Mr. Persky said the suit by the raceway's former employees included an option to seek an end to the new construction at the raceway, but he declined to say whether he planned to pursue such a course in court.

HEADLINE: Florio, a Budget Proposal And an Election Platform

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
In a year in which both he and all 120 members of the State Legislature face re-election, Gov. Jim Florio used much of his annual budget address today to trumpet the successes of his first term in office and to set the platform on which he is expected to seek a second term.
Leading politicians agreed that it was definitely an election-year presentation, although they disagreed about whether that was good or bad. Mr. Florio's speech and his budget won cautious praise from the Republicans who control the Legislature, which must approve the spending plan, though it came under immediate attack from two candidates for the Republican nomination for governor -- Christine Todd Whitman and Cary Edwards. 
 More surprisingly, the budget was criticized by the State Senate minority leader, John A. Lynch, the second most powerful elected Democrat in state government, after Governor Florio. Mr. Lynch's attack today was driven by anger that the proposed budget did not fully restore the homestead rebate program that gives tax refunds to some homeowners and renters. The program was cut in half, to $350 million, last year.
 
'Fiscal Gimmicks'
 "It's clearly an election-year budget -- high on promises but low on problem-solving," Mr. Lynch said in a statement that was distributed to reporters as Mr. Florio delivered his speech. "A budget backed by $4 billion in fiscal gimmicks and $412 million in Medicaid reimbursements should have enough money in it to restore the homestead rebate program to what it was before the Republicans cut it last year."
The proposed budget that Mr. Florio released on Monday for the 1994 fiscal year is a $15.6 billion spending plan shaped largely by political deal-making -- from collaboration with the Republican legislative leaders on major spending to the last-minute infusion of $412 million in Medicaid reimbursements with the help of President Clinton.
Today, Mr. Florio went before a joint session of the Republican-controlled Legislature to outline his broad budget goals: guaranteed health-care coverage for all New Jersey residents, tougher law-enforcement programs, a program to train youths for high-tech jobs.
 
Awkward Position
 With the coalition of Mr. Florio and the Republican legislative leadership seemingly in accord on the budget, it left the Republican gubernatorial candidates and Mr. Lynch, the Senate Democratic leader, in the awkward position of hitting their own party members with the political arrows intended for their traditional enemies, and it left the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Republican, in the even odder position of defending Mr. Florio.
"Governor Florio's budget is great electioneering but lousy economics," said Mrs. Whitman, who held an impromptu news conference in one corner of the State House corridor as Mr. Edwards held a competing news conference several yards away.
But Mr. DiFrancesco said, "This is a good election-year budget," adding that the Republican legislative leaders had agreed on 85 to 90 percent of the budget, including spending on education, health and jobs creation.
 
'Months of Discussions'
 In his speech, Mr. Florio said: "No one wants to see a repeat of the budget hell of last year. This budget I submit today is based on months of discussions I've had with the leaders of this distinguished body."
Mr. Florio, in the final year of his first four-year term in office, has yet to announce for re-election, but much of his speech today had the ring of a politician on the stump.
"You know, when I was a kid growing up in Brooklyn, my Uncle Tom Florio got me one of my first jobs -- shoveling up after the horses at a stable in Prospect Park," Mr. Florio said. "At that time, I thought I was lucky to have a little pocket money. I never imagined it would be such a good apprenticeship for being Governor."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Weaker Against Yen On Expected Trade Pressure

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against the yen yesterday on speculation that leading Western countries may exert pressure on Tokyo to push up the Japanese currency.
Gold prices rose 50 cents an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York to settle at $328.90 for current delivery. A late quote from the Republic National Bank said spot delivery settled at $328.55, up 40 cents from Monday. 
 The Japanese Finance Minister, Yoshiro Hayashi, is scheduled to meet Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on Saturday to address worsening trade tensions between the United States and Japan, prompting speculation that a yen appreciation could be offered as a quick cure.
 
Effect of a Higher Yen
 A higher yen could make Japanese goods more expensive in the United States, curbing imports, and lower the cost of American goods for Japanese consumers, encouraging exports and helping address the trade imbalance. In 1992, Japan's trade surplus with the United States grew 14.3 percent, to $43.67 billion.
David Rolley, an international economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, said that currency traders were gambling that the Clinton Administration would be more confrontational on trade issues. But he doubted that much would come out of Saturday's meeting.
Besides the speculative binge, Mr. Rolley said, the yen's strength stems from increased capital flow into Japanese assets.
In Tokyo, the dollar ended at 122.35 yen, down from 124.73 yen Monday. Later in London, it eased to 124.18 yen, from 124.28 yen Monday. In New York, the dollar slipped to 121.28 yen, from 123.73 yen late Monday.
The dollar fell to 1.6513 marks late yesterday in New York from 1.6573 late Monday. Earlier in London, the dollar traded at 1.6525 marks, down from 1.6553 marks Monday.
The British pound was at $1.4315 in late New York trading, down from about $1.4375 Monday. In London, the pound finished at $1.4305.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Monday quotes, included: 1.5285 Swiss francs, down from 1.5365; 5.5955 French francs, down from 5.6075; 1.2670 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2631, and 1,528 lire, barely changed from Monday's 1,527.

Carter Hawley Hale Selects Storehouse's Top Executive

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. said today that David L. Dworkin, a veteran retail executive, would become president and chief executive of the department store chain, effective April 1.
Mr. Dworkin, who is now chairman and chief executive of Storehouse P.L.C., a London-based retailer, will succeed Philip M. Hawley, who has said he plans to retire. 
 The 49-year-old Mr. Dworkin faces considerable challenges in taking charge of Carter Hawley Hale, the largest retail chain in the West, which emerged from bankruptcy protection in October.
 
Struggle with Debt
 Carter Hawley expanded rapidly into nine regional chains throughout the 1970's and 80's, but it took on considerable debt to fight off a takeover bid from the Limited Inc. The debt burden forced the company to sell some specialty chains and eventually to file for protection from its creditors.
While Carter Hawley has substantially reduced its overhead costs, mainly through a debt-for-equity swap with the Zell/Chilmark Fund of Chicago, the Los Angeles-based retailer must still find ways to attract new customers amid a stubborn regional recession.
Carter Hawley Hale operates 83 department stores, including the Broadway, Weinstock's, Emporium and Broadway Southwest, which had sales of $2.1 billion last year. Retailing analysts have said that Carter must begin broadening its customer base, stocking more fashionable goods and upgrading aging stores.
 
Interested Party
 To accomplish this, however, the company may have to consolidate some operations or seek additional cash from Zell/Chilmark, its largest creditor and shareholder, the analysts said. Zell/Chilmark bought 80 percent of Carter Hawley's $600 million in unsecured debt last year in return for 75 percent control of the company's common stock.
Sam Zell, the Chicago investor who heads the fund, said in a statement today that Mr. Dworkin was "a proven star in the retailing industry," citing his recent turnaround of Storehouse P.L.C.
Before joining Storehouse in 1989 as chairman and chief executive of its British Home Stores division, Mr. Dworkin served as president of Bonwit Teller in New York and as president of the Neiman Marcus Company in Dallas, a Carter Hawley division. Mr. Dworkin has been executive vice president of Marshall Field & Company in Chicago and senior vice president of Saks Fifth Avenue in New York.
 
Experiments Set
 In a telephone interview from his home in London, Mr. Dworkin said that after conducting a comprehensive study of Carter Hawley's operations, he would begin testing a variety of ideas to turn the stores around.
"We need to develop a strong market plan so that we start buying the product that best represents the customer base, and I don't think that has been done for some time," Mr. Dworkin said.

HEADLINE: Modest Decline Continues In Yields Offered by Banks

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Yields to be offered at banks on money market accounts and certificates of deposit in the week beginning today suggest a continuing modest decline.
In the New York market, average six-month certificate yields are lower than at 20 major banks across the country, while money market yields are about the same everywhere.
According to the latest survey by The Bank Rate Monitor, yields on money market accounts in the New York area are down an average of a basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point, to 2.66 percent. Analysts note that the slide in money market account yields is now nearly two months old.
 
Mixed Moves on C.D.'s
 The average New York rate for three-month certificates of deposit dropped a basis point, to 2.76 percent, while the average yield on six-month certificates rose a basis point, to 2.96 percent. 
 New York banks posting the sharpest changes this week included EAB, which dropped 10 basis points off its money market account, to 2.48 percent. Chase Manhattan took 21 basis points off its three-month C.D., leaving it at 2.63 percent. Anchor Savings, however, raised the rate on its six-month C.D. by 55 basis points, to 3.60 percent.
Outside the New York market, yields at 20 large banks were largely unchanged, with the average money market account off a basis point, to 2.63 percent. Six-month C.D.'s were unchanged at 2.99 percent.
At the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, average discount rates declined further, to their lowest levels of the last six weeks. The auction is regarded by many as a harbinger of rate changes that banks might make.
The average rate at auction yesterday was 2.94 percent for a three-month Treasury bill, down 3 basis points, and 3.09 percent for a six-month bill, down a basis point.
Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, said the continued downward drift in savings yields indicated that loan demand remained weak despite recent positive economic signals.
"Banks simply do not have to replace those funds by bidding up deposit rates," he said. "Moreover, last week's easing in interest rates by Japan and Germany could help set the stage for further easing by the Federal Reserve, if that becomes part of President Clinton's recovery scenario."


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on moneymarket accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, Feb. 10, 1993.

Asking the Questions

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is sick to death of it. The President ran on the economy, but all anyone wants to talk about these days is who's taking care of the kids of the candidates for attorney general.
So it seems fitting to take a break from the witch hunts surrounding who paid what when to the sitter to discuss a pressing economic issue. 
 Child care.
The United States needs a national child care system for all families, from the poor to the well-to-do. If the withdrawal of two talented women lawyers from consideration for service in the Clinton Administration because of baby-sitter stuff ends in a welter of class wars and gender hostilities, we will have missed an opportunity to begin a process that should have started two decades ago.
By 1995, two-thirds of the women with preschool children are expected to be working outside their homes. Yet child care has never been a major political issue. And the most depressing thing about the debate these last few weeks has been the defeatism of the dialogue: I have to make do with inconvenient, expensive, even unsafe child care arrangements -- why shouldn't you?
Last week the President talked about wanting to immunize all American children. If we had a system of early childhood care, well-baby programs would be an obvious part of that care. Last week the President talked about wanting to get people off welfare. Women on welfare will tell you one of the greatest impediments to getting off is child care and its cost. "It's the biggest problem in our lives," one mother of three said of herself and her friends.
At the York Street Project in Jersey City, which offers high school classes to women who have dropped out and housing to those who are homeless, the nuns who run the place say it took them only a year to realize that child care would be the linchpin of their efforts, that women couldn't show up for classes or make it to work if they didn't have a safe and stable place to leave their kids.
Our late entry into the world of child care policy gives us plenty of other national programs to consider. In France, nearly all children between the ages of 3 and 5 attend free preprimary schools. A third of all younger children are cared for in licensed and monitored family day-care homes or day-care centers.
In the United States women frequently set up family day care in their own homes with no training or licensing. The Government family day-care system in France includes local hub offices that provide equipment, activities and oversight and a nurse-director who hires and trains providers and matches them with children. Parents pay on a sliding scale based on income.
The system is so good that a group of American experts studied French facilities in 1989. One of them was Hillary Rodham Clinton, then chair of the Children's Defense Fund, now the obvious person to spearhead child care policy. Ms. Clinton is already working on health care, but maybe it's time to start thinking of child care as a subset of health care, providing for the physical, mental and emotional health of many of America's children.
We know what we don't want: We don't want a big government child care monolith. We need a range of options, from corporate centers and benefit packages to family day care and government subsidies. We need community centers and community information banks about sitters.
Where's the money to come from? people will ask. But a better question is where the money's now going. Businesses are losing billions of dollars every year in lost employee time because of child care problems. Government is paying billions in public assistance to women who say a major impediment to going back to work is finding child care they can afford.
And the biggest little cash economy in America turns out to be baby-sitting, not just for briefcase moms with immigrant sitters but for family day-care providers who don't report their income and for women on welfare who supplement their checks with baby-sitting money.
But this is more than an economic issue. America pays lip service to liking kids, but you can't prove it by how they're treated or the priority given their care. It may take some time to find answers for us on this issue. But it's time, past time, that we started asking the questions.

HEADLINE: Less Is Key to an Insurer's Success

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Me.

 BODY:
As many insurance companies fret over the prospect of losing their health business under health-care reform, one quietly growing insurer here, the UNUM Corporation, seems destined to prosper if some widely expected proposals emerge from Hillary Clinton's office this spring.
For the last several years, UNUM has flourished as a result of its decision to abandon the traditional health-care insurance business and focus on add-on benefits. It is now the nation's leading group disability insurer and packages an array of benefits for employers that range from dental to group life to coverage for eyeglasses. 
 Now, as the Clinton Administration is considering tax changes that would encourage employers to provide only basic health coverage to workers, health economists expect the demand by individuals for these supplemental policies to grow rapidly.
 
 
Greater Danger
 What is more, disability insurance is a growth business. While most middle-class Americans are familiar with the need for life insurance coverage, it is only as the baby-boomer generation ages, with families dependent on two incomes, that consumers are realizing the greater danger of losing income from injury than from death.
As a result, UNUM's prospects, at least in the eyes of insurance analysts, are steeply on the rise. The company's stock is up more than 50 percent from a year ago.
[UNUM ended New York Stock Exchange trading Tuesday at $56, down $1.50. The company reported an earnings gain of 21 percent for 1992, to $248.8 million, on revenues of $2.6 billion.]
"The goal now for insurance carriers is to find niche opportunities," Mark Puccia, a director with the Standard & Poor's Corporation, said. "UNUM is the classic case of a company that has done that effectively."
In a move expected to help cash in on a growing demand for supplemental benefits, UNUM announced in December that it was merging with Colonial Life and Accident of Columbia, S.C., an insurer that specializes in accident, cancer and other life insurance products. Combined, analysts say, the companies could dominate the multibillion-dollar supplemental coverage field.
 Also in December, UNUM announced a deal under which the 8,300 life insurance agents of the Equitable Companies would sell only disability products designed by UNUM, a concession by the giant Equitable that it could not compete in that segment.
"When we go into a marketplace, we want to stake out a leadership position," James F. Orr 2d, UNUM's chairman and chief executive officer, said. "When it comes to health-care reform, I think we're one of the best-positioned companies in the business."
UNUM, with offices that peer down over the quaint docks and gray shoreline islands off Portland, was known as the Union Mutual Life Insurance Company here since before the Civil War and until 1986, when it became the first major insurer to de-mutualize. Until then, UNUM was a modest regional insurer that rarely attracted attention as a company with major national or international growth prospects.
But since 1986, when it changed its name to the Latin word for the numeral one, the company has blossomed. Earnings have risen to $16 billion from $10 billion and its return on equity has risen to 16 percent, from 7 percent, far exceeding the industry average. Compared with 1980, when the company had assets of $2.3 billion and 1,872 employees, UNUM has become a behemoth by Maine standards, with assets of $11 billion and 5,725 employees.
 
 
What Not to Be
 At the heart of the company's success, analysts and corporate executives agree, was UNUM's decision of what not to be.
In 1987, it decided to leave the medical insurance business despite growth of the health-care sector because of the growing dominance of the majors. Today, many health economists say there will be no room for the kind of midsize health insurer that UNUM used to be. Under managed competition, they predict, the health insurance industry will be increasingly governed by giants such as Prudential, Cigna and Blue Shield-Blue Cross organizations that have the money and the experience to compete widely on the basis of price. Between 1982 and 1990 UNUM also abandoned other meat and potatoes of the life insurance business: individual life insurance, general investment contracts, individual annuities and pensions.
What was left was a disability business backed up by a huge data base on the disability risks of Americans that is unmatched by any other company. Elaine D. Rosen, the senior vice president for employee benefits and disability division, said the company's actuarial data, gathered over several decades, allowed it to classify long-term disability customers into more than 200 separate categories by factors such as industry, geography and occupation.
 
 
Potential Market
 Unlike life insurance or the crisis-ridden fields of automobile or health insurance, experts see disability insurance as an area of strong growth for years to come. Margaret M. Alexandre, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said the potential market for disability insurance of 117 million Americans was only 36 percent penetrated, largely because most consumers were just realizing the need for disability policies. Ms. Alexandre estimates the business will grow 5 to 8 percent over the next five years. UNUM, which has about 25 percent of the group long-term disability market, now between $2.5 and $3 billion in premiums, expects to see its market share grow 1 percent for each of the next five years as the market expands.
In addition, UNUM, like a number of other companies, offers group dental, life and retirement savings plans and designs so-called cafeteria packages of medical benefits that supplement major medical coverage. With UNUM's help, an employer is able to offer its workers a wide choice of benefits, depending on the employee's needs and how much either the company or the worker is willing to pay. Offering those kinds of choices may be crucial if Washington this year adopts at least part of the model of health-care reform known as managed competition, which would attempt to hold down medical costs by giving consumers, rather than employers, more choice of which types of health insurance they buy.
"Because UNUM sells a full line of health and specialty products, if employees suddenly find themselves with minimum-level coverage, they will begin to shop for others," said Ms. Alexandre of Salomon Brothers, who predicts 13 to 15 percent growth in earnings for UNUM for each of the next five years.
"UNUM," she adds, "has just the product line to deal with that new market."
 
 
Company in Transition
 Nonetheless, in a visit to the company's headquarters, UNUM at times still seemed in the midst of its transition from a modest New England employer to a savvy international corporation. Ward Graffam, president and managing director for European operations, said he had never been on a plane to Europe before he got his job three years ago. A company spokeswoman half jokingly referred to insurance benefits that are only available from companies outside of Maine as insurance "from away."
And with declining interest rates, the company may face pressure to raise prices to make up for lower investment income. That could make UNUM's products less competitive and cost it market share. Also, claims for new diseases that do not have much of an actuarial history, such as Epstein-Barr syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome and AIDS, could dim the company's long-term growth plans.
But Mr. Orr boasts about UNUM's prospects. The company has successfully acquired disability insurers in Canada and Britain, has opened an office in Tokyo, and sees opportunities to build embryonic long-term disability markets in Europe and Asia. One particular target will be multinational corporations that will want to buy benefits from one company for operations in many nations across Europe.
The company says its data base will also help a major expansion into long-term care insurance, a product that demographers say has great promise as baby boomers face old age. Although it is still unclear how well the insurance industry can estimate the proper premium to cover the cost of long-term disabilities decades from now, UNUM says its experience in predicting illnesses will give it an advantage.
The company began selling long-term care policies in retirement communities in 1987. From the data gathered from elderly customers there, says David Hughes, senior vice president for long-term care, UNUM is finding the risk predictable, insurable and profitable. The company now has 10,000 long-term-care customers and hopes that the $15 million business will eventually match its group disability line, which earns more than $750 million in premiums annually. Although not profitable yet, executives say long-term-care insurance will help the company reach its goal of 18 percent return on equity by 1998.
"I wouldn't bet against that goal," said an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. "UNUM is a very well-positioned company."

HEADLINE: Russia's Gay Men Step Out of Soviet-Era Shadows

BYLINE: By JILL J. BARSHAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 9

 BODY:
After decades of enduring persecution and intimidation in the old Soviet Union, homosexuals in Russia are emerging into the open for the first time, even though they say they continue to feel mistreated and threatened by hostile public attitudes and by old laws that remain on the books.
Today, gay groups are officially registered and gay newspapers are published under municipal government laws. In addition, a handful of homosexuals organized a demonstration in front of the United States Embassy at the time of President Clinton's inauguration last month. 
 The few homosexual activists are largely ignored by the mainstream, however, and gay newspapers are only circulated privately.
There is also no organized movement among homosexuals or their supporters to demand that laws banning homosexuality be repealed, but a few officials say there is a chance that the laws can be quietly eliminated.
While hoping and in some cases pressing for legal changes, homosexual groups say that their problem is less with the law than with social attitudes and ignorance.
 
'Russian Walls Are Thin'
 "I'm more afraid that my friends and family will find out than the law," said a successful businessman who is 28 years old. "Your socio-economic stature can protect you from the authorities. It is unfair, but true, that most of the gays in prison are from the lower classes."
He lives alone in a comfortable, one-bedroom apartment. But even at home, he keeps up his guard, asking to speak quietly during an interview.
"Russian walls are very thin," he said. "If my neighbors knew I was gay, they would look at me differently and use it against me."
Under Article 121 of the criminal code, a holdover from the Soviet era, "sexual relations between men are punishable by prison terms of up to five years." Lesbian sexual relations are not mentioned and thus legal. The Government sentenced 10 people to prison for homosexual relations in the first half of 1992.
 
Quiet Pressure for Change
 Among those seeking to change the law are a few people in the Government, although they apparently have taken no overt action on the matter.
"Homosexuals are in a quasi-legal situation," said Sergei B. Romazin, head of judicial reform at the Justice Ministry. "My personal opinion is that we need to change this situation immediately. Article 121 should be repealed, except when rape is involved."
In the fall, a proposed new criminal code omitted the language on the "crime of homosexuality," but it is considered possible that it could be reinstated.
 
Ukraine Law Repealed
 The Ministry of Justice could not provide reliable statistics on the present number of prisoners convicted for homosexuality, but Mr. Romazin said he would "release those in prison immediately as soon as the law is changed."
There is some precedent for removing the legal ban on homosexuality. The Parliament in Ukraine, the most populous state outside Russia in the Soviet Union, decriminalized homosexuality last year.
However, in order to get the old law off the books, a new law was enacted that requires compulsory testing for exposure to the AIDS virus for prostitutes, drug addicts, foreigners, and other "high-risk" groups. Because homosexuals could be included, many say this new law allows some of the old sanctions to remain in effect.
 
Endemic Homophobia
 Homophobia is strong throughout Russia, especially in the provinces. A 31-year-old journalist at an independent newspaper in Kazan, Tatarstan, said that in his home province "very few people know I'm gay."
"Tatars are not Americans," he added. "They wouldn't understand.
Russian society has a long history of official discrimination. A 1964 Soviet sex manual instructs, for example: "With all the tricks at their disposal, homosexuals seek out and win the confidence of youngsters. Then they proceed to act. Do not under any circumstances allow them to touch you. Such people should be immediately reported to the administrative organs so that they can be removed from society."
During the Soviet period, the threat of Article 121 was employed by the K.G.B. to end careers, destroy reputations, or blackmail artists and writers into staying within the bounds of the party line.
Sergei Paradzhanov, one of the Soviet Union's greatest directors and a homosexual, was arrested under Article 121 in 1974 and sentenced to five years in a labor camp. Colleagues believed that he was really paying the price for his controversial films.
 
Inflexible Attitudes
 Attitudes have not changed much since. In a 1991 public opinion poll conducted in Chelyabinsk, an industrial city in the Urals, 30 percent of the respondents aged 16 to 30 years old felt that homosexuals should be "isolated from society," 5 percent felt they should be "liquidated," 60 percent had a "negative" attitude toward gay people and 5 percent labeled their sexual orientation "unfortunate."
One of the many abuses of the old regime was the "gay list." The police used to conduct "raids in places where gays met to do document checks," said Pavel Masalsky, a former prisoner convicted for homosexuality and no other crime.
From these checks, the Ministry of Internal Affairs compiled lists of suspected homosexuals. At trial, a name on this list was sufficient proof of guilt. Even today proof of actual sexual relations is not required.
Mr. Masalsky, 29, an electrical technician, was a victim of the "gay list" as well as what he said was the medical profession's ignorance. He was sentenced in 1984 to three years -- an average term -- after a friend betrayed him to the authorities.
 
'A Nightmare to Remember'
 After the arrest, he said, "I was first subjected to a physical during which the doctor concluded I was gay. The main evidence against me at the trial was the Ministry of Internal Affairs' 'gay list'. It's a nightmare to remember it all."
In the army, which until recently was obligatory for all young men, gay troops face consequences ranging from physical harassment by fellow recruits to court martial.
Public tolerance and visibility are improving, however, slowly undercutting the stigma of homosexuality. In the past, homosexuals were forced to hide out in underground clubs and public bath houses. The more adventurous would stroll about the well-known fountain in front of the Bolshoi Theater. Now there are more respectable places for gay men, particularly in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
 
A Moveable Disco
 An openly gay discotheque, financed by American gay businessmen, floats around Moscow every weekend. Sometimes it is moved across town at the last minute to avoid harassment from anti-gay thugs, known as "repairmen" in Russian slang.
Kevin Gardner, an American who is head of the Moscow chapter of the United States-based International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission, said that there are hundreds of gay organizations throughout Russia.
In Moscow, there are a half dozen officially registered gay publications such as Impulse and Risk, which cover topics from homosexual life abroad to AIDS issues. In St. Petersburg, the gay organizations Krylia (wings) and the Tchaikovsky Foundation (Tchaikovsky was homosexual) are registered with the city government. Even in Russia's industrial heartland in the Ural Mountains, an organization called Rights of Sexual Minorities has existed for years.
"These groups don't have an organized political agenda," said Mr. Gardner. "A few activists have made appeals to repeal Article 121, but many are afraid to come out politically until Article 121 is repealed." Many gay organizations, trying to circumvent the legal prohibition, publicly emphasize AIDS awareness over gay rights as a more acceptable agenda.
Homosexuals say they fear that attitudes in Russia are so deeply ingrained that they will probably never enjoy the freedoms found in the United States. One of the Russian businessmen interviewed, for example, dreams of creating a male family with an adopted child but acknowledges that it could probably never happen.
"The law would forbid the adoption and society is not ready to accept a permanent gay relationship," he said. "There is no gay district in Moscow where gays can openly live like Castro Street in San Francisco. Even if the law were repealed, my life wouldn't really change for the better."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S TOWN MEETING;
CLINTON LAYS BASE FOR NEW SACRIFICE TO BOOST ECONOMY

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Laying the groundwork for the economic proposals he will offer next week, President Clinton returned last night to the talk-show format he used during the fall campaign and tried to prepare the nation for higher taxes and painful budget cuts.
Mr. Clinton sought to use the televised "town meeting" broadcast from Southfield in suburban Detroit to persuade Americans that he was not being diverted by the issues that dominated the first two weeks of his Administration: whether to allow homosexuals in the military and the ill-fated search for an Attorney General. Instead, he emphasized that he was working on almost nothing but the economic plan he will introduce Wednesday. 
 Mr. Clinton vowed that the overall package would be "fair to all Americans." But in reply to a woman who tartly reminded him that she had voted for him in part because he said he would reduce taxes on middle-class people like her, Mr. Clinton said, "I wish I could promise you I won't ask you to pay any more."
 
Spreading the Pain
 But he did not do that. "I cannot tell you that I won't ask you to make any contribution to the changes we have to make," Mr. Clinton added. [Excerpts, page A26.]
The President vowed to try to ease the pain, though, by making clear that he would spread it around, announcing for the first time that he would seek to raise the tax rate on corporate incomes. The rate is now 34 percent, and officials have suggested that Mr. Clinton might want to increase it to 36 percent.
At the opening of the one-hour show, broadcast over Cable News Network and C-Span and on 17 local channels around the country, Mr. Clinton said he could already see "after only three weeks how easy it is to get out of touch, to get caught up in the trappings of Washington."
 
Variety of Tough Questions
 He promised he was "going to try to stay in touch with you this whole four years so you can tell me what you think."
And the audience in Southfield, along with satellite-linked groups in Atlanta, Miami and Seattle, did. If Mr. Clinton thought that by venturing out of Washington into the heartland he would be able to stick to economy and health care, he was wrong.
He was peppered with tough questions on the very subjects he has sought to avoid from reporters in Washington: homosexuals in the military, broken campaign promises, American policy in the Balkans and the reversal of his position on Haitian emigres. In addition there were very local questions, like what to do about hurricane-damaged Homestead Air Force Base in Florida, aircraft-plant layoffs in Washington State and tainted hamburger meat.
But the President fielded each question with the same sort of flowing, cogent answers that he achieved in similar events during the campaign. It was, all in all, trademark Clinton style: switching seamlessly from technocratic policy explanations to folksy homilies to make his points. Health-insurance regulations, he said, "were a blizzard of rules that could choke a horse."
Prowling the television soundstage with a cordless microphone, Mr. Clinton treated each exchange as if it were the sort of impromptu, intimate conversation that two friends might have over a kitchen table.
Later in the evening, Vice President Al Gore had his own question-and-answer session at a high school auditorium in Ontario, Calif., where he told the audience of 300 people and cable television viewers that the Administration was preparing to take strong measures to get the economy moving.
Referring to Congressional Republicans, he said, "they don't want any economic stimulus program because they think everything is just great as it is. Well, you know what, ladies and gentlemen, they haven't been to California lately."
Praising the decision to cut White House perks and staffing, Mr. Gore noted that a once-exclusive dining hall had been converted to a cafeteria for all workers. "Our new Secretary of Labor said he had already gotten some great ideas from people in the cafeteria line," he said.
 
Emphasis on the Economy
 In Mr. Clinton's forum, the questioners seemed to be right on top of the news, with one woman even asking the President in a particularly pointed manner how he could justify announcing a peace initiative for Bosnia yesterday that in effect amounted to negotiating with "war criminals."
Everytime he could, Mr. Clinton made the economy his subject of choice, and he also took the opportunity to fashion his expected defense for a retreat from the campaign assurances that he would not add to the financial burdens of the middle class.
"There's been some bad news," he said in his opening statement. "With all these economic improvements, we aren't generating new jobs, and the deficit of this country is about $50 billion a year bigger than I was told it was going to be before the election.
"So we have to put together a plan that keeps my commitment to you, invests in you and your jobs, in your education, your health care, your future, that brings that debt down, that deals with the health-care crisis, and that does it in a way that's fair to all Americans."
Seeking to put as much pressure on Congress as he can before introducing his proposals for higher taxes, lower spending and job growth, the President urged listeners to "tell your Senators and Congressmen whether I am right or wrong" after they hear his ideas on Wednesday in a speech to a joint session of Congress.
Despite some appearances to the contrary, Mr. Clinton said, he has been working "almost exclusively" on his economic program since his election.
White House officials said the stations screened potential audience members to make sure there was a balance of different questions and perspectives, but they insisted that none of the questions were screened. Questions were asked round-robin from city to city, with local newscasters serving as moderators.
 
Echoes of Perot
 The questions were as focused, and diverse, as any White House news conference. Some came from former Ross Perot volunteers or echoed Perot voters' concerns with the budget deficit and cleaning up Washington.
Mr. Clinton told a questioner who said she had been a campaign worker for Mr. Perot and wanted to know why the President did not support a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget: "It's basically a gimmick."
He added that to force the Government to eliminate the deficit quickly would cause unemployment to rise.
"The important thing is not to balance the budget overnight but put it on a steady path," Mr. Clinton said, citing the example of Japan, which he said managed to eliminate a budget deficit over 10 years.
"We have to do two things at once," he said. "We've got to increase investment in jobs and reduce the deficit."
 
Poignant, Personal Questions
 Some questions grew out of the experiences of members of the audience. A Haitian-American woman asked why Mr. Clinton was backtracking on his promise to allow more Haitian refugees into the country, and a young girl asked how the President could help her avoid the temptations of drug peddlers.
One of the more poignant moments came when Mr. Clinton was gently questioned about crime by a man whose son had been killed for a leather jacket. "I wish I knew how to have an immediate impact," the President replied.
He repeated his support for legislation in Congress that, he said, would put more police officers on the streets of urban areas and impose a waiting period for those seeking to buy handguns. Mr. Clinton described violence among the young as "maybe the biggest problem we've got today in terms of their future and the future of the cities."
A questioner from Seattle, Vicki Detwiler, related a double-dose of woe. She told of her 16-month-old son who is in a hospital's critical-care unit, one of the scores of people in the Northwest with food poisoning from a fast-food restaurant. Her husband, at her side, lost his job two days before their son was stricken, she said, and that deprived them of their health insurance.
What would Mr. Clinton do, Mrs. Detwiler asked, to insure "that no one else has to go through what we have gone through?"
The President, who earlier in the day had spoken with two sets of parents of other food-poisoning victims, noted that he had assigned his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, to devise a health-care plan in the next 100 days.
"If we don't do well on this, we'll never balance the budget or restore the health to the economy," he said. "It's a terrific human issue, but it's a big economic issue for America."
 
'Appalled' Over Gay Debate
 Mr. Clinton said he shared the frustration of many voters who felt it was a mistake for Washington to spend much of his first week in office debating whether homosexuals should be allowed in the military. He blamed Republican Senators for the attention given to the issue, saying they were trying to score partisan political points.
"I was frankly appalled that we spent so much time in the first week on that rather than getting the economy going again," he said. "I tried to put off the gays in the military issue for six months."
Mr. Clinton insisted that he personally "spent very little time on it."
Still, he seemed ready, even eager, to address the issue.
Arguing that homosexuals had always served in the military, he said the only real issue was whether they should be free to state their sexual orientation openly. "Your Government spent $500 million to get rid of 16,300 homosexuals in the military," he said. "The issue is, should you be able to say what you are and not get kicked out?"
The President also had to defend his handling of the search for an Attorney General. He said that his last candidate to withdraw, Judge Kimba M. Wood, did not withdraw because she had done anything illegal but because "she knew the person providing the child care was doing something illegal."
Mr. Clinton said the issue was ultimately whether an Attorney General, who oversees the Immigration and Naturalization Service, should meet a higher standard.
 
Question on the Balkans
 Questioners did not ignore foreign policy. Mr. Clinton was quizzed, for example, on his Balkans policy, which was announced earlier in the day. He defended the plan to get involved in negotiations over the republics of the former Yugoslavia and to pledge American forces to help enforce a peace settlement. But the President assured listeners that he would commit American troops only as peacekeepers after a settlement there.
"We are not committing today to make war," he said.
Mr. Clinton said the United States' experience in the war in the Persian Gulf underscored the wisdom of working closely with the United Nations in such situations. He also argued that the United States simply had a moral obligation to become involved in Bosnia, saying that in the absence of such involvement, "the terrible principle of ethnic cleansing will be validated."
The President demonstrated his political deftness when a Miami-area resident opposed to the closing of Homestead Air Force Base asked about the base's fate. Mr. Clinton made no promises, saying he would go along with a commission that makes recommendations on closing bases.
But he called the Homestead base "an invaluable asset" and promised to find a nonmilitary use for it if it was closed.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S TOWN MEETING;
With a Cue From Larry, Phil and Franklin D.

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Presidents since Andrew Jackson have used whatever means they had to go over the heads of journalists and other intermediaries to speak directly to "the people," especially when beleaguered.
Bill Clinton did so to good effect during his campaign last year, and tonight he demonstrated his skills again in an electronic town meeting that owed much to Ross Perot, Larry King, Phil Donahue and the latest satellite technology. 
 He got more questions on subjects he would rather have avoided -- Haiti, Bosnia, homosexuals in the military and his difficulties in finding a successful candidate for Attorney General -- and fewer on subjects he wanted to emphasize -- jobs and the economy -- but he seemed thoroughly in command.
 
Themes of Campaign
 The President had to defend himself against an accusation that he was reneging on his promise not to raise taxes on the middle class, and he had to field a demand from Mr. Perot's campaign coordinator in Michigan that he back a balanced-budget amendment. But the exchanges sounded genuine, they showed him talking with voters, and they made for lively television.
Perhaps most important of all, Mr. Clinton found ample room to voice his concerns about sick people and people facing economic difficulties, echoing themes of 1992 that have been drowned out during the last few weeks.
Like Franklin D. Roosevelt's fireside chats during the New Deal and Lyndon B. Johnson's televised appeals during the Vietnam War, President Clinton's question-and-answer sessions are intended to build a constituency in the country at large for programs resisted by entrenched interests or a skeptical press corps in Washington.
Mr. Clinton mounted both direct and indirect attacks on the news media. He said that Kimba M. Wood, the Federal district judge from New York who withdrew her name from consideration for Attorney General, had been treated "quite unfairly," but blamed that largely on erroneous press reports suggesting that she was about to be nominated. Those reports were based in large part on disclosures from his own Administration.
He also deplored public attention to the homosexuality question, saying, "I spent very little time on the issue myself." It was he, nonetheless, who pledged in his campaign to do away with the military ban on gay men and lesbians and pressed forward on it in the first hours of his Presidency.
The President's appearance in a television studio in a Detroit suburb marked the start of a politically crucial effort to sell a package of tax increases and cuts in benefits to a nation notably resistant to sacrifice. Once again, as in 1992, Mr. Clinton beamed his message on unconventional channels.
 
Ducking a Question
 He said at the very end of the broadcast that he planned many such appearances, and he ducked a question about formal news conferences in the future. So far he has held none.
Journalists complain now, as they have before, that they are being circumvented. But in the long run Mr. Clinton is no more likely than his predecessors to completely avoid news conferences, with their more searching interrogation, and the professionals do not always ask the most revealing questions anyway.
Perhaps the question that most damaged George Bush last year, for example, was the one asked by a young woman in the audience during a debate in Richmond about the impact of the recession on his friends and acquaintances. The question put Mr. Bush on the defensive by making him look unfeeling in his reaction to economic privation. His response was the equivalent, in its way, of Michael S. Dukakis's seemingly passionless response to a newsman's question in 1988 about how he would react if his wife were raped and murdered.
Mr. Clinton, by exposing himself tonight to the questions of a carefully screened group of ordinary voters, apparently sought to turn the tables on those who have tormented him the most in recent days. The Administration made no secret of that; Jeff Eller, a White House spokesman, said members of the audience had been told, "The President would like to focus on jobs and the economy."
Angry callers to radio talk programs and to Capitol Hill offices have had a major impact on the opening phase of Mr. Clinton's Presidency, as have many commentators in Washington who have given him poor grades. Neither represents a true cross section of American opinion, as the White House argues with considerable force. Programs like tonight's give Mr. Clinton a forum that is considerably more deferential, if no more balanced.
As the President arrived in Detroit, he took a bit of poetic license. Glossing over all the other problems he has had to deal with in a jam-packed 21 days, he told the crowd that welcomed him that he had been "doing almost nothing but focusing on the economy."
 
On the Public's Mind
 The country will no doubt welcome a return to a discussion of the economy and jobs. Those were the issues that won the election for Mr. Clinton, and opinion surveys suggest that they remain the issues most on people's minds.
But all the electronic magic in the world counts for nothing if the public feels it is being cheated or deceived. Johnson's pleas to voters to support "your President" went for naught when television showed voters a war they judged unjust; Richard M. Nixon's insistence that he was not a crook paled against the evidence that his Administration was caught in a huge lie.
Mr. Clinton will have to convince people on the merits that the sacrifices he calls for are equitably distributed. It is a question of sharing the pain broadly among older citizens and young, between the rich and the middle class, between cities and suburbs and between various industrial sectors.
"Listen to what I say next week, decide whether it's fair," the President told a questioner tonight.
Having lost some of the populist momentum of his campaign in the appointment of wealthy lawyers to major positions and in the largely inadvertent early emphasis on social issues that won him little mass sympathy, Mr. Clinton is seeking to get it back. Cuts in White House staffing levels, increased taxes on the very rich and tonight's talk with the folks are intended to do that.
His supporters are hopeful that things are entering a new phase.
"I admit that I see eerie parallels to the Carter Administration," said a prominent Democrat who served in that Administration. "There have been too many mistakes. But the core of what Bill Clinton stood for in the campaign remains intact, and we will soon see whether he can deliver on it."

HEADLINE: Complexity of a Fiscal Giant: A Primer on Social Security

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Some are 65-year-old couples living on golf courses and celebrating their retirement with Caribbean cruises. Others are 90-year-old widows surviving on cans of soup.
But the nation's 41 million Social Security recipients are getting more from the system than they put in. And many have something to lose as the Clinton Administration's deficit-cutters struggle this week to find a politically palatable way to restrain the $303 billion program, perhaps the nation's most politically volatile. 
 Earlier this week, White House officials bowed to intense political pressure by saying they would not freeze the program's annual cost-of-living adjustments. A one-year freeze, advocated by Leon E. Panetta, the White House budget director, could have saved more than $41 billion over five years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But it would have inflicted its pain blindly, taking from the shivering widow and the well-off couple alike.
Despite its step back, the White House may still seek to restrain the system by raising the taxes on benefits. This would spare the poorest of the elderly because their incomes are too low to be taxed. But it is likely to encounter resistance from those generally opposed to tax increases and from groups of the affluent elderly, who are well organized and ready to resist.
 
Need vs. Greed
 Whatever changes Mr. Clinton and his lieutenants propose, they must be ready to engage a deeper Social Security debate, one about need versus greed.
More specifically, the proposals to rein in the program rest upon two surprisingly complex questions: How needy are the elderly? And how generous is the Social Security system?
The answers begin in a swirl of numbers and assumptions that are strongly contested by policy experts and little understood by the public.
The confusion is understandable. Social Security takes from the rich and gives to the poor. But it also takes from the poor and gives to the rich.
It is a pension plan designed to pay most to those who contribute most. But it is also a welfare program, meant to protect people most in need.
 
A Broad Constituency
 That Social Security benefits go to the rich, poor and everyone in between gives the program its political muscle, but it also makes the program difficult to characterize.
"Precisely because you've built this great heterogeneous coalition, you can't think precisely about who the beneficiaries are," said Christopher Jencks, a sociologist at Northwestern University. "Some are needy, some are greedy and some are on the edge."
No one doubts that the United States has waged a largely successful fight against the poverty of the elderly, thanks to increases in Social Security benefits. In 1959, 35 percent of the elderly lived in poverty, according to the Census Bureau. Today only 12 percent do, compared with 14.2 percent of the population as a whole.
The Government currently considers an elderly person poor if the annual income is less than $6,500.
And while the incomes of the elderly have risen, other Americans have fared less well. The poverty rate for children, for instance, has risen to 22 percent, a figure that makes them almost twice as likely to be poor as the elderly.
 
Arguments for Sacrifice
 Many analysts point to such disparities in arguing that it is time for the elderly to share some of the sacrifice that comes with deficit reduction.
"In some sense, Social Security is a victim of its own success," said Richard Burkhauser, an economist at Syracuse University. "It has dramatically improved the well-being of the elderly. And the question is, Is enough enough?"
But others say the declining poverty rate is misleading. While Social Security has saved many elderly people from poverty, the majority still have low to modest incomes.
Figures compiled by the House Ways and Means Committee show that 60 percent of the elderly have annual family incomes under $20,000, and 28 percent have incomes of under $10,000. By contrast, only 8 percent live in families with an annual income of $50,000 or more.
For those earning less than $10,000 a year, Social Security payments provide, on average, almost 75 percent of their income.
"The stereotype of the relatively poor elderly is much closer to reality than the stereotype of the greedy affluent," said Patricia Ruggles, an economist at the Urban Institute, a research group in Washington.
 
Bite of Medical Bills
 Individuals retiring in 1992 received a maximum monthly Social Security payment of $1,088, depending on their contributions to the system over the years. Those who earned the average of the minimum wage throughout a lifetime of full employment received $481 a month. Those who worked less, received less.
Like many economists, Ms. Ruggles argues that income alone answers only part of the question about how well the elderly are faring. Because of rising medical costs and restraints put on the Medicare program, many people have seen their expenses rise sharply in recent years.
The incomes of the elderly also tend to erode, unlike those of most younger Americans, who can expect to see their incomes grow. This, too, can make older Americans less willing to sacrifice in the name of deficit reduction. "The comfortable 65-year-old guy off playing golf can leave a starving widow at age 80," said Timothy Smeeding, also an economist at Syracuse.
That situation can arise, Mr. Smeeding said, because a retired couple is often forced to cash in some of its assets to pay medical bills, thereby reducing the amount of interest and dividends it will earn. In addition, most private pensions are not indexed to inflation, so their value typically erodes. And husbands on average die sooner than their wives, leaving widows with reduced Social Security benefits.
 
Reaping More Than Was Sowed
 While the well-being of America's elderly varies widely, one fact about their Social Security benefits is central to discussions of fairness: all groups of current retirees receive significantly more back from the system than they contributed to it, even when interest and employer contributions are included.
Actuaries know it, but many elderly people do not.
"Congressmen don't go up and down the country saying, 'You guys didn't earn your Social Security checks,' " said Mr. Jencks, the Northwestern sociologist.
Social Security is often called a regressive system because poor people pay a higher percentage of their incomes in Social Security taxes than rich people do. (Annual income above $57,600 is exempt from the 6.2 percent payroll tax.)
But the system is simultaneously progressive because the benefits are set up so that low-earners, upon retirement, get a relatively higher subsidy than high-earners do.
Consider, for instance, a man retiring in 1991, who has earned the equivalent of the minimum wage for his entire working life. Calculations by the House Ways and Means Committee estimate that, with an average life expectancy, he will receive 2.13 times as much in benefits as he and his employer contributed, even counting interest. On average, that will amount to a $38,000 subsidy.
By contrast, the worker who has paid in the highest amount during his working career will get a less-generous subsidy. That man, retiring in 1991, can expect to receive benefits that are only 1.27 times higher than what he and his employer contributed, with interest. He can expect to receive a $32,000 subsidy.
The figures are different for women, since they have a longer life expectancy. But the principle remains the same: those with the lowest contributions get disproportionately more from the system.
 
Decreasing Generosity
 That principle is often cited by the defenders of the system, who argue that Social Security helps take care of the neediest.
But the system is fast becoming less generous for everyone. The Congressional Research Service estimates that by 2030 it will take an average retiree 18 years to get back the equivalent of what he and his employer paid in, with interest. In 1980, that figure was only 2.8 years.
And the research service estimates that under current rules the most affluent young workers, who pay the most taxes, will never receive the equivalent of their contributions.
So, where in this complex program can deficit-cutters find savings?
The likeliest option is a tax increase on benefits. At present, half of the Social Security benefits to individuals with annual incomes of more than $25,000 (or couples with incomes above $32,000) are taxed. By taxing 85 percent of those benefits -- which is the amount taxed on most private pensions -- the Government could raise about $29 billion over five years, the Congressional Budget Office estimated.
While that would spare the neediest of the elderly, political opposition is still likely to be fierce.
"Nobody's proposing to tax the people who are really struggling," Mr. Jencks said. "But people may think, 'Well, they'll start with them but soon they'll be taxing me, too.' "

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S TOWN MEETING;
Excerpts From Clinton's Question-and-Answer Session on TV

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a televised question-and-answer session with President Clinton in Southfield, Mich., and studio audiences there and in three other cities, as transcribed by The New York Times:
 
CLINTON. Let me first of all thank all of you for being here in Michigan, and thank our audiences in Washington and Georgia and Florida for joining us, and all the people across this country who are watching this event. I started doing these televised town meetings a year ago in New Hampshire. Between June and November I did nine that were televised alone, including one here at this station. And I wanted to come out of the White House three weeks to the day after I became President because I can see now after only three weeks how easy it is for a President to get out of touch, to be caught up in the trappings of Washington and basically to be told by people that nothing needs to be changed, or you can't change things. 
 Let me just briefly say I want to take as much time as possible for questions, but I want to say one or two things real quickly. I believe I got elected on a commitment to change America, to create jobs, try to raise incomes, to face the health-care crisis, to try to liberate the Government from special interests and turn it back to the people; and to try to reduce the deficit and put America on a path to long-term health and recovery, bringing the American people together.
There's been some good news and bad news since I won the election. The good news is that the productivity of American firms is up, people are buying houses because interest rates are down, consumer confidence is up since the election -- I like that. People think things are going to be better. There's been some bad news. With all these economic improvements we aren't generating new jobs, and the deficit of this country is about $50 billion a year bigger than I was told it was going to be before the election.
So we have to put together a plan that keeps my commitments to you: invest in you and your jobs, in your education and your health care and your future -- that brings that debt down, that deals with the health-care crisis, and that does it in a way that's fair to all Americans.
I've got another week. I've been working almost exclusively on the economic issues of the country since I became President. I've got another week to put it together and I wanted to come up here tonight and just listen to your questions, answer them as candidly as I could, and share with you as much as I can my feelings about where we're going to go. But I'll say this, all the hundreds of thousands and maybe a million miles that I've traveled, I never saw one person along the highway with a sign that said: "Things are just fine the way they are. Don't change anything."
So I'm going to keep trying to change, and I'm going to try to stay in touch with you this whole four years, so that you can honestly tell me what you think. I'm really proud of the fact the voter turnout was not only up, we not only had the biggest crowd for the inauguration in history, but the mail and the phone calls to the White House are running at record levels -- some good, some critical -- but that's good, that's democracy. And it proves that people really feel, at least so far, that I'm going to listen and try to move forward. And that's what we're here to do tonight.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
The Deficit
 
Q. The American people, Mr. President, feel that Congress does not have the political will to balance the budget. If this is true and, as you say, if the economy is your priority, will you support a strong balanced budget amendment, one that is not watered down? And with us send a signal to Congress that we need them to face the issue. And when can we expect Washington to start to solve this enormous problem of ours?
 
CLINTON I think you can. First of all, I'm not for any version of the balanced budget amendment that I have seen, because I think it is basically again a kind of way of putting the decision off that would give us five years to deal with it.
Secondly, if we balanced the budget tomorrow, we'd drive unemployment up because it would require such terrible sacrifices. We need to do -- I hate to say this again, but did you look at what the Japanese did? They had a huge deficit in the 1970's. About as big, even a little bigger than ours is now. And they brought it down over about a 10-year period until, in 1990, they were the only major industrial country with a balanced budget. And one reason they had low unemployment and high growth.
So what I -- let me just tell you what I'm doing to do, and I wouldn't rule out other measures later. I'm going to try to get the Congress to pass the modified line-item veto bill that the House passed last time and the Senate didn't. I strongly support it.
I'm going to try to pass a strong campaign finance reform law and a lobbying reform law to free the Congress of undue influence of special interests.
I'm going to ask them to cut spending dramatically a broad range of areas. And to raise some more money. To try to bring this deficit down in a dramatic way that will send a signal that we're going -- that we're in control of our own house again and we're going to lower interest rates as a result of it and get this economy going again.
I think that's what we want. The important thing is not to balance the budget overnight, but to put it on a steady and decided downward tack. If we don't do it, a lot of -- let me just say there's no virtue in any of this unless it helps you. Let me just answer that -- a lot of people say to me, Why do you want to balance the budget; it's no fun cutting spending or raising more money to balance the budget or reduce the deficit. If you reduce the deficit, the United States doesn't borrow so much money. We have more of your tax money to spend on the education of your children or on developing new jobs or on health care. We keep interest rates down, and it's easier for you to borrow money in the private sector, so you create more jobs.
If the deficit gets bigger and bigger and bigger every year it weakens the economy. So, we have to do two things at once that no government in your country's history has ever done. We've go to increase investment in jobs and reduce the deficit.
And we're going to do it. And I think we can start next week. Look at my plan, see how you like it and see if the Congress responds. I predict to you that they will respond in a bipartisan fashion and reduce the debt for the first time in a long time.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Family Leave
 
Q. Why did you choose to tackle the gays in the military and the family leave bill first versus getting right to the economy and the Federal deficit?
 
CLINTON I didn't. I did choose the family leave bill first. Let me answer the questions separately. I chose to deal with the family leave bill because I knew there was a majority support in both houses for it and because I thought it was a pro-family bill. I thought it was a bill that would be helpful to strengthen the American family, with so many people forcibly in the work force. It contained an exemption for small business. It had been passed twice by the Congress before and vetoed. I thought it would help families and illustrate we had ended gridlock. I didn't choose to -- I tried to put off the gays in the military issue for six months. Senators in the other party wanted it dealt with now. They saw it as a way to delay family leave and to throw the whole Federal Government into debating that. I actually spent very little time on the issue myself. I met with the Joint Chiefs on a number of issues including that. And met with the Senate Democrats on the Armed Services committee. But I was frankly appalled that we spent so much time the first week talking about that instead of how to get the economy going again. It wasn't my idea. My agreement with the Joint Chiefs was to study the issue for six months so we could focus immediately on the economy. Thank goodness that's what we're now doing.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
The Middle Class
 
Q. Right. I'm concerned about your campaign promise to not raise the taxes for the middle class and how you intend to keep that promise.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
CLINTON Well, first of all, I did put out a plan which didn't contain a middle-class tax increase but I also repeatedly said, and I said in the debates in front of 100 million people, I refuse to say "Read my lips," that's not responsible. Now what's happened since the election? We have been told since the election that the Federal debt every year is going to be $50 billion bigger than we were told it was before the election. Now, I wish I could promise you that I won't ask you to pay any more, but I can tell you this: Look what I'm doing. I'm doing my best to keep my campaign commitments. I have first of all started by cutting the Government. I cut the White House staff by 25 percent yesterday. I bet that's never happened in the lifetime of anybody in this audience and it's real cuts. Today I announced $9 billion in cuts in the central Administration of the Federal Government -- $9 billion.
I have also said that before I ask the middle class to pay I'm going to ask the wealthiest Americans and companies, who made money in the 80's and had their taxes cut, to pay their fair share and I'm going to cut more Government spending. But I cannot tell you that I won't ask you to make any contribution to the changes we have to make. We have got to do two things at the same time: We've got to bring the debt down for the reasons that the first questioner so clearly articulated. And secondly, we've got to invest more in creating new jobs, in educating people and providing health care for all Americans and controlling costs. I'm doing my best to do that in the way that is fairest to middle-class America, but I have to be honest with you. The debt is $50 billion a year bigger than we were told it was before the election. I'm doing my best.
I have done nothing almost for three weeks but wrestle with this budget, try to cut costs and find ways to finance what we have to do, but we've got to change what we're doing. Let me say, I do have an alternative. I can play the same kind of games with you that have been played for the last 10 or 12 years, and this is not a partisan comment. This happened out of Washington. I could give you a bunch of smoke and mirrors and pretend the deficit's not there and then three or four years from now we'd be spending 20 cents of every tax dollar paying off the debt and it's not right. So, I'm going to do the best I can. Listen to what I say next week. Decide whether you think it's fair and tell me and your senators and congressmen whether you think I'm right or wrong.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Jobs in Aerospace
 
Q. My question is: How can America meet the challenge of maintaining our leadership in the very important aerospace industry?
 
CLINTON The answer, I think, is twofold. First, a lot of those aerospace workers who lost their jobs, lost their jobs because of cutbacks in defense which had to come at the end of the cold war. That is, we couldn't keep spending so much more than all of our competitors in these high-wage countries on defense without paying an economic price for it. But we couldn't -- we shouldn't have cut defense as much as we did in terms of high-tech, high-wage employment without a plan to reinvest in other industries and other technologies to put those people to work. So the first thing we have to do is to invest more in converting these high-wage jobs to other technologies. The second thing we need to do, frankly, is to take a serious look at the aerospace industry itself.
The Congress passed a bill last year that was never enacted, that we're now trying to get up and going. Where I will appoint someone and they will appoint some people to a commission to focus on how to rebuild the aviation industry in our country in two ways. No. 1, people who work for Boeing, McDonnell-Douglas and other subsidiary companies -- how can we get more jobs in making these planes and selling them at home and around the world. And No. 2, how can we do something about the commercial airlines themselves to avoid further bankruptcies and massive layoffs like -- we've got a Florida station here with us tonight. Miami has been devastated by layoffs at Eastern and Pan Am. So we're going to work on that.
And I assure you that I'm going to have a strategy to try to invest in commercial aviation. And we're also going to either have to -- we're going to -- either the Europeans are going to have to quit subsidizing Airbus and trying to deny us access to those contracts -- which is something else that's going on now -- or we're going to have to meet the competition. I am not going to roll over and play dead. Seven -- seven technologies are going to shape the high-wage jobs of the future. And one of the biggest is commercial aviation. The United States has a lead there. We are losing it because we have not fought to maintain it. And I assure you as soon as I get this budget and this investment plan, this jobs program, sent up to the Congress, we're going to start working on defense conversion and aerospace.

Homosexual Troops
 
Q. Having served in the United States Navy for five years aboard a guided missile destroyer, and also doing isolated duty in Alaska, and as a Christian and having the opportunity to minister to a number of men in the Navy, I believe it would just add continued undo pressure on a situation that is already pressure-packed to begin with. And I want to know why do you want to lift the ban and what impact do you see the ban having on the military?

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
CLINTON Let me tell you why I favor lifting it, very briefly. We have now, and everyone concedes we have always had, homosexual men and women in the military service. I received a letter from a retired officer, a woman, the other day who told me she left the service because she could not be honest about her sexual orientation, even though she was a distinguished officer with a remarkable service record -- one of many such letters I have received.
Your Government spent $500 million to get rid of about 16,300 homosexuals from the service in the 1980's. Now, here's my position. If there are homosexual men and women in the service anyway, if we know they have served with distinction and they have always been there, the issue is should you be able to say what you are and not be kicked out. This is not about conduct, this is about status. I believe there ought to be the strictest code of behavioral conduct applicable here. I also believe there ought to be an even stricter code applicable to sexual harassment, whether homosexual or heterosexual. The biggest sexual problem in the armed services, according to the men and women who talk to me, involves heterosexual harassment. I think there ought to be a tough code of conduct. If people do wrong, they ought to be gotten out.
But I think people should not be asked to lie if they're going to be allowed to serve. Because the question is not whether they should be there or not, they are there. So the narrow question of this debate is should you be able to stay and admit it.

Fighting in Bosnia
 
Q. How does one negotiate with war criminals without a clear enforcement to let them know that they have to stop with the atrocity? And how does one insure that the Serbs will not continue with their atrocities and that they will negotiate in a good faith and that they will lay down their arms? Will you ask NATO for their enforcement of the terms of agreement and give them the authority to use force in this case? And will you also help Croatia regain its sovereignty on the territories it's lost so that 700,000 people can return to their homes? Thank you.
 
CLINTON Thank you. I'm glad you asked the question in the way you did. I was afraid you were going to ask me why we agreed to get involved in this process today. Just for the benefit of the people who don't know as much about it as you, let me tell you what happened today. Today, the Secretary of State announced a new policy by our Government that we would agree to become more involved in what is going on in Bosnia, not in committing our ground troops now or anything like that, but in trying to get involved in these negotiations to protect the rights and the integrity of the Bosnians, the Croatians and others who have been basically subject to the assaults of the Serbs. That we would be in a position to say we're not going to enforce a peace agreement on the Croatians or the Bosnians that they don't believe in, but that if we can get an agreement then the United States would participate -- not alone, but with the United Nations and with Europe -- in guaranteeing that the agreement would protect the basic human rights of the people involved and the terms of the agreement.
Now people say, So, we are not committing today to make war in the former Yugoslavia. We are committing to try to help get a peace and then to enforce it. Why is that? Because if we don't, No. 1, the terrible principle of ethnic cleansing will be validated. That one ethnic group can butcher another if they're strong enough to do it at the end of the cold war. No. 2, that problem could spread to other republics and nations near there. Never forget it's no accident that World War I started in this area. There are ancient ethnic hatreds that have consumed people and led to horrible abuses. You know about it -- the rapes of the women, the murders of the children, all these things you have read about.
We've got to try to contain it and I think we have to be very stronger -- much stronger standing up to aggression. We've got to get the heavy weapons out of utilization, you implied that. We've got to toughen the embargo against the Serbs. We ought to open a United Nations war crimes inquiry and we ought to enforce that no-fly zone against Serbian aircraft strongly. Those are the things that I think we should do.

Tainted Meat
 
Q. Mr. President, actually, our child is at Children's Hospital in Seattle, but he is in intensive care and critical condition. And only two days prior to him going in there with e coli poisoning from tainted meat, my husband lost his job and we were lost without medical coverage. I'm Canadian originally and always took comfort in the medical system there, and in knowing that my children would be taken care of. My question to you now is, What are you prepared to in regards to the tainted meat problem? And is there any hope in the near future of seeing universal health care so that no one else has to go through what we've gone through?
 
CLINTONLet me first of all say I thank you for being on the program and I hope your child will be well. I did call two other sets of parents who were in the hospital with their children on the way out here, just to inquire about that and to get their ideas about what we should do. Let me answer your second question first. As I'm sure you know, I've asked my wife to head a task force to come up with a bill within 100 which will bring a new system of health care to America, which offers us the chance to provide basic health coverage to everybody, to stop people from losing their health coverage when they lose a job, to stop people from their inability to change jobs because they've had someone in their family sick, and to bring the cost of health care in line with inflation.
I think we can do that, and if we don't do it, we'll never balance the budget and we'll never restore health to this economy. Fifty percent of the projected deficit growth between now and the year 2000 is all in health-care costs. So it's a hard -- it's a terrific human issue but it's a big economic issue for America. And the answer to your question is, within 100 of my becoming President, we're going to have a bill to the Congress to do just what you said.
Now the second thing, this e coli thing, have you all been following it up in Washington? It's a -- I asked the Secretary of Agriculture, Mike Espy, who is responsible for the regulation of the slaughter houses and the meat before it comes to a restaurant, to go up there and look into the situation. And we think there are two things that have to be done. First of all, we've got to make it clear to people who are providing fast food that they've got to do everything they can to comply with our cooking regulations. Some of those viruses would have clearly died had the heat been observed.
On the other hand, we've got to find ways to do more inspections and to try to do them in a more effective way. And so we are reviewing now the possibility of not only hiring more inspectors, which I've already agreed to do, but secondly, seeing if there is some way we can do a better job of actually inspecting the meat, empowering the inspectors to do some more things. We have got to do that and I can tell you, if you have any other ideas I'd like to have them. The parents, it struck me, that I talked to today, had actually some quite good ideas that we're going to pursue. And I want to invite you and any others who are listening, who have other ideas, to let me know. You can look forward to more inspectors, and we're looking for ways to inspect better, as well.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Child Care
 
Q. That's what I want to know. Obviously going to be a working mother I'm very concerned about the child-care crisis, which has been finally been thrown into the spotlight with Nannygate. And I would like to know what your first thing is that you're going to do to address the child-care issue to make it affordable and reasonable.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
CLINTON Is your biggest concern the cost of child care, or the availability of quality care?
 
Q. The quality of the care. The quality of what I can get for the affordability of what I can get. If it's even worth it to go back with what we have available.
And what about working mothers who don't have any choice about going back to work? Where can they take their children and have it be affordable and quality care where they're sure their children are safe and getting good care.
 
CLINTON Well, I think there are two or three things we can do that we're working on now. The first is, to work in partnerships with states to help them to develop high standards for child care, but also quality care at affordable prices. And one of the things that we did in my state when I was Governor is to spend a good deal of our training money, for example, training people who were on welfare but who were quite intelligent and capable for taking care of their own children, to work in child-care facilities. And moving them from welfare to work in ways that took maximum advantage of money the taxpayers were spending already and lowered the cost of child care. And we often put these -- these child-care facilities in and around job-training facilities to help working mothers and working parents that were going back to school. Sometimes they were going to school and working at the same time. I think we can do that.
The second thing we can do is to increase the earned income tax credit, for working Americans and especially middle- to lower-middle-income working Americans so that they will have more disposable income to pay their child-care expenses.
The third thing we can do is simply to increase the child-care credit itself. We basically have got to make the economics of this work. And I think there are lots of other things that can be done, but they won't affect the population as a whole. The population as a whole needs to be helped by making sure you've got a steady stream of trained quality child-care workers and then more income for middle-class people, either through the child-care tax credit, or through the general earned-income tax credit, which basically says if you work 40 hours a week and you've got kids in the house, you shouldn't be put into poverty because of your other expenses including child care. The government ought to reduce your tax burden, if necessary, even give you money back as long as you're working hard and playing by the rules and you need to take care of your kids.

HEADLINE: Japan Official Plans No Initiatives in U.S. Visit

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Japan's Foreign Minister, preparing for what could be an uneasy first encounter with the Clinton Administration, says that economic disputes "cannot be allowed to destroy Japan-United States relations" but that he had no major new initiatives to defuse tensions over trade.
In an interview Tuesday evening, Michio Watanabe, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, acknowledged that balooning trade surpluses and American calls for a tougher trade policy were creating a turbulent atmosphere for his meetings this week in Washington with President Clinton and top Administration officials. 
 Mr. Watanabe's statement that he would be offering no major new initiatives came in spite of advice from the United States Ambassador, Michael H. Armacost, that he bring something with him to defuse tensions that have deepened in recent weeks.
Mr. Watanabe's mission comes at a moment of extraordinary nervousness within the Japanese Government about the country's biggest single alliance. Though President Clinton has said little about trade policy, Japanese officials openly worry that his stress on "economic security" is leading to potential confrontations.
Mr. Watanabe said, though, that "we are not in any way afraid of Mr. Clinton."
A senior American official suggested that the main purpose of the trip -- during which Mr. Watanabe will meet President Clinton, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and several others -- "is really an effort to find out how upset Washington is with the trade deficit."
If the Administration is viewed as disorganized on its trade goals, many here suggest, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party may determine it has more time before it has to make politically unpopular moves here to open markets further or force companies to purchase more imported goods.
During his interview, Mr. Watanabe suggested that he would argue in Washington that Japan's soaring trade surpluses -- roughly $44 billion last year with the United States, and $136 billion with the world -- were a statistical aberration, not a reversal of Japan's commitments to change its ways.
 
Rising Value of Exports
 "Japanese companies do not feel like they are exporting more," he said, referring to the skyrocketing value of Japanese exports.
But American officials say that if Mr. Watanabe attempts to explain away the trade numbers in Washington, it would almost certainly backfire, especially since the Administration seems eager to to stand up to Tokyo.
Japan is also expected to argue that it is taking at least some steps to stimulate its economy, in the process increasing Japan's demand for imports. To this end, the Bank of Japan last week announced that it was lowering the official discount rate from 3.25 percent to 2.5 percent.
Mr. Watanabe attributed the trade imbalance to the rise in the value of the yen against the dollar, which makes Japanese goods more expensive overseas and makes exports seem to grow in value. He also said that the value of exports has risen because Japanese makers are selling higher quality and more expensive products, like the Toyota Lexus, not more products.
Usually, a mission like Mr. Watanabe's would attract little attention in Tokyo. But Japanese officials have gone to extraordinary lengths to cast the visit as the first step to define a new relationship with the United States, before the Clinton Administration rules on a string of economic disputes.
 
Withdrawal of Trade Complaint
 The atmosphere may have improved even before Mr. Watanabe's arrival in Washington as a result of an announcement by the three major American automobile manufacturers that they would not file complaints of unfair trade against Japanese auto makers, as they previously said they would.
Aides to Mr. Watanabe described the action as welcome but not likely to have much impact in light of the many other disputes on the agenda.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
Christopher's Remarks on Balkans: 'Crucial Test'

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Secretary of State Warren Christopher's news conference today:
 
OPENING STATEMENT 
 Today I'm announcing a series of steps that President Clinton has decided to take with regard to the former Yugoslavia. The President believes that it's time for the United States to become actively and directly engaged in the multilateral effort to reach a just and workable solution to this very dangerous conflict.

 	 	 		. . .	 	There is also a broader imperative here. The world's response to the violence in the former Yugoslavia is an early and crucial test of how it will address the concerns of the ethnic and religious minorities in the post-cold-war period.
First, the President decided the United States will actively engage in the Vance-Owen negotiations bringing the full weight of American diplomacy to bear. We know these negotiations will not be easy. We know the options have narrowed because of past inaction. We do not expect miracles, but we believe we can make a difference. We strongly support the efforts of the United Nations and the European Community through the Vance-Owen negotiations to arrive at an agreement that would bring peace to Bosnia.
Now, in order to insure the most effective possible communication between us, President Clinton has today named one of our top diplomats to be our Government's envoy to these talks. Ambassador Reginald Bartholomew will be that envoy.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Second, the President is communicating to the Bosnians, Serbs, and Croatians that the only way to end this conflict is through negotiation. No settlement can be imposed upon the parties both on grounds of principle and on grounds that an imposed settlement would be far more difficult to sustain than one that the parties have voluntarily reached. At the same time, we believe that each party must be prepared to accept a resolution that falls short of its greatest goals.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Third, the President will take actions to tighten the enforcement of economic sanctions, increase political pressure on Serbia and deter Serbia from widening the war. We've informed the Serbians that we plan to raise the economic and political price for aggression. We will work with our allies, the Russians and others, to achieve that result.
We remain prepared to respond against the Serbians in the event of a conflict in Kosovo caused by Serbian action, and, in addition, we will work to strengthen the international presence in Macedonia.
Fourth, the President is taking steps to reduce the suffering and bloodshed as the negotiations proceed. He's calling on all parties to stop the shelling and other violence. He has communicated to all concerned that the no-fly zone over Bosnia should be enforced under the U.N. resolution. He has urged that humanitarian aid be allowed to flow to those in need. And we are considering further actions to promote greater delivery of this aid.
Moreover, we're putting together a U.S. Government team to assess the humanitarian needs as they exist at the present time, and on an urgent basis. The President is also seeking the creation of a war crimes tribunal at the United Nations to bring justice and to deter further atrocities.
Fifth, the President has taken steps to make clear to all concerned that the United States is prepared to do its share to help implement and enforce an agreement that is acceptable to all parties.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Sixth, and finally, the President has consulted widely with our friends and allies on these actions.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. Mr. Secretary, could you please tell us, was there any sentiment in the review toward assisting the Bosnians more directly with weapons? Or even using American air power to silence those Serbian mortars, which President Clinton seemed to be suggesting he might do when he campaigned last August and a lot of world leaders have asked the United States to do.
A. On the first half of your question, we did consider carefully providing weapons to the Bosnians. In the end we concluded not to do that. In consultation with our allies it became clear that those countries that have troops on the ground there, France, the United Kingdom and Canada, felt that their troops would be gravely endangered if we lifted the embargo on weapons to the Bosnians.
We think it's important that those troops stay there. We felt they would not stay there if we lifted the embargo, and on balance we thought it was a step that would be unwise to take.
With respect to the use of air power directly, similar considerations were involved. This situation has evolved a good deal. I must say it has gotten worse. It is less simple. Our options are less good than they were at the time the President spoke when he identified in August the need to take more aggressive action on this subject.
So although those two steps were considered, we concluded that they would not be constructive steps to the resolution of this problem and we should pursue the steps that I've outlined in my statement.
Q. Can you explain two different aspects? You said that in an effort to try to get more humanitarian aid in, number one, that you would work for enforcement of the no-fly zone. First, does that mean you are going to seek that on an urgent basis at the U.N.?
And secondly, you said aid should be allowed to flow more freely. As you know, the U.N. has already said that it is -- all necessary means could be used to get that aid in. Are you talking about shooting your way in to get the aid to people who need it? What are you talking about?
A. On both subjects we're considering how we might best achieve that with respect to getting the aid in . . . , and we're also consulting with our allies on that point.
The statement speaks for itself. But it certainly does leave the implementation for further discussion. In particular I would say for consultation with our allies. We are quite reluctant to move into this situation and take steps without a full opportunity to consult with them to determine whether or not they feel the steps that might be taken would be useful.
But we have not ruled out quite determined steps that might be taken to make sure that the aid gets to those in the country who are starving and need medicine.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Mr. Secretary, you indicated in the past that you were unhappy with some aspects of the Vance-Owen plan. Is Mr. Bartholomew, Ambassador Bartholomew, going to arrive in New York with a U.S. map of Bosnia and how it should look? Do you have specific ideas? can you be a little more specific about what you're looking for that will make this a more equitable settlement?
A. My unhappiness with the Vance-Owen plan, if one is to call it that, in the past has been that the parties were not in agreement and there appeared to be an effort to impose it on the parties. And, as I said in the course of my statement, I think the likelihood of sustaining an agreement where the parties are not in agreement -- or sustaining a plan where the parties are not in agreement -- is much less than it would be if they were in agreement. We will not arrive with a map. We're going to be in the role of sponsors, using our good offices. We have no prescribed solution. The solution is mainly up to the parties. But we think with the full weight of diplomacy and in the background of U.S. power that we can be helpful to the parties in coming to an agreement.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Campaign '93: A Different Trail but a Familiar Format

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOUTHFIELD, Mich., Feb. 10

 BODY:
When President Clinton stepped onto the spare, blue soundstage at station WXYZ-TV here, the carefully screened audience, billed as a group of skeptical questioners, burst into giddy applause.
The President's reception in this Detroit suburb was better than any he had received in the campaign, during which he first grew fond of the question-and-answer "town meeting" format he used tonight on his first trip outside Washington since his inauguration three weeks ago. 
 Once the meeting began, Mr. Clinton warmed quickly to the task he likes best -- campaigning. There was scant material difference between the appearance of Bill Clinton the President and Bill Clinton the Presidential candidate, who appeared in nine such forums from June to November last year.
 
Protected From Reporters
 The Detroit audience, one of four assembled in studios around the country, was bused to the television studio in advance of the program, allowing them to be protected from the questions of hundreds of reporters gathered here. Station officials guided them immediately into the studio and allowed them to grant advance interviews only to the local television affiliate.
After the meeting several in the audience gave Mr. Clinton good reviews. "It's an impossible job," said James G. Littles, a college professor. "All he has to do is try."
Harry W. Weaver 2d, a high school coach, said, "Whether it was a publicity stunt or not, he tried to use it to show he can connect with people, to have our input."
On a small but symbolic point, WXYZ won the battle over the sort of stool Mr. Clinton would sit on. The black lacquered chair with the green upholstered seat looked like a kitchen highchair, but Mr. Clinton largely ignored it, instead pacing along the edge of the raised stage.
Mr. Clinton's arrival here was as carefully choreographed as the most elaborate White House political event. An outside political adviser, Paul Begala, a familiar figure from the campaign, accompanied the President, and he used an airport speech to rally his supporters around the notion of shared sacrifice.
 
Greeted at an Air Base
 In brief remarks to about 200 people who greeted him on his arrival at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in nearby Detroit, Mr. Clinton said he had been "doing almost nothing but focusing on this economy" since he took office, and had come to Michigan for his first post-inaugural trip because he had seen "everything about America writ large here in this state," including economic troubles and racial tensions.
"But remember," he continued, "everywhere I went in this election I said, 'Do not vote for me if you're going to quit on Election Day. Do not come to the inaugural and celebrate the victory unless you're going to help us make the victory good.' "
The trip today on Air Force One was the President's first. Wearing a blue poplin jacket that bore the Presidential seal and his embroidered name, Mr. Clinton took a tour of the specially outfitted Boeing 747 during the flight.
"He didn't miss Air Elvis," said Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, referring to the charter jet that Mr. Clinton used in his campaign for the Presidency.

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
'Plan B' Is Really 'Plan A'

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb 10

 BODY:
For the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow is moving into the center of the diplomatic arena as a result of President Clinton's conclusion that Russia can exert significant influence, for better or worse, over the fate of the United States plan to end the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
By making clear today that it wants to involve President Boris N. Yeltsin in the search for a Balkan settlement, the Clinton Administration appears to be seeking both to persuade Moscow to pressure the Serbs to compromise and to insure that Russia does not use its Security Council veto to obstruct the plan. 
 In some ways the situation is reminiscent of the big-power line-up in the Middle East during the cold war: The United States hopes to use its influence with Bosnian Muslims to push them toward compromise, just as it once sought to restrain Israel, while relying on Moscow to bring along the Serbs, just as the Soviet Union was asked to put pressure on the Arabs.
 
Together, at Last
 The two international mediators, Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen, are likely to find their diplomatic efforts considerably strengthened by Washington's approach. Once the mediators, Washington and Moscow all agree on a formula, any faction that resists it is going to find itself isolated.
An audible sigh of relief went up this morning after Secretary of State Warren Christopher telephoned the mediators to explain that he was not seeking a territorial settlement more favorable to the Muslims, but wanted a deal that all three sides could accept.
 
Moscow Presses Ahead
 Mr. Vance and Lord Owen expressed their respect for Reginald Bartholomew, who will represent Washington in the peace talks, but also vowed to "keep the pressure on for an early agreement on a comprehensive peace settlement in the context of the discussions already under way in the Security Council."
The fact that any deal the Clinton Administration helps to broker is unlikely to be very different from the Vance-Owen plan are proposing was made clear in Moscow today when the Deputy Foreign Minister, Vitaly I. Churkin, urged the Security Council to approve the plan and end the embargo on the rump Yugoslav federation if the plan is accepted by all. "We have only two hopes in this situation," he said. "One is Cyrus Vance and the other is Lord Owen."
By sending Mr. Bartholomew to Moscow immediately and by telephoning President Yeltsin this morning, President Clinton is asking Moscow to use its considerable psychological influence with the isolated Serbian government to reach a settlement.
 
The Ties That Influence
 Ethnically Slav like the Serbs, sharing the same Orthodox faith and speaking related languages, Russia is about the only country to have shown any sympathy for Slobodon Milosevic, president of the Serbian republic. Mr. Milosevic is widely blamed for starting the civil war in Bosnia and he may also be the only man capable of ending it through his influence over Bosnia's nationalist Serbian leadership.
To encourage Mr. Milosevic to press the Serbs in Bosnia, the United States, Britain and France are ready to impose a much tighter economic blockade on Serbia and Montenegro, which make up what is left of Yugoslavia.
But sanctions against Serbia have proved unpopular with the assertive Russian Parliament, raising fears that President Yeltsin might use his Security Council veto to block a tighter squeeze.
Involving Mr. Yeltsin is thus an attempt both to insure that new sanctions will not be needed and to persuade him not to veto them if they are.
 
No-Longer-Great Expectations
 The Clinton Administration, by making clear above all that it has no plan to divide Bosnia in ways that favor the Muslims, has pricked the bubble of Muslim expectations that were inflated by Washington's criticism of the Vance-Owen plan as rewarding Serbian "ethnic cleansing."
Encouraged by talk of a Washington policy review, the Muslims refused to negotiate until they had seen what President Clinton would offer.
Today Bosnia's Foreign Minister, Hari Silajdzic, said his Muslim-dominated Government would never negotiate unless the Serbs surrendered the guns that are shelling Sarajevo. "We will not negotiate with guns at our head," he said at a news conference.
But the United States has now made it clear that all the Muslims can expect is what the Vance-Owen plan already offers: tough enforcement measures to insure that the Serbs do not violate a settlement, a war-crimes court, strong human rights safeguards and some territorial adjustments.
If the Muslims do not accept, they will have no allies left to turn to.

HEADLINE: Law Failed to Stem Illegal Immigration, Panel Says

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
With the Clinton Administration still smarting from the problems with the child-care arrangements of Zoe Baird and Judge Kimba M. Wood, a new Government report contends that illegal immigration continues unchecked and is making a mockery of a 1986 law that was intended to curb it.
Foreigners who seek low-wage jobs -- working in homes, cleaning office buildings, doing the heavy lifting on construction crews, sewing in garment shops, bringing in the nation's fruit and vegetable harvests -- are rarely competing with Americans for those jobs. 
 Both employers and their unauthorized workers run some risk, but the risk is small because enforcement is difficult. Workers have easy access to fraudulent work documents, and the Government has been reluctant or unable to track down most violators.
Next week the Commission on Agricultural Workers, created under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, will submit to Congress the most thorough study yet of the immigration law. Established to appease farmers who feared that the law would cut off their labor supply, the commission only examined the law's effect on farming. But its findings of widespread illegal immigration apply to all parts of the economy that attract unauthorized foreign workers.
 
'Oversupply of Farm Labor'
 After six years of study, the commission's 12 members concluded: "Rather than a stabilization of the labor supply, there is a general oversupply of farm labor nationwide. Unauthorized immigrants continue to cross the southern border in large numbers."
The commission suggests tough new controls on illegal immigration, including development of a fraud-proof identification document for immigrants. Senator Alan K. Simpson, a Wyoming Republican who was an author of the 1986 law, has long espoused such a document, but it raises the hackles of those who regard the document as an invasion of privacy.
Others say the Government could do more to improve the wages and working conditions of menial jobs so that more Americans would be willing to apply for them. The commission says wages and working conditions will improve if the law really stems the supply of foreign workers.
Both the commission and various immigration experts say the steady influx of unauthorized workers worsens working conditions for everyone. "You get low pay for household work, poor conditions and people being taken advantage of," said George High, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a small Washington-based research group.
 
'Systematic Effort' Needed
 Demetrios G. Papademetriou, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Labor Department's immigration policy director in the Bush Administration, said, "What we don't do is make a systematic effort to control immigration."
Mr. Papademetriou, whom commission officials consulted about their report, said it was impossible to know how many immigrants had illegally entered the United States. But he said the most plausible estimate was 3.5 million, of whom 500,000 were farm workers and 350,000 were domestic workers. He said the domestic workers were concentrated in New York City and northern New Jersey, and in Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami and Houston.
The Internal Revenue Service estimates that two million Americans employ domestic workers -- cleaning house, caring for children, tending gardens -- and that only 250,000 of those workers meet all the requirements of the immigration and tax laws.
"It's massive in Washington, D.C.," said Michael Maggio, an immigration lawyer here. "They're working in the homes of our lawyers, our journalists and our government officials."
At the same time, the nation's principal enforcement agency, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, largely ignores violations in farming and domestic work because of insufficient staff. Instead, the agency concentrates on factories and work sites where it stands a better chance of finding large concentrations of workers who lack the proper documents.
 
Searches Called Inefficient
 Under pressure from farmers, the Reagan Administration refused to let the agency conduct unannounced sweeps of farms or ranches in search of such workers, requiring instead that it first inform the owner of the farm where it expected to find the workers.
Tracking down unauthorized maids and child-care workers is inefficient, the agency says. "We don't do very much in the area of domestics." said Verne Jervis, an I.N.S. spokesman. "It's not productive. We've got 1,500 investigators, nowhere enough people to concentrate on household help."
On its face, the 1986 immigration law seems tough. It granted amnesty to several million immigrants who could show that they had been working in the United States for at least 90 days. But it also established penalties of $100 and up to six months in prison against employers who knowingly hired illegal aliens.
The law requires an employer to ask a job applicant for any of a variety of official papers -- a visa, a driver's license, a Social Security card. But it does not require that the employer verify the document. As a result, a thriving industry of counterfeit card makers has emerged.

Voices of New Women Resound in the Senate

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Debate in the Senate sounds a little different these days.
Senators have always gone beyond the records of hearings and studies when they debated legislation. They cite lessons they learned as governors or businessmen, and most of all in wartime. And all of those familiar notes were sounded last week when the Senate debated the family leave bill and argued about homosexuals in the armed forces. 
 But in addition, during the family leave discussion, the senators heard two altogether different voices of experience. Two Senators told how they had to quit their jobs when they gave birth.
Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, recalled that 16 years ago, "when I worked as an executive secretary in Seattle, I became pregnant with my first child."
"At that time," she went on, "even though I was working out of economic necessity, there were no options for working mothers." She had to quit.
Then Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, recalled: "Thirty-five years ago, when I gave birth to my daughter, Katherine, there was no maternity or family leave. I left my job to have my child."
Floor arguments hardly ever affect votes in the Senate. But these two speeches suggested the kind of influence the new women in the chamber may expect to have. They add a different voice, a perspective that senators in the past have absorbed, when they absorb it at all, from constituents and witnesses and sometimes from their wives.
Two days later, another of the chamber's new women was heard from. But this time, Carol Moseley Braun, an Illinois Democrat who is the only black in the Senate, offered a deeply researched argument that the ban on homosexuals in the military was as much rooted in prejudice as the refusal to integrate the Navy was in 1942.
She read old memorandums on the reluctance of whites to be near blacks or to sleep near them that sounded eerily like today's arguments about straight and gay members of the military.
But Senators Feinstein and Murray were not reciting history; they were talking about their own lives. Ms. Feinstein, who is now 54, later recalled that when she was working for the state government and became pregnant "the words 'maternity leave' weren't really known."
She divorced a couple of years later and learned other hard lessons about employers' reluctance to hire a woman with a small child. "We're bringing a different perspective," she said. "We are talking about another kind of experience."
Since those days, Ms. Feinstein has traveled a conventional politician's route to the Senate. She was a member of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors for nine years and then its Mayor for nine more.
Ms. Murray had a shorter, less visible apprenticeship. Now 42, she was elected to the Senate after just four years in the Washington Legislature and four years on a suburban Seattle school board.
Quitting a job to have a child was not the only previously unsenatorial experience Ms. Murray described to the two or three of her 99 colleagues who were present. She also told of how difficult it was for her brothers and sisters to arrange time off from their jobs to care for her seriously ill parents. As a State Senator in 1992, she could juggle her time when her sisters and brothers, none of whose employers gave them leave, could not.
"I am of the infamous sandwich generation, charged with caring for my own children and my parents at the same time," the Senator said. "I personally understand the emotional consequences. I also know that when my family is safe and well cared for, I do a better job at work."
It is rare for someone to come to the Senate without longer political experience than Ms. Murray's, or at least without some other form of celebrity like Bill Bradley's basketball stardom or John Glenn's soaring experience as an astronaut. Senator Murray, in fact, seems like the sort of lawmaker who the advocates of term limits think will arrive in droves if the incumbents are forced to leave: a citizen-legislator.
She sounds that way. "People feel they've been left out of government," she said later in the week. And while "you have to be here to matter," she said, "I want to say what my next-door neighbor would say."

HEADLINE: Clinton Tells Cabinet to Cut Work Force and Privileges

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
President Clinton ordered his Cabinet officers today to slash 100,000 jobs from the Federal work force over the next four years, to cut back executive perquisites and to dissolve obscure Government commissions like the Advisory Panel for the Dictionary of Occupational Titles.
If all the reductions were carried out, Mr. Clinton said, they would save $9 billion over four years. He provided no documentation to back up that number. 
 The announced job cuts, which Mr. Clinton said would be accomplished through attrition and not layoffs, came a day after he declared that he was shrinking the White House staff by 25 percent.
Together these moves are meant both to fulfill campaign promises and to demonstrate that the Government is already going on a diet before Mr. Clinton asks the American people and Congress in a speech scheduled for Feb. 17 for tax increases and even broader deficit-reduction programs.
 
Concern in Private
 While Congressional leaders and their staffs publicly welcomed today's moves, some also expressed concern that in his zeal to fulfill his campaign promises, Mr. Clinton may take steps that lead to a different sort of gridlock, one in which agencies cannot perform up to standard because clerical help has been eliminated, because cuts are not carried out coherently and because already overworked auditors are further reduced in number.
Mr. Clinton announced the latest belt-tightening moves in a Cabinet meeting, after which members of the Cabinet were asked to take the lectern and, in a bureaucratic version of show and tell, explain where they were cutting and how much they enjoyed it.
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, who is less than 5 feet tall, broke up the room when he declared: "My predecessor was traveling, I discovered, by first class whenever my predecessor had to travel around the country. I'm traveling coach. Of course, I don't need the leg room."
 
Out With 'Pony Perks'
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said he was eliminating the "pony perks" in his department. This was a reference to a plan on the books to expand a horse-riding center at the Manassas National Battlefield in Virginia for the convenience of politicians and high-ranking officials.
Mr. Clinton today signed three executive orders for the cuts. The first requires Cabinet and agency heads to cut the 2.1-million-member civilian Federal work force by 100,000 jobs by the end of 1995, with 10 percent of the cuts coming from senior management. Each year, about 200,000 workers leave Government service, and the idea would be to leave some of these vacancies unfilled.
The second executive order tells departments to reduce their administrative costs by 3 percent a year on average, leading up to 5 percent in the fourth year of Mr. Clinton's term.
The third order abolishes Government boards and agencies that Mr. Clinton deems of marginal significance. Examples of such panels, which cost about $150 million a year, are the Advisory Panel for Animal Learning and Behavior, the National Sea Grant Review Panel, the Weather and Climate Coordinating Committee, the Board of Tea Experts and the Advisory Panel for the Dictionary of Occupational Titles.
 
'To Shrink the Gulf'
 Mr. Clinton also announced that he was issuing additional directives "to shrink the gulf between government and the average citizen."
One is cutting the number of officials in each department who will be able to use home-to-office limousines, with a 50 percent reduction in the limousine fleet in the current fiscal year. Another is an unspecified "tightening of the rules for using Government airplanes," with a goal of eliminating unnecessary planes.
Finally, Mr. Clinton said he was ordering the elimination of perks like below-cost executive dining rooms and free memberships in private health clubs for senior officials.
The last Democratic President to impose across-the-board White House and administrative cuts was Jimmy Carter, whose White House operation was debilitated in part by the indiscriminate way in which he made reductions, particularly in his Congressional liaison operation.
Charles O. Jones, professor of political science at University of Wisconsin at Madison, who has written a history of the Carter Administration, said:
"What we learned from the Carter experience is that this kind of symbolic stuff will only be meaningful if it enhances the White House's ability to deliver on health care and the economy. If Clinton can make that connection, people will hail him for it, but if this complicates his ability to deliver on the big things, it will be as well remembered as Carter's."

HEADLINE: Saudi Minister Warns Against New Oil Taxes

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
The Saudi Arabian oil minister, Hisham M. Nazer, made an indirect but strong plea today for the Clinton Administration not to impose taxes aimed at reducing oil consumption and imports.
Mr. Nazer, speaking at a conference of oil executives sponsored by Cambridge Energy Research Associates, hinted that the Saudis and other large oil exporters might respond in ways that he did not detail. Oil import fees "defy the logic of geology and economics," he said. Mr. Nazer indicated that the Saudis' heavy investments in in new producing fields, as well as in American refining and marketing outlets, would suffer if Washington approved oil-related taxes. 
 "We see constant discrimination against oil in many policy measures and initiatives under the pretext of security of supply or the guise of environmental protection or simply alleviating budget deficits,' Mr. Nazer said.
Saudi Arabia replaced Russia last year as the world's largest oil producer, with daily output of 8.5 million barrels.
 
A Push For Higher Prices
 Carbon, gasoline or oil-import taxes in the United States would likely lower demand for OPEC oil and reduce oil prices at a time when Mr. Nazer is leading a campaign within OPEC to pare production quotas and push prices higher.
Oil traders said they anticipated that 11 ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would agree to reduce daily output by as much as 1.5 million barrels a day, from 25.5 million barrels at a meeting that opens Saturday in Vienna. A failure to reduce output could send world prices down by $2 or $3 a barrel.
World oil prices jumped by more than $1 a barrel two weeks ago, when Mr. Nazer was quoted as saying that the Saudis would join Iran in pushing for production cutbacks to raise prices. But a pact is far from certain, and history suggests that if one is reached, it may not be followed for long. A Kuwaiti oil official did nothing here Tuesday night to calm concerns within OPEC over his nation's rising exports.
Nader H. Sultan, president of the refining and marketing subsidiary of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, told more than 500 oil executives at the conference that the kingdom expects to increase daily output to two million barrels by this summer, from 1.7 million barrels currently.
OPEC members have omitted Kuwait from production quotas since its battered oil industry resumed pumping oil a year ago after recovering from the 766 oil well fires set by Iraqi soldiers during the Persian Gulf war.
 Yet analysts said OPEC was worried that Kuwait soon would pump too much oil into a slowly improving global market. The other OPEC ministers are looking for a pledge from the Kuwaitis in Vienna to halt expansion projects temporarily in exchange for a deal to keep exports near two million barrels a day.
Mr. Sultan apparently signaled in his remarks that the Kuwaitis may resist. He said the Kuwaiti oil industry must increase its "spare" capacity to higher levels to generate revenue for rebuilding the war-torn country, although he added that it was unclear how much more was needed. Kuwait produced as many as 3.7 million barrels of oil in the 1970's.
Bernard J. Picchi, senior oil analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Company, said oil prices would fall if Kuwait was not part of an OPEC deal. "If Kuwait is not brought into the quotas, there will be a real lack of market confidence in any OPEC agreement."
 
'Too Many Producers'
 Philip K. Verleger Jr., a visiting fellow and energy economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, said that OPEC was unlikely to keep any agreement for long. "There are too many producers competing for market share," he said. "They can't do it."
In his speech today, Mr. Nazer of Saudi Arabia said the policies favored by environmentalists were "alarming" and that the oil industry had been unfairly singled out as the "culprit" of ecological disorder. He said energy taxes anywhere in the world would blunt the economic development needed to lift more than a billion people from poverty.
"Abject poverty is indeed the worst environmental pollutant facing mankind," he said. "There is no need to rush into costly policies. I cannot think of any means to bring about global economic development without the use of energy, especially oil."

HEADLINE: Random House Closing a Division

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN

 BODY:
Random House Inc. said yesterday that it was closing its troubled Turtle Bay Books division, which was started just over two years ago by Joni Evans, the former publisher of the Random House adult trade division.
As a result, Ms. Evans ended her often-turbulent five-year relationship with the New York publishing giant. 
 Turtle Bay, which from the beginning has been very much Ms. Evans's project, failed to produce any national best sellers or to meet its operating costs, despite a list of authors that includes several who have been successful.
 
Swan Song This Spring
 Alberto Vitale, the chairman and chief executive of Random House, said yesterday that a "difficult publishing environment" doomed the efforts of Ms. Evans and her staff, and that it was now necessary to discontinue operations after the division's spring 1993 books come out.
Ms. Evans deplored the decision to close Turtle Bay, but said she preferred that to the severe scaling back of operations that Mr. Vitale had initially suggested.
"I'm very disappointed in what I think is an abrupt and premature decision," she said. "I want to maintain good relations with Random House and to possibly work with them again, but when I put my all into something and feel I collected the best talent, and then have it prematurely taken away, it makes me want to look around at other opportunities elsewhere."
She also said she had turned down an offer by Mr. Vitale of another position within Random House.
Ms. Evans, who is 50, was recruited in 1987 after the breakup of her marriage to Richard E. Snyder, the chairman of the rival Simon & Schuster, where she had been head of the trade book division. She was hired by Robert L. Bernstein, Mr. Vitale's highly regarded predecessor at Random House's helm.
 
Rose Rapidly
 Random House had hired Ms. Evans to start her own imprint, but within six weeks she was named publisher of the adult trade division, the country's largest publisher of general-interest books.
But in October 1990, she was replaced by Harold Evans -- who is no relation -- after a tenure that mixed visible successes and failures. The following January, with considerable fanfare, she began Turtle Bay.
There has been speculation in the publishing industry over the last couple of weeks that Turtle Bay was in trouble, though few predicted that it would be dissolved this quickly. People close to Ms. Evans thought that it would be given at least until the end of the year to prove itself.
In its size, operations, even its selection of material, Turtle Bay established itself as a boutique publishing house. It was based in a town house in the Turtle Bay section of Manhattan in the East 40's, away from other Random House operations.
Ms. Evans and two former Random House editors who worked with her, Susan Kamil and Julie Grau, reveled in Turtle Bay's nearly all-female staff and its collegial atmosphere. No one held an official title, and editorial sessions were casual.
 
Well-Established Writers
 The three editors were able to bring 20 authors or so with them from Random House. These included some established writers and some celebrities -- among them, A. S. Byatt, Carol Matthau, Ann Beattie, Julia Phillips, Geoffrey Wolff, Michael Caine, Joan Rivers and Erica Jong.
Some Turtle Bay books were well reviewed and some, Ms. Evans said, were profitable. But the division left an impression in the industry of consistently falling short of expectations.
For example, Michael Caine's autobiography, "What's It All About?", was bought for a reported $750,000, and, Ms. Evans said without confirming the amount, "it well earned its advance" with 130,000 copies in print.
But despite an extensive and elaborate promotion and advertising campaign, the book failed to make the best-seller lists of The New York Times or Publishers Weekly, widely regarded as the two most important national rankings. It did make some regional best-seller lists.
Ms. Evans and Mr. Vitale said they started talking several weeks ago about Turtle Bay's future. They said Mr. Vitale wanted to make its lists smaller and to lower its expenses.
But Ms. Evans said such a "scaling down" was intolerable to her.
"It became clear that we had different philosophies," she said. "I always considered this as a long-term process, that it would be three to four years before we broke even, and I thought he did, too. But somewhere along the way, the landscape changed. Alberto thought it it was a tough economic time and the scale-down was necessary. I didn't see it that way. I wanted to have the time I thought I had."
 
Changing Realities
 Mr. Vitale said he did not renege on any agreement with Ms. Evans to give Turtle Bay a certain amount of time to develop, but he conceded that "conditions have changed since the decision" to start the line.
"The reality," he said in a statement, "is that the birth of Turtle Bay coincided with a period of surging competitiveness and streamlining throughout the publishing industry, a reality that now makes it necessary and prudent for us to take this step."
Mr. Vitale said all the writers under contract with Turtle Bay would be consulted and, with their approval, would be placed with editors at other Random House divisions. He said he hoped that Ms. Grau would remain with the company, but that he did not expect Ms. Kamil to.
The three other Turtle Bay employees, lower level assistants, would also be absorbed by the company, he said.
Other publishers agreed that the current climate in the industry was less tan hospitable, and several said that the 18 books Turtle Bay had published did not perform well enough to merit further investment in a floundering division.
Figures on what Turtle Bay had cost Random House could not be immediately obtained because Random House's parent, Advance Publications Inc., the Newhouse family company, is privately held and officials were not providing information.
In all, Turtle Bay had more than 50 books under contract.
Jack Romanos, who is president of Paramount Publishing's consumer group, a Random House competitor, said, "A large imprint like this, that really operates as a small company within a large company, must be instantly successful in this publishing environment."
Turtle Bay, he added, was without any apparent commercial success or a flagship author, "and the absence of those two factors obviously had to contribute to this decision."

HEADLINE: And Now, Let Your Lips Do The Dialing

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
In one of the most significant advances for telephone customers since touch-tone dialing, people will soon be able to dial a telephone number by speaking the name of whomever they are calling.
The voice service would allow each member of a household to compile a separate voice directory of dozens of names. When a wife says "Mom," the phone will recognize only her voice and call her mother; when her child says "Mom," the phone will call only his mother. 
 The system comes from the Nynex Corporation, the nation's fifth-largest local telephone company and the parent of New York Telephone and New England Telephone. Nynex said yesterday that it would soon begin testing the service, which it calls Voice Dialing, on March 15 for 400 customers in Bay Shore, L.I.
 
Expected to Spread
 U S West, another of the big regional phone companies, has licensed the Nynex technology and is already conducting a small market test of the service. Other phone companies are expected to follow.
Nynex said that the service would be offered in Manhattan in 1994 and that within two years it hoped to install the service for 7 million of its 12 million customers. Voice Dialing works on existing telephones and does not require customers to buy additional equipment. For the phone company, too, the technology also primarily uses equipment already installed in its central offices.
Voice Dialing is expected to cost $4 to $6 a month, and Nynex said it would be offered first in areas where there is heavy demand for call-waiting, call-forwarding and similar services. Nynex plans to file for approval from New York and New England state regulators later this year.
As with all new technologies, there are pitfalls. Nynex officials acknowledged that identical twins could use each other's Voice Dialing directory or that on a good day the impressionist Dana Carvey might be able to activate George Bush's directory.
The Sprint Corporation and other long-distance companies are working on what are known as voice-verification systems, which would allow calling-card customers to dial by voice rather than punch in lengthy access codes. But those systems would need to be more discriminating than Voice Dialing, in order to prevent criminals from using stolen cards.
In setting up a Voice Dialing directory, a customer dials a special access code, like *99, recites a name two or more times, then punches in a telephone number. Afterward, the customer picks up the phone, waits for a beep, then says the name. The phone dials the number automatically -- and will do so in the future each time the person speaks the name. Or at any time, the customer can dial manually.
 
No Estimate of Cost
 "And you don't need a thick instruction manual to use it," said Casimir Skrzypczak (pronounced SKRIP-sack), president of Nynex Science and Technology, the company's research unit.
Elizabeth Ricci, a Nynex spokeswoman, declined to estimate how much the company would invest in the project.
The technology, which has been under development since 1987, works like this: A customer says "Casimir Skrzypcsak" into the telephone, which is a microphone. A Nynex computer listening at the other end of the line turns the sound into a unique string of computer-code digits, defined by 22 parameters like the caller's pitch, intonation and speed.
The customer then dials Mr. Skrzypcsak's number, 555-1234, which the computer also turns into computer code, or digitizes. For computer purposes, the first set of coded digits -- the name -- is now equivalent in meaning to the second set of digits, the phone number.
The reason that Voice Dialing is so easy to use and is available in 10 languages is that the words themselves do not matter. Indeed, in a White Plains market test in 1990, a young boy taught the Voice Dialing system to recognize his dog's barks.
 
Not All Voice Systems Are Alike
 Voice Dialing differs from other voice-recognition technologies that have other purposes.
The long-distance company American Telephone and Telegraph, for example, has installed voice-recognition technology to replace some human long-distance operators; computers search a caller's sentence for certain key words, like "France," for example, by way of determining which menu of services to offer the customer. In Nynex's Voice Dialing, callers use isolated words rather than sentences.
Nynex sees Voice Dialing as leading to more efficient use of its networks. In regular touch-tone calling, people misdial 15 out of 100 times, company research has found. In Voice Dialing, Nynex officials said, the system will make a mistake 5 out of 100 times on the first try, and only 1 out of 100 on the second.
A voice dial is also as fast or faster than touch-tone or rotary dialing, depending on how quickly one speaks.
And unlike a technology that is linked to a particular piece of equipment, the case with personal computers or voice-operated programmers for VCR's, Voice Dialing can be used on any phone connected to a household or business line.
 
Prospects and Limitations
 In the future, the Nynex service may also work with what are known as screen-based phones and thus make voice mail and other services easier to use, said Sharad Singhal, director of speech recognition applications at Bellcore, the research arm of the regional Bell companies. For example, it may someday be possible to simply say, "Toys 'R' Us" and have the phone tap into a store's computer and display a list of toys on sale that day.
But Peter L. Hampton, director of consumer applications at the Yankee Group, a high-tech consulting firm in Boston, suggested that Nynex might have been smarter to introduce the service for car-phone users, where hands-free application would obviously make sense. At home, he said, customers may be more skeptical.
Although Nynex has no current plans to offer Voice Dialing for cellular customers, company officials said there were no technical hurdles to doing so.
 
A Way to Increase Traffic
 For Nynex and other phone companies, services like Voice Dialing are important contributors to revenue, which has grown relatively little during the recession. Nynex's 1992 revenue dropped last year, to $13.16 billion from $13.23 billion in 1991.
Moreover, phone companies have been vastly expanding capacity for local, domestic long-distance and international long-distance lines. To prevent a glut of capacity, companies must encourage customers to make more calls and fill the expanding pipelines.
Making phoning easier -- simple enough for children and dogs -- would seem to be one way of doing that.

New York Sues to Halt Kraft's Cereal Deal

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
Kraft General Foods' $450 million acquisition of Nabisco cereals was challenged on antitrust grounds by New York State yesterday.
The state's lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, seeks a preliminary injunction to halt the merger and have Kraft and its parent company, the Philip Morris Companies, barred from acquiring any company that makes cold cereals for 10 years. 
 The Nabisco acquisition was completed on Jan. 4 after the Federal Trade Commission had reviewed the transaction and found no objections, Kraft said in a statement. A similar offer to acquire Nabisco's cereals in 1992 was withdrawn by General Mills Inc. after F.T.C. regulators and Robert Abrams, the New York State Attorney General, raised antitrust questions.
 
 
Kraft to Fight Suit
 Kraft called the lawsuit "completely without merit" and said it would fight it. Mr. Abrams said the suit was filed yesterday because his office had only recently received documents requested from the two companies. Mr. Abrams said the companies were informed on Monday that the suit would proceed.
According to papers filed with the suit, the Kraft-Nabisco merger has allowed Post to improve its market share, to 14.49 percent from 11.52 percent. The deal also has put the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation out of the cold cereal business.
Kraft, which makes Post cereals, like Grape Nuts, Raisin Bran and Honey Bunches of Oats, is the country's third-largest producer of cold cereals behind the Kellogg Company and General Mills Inc.
The top six companies last year, which had included Nabisco, the sixth largest, as well as the Quaker Oats Company and the Ralston Purina Company, had about 90 percent of the industry's $7 billion in sales.
"This is a highly concentrated market," Mr. Abrams said at yesterday's announcement of the filing of the suit. "Going from six major companies to five makes further concentration. The last thing this industry needs is less competition."
Mr. Abrams stood beside several boxes of cereals and complained that their prices "are going through the roof."
In court papers, Mr. Abrams contended that the six leading companies, before the merger, had created a "tight oligopoly." He also charged that they had engaged in little price competition and that "the firms enjoyed unusually high profits."
He cited statistics, provided for his office by an agricultural economist at the University of Connecticut, Ronald W. Cotterill, that showed prices of cereals had risen 71 percent, compared with a 37 percent increase in overall food prices, in an eight-year period through 1991.
"That's a dramatic difference," Mr. Abrams said.
 
Some Are Surprised
 The lawsuit surprised some in the industry.
A spokesman for RJR Nabisco, Jason Wright, said his company was "somewhat surprised, if not baffled" at the lawsuit, noting the F.T.C.'s apparent approval. A spokesman for the F.T.C. declined to comment.
Ronald B. Morrow, an industry analyst for the Smith Barney, Harris Upham Company, said he was "shocked" to learn of the Attorney General's action and suggested that if Mr. Abrams were truly concerned about high prices, "he would go after the price leaders," Kellogg and General Mills.
Mr. Morrow also noted Nabisco's reduced market share, which, according to Mr. Cotterill's figures, fell to 2.97 percent, from 4.86 percent in 1990, and said the merger might help increase competition.

HEADLINE: Stocks Edge Ahead, But Dow Slips by 2.16

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The stock market moved slightly higher yesterday, although several of the large blue-chip issues were weak. As a result, the Dow Jones industrial fell for the third consecutive day.
Most of the weakness came as stocks responded to sharp losses in bonds, following a disappointing 10-year note auction by the Treasury. The third and last leg of the refunding will take place today with the auction of a new 30-year bond. 
 Blue-chip issues, down marginally for most of the trading session, slipped further in late afternoon following news about the auction and a surge in interest rates. The Dow ended the day down 2.16 points, to 3,412.42. At one point during the session, the Dow slipped below 3,400 before recovering.
Among the Dow stocks that fell were Eastman Kodak, down 1 3/4, to 52; United Technologies, down 2, to 45 5/8, and I.B.M., down 1 1/8, to 52 1/4.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 251.9 million shares, up only slightly from Tuesday, suggesting that an orderly market pullback was taking place.
Gainers on the Big Board led losing issues by 952 to 873.
Other market indicators were slightly higher.
 
Nasdaq Index Gains
 The Nasdaq composite index gained 2.81 points to finish at 695.02 on the strength of Intel, up 4, to 114 1/2, and other semiconductor stocks, including biostocks like Biogen up 5/8, to 34 5/8, and Amgen, up 2 3/8, to 54 3/4.
"The stock market gave a good account of itself considering the bond market took it on the chin," said Lawrence Rice, chief market strategist at Josepthal Lyon & Ross. The fact that it was able to bounce back, he said, continues a trend since 1987, which is to buy on the first dip.
"Anytime you have a small correction, it opens up buying opportunities," Mr. Rice said. "There was good breadth in the market, with a lot of money going back into over-the-counter stocks. Drug stocks were good buy as we approach the next week's State of the Union address, by which time there shouldn't be any new surprises regarding health care.
"I saw a lot of bottom fishing in pharmaceuticals and selected large biotech companies. With all the rotating in the market, came increased volatility in the averages and individual stocks, particularly in the gaming group."
Caesars World closed at 46, up 2, but was as low as 43 3/4 on the day, while Mirage Resorts, up 1, to 39 3/4, traded down to 37 at one point.
Informix, a California software company, which earlier this week reported a rise in fourth-quarter earnings to 67 cents a share from 27 cents, saw its stock fall 2 1/4, to 34 1/2 yesterday. A number were concerned that 1993 income may not increase at the same rate as last year.
The Atlas Corporation, which mines gold in Nevada, lost almost half its value yesterday after the company said it expects to report a second-quarter loss of $3.6 million from operations. The company, which commissioned an independent operations audit last month, said the preliminary data indicated that the company will have serious financial difficulties in the near term unless it raises additional working capital.
Shares of American Dental Laser, a maker of dental products, rose 3/4, to 6 1/2. The company said a Japanese manufacturer was willing to pay $3 million in royalties for the rights to make its KCP 2000, a device that uses a jet stream of tiny particles to prepare teeth for fillings.
Dell Computer was down 2 5/8, to 36 1/2, after the mail-order personal computer maker cut prices an average 8.7 percent across its product line Tuesday amid signs of thinning demand.
In Japan yesterday, the Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 67.63 points, or four-tenths of 1 percent, at 17,089.90. The Tokyo market will be closed today for a holiday, National Founding Day.

Sun Oil Takes Environmental Pledge

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The Valdez Principles, a code of corporate environmental conduct devised after the 1989 Alaskan oil spill, won its first major corporate endorsement yesterday. And the company that signed on is an oil company.
The Sun Company of Philadelphia, the 12th-largest oil company in the United States, became the first Fortune 500 company to endorse the principles. Fifty smaller companies have already backed them. 
 In May, a resolution endorsing the principles was submitted at the company's shareholder meeting by the New York City pension system but drew just 6 percent support. After the vote, though, management met with the principles' backers and worked out a compromise.
Sun negotiated various "adaptations" of the principles to fit its business. For example, the first of the 10 principles, protection of the biosphere, says, "We will reduce and make continual progress toward eliminating the release of any substance that may cause environmental damage to the air, water, or the earth or its inhabitants." Some environmentalists would say that includes the pollutants that are released when Sun's gasoline is burned, as well as the carbon dioxide that adds to global warming. and is released when Sun's gasoline is burned.
In the statement adopted by Sun, the company says, "We will reduce our overall emissions to the environment (air, water and land) with special emphasis on toxic substances."
"This is not a commitment to go out of the petrochemical business or the fuels business," Sun's chairman and chief executive, Robert H. Campbell, said at a ceremony in New York yesterday. But, he said, there was "tremendous philosophical congruence" between what Sun was already doing and the environmental principles. He said, though, that he did not foresee major changes in company operations.
The principles were renamed last year and now known as Ceres, for Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies. Joan Bavaria, co-chairwoman of Ceres, said discussions were continuing with other oil companies. Exxon is not among them, she said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Generally Advances; Gold Prices Climb Sharply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar continued to advance yesterday against most major currencies in anticipation of favorable American economic data and a weakening German economy. But it again lost ground against the Japanese yen.
Gold prices rose sharply. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $333.40 an ounce, up $4 from Tuesday. The Republic National Bank said gold rose $3.50 an ounce, to a late bid price of $331.80. 
 Analysts said the dollar drew strength from comments by German officials who downgraded their economic outlook for this year. Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's Economics Minister, predicted his country's gross domestic product would decline by half a percent this year, and a separate Government report predicted a stagnant economy.
A weak German economy makes the nation's central bank more inclined to keep interest rates low, which makes yields on United States securities more attractive by comparison.
Also supporting the dollar are expectations that today's report on January retail sales will be better than expected, said Randolph Donney, research director at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
 
Yen Strengthens
 In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 121.52 yen, down 0.83 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at a higher rate of 120.93 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 121.15 yen, down from 121.275 yen on Tuesday.
The yen has gained strength in recent days amid increasing pressure on Japan to reduce its trade surplus. A strong yen makes American goods cheaper for the Japanese.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.4263, from $1.4312 late Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.4255 to buy one pound, less than Tuesday's $1.43025.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.6595 German marks, up from 1.65425; 1.5370 Swiss francs, up from 1.5315; 5.6135 French francs, up from 5.6020; 1,548.25 Italian lire, up from 1,528.00, and 1.26465 Canadian dollars, down from 1.26775.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.6555 German marks, up from 1.6516; 1.5340 Swiss francs, up from 1.5279; 5.6030 French francs, up from 5.5935; 1.8625 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8591; 1,542.25 Italian lire, up from 1,525.50, and 1.2658 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2675.

Tax-Exempt Yields Lower But Taxables Change Little

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Yields offered by tax-exempt and taxable money market funds were mixed in the latest week.
The current survey of tax-exempt money market funds by IBC/Donohue's Money Fund Report showed that tax-exempt yields fell sharply for the seven-day period ended Tuesday, largely because of a sharp inflow of funds after a rise in tax-exempt yields the previous week. 
 Assets of tax-exempt funds rose by $1.5 billion in the period, to $102.5 billion. As more money flowed into the funds, the prices for shares in the funds rose, pushing the yields lower.
 
'A Seesaw Effect'
 "We have had a seesaw effect from week to week in tax-exempt securities," said Walter S. Frank, chief economist at IBC/Donohue's. "When yields go up, funds flow in. When yields go down, funds flow out."
Managers of tax-exempt portfolios made only slight adjustments in the week, paring the average number of days left to maturity of securities being held to 53 from 55.
The average seven-day compounded yield for a tax-exempt fund fell 12 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 2 percent, and the average seven-day simple yield fell by a similar amount, to 1.98 percent.
Statisticians for The Money Fund Report calculated that over a 30-day period the compounded tax-exempt yield averaged 1.92 percent, down 7 basis points from the previous week. The 30-day simple yield fell a similar amount, to 1.90 percent.
From its survey of tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million, The Money Fund Report said the best performer for the week was the Evergreen Tax Exempt Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 2.71 percent. The fund is distributed by Evergreen Asset Management in Purchase, N.Y.
 
Taxable Funds
 Meanwhile, for the seven-day period ended yesterday, assets of taxable money market funds rose $7.3 billion, to $487.5 billion.
Institutional assets increased $6.7 billion in the period, to $177.9 billion, accounting for most of the rise.
Average days left to maturities of securities in money market portfolios remained unchanged at 61. The fact that maturities remain abnormally long suggests that portfolio managers are not expecting any imminent move in short-term interest rates, analysts said.
The average seven-day taxable compound yield fell a basis point in the week, to 2.76 percent, while the seven-day simple yield fell a similar amount, to 2.73 percent.
The 30-day compound yield fell 3 basis points, to 2.79 percent, while the 30-day simple yield fell 4 basis points, to 2.75 percent.
For the second consecutive week, the top-performing taxable fund with assets of more than $100 million was the Olde Premium Plus Money Mareket Series, with a seven-day compound yield of 3.60 percent. The fund is distributed by Olde Asset Management Inc. of Detroit.
By comparison, the average yield on bank money market funds was 2.71 percent for the week ended yesterday, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, down 2 basis points from the previous period.

To raise Federal revenue, reduce those sacred tax preferences.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IT'S simply a matter of arithmetic. To cut the promised $145 billion from the budget deficit without gutting the military or declaring generational war on the Social Security lobby, President Clinton must ask for higher income tax rates on the middle class or float some brand new tax like an energy levy.
Or is it that simple? The White House has apparently not given much consideration to one very alluring route to raising major bucks, slashing revenue-reducing tax preferences -- what economists call "tax expenditures." 
 Preferences ranging from the home mortgage deduction to the tax-deferred status of life insurance savings are defended by well-organized interests. But as Mr. Clinton is surely discovering, there are no easy ways to raise $145 billion. And the armor protecting tax expenditures may be less formidable than first appearances suggest. Consider some lucrative targets:
Fringe Benefits. For many earners, especially well-paid ones, fringes amount to a quarter or more of their compensation. And while there are limits on what employers may dole out tax-free, the big-ticket items have hardly been touched. Treating pension contributions and health insurance premiums as fully taxable income would add a whopping $103 billion to Federal coffers.
That reform might seem as likely as . . . well, the collapse of Communism. Pension contributions represent much of the private savings in America. And Lloyd Bentsen, the new Secretary of the Treasury, spent much of his influence as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee trying to increase savings incentives, not reduce them.
But in these sober times, one could still imagine tighter limits on gold-plated pension perquisites. And in the case of health insurance, a cap on untaxed outlays would dovetail with efforts to make consumers more conscious of what their employers' dollars buy. According to the Congressional Budget Office, limiting a family's tax exemption to the first $4,800 a year of health insurance would raise $28 billion in 1997.
State and Local Taxes. The 1986 Tax Reform Act eliminated the deductibility of sales taxes, but left property and state income tax deductions virtually intact. That suits affluent residents of high-tax states. And it suits conservatives, who want to shift government responsibilities from Washington.
Nonetheless, eliminating the deduction would be a tempting way to raise $44 billion in 1997, and to hit hardest at the rich. The initiative might be made palatable if it were part of a grand bargain on health insurance -- one in which Washington assumed the full costs of care for Medicaid, the 900-pound gorilla of state budgets.
Mortgage Interest. The home mortgage interest deduction may be the most sacred of the tax expenditure cows. But Van Doorn Ooms, the research director of the Committee for Economic Development, points out that it also creates a major distortion in capital markets, increasing incentives to build houses at the expense of productivity-enhancing industrial investment. And, of course, there is the not-so-small matter of revenue forgone: $48 billion in 1997.
Elimination of the interest deduction would, in fact, be more problematic in economic terms than is generally understood. Ideally, argues Eugene Steuerle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, the interest would remain deductible, but Washington would somehow assess the rental value of owner-occupied housing and tax it -- just as it now taxes the rental income from commercial real estate. And although eliminating the deduction would, on balance, make taxes more progressive, there would be more than a few slips between cup and lip: those with substantial savings could avoid the pain by paying off their mortgages.
Deduction Limits. Limiting deductions to the rate allowed at the lowest tax bracket was proposed in the seminal tax reform plan put forward in the 1980's by two Democrats: Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri. The plan, never adopted, retained the most cherished personal deductions, but limited their value to the lowest bracket. A family in the highest tax bracket (today, 31 percent) would thus still have been able to deduct an unlimited amount of interest or charitable donations or state taxes. But the savings would have been computed as if the taxpayer were in the lowest bracket (15 percent). Potential revenues: $63 billion in 1997.
Not everyone is infatuated with this sleight of hand. Mr. Steuerle sees no reason why a person who earns $80,000 and gives $10,000 of it to the United Way should pay more tax than someone who earns $70,000 and gives nothing. Nor is it clear why a family with a $100,000 income and $50,000 in nursing-home bills should be denied a top-bracket deduction. But there is a Solomonesque justice to the approach that Mr. Ooms believes "would make it more salable than a lot of alternatives."
James Poterba, an economist at M.I.T., notes, moreover, that most voters would be left untouched by the change because just 28 percent of all taxpayers itemize deductions -- down from 39 percent in 1985. And by everyone's reckoning, the change would be very progressive, undoing a portion of the shift in income distribution toward the wealthy in the last two decades.

Support Declines
To independent film makers short of money, the thought of losing a major sponsor is a nightmare. For the last several years Columbia Tri-Star Home Video (formerly RCA Columbia) has financed the production of dozens of films that won critical acclaim during short theater runs before moving into video stores. This year the company plans to curtail that support. 
 Production money from video companies often goes into genre or exploitation films but seldom finds its way into more ambitious efforts. One such movie backed by Columbia Tri-Star is "The Waterdance," released on tape yesterday. The film, Neal Jimenez and Michael Steinberg's film about paraplegics ("small in scale, it is big in feelings," Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times), was also recently nominated for an Independent Spirit Award as best first feature film.
The annual awards will be presented next month by the Independent Theater Project/West, a group of 2,000 independent producers and directors. Among the other films cited in the nominations are Carl Franklin's "One False Move," Allison Anders's "Gas Food Lodging" and John Sayles's "Passion Fish." All were financed by Columbia Tri-Star Home Video.
Many of the films are the kinds of low-budget productions that are ignored by studio movie divisions but turn into moneymakers on videocassette and in other residual markets in the United States and abroad. Steven Soderbergh's "Sex, Lies and Videotape," released by RCA Columbia in 1990, is a prime example. More recently, such acclaimed films as "One False Move," "Mississippi Masala," "Deep Cover" and "A Midnight Clear," all distributed by Columbia Tri-Star, have done very well as videos.
But the company doesn't plan to back films like "The Waterdance" in such numbers in the future. "The economics of those types of pictures have changed," said W. Patrick Campbell, the president of Columbia Tri-Star Home Video. He cited declining foreign theatrical and television revenues as one reason the films are no longer so profitable.
Mr. Campbell said Columbia Tri-Star and its parent, Sony, would not cut off production funds altogether, but he did not indicate how many films the video company would finance in the future. "There's a way to stay in it, but we have to look at it in a different light," he said.
 
Protests Over a Store
 Televised protests this week over the opening of an adult video store in Chelsea in Manhattan raised an old specter for video dealers. "It's terrible for video's image," said Norman Scherer, a New York dealer. "Stores are highlighted and isolated as pornographers."
That concern isn't shared by Don Rosenberg, the executive vice president of the Video Software Dealers Association. The organization represents 4,000 dealers, 60 percent of whom carry adult films along with other titles.
"In the early 80's, if they heard I was a video dealer, people would ask me for adult titles," Mr. Rosenberg said. "Now if you say video store, people don't think of adult movies."
 
NEW VIDEO RELEASES
 
Death Becomes Her
1992. MCA/Universal. $94.99. Laser disk, $34.98. 1 hour 43 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.
 An eternal-youth potion keeps Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep) looking great even after death but does nothing for her nasty disposition. Dead or alive, a star has her flanks to protect, primarily from Hollywood colleagues ready to bury her at the first sign of a wrinkle. On the home front, there's an old romantic rival (Goldie Hawn) who has also quaffed the potion and is out to make off with Ashton's husband (Bruce Willis). While the rivalry is grounds for slickly manipulated body parts and other special effects, Robert Zemeckis's film suffers from a screenplay that Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times "is wildly uneven, sometimes as wicked as a fashion-minded fairy tale and at other times unaccountably coarse and flat."
 
Surviving Desire
1992. Fox Lorber. $89.95. 1:26. No rating.
 Characters in the films of Hal Hartley crawl out on long limbs of emotional risk but even while falling never seem to lose their cool. Here, in a film made for the "American Experience" television series, a professor of literature (Martin Donovan) becomes infatuated with an intense young woman (Mary Ward) who is keenly but fleetingly interested in the professor. Round about the couple are an assortment of characters who are adept at Mr. Hartley's penetrating dialogue and "passionate about the idea of love and desire and survival, even while knowing they might very well end up looking ridiculous" (John O'Connor).
 
Lovers
1992. Worldvision. $89.95. 1:45. Spanish with English subtitles. No rating.
 Vicente Aranda's dark, romantic melodrama slyly plays off its setting in the controlled world of Franco's Spain. Discharged from the army, Paco (Jorge Sanz) is scheduled to marry the sweet, frugal Trini (Maribel Verdu) and dutifully settle down as a happy, hard-working member of the middle class. Instead he encounters the voracious Luisa (Victoria Abril), a young widow who teaches him many methods of love as well as a few crooked ways of going nowhere in business. Mr. Aranda views the chaotic developments dispassionately, never burdening events with larger meaning in a "sophisticated and highly accomplished work" (Vincent Canby).

Peering Into a Dismal 21st Century

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

 BODY:

Preparing for the 21st Century
By Paul Kennedy
Illustrated. Random House. $25.
In his previous book, "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict from 1500 to 2000," Paul Kennedy brought us the bad news that nations rising to supremacy by winning wars tend to get overextended in a way that undermines the source of their wealth, and that the United States is undergoing such a decline. Mr. Kennedy, who teaches history at Yale, didn't think the fall-off necessarily had to end with a crash. He just meant to sound a warning so that leaders could soften the landing. 
 The book set off a debate so lively that conferences had to be organized. At one of them, as Mr. Kennedy explains in his new book, someone got up and told him he should stop worrying about nation-states and start thinking about forces that are "transnational" in nature. Mr. Kennedy did, and "Preparing for the 21st Century" is the penetrating result. In it, the news gets even worse than it was in "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers."
When Mr. Kennedy thought about transnational forces, what first came to mind was the English country curate Thomas Robert Malthus (1766-1834) and his dire observation "that the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man." Mr. Kennedy reflects that what allowed the British people to escape the fate Malthus predicted for them was first, emigration, second, the improvements in British farming that eventually constituted the Agricultural Revolution and third, the Industrial Revolution. Mr. Kennedy adds that a fourth solution had been suggested by earlier events in revolutionary France, "namely, internal unrest followed by external aggression."
Mr. Kennedy then writes, "Those same interrelated issues -- overpopulation, pressure upon the land, migration and social instability, on the one hand, and technology's power both to increase productivity and to displace traditional occupations, on the other -- still confront us today, with greater force than ever." The difference is the increased intensity of the problems now compared with the late 18th century.
Population is exploding, especially in the so-called developing regions of the world, Mr. Kennedy points out. According to the World Bank's calculations, there may be as many as 11 billion people on the earth by the second half of the 21st century. But the forces that saved humankind from a Malthusian fate, while still in effect, are likely to have more ambiguous consequences.
The poorer people of the world can still migrate but are less likely to be welcome wherever conditions are more promising. Biotechnological innovation will doubtless revolutionize agricultural productivity, but it "could lead to further tensions over agricultural trade, as food exporting countries like Australia and the United States find that their produce, while needed by developing countries unable to pay for it, is not required by rich nations increasingly able to create their own biotech substitutes at home."
Robotics and automation are on the verge of creating a new industrial revolution, Mr. Kennedy predicts. But while the resulting boost in productivity will benefit countries with a shortage of labor, like Japan, it will hurt countries with large pools of cheap, unskilled workers.
To complicate matters further, he argues, the rise of multi-national corporations is blurring the meaning of nation-states. Employing mainly manipulators of information, or "symbolic analysts," as Robert Reich has called them, these extraterritorial companies are likely to widen the gap between the haves and have-nots.
And on top of everything else, there is the environmental crisis to worry about: the pollution of the air; the depletion of water, forests and natural resources, and what the author regards as the inevitable heating of the planet's atmosphere through the greenhouse effect. While Mr. Kennedy's vision has a far-reaching sweep, it does not make for encouraging reading.
After reviewing these potential problems, the author turns his attention to "regional impacts," or the varying abilities of different parts of the world to cope. In chapters called "The Japanese 'Plan' for a Post-2000 World," "India and China," "Winners and Losers in the Developing World," "The Erstwhile U.S.S.R. and Its Crumbled Empire," "Europe and the Future" and "The American Dilemma," he analyzes the vulnerabilities of these various nations that are likely to make matters even worse.
Intended as "a guide to understanding global changes," not "as a technical primer for responses to them," "Preparing for the 21st Century" does not assess in detail the planet's chances of surviving. Still, the book's impact is crushing. Mr. Kennedy writes near the end: "It is inconceivable that the earth can sustain a population of 10 billion people devouring resources at the rate enjoyed by richer societies today -- or at even half that rate. Well before total world population reaches that level, irreparable damage to forests, water supplies and animal and plant species will have occurred, and many environmental thresholds may have been breached." When you come to the end, you are so depressed you barely have the strength to close the book.
Mr. Kennedy, on the other hand, whistles past the graveyard: "Nothing is certain except that we face innumerable uncertainties; but simply recognizing that fact provides a vital starting point, and is, of course, far better than being blindly unaware of how our world is changing." After all, he points out, even Malthus ended his "Essay on Population" on an upbeat note, allowing for the possibility that humankind could change its ways and avoid the fate predicted for it.
To this Mr. Kennedy adds, "The same is as true today." Yet one of the main points of his book is that what held for Malthus is less true today. Oh, well, maybe a conference can be organized to work things out.

HEADLINE: Connecticut's Strategy: Ingenuity and Investment

SERIES: Peace Penalty: Connecticut's Morning After -- Last of three articles

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Connecticut's struggles to heal its economy and stop the loss of jobs caused by military cutbacks have not turned the tide.
Economists say that while the end of the recession may yet lift the state's other industries, like insurance, banking and real estate, military contractors are unlikely ever again to require the number of workers they needed even five years ago. The implications of that fact resonate through just about every aspect of life in the state.
 
Along With Aid, More Setbacks
 "If you took Connecticut's difficulties and blew them up to the national level, you'd have social revolt in the streets," said Edward J. Deak, a professor of economics at Fairfield University. 
 Government has not given up.
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., for example, has begun one of the boldest efforts in the nation to help industry, including direct investments of state money to help military contractors develop new products. And the state's Congressional delegation is fighting on several fronts to win President Clinton's help, both in preserving weapons programs and in financing conversion efforts.
 
Continuing Layoffs
 Yet every day, it seems, there are more layoffs.
Just last month, Pratt & Whitney, the jet-engine maker, said it would dismiss a third of its Connecticut work force of 20,000 over the next two years. Pratt & Whitney had successfully cut its dependence on military sales to 30 percent of its overall sales, relying instead on a bustling commercial business -- until those orders fell off abruptly because of the airlines' continuing troubles.
 
Staggering, but Coping
 "It's almost like a boxer receiving two body blows," said Paul Getman, managing director of Regional Financial Associates, an economic research firm. Just like Pratt & Whitney, he said, the whole Connecticut economy has been hit from two sides: by military cutbacks and the recession. "They can survive one, but surviving two is very tough -- that's what they've got, two very severe body blows."
 
The Challenge
 Using Old Skills For New Demands
 
 
Unlike the situation in some states with big Air Force or Navy bases, a high proportion of Connecticut's military workers hold manufacturing jobs: skilled, high-technology manufacturing jobs making products for aerospace and undersea warfare. That group of skills is the state's great hope. If it is lost, economic development officials say, a whole segment of Connecticut's future could slip away with it.
Connecticut gave the world the Colt Peacemaker, known as the gun that won the West, and the Nautilus, the world's first nuclear submarine. Connecticut supplied cannons to George Washington, trench mortars to the doughboys of World War I, and M-16 rifles to the troops in Vietnam. Tank engines built in Connecticut drove the mechanized forces of the United States in the war in the Persian Gulf.
Now the race is on to save what can be saved. From the State Legislature, to the local communities that have banded in new alliances, to business executives and workers in plants across the state, the sense of urgency has ignited public debate about where Connecticut goes from here.
There are signals of change, if not outright hope.
"These people are New Englanders, they understand change, they live with the seasons," said John C. Markowicz, president of Sonalysts Inc., a diversified military contractor in Waterford. "People here still believe if you put your shoulder to the wheel, good things will come."
 
State as Venture Capitalist
 The State Department of Economic Development has received national attention for doing what in most states, and certainly in the Federal Government, would be considered taboo: investing taxpayer dollars directly in companies that the state believes are growing in the right direction.
Although only $9 million has been invested so far in three companies, the underlying ideas, and the risks, are large indeed. Just like venture capitalists on Wall Street, the state could make a handsome return on its investments, or lose everything.
"It's industrial policy," said the state's Commissioner of Economic Development, Joseph G. McGee. "We're trying to use these years to change public perception. We're saying that this will take a sustained commitment of Connecticut tax dollars in order to create an alternative industrial base."
"As long as we have winner investments, it's a home run," he said. "As soon as we blow $5 million on a deal that goes bad, all hell's going to break loose."
The state's first direct investments began early last year, with a $3 million infusion of tax money in Textron Lycoming, a military tank-engine maker that was seeking a commercial jet engine contract. Then Pratt & Whitney received $3 million to help re-engineer its aircraft jet engines as gas turbine generators to produce electricity. The Kaman Corporation, a helicopter parts maker just outside Hartford, got $3 million to help it market a new commercial heavy-payload helicopter.
 
A Daunting Crusade
 The state has also issued more than $200 million in loans, loan guarantees, and outright grants to manufacturers that might otherwise have left the state.
But time and time again, small steps forward have been overshadowed by walloping layoffs and plant closings. Even Governor Weicker's boundless optimism has seemed to flag.
Mr. Weicker, who has made a second career of appearing on shop floors around the state, announcing new grants and help for manufacturers, was cornered by reporters at the State Capitol just hours after Pratt & Whitney's most recent layoff announcement. Asked for his reaction, he paused. The silence continued as he stared down, lost in thought, until it seemed he would not speak at all.
"Obviously, first of all, one of sadness," he said, finally.
Other organizations have tried to help. The Naugatuck Valley Project, a nonprofit industrial development group, has helped arrange employee buyouts of some small military-dependent companies that were in danger of closing. In 1991 it induced a team of consulting engineers to work without pay on a plan to turn Textron Lycoming's tank engines into electrical generators that could run on methane gas from landfills. Company officials say the plan is under consideration.
 
Pockets of Job Growth
 Community leaders in southeastern Connecticut, the most military-dependent corner of the state, have banded together to ponder the region's future and decide the distribution of state and Federal grants. The Legislature has turned a corner, passing sweeping changes in how manufacturing is taxed and regulated.
Not all is gloom. Companies like Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, continue to expand in the state. Tourism has also expanded since the opening last year of the Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo and Casino in Ledyard, owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe. And many small companies in fields as diverse as computer-disk manufacturing and biotechnology are growing as well. Exports at some companies have also soared.
But economists say none of those things can drive the Connecticut economy. Wages in tourism are lower than in military work, and the smaller companies, though they might yet grow into giant employers, do not have the weight to ride to the rescue this time around.
 
'A Wake-Up Call'
 And the workers may not be there when those companies do grow. Although the unemployment rate was 7.4 percent in December, only one-tenth of a percentage point above the national December unemployment rate of 7.3 percent, economists say that one explanation may be that there are simply fewer people to count. Connecticut was the only state in the nation to lose population last year, according the Census Bureau. Between July 1, 1991, and July 1 1992, the number of residents shrank by 8,000, or two-tenths of 1 percent.
"Everyone has received a wake-up call within the last two years in Connecticut, and my sense is that there is some initiative that makes me more optimistic than I otherwise would have been," said the Rev. Kevin D. Bean, an Episcopal priest who has studied the military industry and who helped found the Naugatuck Valley Project in the 1980's.
"But the fact is," he added, "the ongoing and inevitable down-sizing of the whole Pentagon procurement system is going to have major impact on communities from East Hartford to Southington, Stratford and Bridgeport."
 
The Strategy
Asking for Help, Relying on Hope
 Connecticut's Democratic-led delegation in Congress waged a guerrilla war last year, calling in enough political debts to push through -- over the objections of President Bush -- approval for a second $2 billion Seawolf submarine to be built in Connecticut.
Now comes the hard part.
Having worked for the election of President Clinton, they face the task of getting the new Administration, however friendly it might seem, to focus on the type of multilayered problems that affect military-dependent areas like Connecticut.
"I haven't seen anything yet that indicates a real strategy," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat who led the Seawolf fight last year. "But at least they're interested in doing it."
The nine-member delegation -- six Democrats and three Republicans -- claims to have its own battle plan, hammered out in weekly meetings: get Connecticut as many military contracts as possible, while pushing for every possible dollar of a $1.8 billion economic conversion and relief fund, passed by Congress and likely to enter the Federal budget pipeline this spring.
 
Competition on All Fronts
 Another track is to push exports, to both military and civilian markets around the world, while fighting off other states with similar aims.
California, for example, has begun an effort to organize its huge delegation in Congress -- one-fifth of the House of Representatives -- to try to get its share, or more, of Federal military contracts and economic conversion aid.
Arizona has begun an aggressive effort to lure military companies, with national advertisements about the benefits of lower taxes and dry desert climates. The pitch has worked. Hamilton Standard, a unit of Hartford-based United Technologies, said late last year it would expand in Mesa, Ariz., where it will manufacture pneumatic valves now made in Windsor Locks.
Mr. Clinton's every utterance is being analyzed. During the campaign, he supported building a second Seawolf. But members of the Connecticut delegation believe the President has not closed the door on building even a third Seawolf.
Comments by Defense Secretary Les Aspin have also inspired vague hopes. Mr. Aspin favors bolstering the Navy's capacity to move troops and cargo by sea. That means more ships, which would probably be built at Newport News, Va., the Navy's main shipbuilding center. But if Virginia gets all that new business, the Pentagon might, out of fairness, shift to Connecticut some of the submarine maintenance work now going to Virginia, or so the thinking goes.
 
More Cooperation
 Military experts also say that Mr. Clinton has shown no inclination to deviate from his campaign promise to concentrate cuts on operational and maintenance accounts in the military budget rather than hardware purchases, a strategy that could favor Connecticut.
But Mr. Aspin's goals of beefing up the Navy's transport capacities could hurt the state, because Connecticut produces few products related to the building or maintenance of surface supply or troop ships.
"Aspin will buy different things than Cheney would," said Gregory A. Bischak, executive director of the National Commission for Economic Conversion and Disarmament, a nonprofit research group. "Connecticut is not well positioned to get those contracts."
There are signs, however, that the delegation may be at least getting the attention of the military contractors themselves, some of whom in the past have shown little inclination to discuss their affairs.
Officials of United Technologies, for example, said on Wednesday that they had agreed to a meeting next week in Washington with the Congressional delegation to discuss the job cuts at the company's Pratt & Whitney unit, and "whether there are things we can do together to focus attention on the condition of the U.S. aerospace industry."

HEADLINE: Tearing Down the Barricades to the Disabled;
New York City Is Seen as the Proving Ground for a Federal Anti-Discrimination Law

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
Federal law bans discrimination against the 43 million Americans with physical or mental impairments and promotes their employment rights and access to places to work, learn and shop. But it doesn't address the question of what to do when a motorized wheelchair short-circuits and catches fire while crossing 34th Street.
What it takes to bring down barriers to the disabled in New York City -- from developing emergency repair service for broken wheelchairs, to revamping subway stations -- gives a glimpse of the broad-scale changes it will take to make the goals of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act a reality.
 
New York's Experience
 If history is any guide, the rest of the country will be watching what happens with private and public initiatives here. The Federal law's provisions on access build significantly on New York's experience in the 80's, when the city became a leader in legal action to protect the disabled from discrimination, even using the language of local laws. 
 "The sentiment in Washington was that if regulation worked in New York with the country's largest -- and somewhat aged -- transit system, it would work anywhere," said James Weisman, a counsel for the Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association, which sued the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in the mid-80's and secured substantial changes, such as ramps and elevators at major subway stations.
Despite initial skepticism among M.T.A. officials about whether the disabled would ride public transit, the agency's records show that bus chairlifts are used 15,000 times a month. The bus fleet is 91 percent equipped with lifts. In addition, 22 subway stations now have elevators or ramps and renovation of others is planned, said Walter J. Noonan Jr., the authority's officer in charge of compliance with the Federal law.
 
New Subway Cars
 Now the agency is testing new subway cars with special areas for wheelchair users, investigating a Japanese-made escalator that accommodates wheelchairs, and developing individualized service for those unable to use public transportation.
The new career of Denise McQuade, who has spent 41 of her 44 years in a wheelchair, says something about gains by New Yorkers with disabilities -- and about how far they have to go.
On Sept. 30, 1981, Ms. McQuade swung out of her wheelchair and sat stubbornly for seven hours on the steps of an M.T.A. bus in Manhattan until the vehicle's chairlift was lowered so she could roll aboard. Her defiance inspired "Denise and the M.T.A.," a catchy song often performed by an advocacy group for the disabled.
Last month, an exuberant new chorus was added as Ms. McQuade went to work at the M.T.A. Her job: to help the authority, which is responsible for operating 3,600 buses and 6,000 subway cars, to comply with the Federal law.
 
Short-Circuit on 34th St.
 But even as government agencies help barriers fall, other obstacles arise -- like keeping a wheelchair in good operating condition on the mean streets of New York City.
Eileen Healey, board chairman of the Center for Independence of the Disabled, in Manhattan, knows those obstacles first-hand: It was her wheelchair whose motor caught fire on 34th Street.
Potholes are a more everyday menace, said Michael M. McIntyre who travels 75 minutes, by subway and bus, from his home in the Bronx to reach the Queens Independent Living Center, where he is director. The potholes can shake wires loose, leaving a wheelchair immobilized.
"A mechanized chair is a complex piece of machinery which will break, and its user is fortunate if there is a vendor willing to make repairs in a reasonable amount of time," said Ms. Healey. Her center and Mr. McIntyre's have been trying, so far without success, to secure an emergency repair service modeled on automobile clubs.
 
'Hidden Disabilities' Included
 Wheelchair users are the most visible members of the population covered by the Federal law. It also applies to those with visual or hearing losses, psychiatric illnesses and those with a range of "hidden disabilities," from epilepsy, cancer and diabetes to substance abuse.
The people who use wheelchairs and the people who sell and service them both have complaints about the government.
For poor people, the issue is the need for a physician's written prescription, and a guarantee of reimbursement by a government agency, before a new chair or major repair can be obtained -- a procedure that can take months.
And those who can afford to buy chairs themselves have no redress for defective chairs or shoddy repairs, said Ms. Healey. "Wisconsin has a 'lemon law,' but there has been no rush from other states to follow it," she said.
 
Getting to Work
 Vendors, in turn, complain that low reimbursement from Medicaid or Medicare make house calls uneconomic. A few of them hold "wheelchair clinics" at locations such as the International Center for the Disabled, where they make repairs and demonstrate new models.
But even the worry of wheelchair repairs is a luxury to disabled people still struggling to enter the work force.
"It's an old saw but the best social service program is a job," said Chris K. Olander, executive director of the J.M. Foundation, a private organization. "People with disabilities need to secure economic clout and not be tied to a welfare check."
His foundation and 32 other philanthropies created the Funding Partnership for the Disabled, which will give $2 million this year to community organizations to integrate the disabled into society, especially through employment.
 
Agencies See Progress
 Statistics are scarce about employment trends nationwide since the Federal law's adoption, but state agencies see progress.
"We know hundreds -- and there may be thousands -- are finding jobs in spite of the recession, not necessarily leading to careers but simply something to put bread on the table," said Rosemary Lamb in the State Office of the Advocate for the Disabled in Albany.
But in New York, 105,000 to 175,000 people with disabilities are looking for jobs, state agencies estimate. Organizations that place handicapped applicants say the recession has hurt hiring and forced them to shift strategies.
Just One Break in Manhattan, for instance, placed 250 people in jobs in the last year, down 25 percent from the year before. Consequently, said Mikki Lam, its executive director, "we are increasing the number of job rallies we hold, bringing together corporate employers and qualified disabled applicants."
 
Fewer Placed in Jobs
 With assembly line jobs disappearing, the National Center for Disability Services in Albertson, L.I., now focuses more on training for medical or environmental testing laboratories. It placed 300 people last year, also 25 percent fewer than in 1991.
"Still, those 300 people turned into wage earners now earn $4.5 million instead of the Government paying them $2 million in Social Security benefits," said Dr. Edwin Martin, the center's president.
Probably the strongest misgivings about the Federal law came from some business groups that argued that requirements for renovations in buildings could bankrupt small businesses. The objections focused on key but vague provisions in the voluminous act requiring those who own or operate "places of public accommodation," such as restaurants, hotels and shops, to remove architectural barriers if such changes are "readily achievable."
 
Avoiding Litigation
 Such worst-case scenarios have not occurred, said Justin Dart, chairman of the President's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities.
Six hundred complaints about accessibility have been filed with the Justice Department, but virtually all of these are being negotiated to avoid litigation.
Business groups and disability advocates alike say their strategy is to promote education and negotiation. The Better Business Bureau, for one, is working to bring its 250,000 members together with disability advocates, said Barbara Bode, executive director of the Bureau's Council.
"We're pushing voluntary compliance with the A.D.A.," she said of the Federal law. "And we're finding suddenly business recognizes there are 43 million new customers out there -- that's our line for 1993."
 
No Major Outcries
 The National Federation of Independent Business, representing 600,000 small businesses, has not heard major outcries, said Nelson Litterst, the federation's legislative representative. "It's too early to gauge impact, but we're urging members to utilize services such as Goodwill Industries' offer, without fee, to walk business managers through the workplace and recommend accessibility changes."
Recent studies made for United Cerebral Palsy Associations in 18 cities, including New York, said that, since the law was passed, 76 percent of the businesses surveyed reported making alterations in the workplace like building ramps or purchasing sound-amplifying equipment for the hearing impaired. More than half of the adjustments cost less than $100 apiece.
In New York City, members of Disabled in Action are touring neighborhoods and asking merchants to remove relatively small impediments such as a doorstep at the entrance. Frieda Zames, a mathematics professor who uses a wheelchair, visited 40 locations on Manhattan's East Side to push the "One Step" campaign. "A number complied and told me later they were getting new customers," she said.

Taking the Lead, Timidly

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Finally, the U.S. has accepted a leadership role in the Balkan crisis. That is the main point of the modest diplomatic initiatives unveiled yesterday by Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
Reversing the largely rhetorical and passive stance of the Bush Administration, President Clinton has now committed the U.S. to finding a comprehensive plan to combat the deadly virus of nationalism that threatens to obliterate hope for a new world order. 
 But there should be no illusions about yesterday's presentation. It represents a retreat from Mr. Clinton's promised tough approach. And the fact that Mr. Christopher did the unveiling shows the President does not want to commit himself fully and personally to this enterprise.
Also noteworthy, Mr. Christopher carefully sidestepped calling his offerings a "plan" or even a "policy." And rightly so. What he outlined was, rather, a means to a plan -- if one can be devised with the approval of the U.N., Western European allies, Russia and the warring parties in Bosnia themselves.
With the American military and allies all resisting the use of force, with allies and Russia refusing to arm Bosnian Muslims, with the U.N. digging in against deviations from the Vance-Owen peace plan and with widespread concern that foreign crises will divert energies from domestic priorities, the Christopher approach was probably the most Clinton aides could cobble together now.
At bottom, what Mr. Christopher presented reflected a series of complicated bureaucratic and diplomatic compromises, a tentative and temporizing patchwork that raises more questions than it answers.
First, how will the appointment of a special U.S. envoy avoid transforming a U.N. responsibility into an American responsibility? Such usurpation is wrong for the Bosnian crisis and disastrous for any long-term effort to strengthen the U.N. No effective plan for Bosnia will ever command the necessary international backing unless rooted in the Security Council.
Reginald Bartholomew, the envoy and a first-class pro, will be under great pressure from his superiors to act with or without Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen. But the lead should remain with them and the U.N.
Second, how can Mr. Christopher continue to speak publicly of supporting the Vance-Owen ethnic enclave proposal -- thereby undermining the Administration's own plans to modify it -- when he continues to damn it privately? If Clinton aides believe it is fundamentally flawed, their own efforts merely to modify it make little sense.
My own view is that no negotiated peace will be possible for some time. Bosnian hatreds run too deep. Even if the parties signed an agreement, they would bloody it daily. No peacekeeping force, of 50,000 or 100,000 or whatever, could stop them.
Third, while the Christopher approach thankfully offers to put new teeth into the economic embargo against Serbia, do Administration officials really believe this will compel Belgrade to stop the war, let alone roll back its territorial gains? The currency most appreciated in the Balkans, as elsewhere, is force.
Fourth, does Mr. Christopher's dance around the central issue of threatening and using force mean the U.S. will not prompt discussions of force for months to come? To be sure, he spoke of unspecified U.S. military involvement to enforce a treaty agreed to by all parties. He also alluded to the possible use of U.S. troops to help humanitarian deliveries. But these measures barely scratch the surface of what will be needed.
In my opinion, only the prospect of the West intervening and/or arming Croats and Bosnian Muslims can stun the Serbs into stopping. I know well the fears, difficulties and dangers in this course. But I am equally convinced that limited military means can be found to send the necessary messages and protect population centers and aid deliveries -- means and manpower far less than the 100,000 troops that will be needed to police any "negotiated" settlement.
European leaders know the futility of diplomacy without force. But rather than risk using force, they are prepared to accept the strategic and moral consequences of ethnic cleansing. Mr. Clinton, now that he has edged toward the Balkan inferno, must live up to American values.

HEADLINE: All Aboard the Economic Recovery Flier

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The merits of rail transportation, substantial compared with highways, have been overlooked in coverage of President Clinton's strategy of infrastructure investment for economic recovery. Our dependence on road transport exemplifies the inefficient use of resources in the United States. 
 Rail transport requires half the energy to carry a given number of people, needs one-eighth the space road transportation needs and costs one-sixteenth as much. Because rail can transport more people to a place, buildings can be built taller and less spread out, and the need for private parking is drastically reduced.
The research of David Alan Aschauer, an economist at Bates College, shows the net benefits of railroad investment are twice as large as highway investment and accrue positive results three times faster.
More than 72 percent of Americans support increased investment in public transportation options.
Budget makers in state houses and city halls should also redirect transportation investment from highways to railroads.

Ford Lost $7.4 Billion Last Year

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 10

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company posted an $840.3 million fourth-quarter loss today and a $7.4 billion loss for the year, largely reflecting accounting changes and one-time charges against earnings.
Without the special charges, however, Ford's yearly results were an improvement over 1991, when the nation's No. 2 auto maker also posted huge losses. 
 Still, Ford's loss was the largest ever reported by an American company, exceeding the record $5 billion annual loss posted by I.B.M. last month. On Thursday, however, the General Motors Corporation will break the record again. It is expected to report a 1992 loss estimated at $24 billion, also mostly caused by the changes in accounting standards.
Ford's yearly loss came on revenue of $100.1 billion and compared with a $2.3 billion loss in 1991 on revenue of $88.3 billion. An accounting change for retiree health benefits caused a one-time charge against 1992 earnings of $7.5 billion, and a new accounting standard for income tax resulted in a credit of $657 million. Excluding these changes, Ford lost $502 million for the year.
The loss in the fourth quarter of 1992 came on revenue of $25.4 billion and compared with a loss of $476 million in the fourth quarter of 1991 on revenue of $22 billion. The loss in the 1992 quarter included charges of $105 million for the accounting change and $419 million for a restructuring in Europe.
"We've had a big improvement in operating results from last year," said David N. McCammon, vice president for finance. He prediced that 1993 would be profitable.
Harold A. Poling, Ford's chairman, said in a statement, "We were encouraged by the substantial improvement in the profitability of U.S. automotive operations and a record profit from the financial services group." He blamed the recession in Europe for the company's poor financial results there.
Wall Street found encouragement in Ford's results, and the stock rose 87.5 cents today, to $49.75 on the Big Board.
Ford's worldwide automotive operations, excluding the accounting changes, lost $1.5 billion last year, compared with $3.2 billion in 1991. The company said it lost $405 million in American automotive operations and $1.1 billion in foreign auto operations in 1992.
Profits from financial services in the fourth quarter were $196.6 million, a drop from $236.6 million last year. But for 1992, financial services earned $1.03 billion, excluding accounting changes, up from $927.5 million in 1991. Ford's financial services consist of the Ford Motor Credit Company; the Associates, a consumer finance company, and First Nationwide savings and loans.
David Healy, automotive analyst for S. G. Warburg & Company in New York, said Ford's fourth-quarter operating loss, minus the accounting changes, was about a third greater than he had predicted because of large reserves to cover car warranties and other unexpected items. Another analysts saw problems ahead.
"Ford's gross profit margin actually declined in the fourth quarter" on a 24 percent increase in volume, said Wendy Needham of Smith Barney, Harris Upham in New York. Costs associated with the race between the Ford Taurus and Honda Accord for the leadership in car sales had contributed to the erosion of profit margin, she said.
With auto demand in the United States gaining strength and Ford preparing to introduce a promising new midsize car, the Mondeo, in Europe, 1993 will be profitable, Mr. McCammon, the Ford vice president, said.
But Europe's economy remains doubtful. Ford expects sales on the Continent to drop to 13.7 million vehicles this year, compared with 14.9 million last year. Ford is forecasting sales of 13.5 million cars and trucks in the United States this year, up from 13.1 million last year.

HEADLINE: TAIWANESE NAMED ISLAND'S PREMIER

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Taiwan's provincial Governor, Lien Chan, was nominated to be Prime Minister today, marking a major shift of power in the ruling Nationalist Party in the wake of democratic reforms.
President Lee Teng-hui nominated Mr. Lien at a meeting of the party's 31-member Central Standing Committee, which approved the decision. Parliament is scheduled to vote on Mr. Lien's confirmation this month. 
 Prime Minister Hau Pei-tsun, 73, a conservative Nationalist leader accused by the opposition of blocking democratic reforms, was forced to resign last week after losing a fierce battle between liberal and conservative factions in the ruling party.
Mr. Lien, 56, a liberal politician who heads the provincial government apparatus, would be the first member of the island's native Taiwanese majority to become Prime Minister. Mr. Hau and his predecessors were born in China and fled to Taiwan after Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Government lost the civil war to the Communists in 1949.
Democratic reforms that began with the lifting of martial law in 1987 are gradually shifting power into the hands of native Taiwanese. President Lee became the island's first native President in 1988.
 
Vows His Loyalty
 Mr. Lien, in a gesture of reconciliation toward the conservatives, said after his nomination that he would "loyally follow in Premier Hau's footsteps.'
Mr. Lien is expected to support President Lee's policies of democratic reform and the use of Taiwan's economic power to break out of the international isolation caused by its diplomatic rivalry with the Beijing Government.
He has affirmed his commitment to the ruling party's official goal of reunification with China, although many native Taiwanese leaders place less emphasis on this goal than do mainland Chinese like Prime Minister Hau.
Mr. Lien was Foreign Minister from 1988 to 1990 and has served as Vice Prime Minister, Communications Minister and deputy secretary general of the Nationalist Party.
He holds a doctorate in political science from the University of Chicago and was an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Connecticut in the 1960's. He comes from one of Taiwan's wealthiest families and is a millionaire.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 6, 1993, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article by Reuters on Feb. 11 about the nomination of the Provincial Governor of Taiwan, Lien Chan, to be Prime Minister referred to his background imprecisely. Although he is considered part of the native Taiwanese majority because his ancestors were born in Taiwan, he was born in mainland China and moved to Taiwan as a child.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed as Investors Await Trade Talk Resolution

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mixed against other leading currencies in light, technically driven trading yesterday as investors awaited the outcome of a standoff in trade talks between the United States and Japan.
Gold prices fell in New York after rising in Europe. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for April delivery, the most actively traded futures contract, lost $2, settling at $383.70 an ounce. 
 The dollar settled into a narrow range against the Japanese yen as traders awaited news on bilateral talks to narrow the nearly $60 billion United States trade deficit with Japan. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 108.30 yen, unchanged from Wednesday.
Japan's Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, is scheduled to meet President Clinton in Washington today. Mr. Clinton had set today as a deadline for reaching agreements to further open the Japanese market to American products.
"At this stage, the market's very undecided about what's going to happen," said Brian Halligan, yen trader at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. in New York. "Everyone's reading headlines and just reacting."
 
Sanctions Possible
 In recent weeks, the dollar has fallen against the yen on suspicion that the United States Government might try to drive up the Japanese currency to force the trade gap to shrink. But traders said yesterday that the United States Government might instead impose sanctions if the trade talks failed.
Sanctions could further batter the ailing Japanese economy and hurt the yen.
The dollar fell against the German mark after failing to top the 1.7650-mark level. The dollar's drop from the 1.7560-mark level, to 1.7530 marks, was "a very quick and violent move," as it set off prearranged orders to sell dollars, said Matt Porio, a vice president of Chase Manhattan.
The market was also awaiting the release today of the Producer Price Index for January from the Government.
"This is kind of critical because of all the inflation chatter going on," said Kevin Lawrie, director of foreign exchange at Mellon Bank. An unexpected surge in inflation at the producer level could point to higher interest rates, thus strengthening the dollar.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS LEADERS URGED BY CLINTON TO BACK TAX PLAN

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
President Clinton told business executives and their lobbyists face to face today that next week he would propose an increase in the top corporate income tax rate and a limit on the tax breaks that companies could take for their executives' salaries.
The proposals themselves were not completely new, but this was the first time since Mr. Clinton took office -- and probably the first time since he began his campaign -- that he had looked people in the eye and told them in public that they would have to give up something specific for the sake of reducing the Federal budget deficit. Until now, Mr. Clinton has only spoken generally about shared sacrifice. 
 "I need your support and your contribution," the President told about 200 business executives and their Washington lobbyists whom he had invited to the White House. "Everyone will have to pay their fair share. But if you do, we will all be better off, and the business community will be stronger in the years ahead."
 
Attack on 'Excessive Pay'
 He said that the top corporate tax rate would have to be raised in line with the increase he plans to propose in the top rate for individuals and that "the tax code should no longer subsidize excessive pay of chief executives and other high executives."
Mr. Clinton received a standing ovation at the beginning and the end of his speech, which was attended by many Cabinet members and was open to reporters. But afterward, some business leaders expressed their concern, and many others were reserved in their response.
Dirk Van Dongen, president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, an organization of small businesses, said: "I came out with many more questions than answers, and many strong concerns. We are very, very disturbed with this initiative with regard to corporate rates."
But others, especially those with Democratic connections, said that the President had been courageous and that they would back him. One was Barbara Davis Blum, chief executive of the Adams National Bank here, who was deputy administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Carter Administration.
"It's a bitter pill for people to swallow," she said. "It's a bitter pill for me to swallow. But what a gutsy thing for him to do -- telling the ones who would least like it."
At an earlier private meeting with a few of the most prominent executives, Mr. Clinton said he would propose some form of a tax on energy, according to John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer and a strong Clinton supporter. The President's top advisers have said publicly that an energy tax is in the cards, but this was the first time Mr. Clinton himself acknowledged it.
 
Program in Final Stage
 The 25-minute speech in the East Room was part of a drive by the President and his staff to build support for the economic program he plans to announce to Congress on Feb. 17.
Administration officials said the program was in the final stage of development and would probably be completed over the weekend. In an interview, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said the "job impact" of every idea was being weighed before it was included or excluded.
At a televised "town meeting" in a Detroit suburb on Wednesday night, Mr. Clinton began to prepare the ground for the sacrifices he would ask from ordinary Americans. He suggested more directly than he ever had before that rather than offer a tax cut, as he promised in his campaign, he would propose higher taxes on the middle class and would cut spending for popular programs.
 
Superfund Called a 'Disaster'
 In his speech today the President emphasized his intention to improve Government programs, and singled out the Superfund program for cleaning up toxic wastes as one that does not work. Under the program, which began in 1980 and is one of the largest environmental public works projects, the Government pays to clean up toxic waste dumps and then tries to get reimbursed by businesses that caused the problem.
"The Superfund has been a disaster," Mr. Clinton said. "All the money goes to the lawyers, and none of the money goes to clean up the problems that it was designed to clean up."
But what made today's speech most unusual was the directness with which the President spoke. He began by discussing the nation's long-term economic problems, saying that deficit reduction was "a critical part of a strategy to build jobs and growth for America today and in the long run."
He accused the Bush Administration of understating the size of the deficit and added: "I can sort of deny the problem and finesse the numbers, or I can tell you what I think is the truth. I think I should follow the latter course."
Then he addressed the business executives specifically. "We must ask your contribution to bringing the deficit down," he said, almost pointing his finger at his audience. "If the business community leads the way, Congress will follow. I need your help. I hope you'll be there."
Mr. Clinton, who wants to raise the top individual income tax rate, said he had been told by his Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, that there would have to be "a corresponding increase in the corporate tax rate to avoid tax shifting."
What that means is that if the top individual rate and the top corporate rate get too far out of line, tax lawyers and accountants will figure out ways for wealthy people to move income from one side of the ledger to the other to gain a tax advantage.
The top corporate rate, paid by all but the smallest profitable companies, is now 34 percent, compared with a top rate for individuals of 31 percent. The President's comments suggest that if he fulfills his campaign promise to propose raising the top individual rate on families with incomes above $200,000 to 36 percent, then he might also propose lifting the corporate rate to that level.
The idea of limiting the tax deductibility of executives' salaries is more amorphous. Now, companies can write off the entire cost of all salaries as a business expense. Mr. Clinton suggested during the campaign last year that salaries above $1 million should not be deductible.
 
'Excessive' Executives' Pay
 But today he added a new fillip, saying that "excessive" pay should not be deductible, and defining excessive as "unrelated to the productivity of the enterprise."
Mr. Clinton has never been specific about whether he considered stock options and other kinds of compensation in the same realm as salaries.
Several executives at the meeting were critical of the proposal on deductions of salaries, and wondered how the Government could possibly have a fair rule to gauge the productivity of a company.
"He's going to have a very difficult time selling that," said William B. Blount, chairman of an investment banking company in Alabama. "It's not a good idea, the Federal Government regulating corporate America."
Mr. Blount, incidentally, is chairman of the Democratic Party in Alabama.

HEADLINE: Older Cities Relying More on Suburbs' Taxes

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Lighted letters still shout this old factory city's historic boast from a bridge over the Delaware River: "Trenton Makes, The World Takes." But these days Trenton, like most of the other big, once-rich cities in the region, is the taker, not the maker, when it comes to paying for its municipal budget.
As investment has fled to the suburbs or to more newly developed parts of the country, cities have begun relying less on their own tax receipts and more on tax revenue raised in the suburbs and redirected as state aid. (New York City, helped by an economic rebound in the 1980's, became an exception to the trend.) At the same time, outside aid is making up an ever smaller part of the budgets of the newer metropolitan areas that have grown up at former suburban crossroads. 
 And though President Clinton may be more sympathetic than his predecessors to urban needs, what he can actually do collides with the reality of Federal budget deficits.
The tug-of-war, reflecting the fact that older cities retain political clout, if not economic, has carried a price for both the aging urban communities and the emerging satellite cities.
"In the small cities, local taxpayers are paying a bigger and bigger portion of the cost of their government and more and more of the taxes that go to other cities, but less and less is coming back to us," said Eileen M. Earl, budget director for White Plains.
 
City Against City
 White Plains derived 7.5 percent of its $40 million budget from state aid in 1980, but 5.5 percent in 1990. Meanwhile, Buffalo, the state's second largest city, increased the aid-provided share of its budget to 69 percent from 66.4 percent.
Ms. Earl calls that unfair, arguing that White Plains is not exempt from urban problems. For example, she said, it has a shelter for homeless people, financed by Westchester County, that requires frequent attention from the city's police and fire departments without compensation.
But older cities also pay for the shift in aid, with an erosion of local autonomy, as decisions affecting a housing project, a new school building or a health program are increasingly being made in state legislatures or Federal offices instead of City Hall. In New Haven, where state and Federal aid pays 53.4 percent of the bills, officials grumble about the strings attached to outside aid, but feel they have to lobby for it anyway.
"Our property tax base is so overburdened that we take what is offered," said Jane Ciarleglio, director of intergovernmental affairs. "But the requirements can be so demanding and so full of rules of the things we can and can't do, that there are times when we do say to ourselves, maybe we just shouldn't take it."
 
Greenwich Can Afford 'No'
 Rich towns have that choice: this winter, Greenwich, Conn., decided not to apply for Federal disaster relief to repair storm-damaged beaches. The town feared that Federal help would also mean Federal rules opening the beaches to nonresidents.
Greenwich received 16 percent of its revenues in state and Federal funds in 1980; today the figure is 7 percent, said William J. Bliss, the Town Comptroller.
A reliance on outside aid also opens city administrations to outside scrutiny. In the 1970's, Mayor Hugh Ad donizio of Newark campaigned for extensive state aid to the city's schools. The legislative debate focused attention on longstanding reports of corruption, which eventually led to Mayor Addonizio's conviction.
Perhaps no two cities better reflect the way the fiscal balance can shift than New Haven, a historic manufacturing city, and its neighbor down the coast, Stamford. Both cities are about the same size, with New Haven slightly larger; both have manufacturing pasts that provided early wealth, and both have their shares of urban problems. In 1970, each derived about a quarter of its income in aid.
 
Tale of 2 Tax Bases
 But over the next two decades, Stamford was more successful than New Haven in riding the corporate office boom, rebuilding its downtown and adding millions to its tax base. In 1990, as a result, New Haven's reliance on outside aid more than doubled, to 53 percent of total revenues, while Stamford's share fell to half its former level, to about 13 percent.
Similarly, Trenton derived just 9.5 percent of its general revenues from state and Federal aid in 1960, when it was still a steel and ceramics center for the Delaware Valley, but 64.4 percent from outside its borders in 1990, after most of its big factories closed.
In New York City, a brush with bankruptcy in the 1970's raised the level of outside aid for the city to 46 percent of revenues. But the city's long stretch of prosperity during the 1980's dropped its 1990 aid share to 38 percent, far below Buffalo's 69 percent and Syracuse's 62 percent.
Still, from universities to hospitals, New York City is a huge consumer of aid: the $12.3 billion it received from state and Federal coffers in 1990 was 27 percent of all aid given to all municipalities nationally that year, according to Census Bureau figures.
Aid levels are not directly comparable among cities because in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, aid figures do not always include welfare payments. Welfare is a county and state responsibility, so public assistance payments are reflected in New York City's aid budget, but not for Trenton, White Plains or New Haven, which are part of larger counties. If a direct comparison of aid levels is attempted, New York City is getting an even smaller percentage than, say, New Haven, because New York's 38 percent includes outside welfare contributions while New Haven's 53 percent does not.
Some experts on urban affairs implicitly criticize the cities as becoming too reliant on outside money.
"In the years between the end of the Civil War and the First World War, New York City built its massive subway system, a water system which is one of the world's wonders, without Federal aid or subsidy or even much borrowing," said Roger Starr, editor of The City Journal, a quarterly of the Manhattan Institute. "We built it, but now we can't run the subways without 40 or 50 cents for every dollar coming from the state or the Federal Government."
Others regard the reliance of the older cities on the states as an inevitable result of the flight of investment from cities and the corresponding concentration of the poor behind the city line.
Peter Salins, chairman of the urban planning department at Hunter College, argues that the flow of suburban taxes to the cities marks a necessary and desirable integration.
"I want to change the lexicon," he said. "Newark may have in some earlier time been independent, but today it is functionally the same as Brooklyn, a part of the greater New York City urban area, and it is under no more obligation to be self-reliant today than Brooklyn is."
 
Suburbs' Protection Money
 Mr. Salins regards the tax transfer from suburb to city as a form of protection payment against the ills of the city.
"If the cities were once the economic locomotives, why then are we now tolerating them as cabooses?" he asked. "Because they are the poorhouses, quite simply, and if the poor were not living in these older decaying satellite cities, where will they live?
"They will not vanish, they will not disappear into thin air, they will not go to Ohio. So the suburbanites and the more affluent residents of the central cities are content to pay the additional taxes to keep the undesired households and the undesired activities, the warehouses and so on, where they are."
His theory is small comfort to Bridgeport, Newark and other cities starved for money. Urban interest groups do have some hope that the Clinton White House will at least make it possible for them to struggle for pieces of a slightly bigger aid pie. Since President Clinton's inauguration, appeals for more urban aid have come from the National League of Cities, the United States Conference of Mayors and the Urban League.
 
A System of Boundaries
 John Yinger, an economist at Syracuse University, argues that since the state and Federal governments created a system of boundaries that lets jobs and investment abandon impoverished sections for more prosperous ones, then the state and Federal governments should help maintain services for the people left behind.
"I don't think of it as dependency, because that suggests that they have alternatives," he said. "The old cities are not in this position because they are screwing up; it's because they are facing very harsh conditions."
In fact, said Mayor Douglas H. Palmer of Trenton, the region's cities already put a heavier tax burden on their property owners than the suburbs, and yet need still higher levels of state and Federal aid.
"Our homeowners are already very heavily taxed, and we just had a revaluation that hit many people even harder," he said after announcing a campaign to wrest more aid from the State Legislature.
Beyond the education budget, 65 percent of Trenton's city budget is for police and fire protection, Mayor Palmer said. "If you want to lay people off, that's where the big bucks are, and in this day and age, who can talk about cutting back on public safety?" he said. "So we are stuck between the rock of cutting services and the hard place of raising taxes, and we can't really do either."

A Plan for Close-Up Images of Earth From Space

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 11

 BODY:
A small California company formed by a scientist who worked on the military's so-called Star Wars program has been licensed by the Government to launch a series of photo satellites that will make it possible for customers to directly dial up high-resolution images of earth and view them on their personal computers.
The new system, even though capable of producing the highest-quality commercially available images from space, will not approach the close-up power of military spy satellites, which is why the Department of Defense agreed to permit the license for the relatively weaker system. Military satellites can discern objects as small as one foot in diameter, civilian experts say. The permit is the first granted under a law passed last year by Congress.
 
Political and Economic Impact
 Readily and widely available high-resolution images of the earth could have a significant political and economic impact, according to business experts and Government officials. Besides making it harder for the world's military powers to launch surprise attacks, the pictures might be used for purposes like corporate espionage or news gathering. 
 The Worldview Imaging Corporation, an Oakland, Calif., start-up venture with Silicon Valley financing, received approval for the project from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in January.
The company was founded early last year by Walter Scott, a computer scientist who until the end of 1991 was the head of the controversial Lawrence Livermore Laboratories projects "Brilliant Pebbles" and "Brilliant Eyes," which are part of the Strategic Defense Initiative -- the formal name for the Star Wars program. His co-founder was Doug Gerull, an executive at the Intergraph Corporation, the leading company in the geographic information systems market.
"If the imagines are cheap and available quickly, this will change a lot of things," said Mr. Gerull, Worldview's chief executive. "You could sit at your desk and get an image from anywhere on the earth."
The resolution of the Worldview system is still nowhere near what the United States Government spy satellites can obtain. Those systems can take pictures that clearly show objects as small as footballs, while the Worldview system would show objects of "under three meters," according to several people familiar with the project. Still, that would be enough resolution to distinguish objects the size of cars and military vehicles.
Moreover, it would be significantly more resolution than is currently possible from Government public systems like the United States Landsat satellites used for map making and other data gathering, or the French Spot system used for similar purposes. Spot can resolve images up to about 10 meters while Landsat's resolution is about 30 meters.
The Worldview project is certain to generate interest -- and controversy. High-resolution images have been a closely protected technology by the nations that are space powers because of the crucial military and economic information the pictures contain. Currently the United States, France and the Soviet Union are selling only lower-resolution images to a variety of commercial concerns, ranging from agribusiness and petroleum companies to environmental organizations searching for evidence of pollution.
If all goes as planned, the company will begin supplying satellite photos in 1996 from a single small satellite and gradually add additional satellites to make it possible to get quicker turnaround time on a photo request from a customer.
Industry analysts said that Mr. Gerull had been a significant force in turning Intergraph into the leading player in the geographic information systems, or G.I.S., market. This computer hardware and software is increasingly being used by both corporations and local government planners in sophisticated data-analysis applications.
Last year the G.I.S. market was $2 billion, according to Kathy Hale, a market researcher at Dataquest in San Jose, Calif. Ms. Hale said that she expected the market to double by 1996 and that growth of G.I.S. would be fueled in part by the availability of cheap satellite imagery such as Worldview's.
"It's really a Government monopoly and this will provide some healthy free-market competition," she said.
One of the most influential backers of Worldview, and a member of its advisory board, is Edward Teller, the architect of the hydrogen bomb. Mr. Teller has been a vocal proponent of a global satellite observation system for military, economic and environmental applications.

HEADLINE: Experts See Tax Curbs on Executives' Pay as More Political Than Fiscal

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
The effects of President Clinton's plan to limit corporate tax deductions for paying seven-figure salaries would probably be more political than economic, some experts on executive compensation said yesterday.
The plan could hit hard at high-salary industries like Wall Street, Hollywood and big time sports, which might make it easier for middle-class people to swallow a tax increase, these experts said. 
 But the money raised for the Treasury could be relatively inconsequential, perhaps several hundred million dollars, which would be only a ripple in a multibillion-dollar ocean of debt.
 
End of a Subsidy?
 Reviving an idea he raised during last year's campaign, Mr. Clinton said corporate taxes would have to rise so the tax code would "no longer subsidize excessive pay for chief executives and other high executives."
Companies have been able to write off the entire cost of salaries as a business expense. Mr. Clinton suggested during the campaign that salaries above $1 million should not be deductible. He never specified whether he considered stock options and other kinds of compensation in the same realm as salaries.
Jude T. Rich, chairman of Sibson & Company, a consulting firm based in Princeton, N.J., said the effects of the change would be fairly widespread among large corporations, especially if stock option gains were included. "That's where the big money is," he said.
He said that the average chief executive's pay at the 20 largest companies last year was $4 million to $5 million and that a majority of chief executives in Fortune 500 companies received more than $1 million. But he said the benefit for the Treasury would be "just peanuts: a couple of hundred millions."
 
'Where All the People Are'
 He added, "It's purely a gesture to the middle class," because they will have to pay through tax increases or Social Security cuts if the President wants more revenue. "That's where all the people are."
The proposal quickly drew criticism on Wall Street, where not only the most senior executives, but scores of others, are paid more than $1 million a year.
But few on Wall Street are likely to be immediately concerned, at least while the times are good. While calling on changing the tax code for excessive compensation, Mr. Clinton specifically defined such excess as any payments "unrelated to the productivity of the enterprise."
At first blush, that could leave Wall Street at least partly off the hook. After all, the majority of the money in a Wall Street executive's annual pay comes from the year-end bonuses. The bonuses come from a pool of capital funded during the year, and each executive's amount is set by a committee at the firm, arguably linking the whole process to the firm's productivity.
 
Good Pay in Bad Times
 But Wall Street has never been known for containing itself, and has been known to keep paying hefty amounts even when times are bad. In 1990, for example, the entire industry posted a loss, which analysts said would not have happened if compensation levels had fallen to the degree the business had.
"Wall Street goes up on the upside, but they dont go down when things are tough," said John Keefe, president of Keefe Worldwide Information Services, a consulting firm to the financial services industry. "This kind of plan will cause Wall Street to rethink its compensation scheme."
In the sports world, the Clinton plan was viewed as potentially having "a disastrous impact" on major league baseball, said an official in a league office who asked that his name not be used.
Currently, player contracts are regarded as depreciating expenses by owners of the 28 teams. Last year, 265 players made more than $1 million, to bring the average salary in the major leagues to "well above" that figure, the official said. "Without those tax deductions, he added, "we would have to drastically alter the structure of our game."
While he declined to speculate on what changes might be required if the proposal became law, he said the effect would be different on different teams because of the way player contracts are structured by team owners. Some owners amortize the contracts over longer periods.
Hollywood executives, reached last night, said they would need to see details of the Clinton plan. "It is too early to comment and I'm not sure what it means," said a senior executive at one studio who also insisted on not being identified.

HEADLINE: With Jeers for the West, Iran Cheers 14 Years of Revolution

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Hundreds of thousands of Iranians accompanied by battalions of the armed forces converged on Freedom Square in Teheran today in a Government-sponsored rally marking the day the military capitulated to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, bringing the fall of the monarchy 14 years ago.
While President Hashemi Rafsanjani said in a speech today that the West must reassess its attitude toward Iran, marchers labeled the United States "the mother of all corruption." 
 Huge crowds waved framed photographs of senior Iranian clerics, as the voice of Mr. Rafsanjani, broadcast over towering loudspeakers, declared that the Iranian "people are quite happy and love their revolution."
"Western analysts must reassess their attitude about Iran," Mr. Rafsanjani said. "Don't label us fundamentalist or terrorist."
Mr. Rafsanjani said that the sheer appeal of the Islamic revolution ruled out emulating Western models of the multiparty system.
"Our struggle against the West is not a war," said Hamid Shariatpour, a 22-year-old Teheran cleric. "It's a cultural struggle in which we must replace the negative with something positive."
In recent weeks, while the state-run media and senior Iranian leaders made accusations of Western ploys "to reflect a negative image of Iran" according to a commentary on Iranian television, few have dealt with economic pressures and Iran's damaged international creditworthiness.
Since last March, the late payments on short-term loans due to the Central Bank of Iran's indiscriminate opening of letters of credit have provoked concern in foreign banks.
Mr. Rafsanjani told a gathering of foreign diplomats in Teheran yesterday that Iran "as a member of the world community understands the need for peaceful cooperation." "In the second half of this year, we had some difficulty in paying our short-term credit," he said. "This is being eliminated."
But even though Mr. Rafsanjani adopted a more conciliatory tone yesterday, marchers publicly condemned the United States.
Massoumeh Robatjazi, 13, described walking in the annual rally as "a family tradition."
"I just repeat the slogans the other people give to show our unity," Miss Robatjazi said. "My favorite is, 'Death to America' ."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury's Auction Sets Off a Rally

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The Treasury's auction of 30-year bonds went well yesterday and sparked a rally that turned a so-so three-day quarterly auction into a better one, traders said. President Clinton also helped, as the yield on the new 30-year bond dropped to 7.15 percent.
The $35.5 billion three-day sale of Treasury notes and bonds was the first quarterly auction under Mr. Clinton. Coming after a strong rally since January and ahead of the disclosure of the President's economic plan next week, it could have been a perfect excuse for a big correction. 
 But after it was all over yesterday, the market had only moved a little above the low yields for the year reached last Friday. And Mr. Clinton, in his appearance in suburban Detroit Wednesday night and in comments to businessmen at the White House yesterday, was still saying the things that have made many investors and traders believe that he is serious about reducing the record Federal budget deficit.
 
 
'Did Himself Proud'
 "Mr. Clinton did himself proud over the last 24 hours by focusing people back on deficit reduction," said Joseph Liro, the chief economist at S. G. Warburg & Company.
By late in the day, those who bought the 30-year bond at its average yield of 7.22 percent were well into the black as the yield dropped to 7.15 percent, which is down from the 7.21 percent in the when-issued, or pre-auction, market Wednesday and from 7.25 percent on the old 30-year bond.
The successful sale of $9.33 billion of 30-year bonds, which was at the lowest yield since the 30-year bond began to be regularly auctioned in February 1977, sets the stage for a another test of the 7.1 percent closing low for the 30-year bond that was reached in April 1986. Before yesterday, the lowest yield reached since 1986 was the 7.15 last Friday. The new bond has a 7.125 percent coupon, also the lowest since 1977.
Whether the 7.1 percent level can be broken will depend a lot on the deficit-cutting plan that Mr. Clinton outlines next week. Many traders and investors have been buying the 30-year bond in part because they are expecting the President to be able to cut the budget deficit.
The 30-year bond auction also touched off a rally in the rest of the market that helped improve the fortunes of buyers of the three-year notes and 10-year notes in the first two parts of the Treasury's quarterly auction Tuesday and Wednesday.
 
 
'No More Worries'
 "Once it was over there was no more paper and no more worries and we had a relief rally," said Jay Goldinger, a bond trader at Capital Insight in Los Angeles.
The three-year note was back in the black as the yield dropped to 4.7 percent, below the 4.73 percent average at the auction and well below the 4.78 percent it jumped to after Wednesday's selloff.
The new 10-year bond, whose poor auction set off selling Wednesday, was still in the red, but much better off. The new note was auctioned at a average yield of 6.33 percent but jumped to 6.41 percent by the end of Wednesday trading. Yesterday the yield worked its way back down to 6.36 percent.
Traders said that there were several factors that made the 30-year auction go well. One was that the 10-year auction went so poorly Wednesday and the selloff that followed pushed up the yield on the new 30-year bond, making it cheaper and more likely that buyers could count on some profits.
 
 
Speculation on Further Reduction
 In addition, many traders are still speculating that the Treasury will make a further reduction in the regular size of the 30-year auction at the next quarterly sale in May. The Treasury cut the size of this auction by $1 billion.
There was also speculation that some speculators were making bets yesterday that the spread between the yields on long-term securities and shorter-term securities would narrow. To make this bet an investor buys bonds and sells shorter-term securities. There was also talk that Goldman, Sachs & Company was an especially large buyer of bonds.
The report that retail sales rose three-tenths of 1 percent in January gave a little support to the market in the morning because the increase was a littler less than expected. There seemed to be little impact from the decline of 12,000 in initial jobless claims, to 340,000, in the week ending Jan. 30.

HEADLINE: Casino Owner Offers Lure: $140 Million in New Taxes

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas casino owner, said today that his company, Mirage Resorts, would guarantee the state at least $140 million a year in tax revenue, about 1.6 percent of the entire 1993 state budget, if casinos were legalized for Hartford and Bridgeport.
The total, which Mr. Wynn told a legislative committee would be backed by the "full faith and credit" of his company, was far more than the $50 million that Mirage officials had mentioned in past lobbying efforts, and reflects the heights to which Connecticut's debate over gambling have climbed in just the last few weeks. 
 
 
The Pequot Pact
 Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and the Mashantucket Pequot Indian tribe, which operates the state's only casino, in Ledyard, signed an agreement last month under which the tribe pledged $100 million a year to the state in exchange for the right to operate slot machines. Under that agreement, which was intended by Mr. Weicker to short-circuit the casino movement, the tribe would be released from any obligation to make payments if the Legislature were to legalize slot machines anywhere else in the state.
Apparently by coincidence, the State Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, issued a long-delayed legal opinion today concluding that the agreement was legal and binding upon both parties and was not, as some state lawmakers had charged, a usurpation of legislative authority by the Governor.
Mr. Blumenthal, who was not consulted by the administration in negotiating with the tribe, said he believed the agreement could not be overturned by the Legislature, and did not require any approval by Federal authorities either.
He said he thought that the agreement could not be overturned by anyone, ever, without the consent of both parties. What that means, he said, is that Mr. Weicker has committed the state in perpetuity; even if future governors or legislatures wanted to withdraw from the pact with the Pequots, they could not do so unless the tribe consented. Connecticut can refuse to take the tribe's money, but the slot machines are there to stay, Mr. Blumenthal said.
 
Fairness Concerns
 Mr. Weicker's pact with the tribe, while praised by lawmakers as a deft political maneuver, has been criticized by some municipal leaders, who say the $100 million in proceeds is not being fairly distributed around the state. Bridgeport, for example, the state's largest city and one of the poorest, would get only $1.8 million, while Farmington, a wealthy suburb of Hartford, would get $3.2 million.
Mr. Wynn, who was testifying at the Capitol at the very moment that Mr. Blumenthal was issuing his opinion on the Pequot pact, also said he disagreed with the Attorney General's interpretation, and said he thought the tribe could stop payments at any time and the state would be unable to do anything about it.
 
The Social Effects
 But money is only part of the issue. Some legislators questioned Mr. Wynn sharply about the effects his casinos might have on crime rates and gambling addictions, and what guarantees he could make that the residents of the cities where casinos would be built would benefit.
Mr. Wynn said that large crowds always produce higher levels of crimes like pocket picking and purse snatching that have nothing to do with gambling, and that gambling addicts are more prone to bet on horses and state lotteries than at casinos.
For Mr. Weicker, however, Mr. Wynn had only kind words. He said the Governor's deal with the tribe -- by giving the state a cut of the profits in gambling at Ledyard -- had transformed the debate from one of policy and politics to one centering on the economy and jobs.
"He got it down to the terms we thought it ought to be," Mr. Wynn said. Mr. Blumenthal said in his opinion that the pact between the Pequots and the state did not forestall any legislative action on the gambling bills before the General Assembly, including a proposal to authorize slot machines at off-track betting parlors and jai-alai frontons.
But he said he agreed with the administration's position that any such action, if it legalized slot machines, would release the tribe from its financial obligation to the state.

The executive director of Unicef has recommended that the relief agency keep its headquarters in Manhattan rather than moving to Westchester County or elsewhere.
Under a proposal by the Dinkins administration and a city-state agency, the rent that Unicef pays for its current headquarters at 3 United Nations Plaza would be cut, and Unicef would be given ownership of the building in 2026. 
 Unicef, formally called the United Nation's Children's Fund, has 950 employees in New York City. Mayor Timothy C. Idoni of New Rochelle, which had been courting the agency, vowed not to give up the fight, but New York officials said the recommendation announced yesterday made it highly unlikely that Unicef would move.
The current owner of the 203,000-square-foot building at 3 United Nations Plaza, between First and Second Avenues on a renamed section of 44th Street, is the city-state agency, the United Nations Development Corporation. It expects the bonds issued to pay for the building's construction to be paid off in 2026, after which it would transfer ownership to Unicef. The city, which owns the land at the site, would give that to Unicef.
In addition, the Development Corporation is negotiating to buy an additional 200,000 square feet of space for Unicef Unicef or the United Nations would also similarly be able to obtain ownership of the new space eventually and it, too, would be exempt from real estate taxes.
Unicef's executive board has the final say on where Unicef goes, but city officials were confident that the major hurdle had been overcome when they obtained the backing of Unicef's executive director, James P. Grant. "I think we're the majority of the way there," said Barry F. Sullivan, Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development.
Mr. Grant said alternatives to Manhattan would be less costly, but the statement said the "paramount considerations for the basis of his decision" were location: He decided that there would be "major disadvantages" to not being very close to the United Nations headquarters and the Permanent Missions to the United Nations.

HEADLINE: U.S. Panel Urges Setting Export Target Levels

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
The chairmen of some of the nation's largest corporations said today that Federal trade officials should establish temporary market-share targets for American exports.
In a report, the executives, members of the Government's top advisory panel on trade, said the targets were needed because Japan still imports a smaller percentage of its manufactured goods than any other major industrial nation, despite the removal through negotiations of many regulatory trade barriers in Japan. 
 These persistently low purchases from abroad, the report said, reflect the existence of "invisible barriers" to trade in Japan. As evidence, they cited that nation's system of interlocking ownership among companies.
But the panel also said that a failure by Tokyo to meet targets should not be enough, by itself, to justify retaliation against Japanese exports.
 
Guarantee of Market Share
 Under a system of market-share targets, a government -- for instance, the United States -- obtains agreement that a set percentage of a product used in the other country be foreign-made. A big chunk of that foreign share would presumably be American. The idea is controversial because some free-trade proponents argue that any such arrangement represents managed trade.
The release of the report today coincided with the arrival here of Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, who met briefly with President Clinton at the White House.
After the meeting, Mr. Clinton said they had agreed that "we shouldn't be protectionist in our relationship." But he said he also told the Japanese official that he would press efforts to bring down the trade deficit, "and that I would be working with him on it very firmly."
A Japanese official here with Mr. Watanabe said Tokyo opposed specific market-share targets. "It would be highly surprising," the official said, "if we accepted the existence of invisible barriers, and therefore it would be highly surprising if we would accept" such targets.
 
Stability or Monopoly?
 But former American trade negotiators have said that Japanese officials have in fact been receptive to such arrangements, which tend to produce a more stable market but can also encourage the development of industrial cartels that charge high prices to consumers.
The panel that issued today's report is formally the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations. It was created by Congress in 1974 and includes the heads of I.B.M., A.T. & T., American International Group, Boeing, Dow Chemical,Eastman Kodak and Chase Manhattan, along with 37 other top officials from corporations, trade associations, academia and labor.
Their report shows the extent to which large American corporations like to have the Government take their side in trade disputes, even though many of them say they are strong advocates of free trade.
The use of specific market-share targets, besides evoking the managed-trade argument, would have the effect, critics say, of insulting a valuable ally like Japan by trying to dictate economic policy.
But Timothy J. Regan, a vice president at Corning Inc., who helped draft the report, said the use of targets did not represent managed trade because the targets would not be directly linked to any reductions in American imports from Japan if they were not met. Equating targets with managed trade, he said, "is like saying if you have a tariff, you're protectionist -- it's simplistic."
He added that the panel had made a similar if less specific recommendation of market-share targets in 1989.
 
Accord on Semiconductors
 The semiconductor industry is one cited by people on both sides of the argument. The Bush Administration's 1991 agreement with Japan noted the two Governments' "expectation" that foreign semiconductors would make up 20 percent of the Japanese market by the end of 1992.
But it did not say what would happen if the target were not met. Final figures are scheduled to be released on March 17, and are widely expected to fall short of 20 percent.
Tokyo officials contend that the Americans' market share has not risen as planned because the Japanese recession has stunted the market and encouraged Japanese electronics companies to stick with their longtime domestic suppliers.
But the American share did not grow in the late 1980's, when Japan's economy was thriving. Japanese officials argued then that demand was growing so rapidly that their electronics manufacturers could not be expected to buy foreign semiconductors at the faster rate required to enable other nations' market share to grow.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Gained 0.3% Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Consumers kept on spending in January, pushing retail sales up three-tenths of 1 percent, the Commerce Department reported today. Department stores and automotive dealers recorded the biggest gains.
While the overall increase was a bit shy of expectations -- and was accompanied by a downward revision for December -- analysts said they were not worried that the economic rebound was losing momentum. Rather they saw the results, based as usual on partial data, as continuing an upward trend that has generated six increases in seven months. 
 "It's doing fine," said John E. Silvia, an analyst for Kemper Financial Services, referring to the one-third of the economy accounted for by retailing. "It's not a boom -- but we don't want a boom."
 
 
Jobless Claims
 In a separate report, the Labor Department said first-time claims for unemployment insurance fell 12,000 in the last week of January, to 340,000, the second straight decline after three consecutive increases.
The latest doses of favorable economic news came as the Clinton Administration began to make the remaining final decisions about the legislative package the President is to introduce formally on Wednesday. It is to consist of short-term stimulus on the order of $25 billion to $30 billion and a four-year strategy for reducing the budget deficit through spending cuts and tax increases.
Consumers pushed $167.4 billion across retail counters last month, with a 1.1 percent jump in sales of durable goods more than offsetting a slight decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in the nondurables sector. Durable goods are expensive items from home appliances to autos that are expected to last at least three years; nondurables are less costly items like food and clothing.
 
 
'Even Growth Track'
 This was enough to show the economy remains on an "even growth track," said John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers. He said he found little evidence in the latest data -- including a recalculation of December's gain to eight-tenths of 1 percent from 1.2 percent -- that consumers had retrenched to pay off holiday debt or in anticipation of smaller income-tax refunds.
Tracy Mullin, president of the the National Retail Federation, the largest trade group, hailed the January results, the third consecutive monthly gain. "This upward trend is continuing, and it proves that the industry is well on the way to a solid recovery," she said.
The $62.1 billion in sales of durable goods last month included gains in all major categories -- 1.1 percent for automotive dealers, eight-tenths of 1 percent for merchants selling building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes, and six-tenths of 1 percent for those selling furniture and home furnishings.
The retail figures are adjusted for normal seasonal variations and for holiday and trading-day differences. They are not adjusted for price changes, however, so they do not reflect either inflation or discounts.
Sales of nondurables totaled $105.3 billion last month, a flat performance that followed an advance in December of six-tenths of 1 percent.
 
 
Department Store Sales
 A 2.4 percent jump for department stores drove the overall general merchandise sector up 1.9 percent. Gasoline service stations chalked up a 1.4 percent gain.
But these were completely offset by declines of eight-tenths of 1 percent at restaurants and bars, seven-tenths of 1 percent at drug and proprietary stores, six-tenths of 1 percent at grocery and other food stores and four-tenths of 1 percent at stores selling clothes and accessories.
Compared with January 1992, the report also showed, retail sales were ahead by 6.6 percent with no adjustment for inflation. In the latest three-month period -- from November through January -- the gain was 7.2 percent.

HEADLINE: The Art Market

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

 BODY:

Art, Texas Style
The Dallas Museum of Art has been thinking in true Texan scale, with a $30 million, 140,000-square-foot addition that is to open in September. The three-story Nancy and Jake Hamon Building was financed in part by a $20 million gift from Mrs. Hamon, the widow of Jake Hamon, a Dallas oil tycoon who died six years ago. Mrs. Hamon stipulated that the money go toward building a new wing rather than increasing the museum's endowment.
The addition was designed by the New York architect Edward Larrabee Barnes, who designed the museum's existing building in 1984. In addition to office and storage space, the wing provides 14,000 square feet for 7,000 American objects, including the museum's extensive assortment of Pre-Columbian gold. There will also be a 32,000-square-foot education center for the museum, half of whose visitors participate in some kind of educational program.
But with so many museums struggling just to survive, and the city of Dallas's having reduced its financial contributions to the museum, the new wing is viewed with some skepticism in the art world. But there are also those who believe the addition could help pull in potential donors.
"It may seem brash from a distance but it's the classic Texas attitude," said Harry S. Parker 3d, a former director of the Dallas Museum who is now the director of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. "Texas has a long tradition of building real-estate projects on-the-come. And being leveraged is a part of the thinking."
 
Against the Tide
 Peter C. Marzio, the director of the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, said that while most museums were pulling in their horns, Dallas was acting aggressively. "But sometimes going against the tide works," he said. "The question is do they have sufficient money to operate?"
Richard Brettell, a former director of the museum who is the consulting director for the Hamon expansion, said he was "very sanguine about the museum's financial future." But he added, "That's not to say it's going to be easy."
When the museum was founded 90 years ago, the city owned all the art as well as the building. When the museum moved to its new site in 1984 it established itself as a separate legal entity. The city of Dallas owns the present museum's buildings and what now amounts to about half its collection. While last year the city cut its funds to the museum by 17 percent, Dr. Brettell said that two years ago the city had extended for 20 years its contract to pay the museum's operating costs based on a percentage of the city-owned art, and that this new contract included the cost of operating the new addition. The city has also agreed to make a one-year increase of 50 percent in its financing to help with the opening year of the new addition.
"We're building the addition to the city's specifications," Dr. Brettell said. "But the city's collection will remain static and ours is growing, which means that over time the city will be giving less money." He said the museum hoped that income from its endowment would be able to cover the difference.
 
80% of FundsEighty Percent in Hand
 The addition is part of a $55 million expansion. Meg Hanlon, who heads the museum's press office, said 80 percent of the funds had been raised.
The wing will become the centerpiece of a totally reorganized museum, housing what the institution calls its Museum of the Americas. In time, the remainder of the collection will be divided among a Museum of Europe, a Museum of African and Asian Art and a Museum of Contemporary Art. The philosophy behind the thematic reorganization reflects the museum's desire to be sensitive to its location, in a state that borders Mexico, and to put non-Western art on an equal footing with European art.
"When we analyzed the collection we began thinking about making a definition for each building," Dr. Brettell said, "so that rather than simply being a cultural maze, like most museums, ours will be organized into geographical and historical units."
On April 17, the institution will reopen a portion of the second and third floors of its existing building to house the Museum of Europe. The Museum of African and Asian Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art are to open in successive years, beginning in 1994.
 
Dispute Over Picasso Print
 A lawsuit is proceeding between two of the world's leading print experts: David P. Tunick, a Manhattan dealer, and Eberhard Kornfeld, the owner of Galerie Kornfeld, a well-respected auction house in Bern, Switzerland. Last week, Judge David N. Edelstein of Federal District Court in Manhattan denied a request from Mr. Kornfeld to dismiss the case.
The court had ordered Mr. Kornfeld to produce by Feb. 1 documents relating to the Picasso print that is at the center of the dispute. Mr. Tunick's lawyer, William M. Barron of Walter, Conston, Alexander & Green in Manhattan, said Mr. Kornfeld had failed to do so. Now Judge Edelstein has ordered Mr. Kornfeld to appear in court next week for a deposition.
At the heart of the dispute are issues of authenticity and money. In June 1990, Mr. Tunick paid $1.68 million for an impression of Picasso's famous 1935 print "The Minotauromachie" at an auction at Galerie Kornfeld in Bern. Mr. Barron says that at the time of the sale both men had agreed that Mr. Tunick would pay for the print in installments. The dealer exhibited the print at the annual Art Show in Manhattan in February 1991, where it was the centerpiece of his booth and was priced at $2 million. The work failed to sell at the show.
 
Offer of an Exchange
 Sixteen months after his purchase, and eight months after the Art Show, Mr. Tunick said experts who had seen the signature questioned its authenticity. Mr. Kornfeld, a Picasso expert himself, insists the work is genuine. He offered to exchange it for a copy of the same print in his private collection that had once belonged to Nelson Rockefeller and had for years been on loan to the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Mr. Tunick refused to make the swap.
"He refused the offer when he heard he would have to pay in 30 days," said Mr. Kornfeld in a telephone interview earlier this week. "He said it would not be possible."
Last October, nine days after Mr. Tunick said he discovered that the print's signature was fake, he filed suit in Federal District Court in Manhattan, citing fraud, misrepresentation, breach of duty, honesty and good faith in fair dealing, and breach of fiduciary duty. He asked for his money back -- the $426,254 paid in cash as well as artwork he consigned to the Swiss auction house valued at $974,000 -- and punitive damages of $20 million.
At the end of November, Mr. Kornfeld filed a lawsuit in Switzerland for the money he was still owed. Two months ago the case was thrown out of the Swiss courts on jurisdictional grounds, a decision Mr. Kornfeld is appealing.
 
Change of Venue Denied
 Judge Edelstein ruled that the case is to proceed in New York because the disputed print is here, as are the several experts who believe the signature is a forgery. In a pretrial motion, Mr. Kornfeld maintained that the dispute should be heard in Switzerland because he is a Swiss citizen and because his auction house had specified that any court proceedings must take place in Bern. The judge denied the motion to dismiss the case.
Faxes that went back and forth between the two men for 15 months reflect, for the most part, a verbal tug of war concerning the payment. In one fax, dated July 24, 1991, and submitted to the court, Mr. Tunick wrote to Mr. Kornfeld: "While we see some signs of business beginning to turn around, our cash position remains difficult for now, and we simply are not able to continue with any sort of payment schedule at the moment."
Mr. Barron, Mr. Tunick's lawyer, said, "This was the beginning of the worst part of the recession and Tunick simply could not divert monies and change his business plans to accommodate Kornfeld." The lawyer added that "as of the time David discovered the forgery he had paid $1.4 million in monies and in kind, so that his ability to pay simply cannot be questioned."
Mr. Barron said that Mr. Kornfeld changed the terms of the deal, at first agreeing to accept extended payment but then wanting money immediately.
 
A Different Estimate
 Matthew C. Kesten, a lawyer with Kantor, Davidoff, Wolfe, Rabbino & Kass in Manhattan, who is representing Mr. Kornfeld, said Mr. Tunick's payments do not add up to $1.4 million. So far, Mr. Tunick has made three cash payments totaling $350,000, according to documents filed with the court. He has also consigned six prints to Mr. Kornfeld to auction, two of which, Mr. Kesten said, have been sold for a total of about $29,000. Mr. Kesten estimates this leaves a balance of $1.3 million.
Among the prints Mr. Tunick sent to Mr. Kornfeld was Edvard Munch's "Madonna." According to court documents, Mr. Kornfeld put the print up for sale and his firm's published sales results indicated that it sold for about $500,000. But after questioning in court, Mr. Kornfeld admitted that the piece had in fact not been sold at all. "Mr. Kornfeld published the highest bid, he never said the print had sold," said Mr. Kesten.
Mr. Barron said: "Mr. Kornfeld has been struggling to avoid taking the case to trial in New York. He has lost in Bern and here. This case will now proceed with pre-trial discovery and we hope for a prompt trial, where Mr. Tunick will prevail and very likely recover substantial punitive damages."
Mr. Kesten sees things differently: "If we are ultimately allowed by the judge to get to the merits of the case, I think we will be able to show that the signature is correct. The piece was only questioned 16 months after Tunick bought it and conceded that he could not pay for it."

HEADLINE: Fiscal Prudence in Trenton

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio has yet to announce he's running for re-election in November, but his budget love-in with the Republicans who control New Jersey's Legislature says he is looking to minimize confrontations that might upset his plans or rattle voters. His cautious stance may be smart politics, but it is also smart governance after years of fiscal stress.
The Republican leadership greeted the Democratic Governor's budget message this week with approval. The two Republican contenders for Mr. Florio's job denounced it. And the Senate Democratic leader complained that Mr. Florio should be fighting to restore homeowner tax rebates that the Republicans cut last year. 
 Who's in charge? Until November it won't be clear. Republicans snatched control of both houses from Democrats two years ago, with veto-proof majorities, after Mr. Florio snatched the governorship from Republicans two years earlier and bulled through the biggest tax increase ever.
Last year most of his vetoes were overridden, including his veto of the Republican budget, which cut the state sales tax. This year he has apparently decided it's wiser to accept the inevitable. He even consulted the Republicans in preparing the budget and, smartly, removed contentious school aid issues from the docket altogether by resolving them separately two months ago.
The Governor's $15.6 billion plan for the coming year is as notable for omissions as for what's proposed. Above all, there are no new taxes, no new fees and no increases in transit fares.
Remarkably, Mr. Florio nonetheless foresees enough revenue to earmark $100 million for a "rainy day" fund. That's a far more responsible move than racing to cut taxes again, which some Republican leaders have mentioned.
New Jersey may be in somewhat better economic shape than other Northeastern states, but it would be foolhardy for any state to lapse so soon into the bad old budget habits of the 1980's.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The President Can Do It

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL; Anthony Lewis is on vacation.

 BODY:
Now that everybody is totally alert to the national danger from alien nannies, perhaps Americans and their new Administration will find a little more time and thought to deal with an even greater threat to our society.
Drugs. You do remember drugs? 
 Drugs, as in crack babies doomed to a misty, stumbling life, as in gangs spraying bullets into passers-by, as in jammed jails and emergency rooms, hundreds of billions lost in production, the spread of AIDS, mentally disturbed homeless driven to madness, as in 10-year-old pushers.
Many Americans do not remember, as long as it is not their street corner, their grandchild in an AIDS pediatric ward.
But maybe this new President will give the fight against drugs what it has lacked most -- leadership, direction, passion, energy from the Oval Office. Maybe -- no guarantees. During the campaign, all the candidates yawned their way past it. The polls did not care -- why should candidates, right?
President Bush had increased the anti-drug budget. But as for anti-drug leadership and energy, well, no. Ross Perot -- the mouth of the South told us he had a great anti-drug plan. He just never came up with it.
Candidate Clinton said a few of the right things, briefly. But it was economic statistics that made his eyes sparkle -- as if the U.S. could ever get off its knees without getting the monkey off its back.
Since Election Day, Clinton people seem startled when it is mentioned: "I'll get back to you on that."
Now President Clinton has cut the staff of the coordinator of anti-drug policy, once laughingly known as the drug czar, to about 25 from 146.
Too small, even though the office was comatose under a Bush appointee, a defeated Republican politician whose name I forget.
But President Clinton has taken one potentially useful step -- to give cabinet rank to whomever he appoints as director.
Potentially -- if the President tells the Cabinet that on drug issues the director speaks for him, so listen. Potentially -- if the director gets a voice in Federal anti-drug spending.
Most experts in the anti-drug field agree that trying to stop drugs from coming into the country will not work by itself. But enforcement and interdiction will always be part of the job and the new director will need a top law person as deputy.
The key is reducing America's craving for drugs through education and hard therapy. 
That will not happen unless President Clinton puts his own back and brain into it, to lead, lead.
Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, head of the 15 therapeutic communities known as Phoenix House, has been pleading vainly that the military turn buildings in abandoned or underused military camps over for yearlong drug therapy. Now there is barely a tenth of the 100,000 beds needed for that intensive treatment.
The President could do it. He could also help build mandatory therapy into the prison time of every person convicted of a drug-related crime, as proposed by Representative Charles E. Schumer of New York.
The struggle against drugs cannot be set apart, as it is now. It has to be woven into planning and operation of health care, criminal justice, anti-AIDS work, job training, education. The President could do that.
James Burke, the business executive who heads the energetic and effective Partnership for a Drug-Free America, asks for a drug summit meeting. The President could do that.
The drug coordinator has to be a person of deep experience and reputation. The appointment of Dr. Rosenthal would be Presidential emphasis of the importance of the job. Other top candidates would be Mr. Burke, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop or Mathea Falco, author of the recent, valuable book on community and business action, "The Making of a Drug-Free America."
The President will find Democrats in Congress who give their energies to the drug war. One of them is Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York. But Mr. Rangel's committee on narcotics is threatened by Congressional budget cutting. That would destroy an anti-drug watchdog to save less money than a drug gang can earn in a month. The President might help stop that.
No, the drug war cannot be won by any President alone. But one thing we have seen: It can't be won without him.

 BODY:
HERBERT ZOHN, a retired art dealer, has been a lifelong admirer of Eleanor Roosevelt, and several years ago he was struck with an idea: to put up a sculpture of her in what he described the other day as "a shabby corner of Riverside Park at 72d Street."
Mr. Zohn wrote to the New York City Parks Department and learned that the work would have to be done by a private organization, so he formed the Eleanor Roosevelt Monument Fund. He recruited her grandson Dr. FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT 3D, a professor of economics at Sarah Lawrence College, to be his co-chairman and organized a sculpture competition. 
 On Feb. 21, the First Lady, HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, is to speak at a benefit for the project titled "First Ladies of Song" at Alice Tully Hall. Proceeds will help pay for a eight-foot-high bronze sculpture by the competition winner, PENELOPE JENCKS of Boston, and for the landscaping of the two surrounding acres in the park.
The performers are to include Joanne Woodward, Barbara Cook, Judy Collins, Lena Horne, Marilyn Horne, Julie Wilson, Rosemary Clooney, Kitty Carlisle Hart and Shirley Verrett.
Dr. Roosevelt, who arranged for Mrs. Clinton's appearance, said, "Once she got my letter summarizing the project, she expressed her enthusiasm and made her commitment early on."
"People are always comparing Mrs. Clinton with my grandmother," he added. "In the January-February issue of Mother Jones magazine, there is an article called something like 'Advice From Eleanor to Hillary," and they did something with a photo of Mrs. Clinton sitting in a chair and Eleanor Roosevelt sitting in a chair so that it looks like one photo."

HEADLINE: Remaking U.N. for a Changed World Means End to Veto Power;
Look to Moscow's Role

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher has said that it is "time for some reorganization of the United Nations," including permanent membership for Japan and Germany. His remarks prompted a curt response from Britain, whose Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, argued, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." 
 But until only a few years ago, the Council was handcuffed by permanent member use of the right to veto and was in this sense quite broke.
The veto hasn't been used for a while, but the apparent consensus among permanent members can in no way be taken for granted. Signs of change are emerging from Moscow, where hard-liners are gaining influence over the Government's decision-making machinery. Russia's finger-pointing at Croatia, in response to that country's violation of the United Nations peace agreement, has ruled out the possibility of the Council's taking action soon against Serbia. And Vice President Aleksander Rutskoi's recent threat to use the veto to "halt ill-conceived United States attacks on Iraq" is perhaps the most disturbing reminder that dissent at the Security Council is anything but a thing of the past.
Mr. Christopher's reference to the need to reorganize the Security Council reflects the Clinton Administration's aspirations for a more effective United Nations, able to imbue Washington's actions with multilateral support. Mr. Christopher would do well to look more closely at the negative implications that Russia's rightward shift has for the Council's smooth functioning. That this shift is fueled in part by frustration with the reforms advocated by President Boris N. Yeltsin should encourage the United States and other G-7 countries to bolster reformist influence, particularly Mr. Yeltsin's, through more sincere -- and more visible -- economic and political support.
If Moscow's reformers are allowed to fall, the world, and the United States in particular, will have lost the chance to establish the multilateral channel for settling international disputes.

Household Help

Can someone who belatedly paid Social Security taxes for household help now amend his or her income tax return to claim the child-care credit?
EVELYN MILLER, MANHATTAN
Yes you can, but any interest or late-filing penalties are nondeductible, said Julian Block, a Larchmont, N.Y., tax lawyer. "To amend your return, file Form 1040X, accompanied by Form 2441, for each year in which you claim the credit," he said. The maximum child-care credit each year is $480 for the care of one child and $960 for the care of two or more children. 
 There is a deadline for amending a return, Mr. Block added. In most instances it is three years from the return's due date. Thus a return for 1989 with a due date, for most people, of April 15, 1990, has a deadline of April 15, 1993. Further information is contained in Internal Revenue Service Publications 503 and 556, available free by calling 800-TAX FORM.

Buying Stock on Margin

What are the advantages and disadvantages of buying stock on margin?
MICHAEL WATINS, FLORAL PARK, L.I.
A margin account lets an investor borrow money from a brokerage firm to purchase additional securities and is a double-edged sword. "The primary advantage is that it offers the opportunity to increase the overall return on your investment portfolio, if the amount you earn on the investments bought with this borrowed money exceeds the interest rate charged by your broker on the loan," said Jonathan D. Pond, author of the "New Century Family Money Book." That rate is usually the prime lending rate plus 1 to 3 percentage points.
But if your investments decline significantly in value, "you may then be subject to margin calls, typically a forced sale to meet the requirements of your margin agreement," Mr. Pond noted. "This happened to a lot of margin investors right after the 1987 crash who were forced to sell stocks to offset their paper losses."

Being an Angel

I've been thinking about investing in an Off Broadway show. How does it work?
MIKE SOMMER, LEE, MASS.
According to Frederic B. Vogel, executive director of the Commercial Theater Institute, "putting money in a theatrical show is a very high risk and you should not invest unless you are prepared to lose it all."
There are 100 percentage points, known as points, in the ownership of a show that are sold to investors, with the amount of each point based on the total capitalization.
"Limited partners put up all the capitalization, for which they get 50 percent of the net profits," Mr. Vogel said. "General partners, who do all of the work and generally do not put up any capital, get the other 50 percent."
Limited partners have limited liability, generally with no responsibility for any financing beyond their initial investment. "All or part of their investment is returned to the limited partners if the production has an operating profit, prior to any net profits being distributed," Mr. Vogel said.

HEADLINE: About New York;
Bakers Find Anger Is the Mother of Invention

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN

 BODY:
As a starting point, hatred can be positive. Take the case of the 400 workers who lost their jobs when Stroehmann's shut down its Taystee Bread bakery in Queens seven months ago. When they started to hold their weekly meetings, it was mostly to vent their anger at bosses who had fled the city and abandoned them. They cursed their old employers. They dreamed of vengeful boycotts. They are still meeting, only now, what they talk about is setting up their own big bakery in two years time.
"O.K., listen up," said Lynn Bell, addressing 35 of the unemployed workers who turned up at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Flushing. The 40-year-old former machinery cleaner and union representative was both giving news and shoring up hopes. 
 "We've gotten some more grant money," she said. "We're going to be meeting with the association of Chinese bankers. We got some resumes from people answering our ad for a bakery manager. Our site committee is looking at 15 possible locations.
"And, oh yes, the advertising agency that's working with us wants to hear from you with any ideas about what we should call our bread. It ought to be a name that signifies what we are all about."
A visitor who had spent the afternoon with Ms. Bell and her associates thought they should call it something like Honest Bread, Real Tough Bread, Righteous Bread. In fact, though, they are not going to call it anything anytime soon, because, as Ms. Bell repeatedly made clear, it will be a long time before any dough rises. Still, that they had come this far, that they had bankers and an advertising agency and that they were still staying in touch with each other was clearly remarkable.
"You've got to understand that all this started when we were just a bunch of loudmouthed complainers meeting in the Maplecrest bar across the street from the plant," said Jennie Call, who worked for Taystee for eight years as a packer. Before that, she had worked for a printing compa
ny that relocated to New Jersey and another bakery that moved upstate. "At first, there were just four or five us meeting at the bar, but it grew when the closing date got nearer."
Back when the bakery was still running, John Diaz, who is 59, had been in management. As assistant superintendent, he had been Ms. Bell's supervisor and for years hisdealings with the union representative were not the warmest. Now they are good friends and allies in a fight for jobs, brought together by the bakery's closing.
"What Stroehmann's did -- the way they did it -- well, betrayal is too nice a word," said Mr. Diaz, who had worked at the bakery for 20 years. "We all felt violated. They never asked for concessions from the union or the workers. They never offered relocation possibilities. They never discussed things or negotiated. They just left, thinking they could maintain quality and production by paying less wages at bakeries in Pennsylvania. I think that was their plan ever since they bought Taystee Bread four years earlier. They thought they could buy in to the metropolitan market for sales and run away from production."
Joseph Chaffee, another former manager, added: "You know what the severance was? It was 30 hours pay for each year of work after three years."
For Edouard Archange, a 49-year-old father of five, that worked out to about $1,500. Just like most of the Taystee workers, Mr. Archange has not found a job and has been living on his savings and unemployment benefits. "There are no jobs," he said. "All we can do is to start our own bakery."
That idea first came up at the Maplecrest when Ms. Bell said she had heard that in Pittsburgh, bakery workers had somehow managed to put together their own company after their employers moved away. By this time, the angry Taystee workers were spending most of their time trying to organize a boycott of their former employer's products. A group of 30 visited Pittsburgh and learned how the workers there had battled for three years to set up a bakery called City Pride, with equity shared by workers and investors.
"We saw we had a model to work with," said Ms. Bell. She is an exceedingly polite woman, deferring to others, eager to bring everyone into the discussion, but she is clearly a catalyst who combines a marathoner's energy with the enthusiastic hopes of a crap shooter.
They set up the Community-Labor Campaign to Save Taystee Jobs, renting an office at 32-17 College Point Boulevard, not far from the old bakery. They quickly received $121,000 in grants from the New York State Urban Development Council, banks and private foundations to be used as seed money. They commissioned a study from a consulting group in Boston to determine whether a bakery based in New York City could effectively compete in a market dominated by producers who, for the most part, truck in baked goods from plants elsewhere. The study showed that, yes, such a bakery could do well.
A Brooklyn-based nonprofit organization called Leap became the project's sponsor, seeking $10 million to set up the bakery, which, like the one in Pittsburgh, is to be owned by investors and workers. City officials informed the group that they were pressuring Stroehmann's, which still does business in the city, to return $780,000 in tax benefits that were forfeited when Taystee closed. The officials added that the money had been earmarked as an investment in the new bakery. At the moment, plans call for production to begin by the end of 1994.
"It's a long time to wait," said Mr. Archange, "but what can we do?"
Someone said that unemployment benefits would run out by then. Someone else noted that unemployment in the area was twice that of the nation.
"It's our kind of jobs that are disappearing," said Ms. Bell.
Ms. Call said: "We're fighting for our jobs by what we're doing, and if we succeed, it'll lead others to try."
The visitor noted that the effort seemed like a labor of love.
"No, that's where you're wrong," said Mr. Chaffee, laughing. "With the way we were treated, it's more like a labor of hate."

HEADLINE: Another Surge of Refinancings Sweeps Over Mortgage Lenders

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
American homeowners, who last year pared billions of dollars in interest payments off personal balance sheets by refinancing their mortgages, are at it again.
Fueled by a rally in the bond market that has pushed long-term mortgage interest rates to 20-year lows, the latest surge in refinancing activity began right around Christmas, mortgage bankers said, and has intensified in the last few weeks. 
 "Our call volume has gone from 50 to 60 an hour to 150 an hour in the last week," said Laura Lippman,a spokeswoman at Countrywide Credit, based in Pasadena, Calif., the nation's largest originator of mortgage loans. "Throughout the company, we are probably getting close to 10,000 calls a day on refinancing mortgages."
If it continues, the latest refinancing wave will free huge amounts of money that might otherwise have gone to lenders each month. That money could give added lift to an economy that is already looking increasingly healthy. Unlike other refinancing frenzies in the last year, this one comes as consumers' spirits are relatively high, having risen steadily since the Presidential election.
Mortgage bankers, who have lived through two years of initially hectic and then frenetic refinancing activity, sound somewhat blase about the latest pickup. What is interesting at the moment, they say, is that mortgage applications for new purchases have been rising for six weeks.
 
Contrast to Last Year
 "Last year there was a tremendous volcano of refinancing activity," said Howard Culang, managing director for Prudential Home Mortgage, the nation's second-largest originator of home mortgages. "Now it is growing, but it is more measured."
Still, analysts point out that the bond market, made up of a jittery bunch of traders, could bring mortgage refinancings to an abrupt halt if it does not like the components of the economic program President Clinton is to outline on Wednesday or if it is troubled by the way Congress deals with the package.
Interest rates on 30-year Treasury bonds, which influence mortgage rates, fell to 7.12 percent yesterday, a seven-year low.
At the moment it is not clear which mortgage products homeowners are favoring as they refinance. Last year, for example, many chose to move out of 30-year mortgages and into 15-year loans. Although monthly payments are higher on shorter-term loans, homeowners can pay down debt faster.
The rush to refinance "does not necessarily imply greater spending," said Alan Sinai, president of the Boston Company Economic Advisors Inc. "But it does help the economy."
Yesterday the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, which buys pools of mortgages from lenders, reported that the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell for the eighth week in a row, to 7.75 percent, from 7.80 percent a week ago. The 7.75 percent is the lowest average rate since June 15, 1973, when the rate was 7.73 percent.
At 7.75 percent, the monthly principal and interest payment is $707.23 on a 30-year loan of $100,000. That compares with $834 a month for a similar loan at 9.5 percent.
Average rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, which are often favored by first-time home buyers because of the low initial rate, fell to 5.04 percent, Freddie Mac said, from 5.06 percent a week ago.
Each week the Mortgage Bankers Association puts out separate indexes tracking mortgage applications for refinancings and for purchases.
In the period from late December to Feb. 5, the refinancing index rose 116 percent, said David Lereah, chief economist at the association, but the index, which is at 719, remains well below the peak of 1,354 it hit last July 24.
The association's purchase index has risen 69 percent in the same period, to its highest level since the measure was first published in 1990.
 
One Lender's Outlook
 "We have been doing more purchase business than other business," said Pete Wissinger, an executive vice president at Norwest Mortgage Bank in Des Moines, a mortgage lender that does business in 49 states and originated more than $21 billion in mortgages last year. "But we could see a very robust refinancing market this year if rates stay at these levels or go lower."
It is difficult to imagine that refinancing activity in 1993 will match what took place in the last two years.
In 1991 and 1992, years when the Federal Reserve Board steadily pushed down short-term interest rates to help stimulate the economy, nearly half a trillion dollars in mortgages were refinanced, according to estimates by the mortgage bankers group.
Those refinancings, in turn, pushed down debt service costs by nearly $10 billion, the association estimated.
Nevertheless, bankers said the pool of mortgage loans that have not yet been refinanced remained huge.
 
Still Haven't Acted
 Mr. Lereah said that in August he identified $2.4 trillion worth of mortgages that were candidates for refinancing. "There is a very large pool of mortgage holders out there paying anywhere from 9.5 percent to 10 percent that still have not refinanced," he said. "It may take two or three refinancing booms in a row before these people wake up."
Mr. Sinai, the analyst, said that unless President Clinton's economic address offered serious proposals to cut the Federal budget deficit, and Congress responded to his policies in a credible way, those who had delayed refinancing their mortgages might have missed the boat.
"Those who are grabbing the window of opportunity here are very wise," he said. "The bond market has already improved some on the belief that the President is serious about cutting the deficit. If he really presents a really bona fide deficit reduction program, the bond market will fly. If he doesn't, long-term interest rates are probably going to move higher."

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT ASSAILS 'SHOCKING' PRICES OF DRUG INDUSTRY

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va., Feb. 12

 BODY:
President Clinton criticized the powerful drug industry today for pursuing "profits at the expense of our children" as he sought to assign blame for soaring health care costs and to enlist public support for his own health program.
Mr. Clinton's blunt words came as he announced a proposal to spend $300 million next year to increase the number of American infants and children who get vaccines. White House officials said the effort would lead to the immunization of one million more infants and children beginning this summer. 
 "Our prices are shocking," Mr. Clinton said. "The pharmaceutical industry is spending $1 billion more each year on advertising and lobbying than it does on developing new and better drugs. Meanwhile, its profits are rising at four times the rate of the average Fortune 500 company."
 
Push for Lower Prices
 The President's criticism of the drug industry echoed a similar attack on Thursday by Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is in charge of developing the Administration's health-care policy. Defending themselves, several drug companies, whose stock prices declined modestly today, said the President had been misled by statistics in asserting that vaccine makers were profiteering. Four companies said they would send representatives to a White House meeting next week to discuss prices with Mr. Clinton. [Page 8.]
While the President said Federal spending on immunizations at public clinics would rise sharply, he made it clear that he wanted drug companies to lower their prices. He said he had directed Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to begin negotiating immediately with drug companies on the price of childhood vaccines against polio, measles and diphtheria.
 
Vaccinating All Children
 He also pledged to deliver a proposal to Congress that would guarantee the immunization of every child. Fewer than than half of all 2-year-olds in the United States are fully vaccinated, White House officials said.
Mr. Clinton's comments were the opening salvo of a campaign to try to drive down the cost of drugs and to sell the Administration's health plan to the public.
Administration officials said James Carville, an architect of Mr. Clinton's election victory last year, would be the political strategist for a nationwide effort to win support for the health plan. Mr. Carville also managed the Senate campaign of Harris Wofford, whose upset victory over Dick Thornburgh was widely attributed to its emphasis on health care reform.
A day after Mrs. Clinton traveled to Pennsylvania to single out the pharmaceutical industry as a target for the public's discontent, Mr. Clinton went to a health clinic across the Potomac River to rebuke the manufacturers even more harshly.
 
Backing From Top Democrats
 Asked whether members of Congress, who are lobbied heavily by the pharmaceutical industry, would be behind his effort, Mr. Clinton told reporters: "Whether they are or not is up to them. But this is unconscionable. We are running the risk of new epidemics spreading out in this country. We cannot do it."
Making no secret of his goal to win over the public, he added, "I think the public outpouring on this is going to be so strong that they'll come along and do it."
Although major makers of vaccines complained that Mr. Clinton had singled them out unfairly, leading Democrats praised the President. "It is appropriate for the President to insist that drug companies do their part as well," said Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. He added that "the laissez-faire attitude of the past Administration meant that business too often was not asked to participate in meeting urgent national needs."
Mr. Clinton's appearance today at the health clinic at the Fenwick Center here, where children get free shots, was also a public relations prelude to his economic address to a joint session of Congress next week. The visit had the feel of a campaign event. Mr. Clinton hugged babies and worked the crowds of hundreds of children and parents, and he halted the motorcade and jumped out of his Cadillac limousine as he was leaving the center to mix with more people lining the street.
Mr. Clinton said the vaccine program would be included in the economic plan he would announce to Congress on Wednesday. The program, he said, would create an increase in medical clinics' working hours and thus provide a small boost to the economy.
Administration officials said they were still considering a plan that would have the Government buy the entire supply of children's vaccines and distribute them free.
President Clinton has said he will submit legislation to Congress by May 1 to control health costs and guarantee access to health care for all Americans. Thirty-five million people do not have health insurance.
 
Opposition Is Expected
 But the Clintons say they expect fierce opposition from businesses and health care providers that get large amounts of income and profits from the current system. That is why the White House is enlisting Mr. Carville. "I'm sewing on my chevrons, polishing my weapons and getting ready to go out and do battle," Mr. Carville said today.
Mr. Clinton said that while 10 states had negotiated agreements with vaccine manufacturers to get cheaper vaccines, others had been turned away.
"Today, we must tell the drug companies to change those priorities," he said. "We cannot have profits at the expense of our children." The President said he had specifically instructed Ms. Shalala, in her talks with the manufacturers, to assure that states could buy vaccines at affordable prices.
George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, acknowledged that the Administration, in seeking to persuade drug companies to reduce prices, could threaten to remove their tax advantages for research and development. But, he said, he hoped for "good negotiations," adding, "I don't know that we have to presume, necessarily, a completely adversarial relationship."
 
Jump in Prices
 The average costs of vaccinating children have risen for several reasons, including the fact that more shots are recommended nowadays, prices have gone up, and there was a Federal excise tax on the vaccinations from 1988 to 1992.
In 1982, the average cost of a complete series of vaccines for a child, purchased by private doctors, was $23.29. By 1992 the cost was $243.90. In that same period the cost for an average vaccine purchased under Federal contract rose from $6.69 to $128.79. Those figures are based on calculations by the Department of Health and Human Services and American Academy of Pediatrics.
The cost for a vaccination from a private doctor for diphtheria, tetanus or pertussis went from 19 cents in 1977 to $9.97 in 1992. For an oral polio vaccination, the price rose from a dollar to $9.91. And for measles, mumps and rubella, the price jumped from $6.01 to $25.29.

U.N. PLANS PULLOUT OF U.S. TROOPS
The U.N. Secretary General plans to bring most American troops home from Somalia by April and replace them with a multinational corps of 15,000 to 20,000 soldiers under the command of a Turkish general. The plan would leave 3,000 to 5,000 American troops under the command of a foreign officer, a departure from long-standing U.S. policy. 1
 
BOSNIA TO BAR U.N. AID
The Bosnian Government announced that it would refuse to accept any further deliveries of U.N. food and medical aid to Sarajevo until United Nations relief convoys begin regular deliveries to besieged Muslims in eastern Bosnia.

HEADLINE: In Nervous Uzbekistan, It's a New Day but With the Same Old Hard Line

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TASHKENT, Uzbekistan

 BODY:
Here in the heart of Central Asia, Uzbekistan challenges the fond hopes and assumptions that a collection of newly independent countries would cast off the immense burden of the past and emerge as democracies from the wreckage of the Soviet Union.
Stunned by ethnic strife and the rise of the religious right next door, Uzbekistan is engaged in a sweeping political crackdown on dissent, banning demonstrations and arresting opposition leaders on charges ranging from treason to slandering President Islam Karimov. 
 In neighboring Tajikistan, a civil war along clan and religious lines has displaced a tenth of the population. With the help of Uzbekistan and Russia, and worried about Iranian influence and the intervention of Afghan Tajiks, the former Communists are back in power.
In Turkmenistan, the Communist system has scarcely changed at all. Even in Kazakhstan, potentially the richest country of the region, the leadership is putting economic development far ahead of political change, trying to keep the lid on ethnic tensions.
But in Uzbekistan, the largest country of Sunni Muslim, Turkic-speaking Central Asia, open repression is the order of the day.
Western and Asian diplomats here consider the crackdown a puzzling overreaction by Mr. Karimov, who ran Uzbekistan under the Soviet Union and who won a carefully orchestrated election in December 1991.
"It's fair to say that the Karimov Government is out to do in the political opposition," said a senior diplomat. "There's nothing subtle about it."
 
For Clinton, A Sticky Issue
 The crackdown presents the new Clinton Administration with the problem of figuring out how to press a Soviet-style authoritarian state on human rights without angering its leaders and cutting off dialogue altogether.
Mr. Karimov, president of Uzbekistan since March 1990, did not favor the breakup of the Soviet Union. He has tried to preserve the old system while edging gingerly toward a freer market. Washington moved quickly to open an embassy in Tashkent, seeing Uzbekistan as a bulwark against Iran-style Islamic rule, which seems to have replaced Communism as the West's nightmare of choice.
But Mr. Karimov has presented Washington with considerable difficulties. An American human rights report cited arbitrary arrests, press censorship, long detentions without charges, surveillance, phone-tapping and the dismissal and beating of opposition political figures as "a calculated attempt by the Government to intimidate and silence the opposition."
Uzbekistan faces severe economic problems. The Soviet Union required Uzbekistan to concentrate on growing cotton, which has ravaged its environment and distorted its agricultural balance. Uzbekistan remains the world's fourth-largest cotton producer, though more land is reverting now to fruits and vegetables. It also mines gold and uranium and produces natural gas. Last March, some oil was discovered.
But the economy is worsening. The conversion to private property and ownership that has started fitfully in Russia has barely begun here, and Western investors are wary of what they regard as a rich country with an unstable political environment.
Prices are inevitably rising, despite Government subsidies on bread, butter, rice, cooking oil and other items. But a system of rationing through neighborhood stores has produced inevitable shortages. Pensioners live mostly on bread and tea.
The problems can be seen in the huge central market of Tashkent, where there are lines to buy the savory grilled shashlik with onions on the fresh flat bread called nam and the prices are cheaper than in Moscow.
 
Meat Is a Luxury On Worker's Pay

But a construction worker in the market, who said to call him Uncle Misha, is supporting his wife and four children on 6,000 rubles a month, about $10. A kilo of meat costs nearly 12 percent of his monthly salary.
"I don't know if we'll make it," he said, looking over bruised apples.
Compounding these problems, the government is facing a severe budget crunch and has started to lay off workers.
Uzbek officials will not talk openly about the crackdown, but they say Mr. Karimov's foremost aim is political stability in a time of economic transition and regional tensions.
They say Uzbekistan has taken an object lesson from Tajikistan and cannot allow Islamic "fundamentalists" and naive democrats to inflame tensions. They imply the Uzbek opposition has close ties to proponents of Islamic rule, which the opposition denies.
Religion does indeed play a major part in the lives of the people here, and a focus for opposition to the government. At the Tellah Shakh mosque, services are full, with the shoes of the faithful in racks outside the door.
Men in the national robe-like coat, or chupan, and the embroidered, four-sided cap, or tyubeteyka, mingle on the street, looking at religious books for sale or listening to tapes of foreign mullahs. Rashid Hassanov, a pensioner, said religion was freer now.
Nearby, at the Shaik Zainuddin mosque, some 1,000 men worshiped inside and another 500 were outside.
"Of course Karimov is afraid of such strong religious power as in Iran or Tajikistan," said a 54-year-old carpenter who declined to give his name. "They're still Communists. If you say something against them, they'll grab you by the throat." He thought for a moment and said: "But we can pray, that's the main thing."
 
Trying to Separate Religion and Politics
 Mr. Karimov says he is trying to draw a sharp line between religion and politics. Any religious-based party is banned, including the Islamic Renaissance Party, which was active in Tajikistan and works underground here. Its leader, Abdullah Utayev, and as many as 20 others are already in jail.
Last spring, in the Fergana Valley, where religion is strong, Mr. Karimov moved to crush an organization called Adolat, or Justice, which organized vigilante groups to stop official corruption, and there were many arrests.
Deputy Prime Minister Bakhtiar S. Khamidov said that the opposition has "no real economic or political program." The Tajik events "quite clearly show that the fundamentalists do not represent the majority there," he said.
There have been persistent reports, confirmed by Tajik officials, that Uzbekistan sent military aid to the former Communists in Tajikistan. But Uzbek officials say Tashkent has provided only humanitarian aid.
Akhmadzhon Lukmanov, an Uzbek Foreign Ministry spokesman, said that Uzbekistan, with 1.5 million ethnic Tajiks in a population of about 19.9 million and the same number of ethnic Uzbeks in Tajikistan out of 5.1 million, could not help but be nervous over a religious and clan war next door.
"Certain groups there with fundamentalist goals just wanted to take power, and at the same time they covered their activities with talk of democracy," he said.
 
Court Used to Stifle Opposition Voice
 The court cases against opposition groups seem to proceed from the assumption that they are power-hungry dupes of the Islamic right. On Jan. 19, for example, after a brief case, the activities of the main opposition movement, Birlik, or Unity, were suspended for three months in what the official newspaper, Voice of the People, called "a last chance."
Calling Birlik leaders "puppets in the hands of forces that seek anarchy and chaos," the paper, with Stalinist echoes, said: "It's impossible to stop the locomotive of history. They tried by putting a rotten log across the tracks."
Two days later, the trial began of a Birlik leader, Abdumannob Pulatov, who was kidnapped by Uzbek Interior Ministry police from Kyrgyzstan in early December after attending a human-rights conference.
Young men wielding steel pipes cracked the skull of Mr. Pulatov's brother, Abdurahim, Birlik's chairman, outside the Interior Ministry after he was questioned June 29. He is now in exile.
Abdumannob Pulatov, a 41-year-old physicist and chairman of the Uzbek Human Rights Committee, was convicted for "offending the honor and dignity of the President." He was charged with creating and causing to have carried a poster of Mr. Karimov a year ago, after three students died in price riots, with the caption: "There is a beast that eats its children."
The case against Mr. Pulatov had significant inconsistencies. Uzbek police intermittently prevented an American diplomat, a reporter and other foreigners from entering the trial, despite the judge's permission. On Jan. 29, Mr. Pulatov received a sentence of three years, but was immediately pardoned by the judge, who invoked a prior presidential amnesty.
Mr. Pulatov thanked Western diplomats and human-rights organizations. "I'm free because our President decided to reach a compromise with the West," he said.
There are many more such trials on the docket. The secretary of Birlik, Vasiliya Inoyatova, is facing similar charges of defaming the President because of a poem. Four people are currently under arrest on charges of trying to overthrow the Government.
At least 11 Birlik members have been arrested for a time and then released, and many have been fired from their university jobs, including Shukhrat Ismatulayev and Marat Zakhidov, both mathematicians, the co-chairmen of Birlik.
Talib Yakubov, 53, a Birlik founder, was fired from the Pedagogical Institute on Nov. 30. The dean told him he could remain only if he promised to quit his political activity.
"The K.G.B. has a free hand," he said, speaking in a darkened car under a weak street lamp. "It's like wolf hunting. The dogs are pushing us to the place where we can be killed."
 
Strong Convictions, Stronger Reaction
 The registered opposition party, Erk, or Freedom, has faced considerable pressure. Its bank accounts and cars have been seized, its newspaper shut, its building partly requisitioned.
Its chairman, Mohammed Salikh, 43, said bluntly: "Sometimes I think we're acting too openly. Our people are being arrested; there are provocations; they are threatened by telephone, with arms; some are hit by cars or beaten in the street. It strengthens our convictions, but with every hour this regime is getting stronger and more obvious. Freedom is being strangled here."
Asked whether he was concerned about the power of his comments, Mr. Salikh shrugged. "Karimov has a hot temper," he said. "If someone tells him Salikh gave an interview to The New York Times and said something bad, he could just call a general and say, 'Get rid of him.' He's very thin-skinned. Look at the Pulatov case."
Diplomats from secular Islamic countries counsel patience and suggest that because there is no democratic tradition here, the West must not hold Mr. Karimov to impossible standards. "This has never been a democracy and may never be one," one diplomat said. "It's important, in a list of 10 vital issues, not to overemphasize one or two."
"I know the Uzbeks," he said. "If you shout too loudly, they'll slam the door, and they'll keep it shut for a long time."

Although President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan has banned religious parties, there has been a resurgence of religion; Uzbek soldiers cleared the hallways where the trial of opposition leader Abdumannob Pulatov was held. Because of inconsistencies in the case, Mr. Pulatov was pardoned by the judge at the end of the trial. (Photographs by Otto Pohl for The New York Times)

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 12

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council, closing the book on the dispute over Israel's deportation of 400 Palestinians more than six weeks ago, again urged Israel today to take back the deportees and called on the Palestinian delegation to return to the stalled Middle East peace talks.
Under a complicated agreement worked out over the last few weeks, the Council told Israel that it welcomed its decision to readmit 101 of the Palestinians deported to a barren strip of land in Lebanon separating the Israeli and Lebanese frontiers. But the Council said it expected Israel to comply fully with its order to take all of them back. 
 In a victory for Israel, the Council has also agreed to drop any consideration of an earlier demand by the Palestinian Liberation Organization for economic sanctions against Israel and is not now expected even to debate Israel's failure to comply fully with its orders.
 
Peace Talks a Priority
 The action reflects the efforts by the Clinton Administration, with the backing of all other Council members, including its three Muslim members, to give top priority to restarting the stalled Middle East peace negotiations after the Palestinians withdrew from those talks to protest the deportations.
The United States made it clear that it wanted the dispute over the deported Palestinians to be resolved at the United Nations before the departure of Secretary of State Warren Christopher for Israel on Wednesday on his first trip to the Middle East.
Some senior Israeli officials say they believe that as a result of today's compromise the Palestinians will return to the talks after Mr. Christopher completes his trip in about two weeks time. Several other Council members expressed a hope for that outcome but cautioned that they had no hard evidence of a behind-the-scenes deal.
The P.L.O. spokesmen here denied that their organization had made any commitment to re-enter the Middle East peace talks and said they had not agreed to today's action. "We are not a party to what was agreed today," said the P.L.O.'s chief representative, Nasser Al Kidwa, calling it "meaningless."
"My instructions are that our terms for returning to the peace talks remain the same, the full and safe return of all the Palestinian deportees," he added.
 
'Step in the Right Direction'
 Under today's arrangement, this month's Council President, Ahmed Snoussi of Morocco, explained the Council's views to Israel's United Nations representative, Gad Yaacobi, at a private meeting here this evening.
Afterward, he said the Council had reaffirmed its decision to demand the return of all the deportees but felt the readmission of 101 represented "a step in the right direction." The Council urged Israel to "advance expeditiously" toward full compliance with its demands. And it urged "all concerned" to seek to "reinvigorate the Middle East peace process."
The Israeli representative then restated his Government's position, that the expulsions represent a temporary and exceptional measure that is not a part of Israel's normal policy. Israel also says that all the temporary deportation orders will be reviewed by special boards regardless of whether an individual has lodged an appeal.
The reviews raises the possibility that many more deportees could be offered readmission well before their expulsion orders lapse at the end of this year. But Israeli officials deny having given the Clinton Administration any secret assurances that they would soon be offering to take back the remaining deportees.
After the meeting Mr. Yaacobi said he believed "this issue is now finally off the agenda of the Security Council." He urged all parties to return to the peace talks but gave no promise that the deportees would be allowed back before the end of the year.
The Security Council reacted to the original expulsions by voting on Dec. 18 to "strongly condemn" Israel's action as a breach of international law and demand that it immediately readmit all those who were deported into Lebanon but who were subsequently refused permission to enter that country.
The P.L.O. then asked the Council to impose a variety of mandatory sanctions on Israel when Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali reported on Jan. 26 that the special envoy he had sent to Jerusalem had failed to persuade Israel to bow to the Council's demands.
But the Clinton Administration came down firmly against any further Security Council action against Israel, saying its top priority was to get the peace talks started again. Britain, France, Russia and other Western members gave broad support.
The P.L.O.'s demand for sanctions also won little support from the Council's six third-world members, which include three Muslim countries: Morocco, Pakistan and Djibouti.
All opponents argued that any move to sanction Israel would certainly be vetoed by the United States and perhaps other permanent members too. Such a veto, they said, would only damage the Middle East peace negotiations further by giving a propaganda victory to Muslim fundamentalists opposed to any negotiations with Israel.
As this month's President, diplomats say, Morocco played a critical role in fashioning today's compromise, with King Hassan anxious to resolve the issue during his country's presidency as a sign of support for the peace talks.
 
An Impossible Goal
 An additional argument against attracting an American veto was that it would would end a two-and-half-year period during which the five permanent members of the Council -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- have refrained from using their vetoes and tried instead to settle disagreements by compromise.
Had a veto been used, many members feared that other permanent members would be tempted to veto actions that they found distasteful, and that Russia in particular might start using its veto to protect Yugoslavia's Serbian Government from further Council pressure on it to cooperate in ending the Bosnian civil war.
Once Israel bowed to American pressure and agreed to take back 101 deportees, the P.L.O. apparently concluded that sanctions had become an impossible goal.
Instead, it called for a resolution that would have done little more than urge Israel to comply fully with the Council's earlier orders. And when the major powers objected, it suggested that the Security Council should just hold a public debate on the whole issue so that it and its Arab supporters could air their views. But that idea was also rejected.
At a breakfast meeting with journalists in Washington, the Palestinian delegation's spokeswoman, Hanan Ashrawi, expressed a willingness to compromise with Israel to break the impasse.
"We will be willing to deal with whatever the Security Council decides," Mrs. Ashrawi said.

HEADLINE: Dow Ends at 3,392.43; Off for Day and Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday amid concern about President Clinton's State of the Union Message next week, especially over the possibility that tax increases will be part of a deficit-cutting package. The week ended very much the way it started, with the broad market retreating across its full breadth.
Analysts also cited some programmed selling, early weakness in bond prices and the three-day holiday weekend as factors in the decline.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 30.26 points, to 3,392.43. For the week, the Dow lost 49.71 points from its all-time record closing high of 3,442.14 at the end of last week.
 
Trading Tails Off
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday was the lightest of the week, at 216.8 million shares, down from 257.2 million on Thursday. The equity markets will be closed on Monday for the Washington's Birthday holiday. 
 "The Presidential attack on high drug prices, however valid, didn't help the already extended market and bore an uncomfortable resemblance to John Kennedy's 1962 attack on the steel industry that resulted in a bear market drop of 50 percent," said Harry W. Laubscher, senior vice president and market analyst at Tucker Anthony.
"And because of the market's susceptibility to such high-level knocking," he added, "investors might be wise to take protective measures against a possible repetition."
Dennis Jarrett, chief market analyst at Kidder, Peabody, noted that the brief swoon in the bond market after the release yesterday morning of the January producer price data was enough to take the heart out of the market.
"Trading-oriented investors usually shy away from holding long positions ahead of a three-day holiday, preferring instead to have their books a little balanced," he said.
Anther factor, Mr. Jarrett added, was the snowy weather in New York, which kept a lot of analysts away from the market.
ARCO fell 3/4, to 117 3/8, and Amerada Hess dropped 1 1/2, to 49 3/4, after a Paine Webber analyst cut his ratings on the companies to unattractive, advising investors to shift into overseas oil companies.
 
Boost for Big Airlines
 Stocks prices of the three largest domestic airlines were up after Merrill Lynch analysts lifted their rating for the group, citing an improved industry outlook. UAL, parent of United Airlines, rose 1 1/2, to 126; AMR, parent of American Airlines, rose 7/8, to 63, and Delta Air Lines, gained 3/4, to 51 3/8.
Netrix, a manufacturer of computer networking products, sank 6 3/4, to 12 1/4, after the company said fourth-quarter earnings had doubled to 10 cents a share, which was below its expectations. The company said economic sluggishness had slowed orders from Europe.
Sears rose 1 1/8, to 52 5/8. On Thursday, the retailer outlined a $4 billion, five-year program to upgrade its stores; Merrill Lynch raised its rating on the company to above average.

HEADLINE: U.S. Details Careful Plan Of Hijacker

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
The Ethiopian who commandeered a German jetliner to New York carefully planned the hijacking for some time because he had been refused entry to the United States and had "personal and family problems" that required his presence here, Federal authorities said yesterday.
The nature of the problems was not disclosed, but the suspect, Nebiu Demeke, who had lived in Germany since last August and is the son of an Ethiopian father who is an economist and a Moroccan mother, said he had brothers in Minnesota and Indiana and a sister, Selamawit Demeke, at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania.
 
Bail Hearing in Court
 Mr. Demeke also told the authorities how he had deftly smuggled a harmless starter's pistol aboard the Africa-bound jet over Austria on Wednesday, hiding the gun under an Indiana Jones-style hat and then using it repeatedly to threaten pilots and flight attendants. As his arrest loomed, he swapped it for the pilot's sunglasses. 
 As most of the hijacked passengers returned to Europe and German authorities focused anew on security at Frankfurt, Europe's largest and busiest air hub, the pilot of the Lufthansa jet described the ordeal at a news conference and the hijacking moved from a sky-and-runway drama into the courts yesterday.
Alternately brooding and smiling, a thin, small man who looked more like 12 than 20 years old, Mr. Demeke appeared before United States Magistrate Allyne Ross in Brooklyn for a bail hearing on Federal charges of air piracy carrying penalties of 20 years to life in prison.
In a Federal complaint that provided many new details of the episode, he was accused of seizing Lufthansa Flight 592 with 94 passengers and 10 crew members after it left Frankfurt, bound for Cairo and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and of commandeering it to New York by threatening to kill crew members with what looked like a semiautomatic pistol but actually fired only blanks.
During the 11 1/2-hour, 5,600-mile odyssey, the complaint said, the hijacker put the gun to the head of the pilot, Capt. Gerhard Goebel, and threatened to shoot a flight attendant every five minutes during a refueling stop in Hanover, but surrendered without a struggle when the wide-bodied, twin-engine Airbus 310 landed at Kennedy International Airport at midafternoon.
The complaint said Mr. Demeke "admitted his involvement in the hijacking" and told Federal agents that he "planned the hijacking because he had been unable to enter the United States lawfully" and because he had "personal and family problems which required his presence in the United States."
Clad in blue jeans, a turquoise paisley shirt and a blue ski sweater under a large black parka, the defendant stood silently beside his court-appointed lawyer, Marcia Levy, during the 15-minute hearing. Mr. Demeke entered no plea to the charges, and the hearing focused on the question of bail.
 
Held Without Bail
 Thomas H. Roche, associate United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, asked that Mr. Demeke be held without bail and told the court the defendant had confessed to a premeditated hijacking, had endangered the lives of all on board the jetliner, had no job or apparent means of support and might flee if he was released.
Ms. Levy did not comment on most of these assertions or on the substance of the charges, but denied that her client might flee. "He has a strong desire to be exactly where he is," she said. "There is no risk of flight." But the magistrate ordered Mr. Demeke held without bail for a hearing on Feb. 26.
German authorities said Mr. Demeke, a former student in Morocco, had arrived in Germany last August and had applied for political asylum. But he withdrew the application this month and decided to return to his native Ethiopia. As is customary in such cases, the German Government paid for his ticket.
While security at Frankfurt Airport was under review, the complaint against Mr. Demeke said he had smuggled his starter's pistol aboard with a simple trick -- putting it under his Indiana Jones-style hat. At the security checkpoint, it said, he was scanned with a hand-held metal detector, but only from the shoulders down.
"The defendant was then asked to remove his hat, which he did, thereby concealing the pistol from the security officer," the complaint said, implying that he had pinched the pistol in the crown of the wide-brimmed fedora in a slick conjurer's move.
 
Threats to Kill
 Once on board, the complaint said, Mr. Demeke entered a lavatory, donned a ski mask, drew his pistol and emerged to seize a flight attendant as a hostage. In the cockpit, he "placed the pistol against the head of the captain" and ordered him to fly to New York.
But a refueling was needed, and Mr. Demeke, impatient during 90 minutes on the ground in Hanover, threatened to kill a flight attendant every five minutes unless the refueling was speeded up, the complaint said. Later, over the ocean, he told Captain Goebel that he had "planned this for a long time."
The captain, at a news conference in Frankfurt yesterday, said: "I told him that he had planned very well. I praised him. He was proud of what he had accomplished. At first, he was hyper-nervous, threatening. Things loosened up with time, and we developed a kind of collegial relationship."
Federal officials acknowledged, meantime, that they had misidentified the hijacker and misstated his possible motives in Wednesday's swirl of confusion. Officials here and in Germany mistakenly named Ferah Siyad Shuriye, a 31-year-old Somali living in Norway, as the hijacker, and said he had demanded American intervention in the war in Bosnia.
Mischance, a bizarre anonymous call and a progression of rumors apparently accounted for the gaffes. Mr. Shuriye was aboard, seated just in front of the hijacker, and a boarding pass with his name on it was found on the floor. Since the hijacker never gave his name to the crew, the pass was thought to be his.

HEADLINE: ARGENTINA SIGNS TECHNOLOGY PACT

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Broadly opening its technology to a Latin American country for the first time, the United States signed an agreement with Argentina today that will permit this country to buy some of the most advanced computer equipment, nuclear technology and aeronautical guidance systems.
In a memorandum of understanding signed in the ornate San Martin Palace in downtown Buenos Aires, Argentina agreed to a broad range of controls over technology it develops and any technology it receives from the United States. 
 It is the first time the United States has nudged a Latin American country into an agreement that effectively controls the transfer of missile and nuclear technology, as well as technology that could lead to the manufacturing of chemical and biological weapons, to potentially hostile third countries.
For Argentina, the agreement means the flow of more sophisticated computer equipment and greater acceptance among industrialized Western countries as a significant international player toward global stability.
 
Argentina Reliability Noted
 "Basically it shows that we think this country is reliable and responsible in handling the use of potentially dangerous technology," said a United States official who asked not to be identified. "This country has come a long way."
Just a decade ago, after the Falkland Islands war, Argentina was one of the most bellicose countries criticizing the dominant presence of the United States. But under President Carlos Saul Menem, the country's political orientation has been reversed.
Not only did Argentina restore ties to Britain and renounce the use of force in seeking the return of the Falklands, but at the request of the United States it has nearly abolished its medium-range ballistic missile program, called the Condor II, which it developed in the early 1980's with Egyptian and Iraqi financing.
The demise of the Condor II was critical in the United States' decision to sign the memorandum of understanding on the control of strategic exports today. For years Washington maintained that the Condor II was a potential technology that would add to the arsenals of hostile Middle East countries, especially that of Iraq. The missile, more accurate than the Scud, was capable of carrying nuclear payloads.
The United States has been trying to conclude a similar agreement with Brazil, but those talks have stalled, a United States official said.
American officials said Argentina was on its way to becoming a member the Coordinating Committee on Export Controls, or Cocom, an informal group of 17 countries aimed at keeping out of the hands of hostile countries technology that could be used in the making of weapons of mass destruction.
 
A First Step
 Today's agreement is considered Argentina's first step toward membership, which could be still several years off. United States officials said the key was for a country like Argentina to show a track record of abiding by the export restrictions.
In addition to ending the Condor II program, the country enacted a law last year that greatly restricted the export of its technology.
The new agreement permits this country, which has been struggling to modernize its economy and industry, to acquire computers, munitions, nuclear reactor technology and chemical technology that is likely to speed its development.
After suffering decades of high inflation, military governments and persistent corruption scandals, Argentina is longing to be considered part of the industrialized world and not of the third world. Mr. Menem frequently tries to persuade Argentines that the country is either part of the first world or just on the doorstep.

HEADLINE: From Intel, the Thinking Machine's Chip

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 12

 BODY:
The Intel Corporation has begun shipping samples of a computer chip that imitates the circuitry of the human brain.
The chip is the largest and fastest neural network processor yet built, and computer designers and scientists say the new technology is the most promising approach toward building intelligent machines that mimic hearing, seeing and thinking -- functions today's computers do poorly. 
 The project is still a gamble for the world's leading maker of the microprocessors that form the core of popular desktop computers. Researchers have been experimenting with systems that simulate "biological computers" for more than a decade. Yet beyond some promising niche applications, Intel has not yet found a widespread use for these chips.
Developed in partnership with Nestor Inc., a Providence, R.I., computer development company, and with only about $1.6 million from the Pentagon, the new chip is designed to recognize patterns of information quickly and precisely. It is structured as an array of 1,024 silicon "neurons," each with a tremendous amount of memory to store and retrieve data.
Artificial neural networks are modeled on the human brain's biological network of hundreds of billions of special cells, or neurons, that transmit information back and forth, making possible behavior like learning and recognition.
The computerized neural networks may one day be able to perform tasks like recognizing objects and understanding speech, which have so far stymied conventional computers. Moreover, with the ability to learn by themselves, such machines would not require the laborious programming of rules and procedures now required to allow computers to work.
"Neural nets offer a whole new way of viewing how computing can be done," Gordon Moore, Intel's chairman and the company's co-founder, said this week. "This represents a significant step toward the mainstream."
The designers of the chip said it was capable of performing 20 billion simple operations a second, a favorable rate when compared with that of today's most powerful supercomputers. Moreover, the new chip, known as the Ni1000, contains 3.7 million transistors, a larger number than Intel's new Pentium personal computer microprocessor, which is yet to be introduced.
In addition, the neural network processor is expected to be more resilient than its conventional microprocessor counterparts, Intel's designers said. Because it is based on a network of separate neurons, a single or even dozens of processing elements can fail and the chip's performance will not be harmed. In contrast, in a conventional microchip, the failure of a single transistor can be fatal.
A number of small start-up companies, as well as large electronics companies like Intel, Motorola, A.T.& T. and Ricoh, are all pursuing neural network systems. But many researchers in the field are skeptical about the economic viability of taking experimental designs and freezing them in silicon chip designs.
"This gives the researchers less freedom to change their particular design," said Ronjon Naj, a neural network expert who is the head of Lexicus Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif., pen software recognition company. "Even if you do use them, the cost of putting them into a machine may limit the application."
But another industry analyst said it was possible that Intel might find a profitable business for its new chip.
"There is a lot of attention being given to fuzzy logic chips in home appliances and cruise controls in cars," said Sanjiv Varma, an artificial intelligence expert at New Science Associates in Mountain View, Calif. "Some entrepreneur might come up with an embedded application for Intel's neural processor that is not high-tech but is more mundane."
Because it is based largely on technology initially developed by Intel's memory division, the neural processor took only a fraction of the resources needed to developed the Pentium. A team of five circuit designers laid out the chip, and it was produced with $1.6 million from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Office of Naval Research. Intel invested an additional $1.1 million, and Nestor put up $400,000.
The Pentagon has been investing heavily in smart weapons and a generation of automated battlefield control systems.
A number of researchers said the most interesting feature of Intel's new Ni1000 is the tremendous amount of memory, more than 330 kilobytes on each chip. Memory is increasingly being viewed as more important than raw speed in determining the power of neural networks. Memory provides the context that is thought to be vital to recognition in advanced systems.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Wholesale prices remained under control in January and business sales jumped sharply in December, the Government said today in two more economic reports suggesting continued gradual economic improvement.
"The expansion is solidly in place," said Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting service. "It's just going to remain quite moderate." 
 The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index edged up two-tenths of a percent in January after a one-tenth of a percent advance a month earlier and one-tenth of a percent declines in October and November.
"We're moving in the right direction," said Ron Schriebman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler Distributors. "We just need to pedal faster and create some more jobs."
The wholesale prices report showed that much of the increase was in energy products and automobiles. Food prices were down. At an annual rate, wholesale inflation was running at 2 percent, just slightly more than the 1.6 percent in 1992.
The Commerce Department said business sales at the manufacturing, wholesale and retail level shot up 1.9 percent in December, outpacing the four-tenths of a percent buildup in inventories, including a 1.7 percent jump in retail stockpiles.
Analysts were unable to explain the surge in the retail backlog, which took place at the same time stores were reporting an eight-tenths of a percent increase in sales during the strongest holiday shopping season in four years.
Still, the overall inventories-to-sales ratio fell to 1.46, the lowest level in at least 10 years. That means that it would take 1.46 months to exhaust backlogs at the December sales pace.
Slim inventories often mean increased production and more jobs as businesses try to meet increased demand as the economy picks up.
In the wholesale price report, the Labor Department said food prices dropped nine-tenths of a percent in January after jumping 1.3 percent a month earlier. Vegetable prices, which shot up 48.4 percent in December, fell back 19.2 percent last month.
Energy prices, on the other hand, rose nine-tenths of a percent, including a 2.9 percent jump in gasoline prices. The cost of energy products fell 2.3 percent in December.
Excluding the often-volatile food and energy components, the core rate of wholesale inflation rose four-tenths of a percent, partly because of what analysts said were one-time increases of 1.2 percent in automobile prices and 2.6 percent in tobacco products.
 
Inflation Front Calm
 Mr. Schriebman of the wholesale distributors association said the report showed that wholesale inflation began 1993 where it left off last year.
"There's no volatility in producer prices and hasn't been for two years now," he said. "There's just too much slack in the economy, too much idle capacity, to rile up inflationary pressures."
In the food component, beef prices were down three-tenths of a percent while chicken prices dropped 3.9 percent. Dairy products declined five-tenths of a percent and fresh fruit, 6.6 percent.
These declines were partly offset by an 8.3 percent jump in fish prices and a 1.3 percent increase in pork prices.
Electricity was up seven-tenths of a percent. But natural gas prices edged down one-tenth of a percent and fuel oil dropped by half a percent.
The 1.2 percent rise in auto prices wiped out a two-tenths of a percent decline a month earlier. Economists at the Mitsubishi Bank in New York attributed the increase in car prices to lower price-tag incentives.
 
Clothing Prices Mixed
 Women's apparel prices increased two-tenths of a percent, but men's and boy's clothing dropped half a percent. Girls' and infants' apparel prices were down seven-tenths of a percent. Footwear was down one-tenth of a percent.
Prescription drug prices dipped five-tenths of a percent after December's 1.4 percent advance. Magazine prices jumped 1.4 percent.
Tobacco product prices were up 2.6 percent in January, more than twice as much as in December. Alcoholic beverage prices fell three-tenths of a percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends the Day Mixed While Gold Prices Decline

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed yesterday, rising against the German mark and Japanese yen amid positive economic news.
Gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery traded late at $329.60 a troy ounce, down $2.60 from late Thursday. The Republic National Bank of New York said gold fell $2.45 an ounce, to a late bid price of $328.80 an ounce. 
 Zlatko Glamuzina, chief currency dealer at Banco di Sicilia, said positive economic news announced yesterday had driven the dollar higher against the mark as the trading day progressed.
Also influencing the market was a report that the University of Michigan's February index for consumer expectations remained unchanged. Mr. Glamuzina said the index had been expected to fall, so this was positive news.
Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 120.45 yen, down 1.07 yen from Wednesday's close. Japanese financial markets were closed Thursday for a national holiday. Later in London, the dollar finished at a higher rate of 120.78 yen. In New York, the dollar traded at 120.65 yen, up from 121.175 yen late Thursday.
In New York, it cost $1.4205 to buy one British pound, compared with $1.4180 late Thursday. In London, the British pound fell to $1.4180, from $1.4190 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 1.6615 German marks, up from 1.6577; 1.5415 Swiss francs, up from 1.5355; 5.6225 French francs, up from 5.6050; 1.8705 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8650; 1,547.00 Italian lire, up from 1,543.00, and 1.2551 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2563.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $328.35 a troy ounce, compared with $331.80 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, it fell to a late bid of $328.50, compared with $331.90 bid late Thursday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 55 cents an ounce to close at $331.10.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Cattle Prices Continue Rise As Storms Muddy Feedlots

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Live cattle futures prices hit a record high yesterday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as foul weather threatened to further constrict tight supplies of slaughter-ready animals. Other cattle and pork futures finished mixed in Chicago.
On other commodity markets, oil futures fell, lumber futures rose, and grains and soybeans ended mixed. 
 Live cattle futures rose in response to continued strength in the cash market yesterday after a winter storm dumped snow on sodden feed yards in Nebraska and western Kansas.
Analysts said the precipitation worsened the condition of mucky feedlots that had begun to dry out after a series of storms from late November through January.
Deep mud drains body heat from cattle, slowing their rate of weight gain and forcing feeders to either hold back animals or sell them to meatpackers at subnormal weights.
Cattle carcasses have averaged 685 to 686 pounds since December, about 10 pounds below weights a year ago, said Joe Kropf, commodity analyst with Bill Helming Consulting Services in Shawnee, Kan.
"The feedlot conditions at the end of this week are better than they were at the first of December or the first of January but not as good as they were a week or so ago," he said.
 
Oil Futures Fall
 Crude oil and other energy futures fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Light sweet crude oil for March delivery sank 28 cents, to $19.98 a barrel. March heating oil tumbled 1.02 cents, to 55.63 cents a gallon. March unleaded gasoline fell 1.58 cents, to 53.58 cents a gallon. March natural gas fell 3.5 cents, to $1.71 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Spruce 2-by-4's for March delivery posted a sharp $7.20 gain to $395.70 for 1,000 board feet, the 15th straight record high. Lumber has been supported by tight supplies and rising demand as the economy strengthens.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, March wheat fell 2 3/4 cents, to $3.64 3/4 a bushel. March corn slipped 1/4 cent, to $2.12 1/4 a bushel. March oats fell 1/2 cent, to $1.40 1/4 a bushel. March soybeans rose 3 1/2 cents, to $5.70 1/2 a bushel.

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
3 New Offerings: Bond, Stock and Mixed

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
Tax-conscious investors with a conservative bent might consider the new T. Rowe Price Tax-Free Insured Intermediate Bond Fund from T. Rowe Price Associates of Baltimore.
Owning bonds that mature in 5 to 10 years reduces the volatility of the fund's share price by about a third, which is a plus should interest rates begin to rise. 
 The insurance, which guarantees payment of the bonds' principal and interest in the event of default (but does not guarantee the share price will not fall), reduces the fund's yield by about two-tenths of 1 percent now, the company estimates. The fund's 30-day yield is 4.98 percent.
Another new offering is the Mutual Discovery Fund, the fourth entrant in a series of funds managed by Michael Price and sponsored by Mutual Series Fund Inc. of Short Hills, N.J.
Discovery will invest in small-capitalization stocks in the United States and overseas and may buy bonds or securities of companies involved in mergers or reorganizations.
Mr. Price, who has a good long-term record, uses a value approach to stock picking, which is now in vogue. "Value" managers buy companies they think are undervalued while "growth" managers buy companies whose earnings are expected to outpace the average.
Oakmark International Fund is a new overseas stock fund managed by the Chicago-based Harris Associates, whose Oakmark Fund was the top-performing fund last year.
Like Oakmark, the overseas fund uses a value approach to stock picking. Overseas investments may be good bets now because they have lagged behind domestic investments for four consecutive years.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Albertville Learning To Turn Gold, Silver And Bronze Into Green

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBERTVILLE, France

 BODY:
For any American television viewer who overdosed on luge last February, Ray Leblanc and 16 days of snow-capped, tape-delayed Winter Olympic scenery from the French Alps, a return to the Savoy region one year later reveals an area indelibly marked by the Olympic experience.
The enormous Olympic rings are still painted on the highway in the workaday outskirts of Albertville. Windows full of Magique-the-mascot dolls and "Albertville '92" duffel bags at 40 percent off still fill the stores on the city's main street. 
 At the edge of town, past signs for "Le Parc Olympique," stands the Ice Hall, where Kristi Yamaguchi's combination of artistry and athleticism carried her to a gold medal in ladies figure skating. Now, anyone can rent a pair of skates, open a door and lurch gamely onto the ice. Only this is no longer quite the same arena where Yamaguchi starred. Although the hall's interior shell is unchanged, only 1,200 of the original 9,000 seats remain. It is as if someone has laid out a Little League stadium in a space shuttle hangar.
 
Gone to Barcelona
 Across a two-lane road from the Ice Hall, the site of the whimsical and memorable opening ceremonies bears little resemblance to the place where 1,808 athletes from 64 nations paraded on Feb. 8, 1992. The 30,000-seat stadium is gone, shipped off piecemeal to Barcelona to accommodate Summer Olympic fans. In its place is a huge dirt lot that contains only one vestige of its former function: the elaborate steel mast that served as an axis for the imaginative choreography of the young ceremonies director, Philippe Decoufle.
Across the lot at the speed skating oval where Bonnie Blair once again warmed middle America's collective heart, the stadium has been left untouched, but the ice has been replaced by a rubberized, all-weather track.
"Before the Olympics, the foreigners never stopped in Albertville," said Nathalie Miege, who works in a souvenir shop. "They all come through now and take their pictures, but I think they're a little disappointed because there's not much left anymore. Not in Albertville anyway."
Up the serpentine roads that lead to the ski resorts, the evidence is more plentiful. In Courchevel, the two ski jumps still tower over their wooded surroundings. In Val d'Isere, the men's downhill run, La Face de Bellevarde, is now open to recreational skiers. In Meribel, the hockey rink is home to junior tournaments and figure skating exhibitions.
 
'A Good Source of Income'
 Even the bobsled and luge track, which gave organizers such fits because of environmental safety concerns, has finally resumed operation in the hamlet of La Roche, offering bold tourists the chance to glide top to bottom with a driver for 400 francs (about $75).
"We see this is a good source of income," said Andre Broche, the track's director, who must balance the track's books over the next three years to keep it open.
Money remains an everyday topic in the Savoy. The good news is that the $52 million deficit run up by the Olympic Organizing Committee was quickly covered by the federal government and the Savoy Regional Council. The troubling news is that some small communities who viewed the Games as an excuse to think big continue to struggle.
Brides-les-Bains, site of the principal Olympic village, is still searching for financing to underwrite a deficit that exceeds $11 million. Pralognan, which was host to the demonstration sport of curling, ended up paying $2 million (about $3,400 for each of its 600 inhabitants) to cover its share of constructing an ice rink. Les Saisies, site of the cross-country events, has reportedly been ordered by the Government to spend no more on infrastructure improvements until 1997 because of its financial difficulties.
Local taxes are up in many areas of the region, even in the tony commune of Meribel/Les Allues.
"My taxes have increased about 15 percent," said Jean-Marie Choffel, Meribel's director of tourism. "Of course everybody resents it, but it's the price you pay. There aren't many places who have the chance to hold the Olympics. There is a cost, and the hope is that you will benefit in the long term."
 
Strong Start to Season
 Some short-term benefits have already become apparent. Tourism was up significantly in the Olympic region throughout the summer, and with some help from an early snowfall, the first month of the winter season produced record occupancy rates.
"We have never started a season like this; the lifts in the Three Valleys have seen their receipts go up 60 percent," said Michel Barnier, the president of the Savoie General Council who was a co-president of the organizing committee with Jean-Claude Killy. "It will be a very good season, but I want to be prudent. I won't say we've really succeeded until I see the same sort of numbers after two or three seasons."
The pre-Olympic improvements made in local transportation have certainly played a role in the early success. New and improved roads have cut traveling times from Lyons to the high-altitude stations by as much as a third during peak periods. But the fact remains that nearly 25 percent of the Savoy's visitors this winter have been first-time visitors, and the majority of those have been foreigners who discovered the Savoy last February.
The optimism over tourism has helped soften the psychological blow to an area that in the last year has seen unemployment rise from a relatively low 7.5 percent to 10 percent, which is near the national average.
Despite the difficulties, it is no easy task to find someone who regrets embarking on the Olympic adventure.
"We miss the Olympics here," said Daniel Marret, an Albertville bartender. "For five years before the Games, it was like people dared to dream. They worked toward a common goal and forgot some of their petty differences. Now, Albertville is becoming again just another small town. I guess it's inevitable. You only live an experience like that once in your life."
 
'We Made It to the End'
 Although Barnier can wax nostalgic about the lighting and extinguishing of the flame, it is clearly his relationship with Killy that marked him the most.
"We started together on this project 10 years ago, and we made it to the end," he said. "I was very happy to show that two different men could live such an adventure together and come away friends."
In June, Killy was named president of Amaury Sports, a Paris-based organization that among other tasks, negotiates television rights for the Tour de France and the Paris-Dakar automobile rally. Barnier, a Neo-Gaullist member of Parliament, recently authored a book on environmental trouble spots and is preparing to stand for re-election in March.
He plans to make his second trip to Lillehammer, Norway, this summer to meet with the next Olympic organizers.
"I don't want to give them too much advice," Barnier said. "I will go see them out of friendship because we have always had a good relationship. All I would say is not to lose a minute. The last year goes very quickly."

HEADLINE: Seattle, City of Future, Finds It's a Company Town

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Over the last seven years, during one of the worst economic periods in modern times, few cities in America added jobs as quickly as Seattle did. This Pacific Rim port has been held up as the city of the future: an economy free of smokestack industries, producing things the world wants to buy, from airplanes and computer software to biotechnology and exotic coffee.
On Jan. 26, a day some here are calling "Black Tuesday," the city of the future was told it might lose 50,000 jobs in the next 18 months -- nearly 5 percent of the area's work force. The Boeing Company, this city's old partner in civic destiny, said hard times in the world airline industry were forcing it to cut production by 35 percent. 
 The move is very likely to result in up to 20,000 layoffs at Boeing plants in the Puget Sound area and tens of thousands more at businesses here that depend on the Boeing payroll. Boeing is also laying off 5,000 or so workers at plants in Wichita, Kan.
When Pittsburgh lost its steel mills, or Flint, Mich., lost its auto plants, the cities were said to be rust belt relics clinging to dinosaur industries. Seattle's story is different, making it all the more troubling to business and Government leaders trying to build the nation's manufacturing base.
 
Clinton Pledges Help
 For one thing, Boeing is no dinosaur. Even with its recent contraction, it is the nation's leading exporter, building nearly 60 percent of the world's airplanes. Last year its profits were $1.6 billion. It has orders stretching to the 21st century. The jobs are high paying and mostly high technology.
On Wednesday, responding to a question from a Boeing worker at his televised "town meeting," President Clinton said the Government intended to take forceful measures to keep Boeing and the rest of the aerospace industry healthy.
"I am not going to roll over and play dead," Mr. Clinton said. "Seven technologies are going to shape the high-wage jobs of the future. And one of the biggest is commercial aviation. The United States has a lead there. We are losing it because we have not fought to maintain it."
But while political leaders may be able to shore up the domestic air industry, those measures are not likely to help the world economy. And Boeing, more than virtually any other major American company, has hitched its fortunes to world commerce.
 
Dangers of Dependency
 Seattle coasted above the last major recession in large part because it had an economy based on world trade. What the layoff announcements have demonstrated to many business leaders here is that no city, no matter how forward-looking and global its economic base, should be so dependent on a single company.
"When everybody else was singing its praises, I thought the Seattle economy was a train wreck waiting to happen because it was so dependent on Boeing," said Joel Kotkin, a Los Angeles writer who specializes in Pacific Rim trends and is a senior fellow at the Center for the New West in Denver.
From 1984 to 1990, Boeing doubled its Seattle-area payroll to a high of 106,000. In those years, the Puget Sound region added more than 300,000 jobs, growing at three times the national average. At one point, Boeing was hiring 500 people a week. Now the company employs 98,000 people in the metropolitan area, which has a population of 2 million.
Mike Wills moved to Seattle in 1987, bought a house, then began a family with his wife. He was hired by Boeing two years ago but was notified last month that he would soon be laid off. "I chose Seattle over other cities because it seemed like there would be more opportunity," he said. "I'm optimistic I'll land on my feet. But the short-term fear from something like this puts a lot of stress on the family."
 
The Envy of Other Cities
 The recent Boeing boom may have produced a false sense of security, what Glenn Pascall, a local economist and writer, called "an absolute sense of superiority because of the dominance of Boeing."
"Seattle is what every city is trying to become," said Mr. Pascall. "It is already a high-tech center, competing globally. But then something like these massive layoffs come along and it makes you wonder."
Perhaps no major city in the nation is more attached to a single employer. Even General Motors employs far fewer people in the Detroit area, about 50,000, than Boeing does in Seattle.
"People who've been in Seattle long enough are really afraid of Boeing, because they've been hammered before by these busts," said Charles Royer, the former Mayor, now director of the Institute of Politics at Harvard University. "It's like San Franciscans who have been through an earthquake. You walk around on eggshells, even during the good times."
The city has shaken some of its dependence on the aerospace giant. In 1970, after a collapse of major orders for new planes, the company shed 64,000 jobs, two-thirds of the payroll, and the famous sign appeared: "Will the last person leaving Seattle please turn out the lights?" Unemployment reached 13 percent, the highest of any city in the nation.
 
Buoyed by Microsoft
 Virtually no one is predicting such a gloomy scene this time around. Twenty years ago, 1 in 5 jobs in the Seattle area was at Boeing. Today the figure is 1 in 10, and the region supports more than 200,000 high-tech jobs, many at Microsoft, where the average salary is $81,000 a year. It is also a national leader in biotechnology, fisheries and container-ship port activity.
Dick Conway, who makes the economic forecasts for several Seattle-area government agencies, says the city may still escape a recession, even with the loss of 50,000 jobs. Boeing, he said, is the only drag on an otherwise healthy economy.
"The reason we've done better than most states is because through Boeing and others, we are more dependent on world trade than any other state," Mr. Conway said. "Over the long run, I'd say if you have to be dependent on someone, you couldn't pick a better company to be dependent on than Boeing."
Still, the drag is a big one. Because Boeing workers are paid so much more than they were 20 years ago and are far more productive, the layoffs will affect virtually every part of the region's economy, he said.
 
Both Loved and Loathed
 There is talk in Washington, D.C., about providing some sort of legislative relief for Boeing and the airlines. One proposal, backed by Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, would change bankruptcy laws so that airlines operating under such restrictions could not start fare wars, thereby dragging down the healthy carriers. Over the last three years the nation's airlines have lost more than $9 billion, which is more than they made in profit in the previous 44 years.
Seattle residents have long been ambivalent about Boeing. "Most of us regard Boeing the way Indians once thought of Mount Rainier -- a cloudy, mysterious place about which nothing much can be known," David Brewster, editor of The Seattle Weekly, a newspaper focusing on the news and the arts, wrote in a recent column.
Paul Schell, dean of the School of Architecture at the University of Washington and a Seattle Port commissioner, calls Boeing the "company people love to hate."
"If there's a good side to these layoffs, it is that this will stir us out of a complacency that comes from having a Boeing in your backyard," he said.

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
A Lawyerly Search for a Good Lawyer

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Maybe Shakespeare, Dickens and Dan Quayle were right.
Recent events in Washington have only reinforced the arguments of those who would "kill all the lawyers," or at least curb them, or at the very least not let a lot of them get into a room and make important decisions affecting the country. 
 The Clinton Administration's tortuous search for an Attorney General, which may have ended with the selection of Janet Reno, the Miami prosecutor, must seem strange to most Americans.
How could Judge Kimba M. Wood have been interviewed by a President who is a lawyer, a First Lady who is a lawyer, a White House counsel and half a dozen others who are lawyers -- and still everyone comes out of these talks without the answer to their most important question?
How could these high-powered lawyers have never realized that there would be a political problem with Zoe Baird when she told them at the start that she had broken the law? And how could they have failed to see that because one woman did something illegal and the other did not, that their stories might play differently with the public?
 
Friends and Strangers
 And as Rush Limbaugh, the conservative talk show host, put it, "Why has it taken so long for a bunch of lawyers to find a good lawyer?"
It seems strange that the First and Second Lawyer always seemed to have been picking people recommended by others but strangers to them, even with their vast network of lawyer friends. Indeed, Mr. Clinton seemed to have a hard time explaining just how he had failed to notice Ms. Reno, even though she was a friend of his brother-in-law.
Res ipsa loquitur, as lawyers like to say: The matter speaks for itself.
Charles Peters, the editor of The Washington Monthly, said the cases of Ms. Baird and Judge Wood are instructive: "In both instances, you had a tremendous number of lawyers who fooled around and missed the main point. Isn't that a symbol of what happens when you've got all these lawyers running things?"
Mr. Peters says the tone of the Clinton Administration so far has been more lawyerly and elitist than populist. In the campaign last year, many Americans were drawn to the plain-spoken Ross Perot, who promised to run the Government like a business. Mr. Clinton, by contrast, has an Administration that comes across like a high-powered law firm.
Even by the standards of a capital accustomed to a glut of lawyers, this President has surrounded himself with a lot of lawyers, many in top jobs that require no legal training. He has also conducted the opening weeks of his Presidency in a lawyerly way, getting bogged down in technicalities, loopholes, caveats and flyspecking.
Robert Altman, the movie director who lives in New York, finds Washington these days all too reminiscent of his 1975 movie, "Nashville," in which a folksy, blunt character named Hal Phillip Walker (a presage of Ross Perot) began a third-party campaign for President with a pledge to eliminate all the lawyers from Congress, because, as he said: "A lawyer is trained for two things and two things only -- to clarify, that's one. And to confuse."
In an interview, Mr. Altman said: "The basic philosophy of lawyers is that there is no morality, only legality. My own lawyer, who is one of my very best friends, drives me crazy with his endorsement that anything legal is acceptable, even if it isn't moral. My feeling about lawyers is, Wait a minute, I have to call my lawyer and find out if I can say this."
In the case of Judge Wood, two cultures collided semantically. Using political culture shorthand, Mr. Clinton asked the judge if she had "a Zoe Baird problem." She answered, in narrow legalese, that she did not have a problem exactly like Ms. Baird's, but she did not answer the broader political aspect that was clearly included in the President's question.
And it was ironic that Mr. Clinton did not recognize the narrowly worded escape clause approach, since he used it himself during the campaign to fudge issues on the draft, taxes, marijuana and his personal life.
In the campaign, George Bush and Dan Quayle lambasted Mr. Clinton for being "in the tank" with a special-interest group wearing "tasseled loafers."
"Sharp lawyers are running wild," Mr. Bush said, with "crazy lawsuits."
But once in office, Mr. Clinton cleaved to his roots as a lawyer. The New Republic recently noted that while his Cabinet has four women, four African-Americans and two Hispanics, "in a more meaningful sense Clinton has chosen one of the least diverse Cabinets in memory; of its 18 members, 13 are lawyers, and those include all four top economic officials."
The President could have tried to cut through some of the legal red tape entangling his opening weeks by standing up and saying that the current laws about illegal aliens and Social Security taxes on domestic workers are perceived as overly complicated, and perhaps need some simplification to encourage compliance. But that did not happen.
Rather, the Administration began jettisoning any candidate with even the slightest perceived problem on the subject, and pleading no contest on the officials already in place who have problems -- a move that has caused even greater confusion about what is allowable.
William Kristol, Mr. Quayle's former chief of staff who was the architect of the Vice President's campaign against excessive litigation, predicted that Mr. Clinton would be hurt if his Administration continued "to be dominated by lawyerly thinking."
 
'The Party of Lawyers'
 "The Democrats were once the party of working men and women and union leaders and political bosses and farmers and ethnic groups," Mr. Kristol said. "Now they've become the party of lawyers and interest groups who use the legal system to advance their goals and argue about 'rights.' Lawyers don't produce anything. They just feed off of and encourage other people's problems."
The best description of the law's tendency to feed on itself, which the new President might take as a cautionary tale, comes at the beginning of "Bleak House," when Charles Dickens describes a case in the Lord Chancellor's court called "Jarndyce and Jarndyce":
"This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what it means. The parties to it understand it least; but it has been observed that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five minutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the premises.
"Innumerable children have been born into the cause; innumerable young people have married into it; innumerable old people have died out of it. Scores of persons have deliriously found themselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, without knowing how or why. . . . There are not three Jarndyces left upon the earth perhaps, since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a coffeehouse in Chancery Lane; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still drags its dreary length before the Court, perennially hopeless."

HEADLINE: Jabs and Plenty of Pitches In Perot Visit to 'Tonight'

 BODY:
Ross Perot traded jokes and jabs with a master of the form, Jay Leno, on Thursday night as he expanded his political fund-raising drive to the "Tonight" show's huge television audience.
If the lusty response of the crowd was any indication, the sometime Presidential candidate was a hit. 
 The NBC studio sounded like the setting for a basketball game or a professional wrestling match when Mr. Perot walked on stage, lugging a valise stuffed with his trademark economic charts and graphs. The roar of approval was punctuated with many boisterous, and mostly male, shouts of encouragement, in the "Go get 'em Ross!" vein.
In his appearance, Mr. Perot kidded about his closely cropped haircut and his "full-blooded Sioux Indian" barber, about Dan Quayle, about Dana Carvey's impersonations, and about himself.
All the while, he managed to weave in references to his toll-free number and the post office box through which Americans can join his political organization, United We Stand, America, for $15.
Mr. Leno remarked, "People say, 'Sending Ross Perot $15, isn't that sort of like bringing goldfish to Sea World or something?' "
Mr. Leno prodded Mr. Perot to take credit for the idea of televised "town meetings," like the one President Clinton staged on Wednesday night, but Mr. Perot declined, correctly. While Mr. Perot popularized the term "electronic town hall" in the Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton had held several such forums in the New Hampshire primary campaign.
Mr. Perot said he called Mr. Carvey about his impersonations on "Saturday Night Live" and told the comedian that he was so good that "my family feels you are better than I am" and that "if you would go on the campaign trail," Mr. Perot could be twice as effective.
Chatting about a sandwich that a restaurant in Maine created in his honor, Mr. Perot said there was also a "Dan Quayle sandwich, which is two slices of white bread with nothing inside."
"What's in your sandwich?" Mr. Leno replied. "Any tongue in your sandwich?"

HEADLINE: It Isn't 'Yankee, Go Home' Anymore

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis; Flora Lewis is senior columnist of The New York Times; Russell Baker is on vacation.

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
The message to Washington from the mammoth gathering of leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, was loud and clear. Reversing the hostile graffiti of a generation ago when America was seen as determined to dominate, it was, "Ami, don't go home."
From East and West, North and South, the plea was for the U.S. to stay actively engaged in the world's economic and security affairs. Raymond Barre, France's former and possibly future Prime Minister, put it flatly, saying the U.S. bears "first responsibility" for restoring economic confidence and pulling everyone back into a new period of growth. Others need to do better on their monetary, fiscal and wages policy mix, he said, but the key is to make sure there is no U.S. "economic decoupling" and a convincing U.S. start on deficit reduction. 
 Virtually every participant insisted that only new U.S. initiatives can revive effective cooperation among world leaders, not only on trade, exchange rates and finance but also on coordinating aid to the East and the dangerously frayed Russian society, stopping war from spreading through the Balkans and restoring enough order to enable the world to get on with its business.
There is a sense of helpless, fearful drift among the nations so sure of themselves not long ago, and a nostalgia for the days when America could be counted on to command, enabling everybody else to indulge in carping. The pleasure of America-bashing has vanished. There is a risk of schadenfreude, of finding some satisfaction in these new perceptions, while America tries to focus on attending to its own needs. It is a trap. Too much is at stake for the U.S. as well for it to turn aside and let the others stew a while.
Nationalism is rising everywhere, even in stable countries. The new enemy to replace the reliably thick ice of the cold war is disorder. It can be faced only by cooperative policies and will be faced only if Washington provides the impulse and sets the terms for coordination.
Fred Bergsten, a Washington economist, points out that the Group of Seven industrial countries control 75 percent of the world economy, but he says "the G-7 is dead." That is, the minimum of joint management that it had been providing hasn't been functioning in the last couple of years. He wisely calls for an urgent, special meeting in the spring before the regularly scheduled photo-op summit in Tokyo this summer.
Two trends going in opposite directions have created a sharp strain in relations among states. Economies are being globalized; regardless of where decisions are made, they operate transnationally. But politics are being renationalized, turning inward, with a loss of awareness of the superseding common interest and the need for mutual reinforcement that the cold war imposed.
The need hasn't diminished with the dissolution of blocs. If anything, it has increased, but so has uncertainty, and it undercuts what efforts there are to keep things on track.
President Clinton is right to think carefully: the message from America does need to be renewed and revised. But he is wrong if he thinks there's no hurry and others can be left to fill the void. The new voice needs to speak firmly, with great clarity, on America's response to the uneasy world: the U.S. doesn't want out and it doesn't want to take over. Responsibility must be shared. Mr. Clinton should say America recognizes the menace of disorder and it's not the kind of world we want to live in, but the rest of you have as much or more to lose than we do if you block or fail to join a concerted effort to keep it moving steadily. Everybody's listening hard. He would be heard.

BYLINE: By ALEX ROSS

 BODY:

Jupiter SymphonyChrist and St. Stephen's Church
Manhattan
 After temporarily succumbing to financial crisis last spring, the Jupiter Symphony has moved a few blocks north of Alice Tully Hall, which was its home for many years. This chamber orchestra, whose repertory derives largely from the Classical era, has revived itself on the basis of individual donations, including some from members of the New York Philharmonic.
 Monday night's concert began with Handel's Concerto Grosso No. 1 in B flat and then Haydn's Symphony No. 18 in G. While the ensemble was not always completely tidy, it had an attractive, well-rounded sound; Jens Nygaard conducted gracefully and with a lyrical bias. Robert Ingliss was an able oboe soloist in the Handel. 
 The program note promised a "special surprise" after intermission, and this arrived in the person of Jerome Lowenthal, the always surprising and sometimes incredible pianist who specializes in forgotten Romantic fireworks. Mr. Lowenthal began with a stirring declamation of Paul Verlaine's poem "Clair de Lune" in French, then played the Debussy piece of the same name; Scriabin's Nocturne in D flat, for the left hand alone, closed his segment brilliantly.
 Grieg's "At the Cradle" and Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 2 followed, with Pamela Frank as soloist in the latter. Ms. Frank, who has already given two acclaimed recitals this year, has become a major presence among younger violinists; this Mozart displayed in good measure the lyrical and dramatic intensity that characterizes her work.

HEADLINE: About New York;
Bakers Find Anger Is the Mother of Invention

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN

 BODY:
As a starting point, hatred can be positive. Take the case of the 400 workers who lost their jobs when Stroehmann's shut down its Taystee Bread bakery in Queens seven months ago. When they started to hold their weekly meetings, it was mostly to vent their anger at bosses who had fled the city and abandoned them. They cursed their old employers. They dreamed of vengeful boycotts. They are still meeting, only now, what they talk about is setting up their own big bakery in two years time.
"O.K., listen up," said Lynn Bell, addressing 35 of the unemployed workers who turned up at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Flushing. The 40-year-old former machinery cleaner and union representative was both giving news and shoring up hopes. 
 "We've gotten some more grant money," she said. "We're going to be meeting with the association of Chinese bankers. We got some resumes from people answering our ad for a bakery manager. Our site committee is looking at 15 possible locations.
"And, oh yes, the advertising agency that's working with us wants to hear from you with any ideas about what we should call our bread. It ought to be a name that signifies what we are all about."
A visitor who had spent the afternoon with Ms. Bell and her associates thought they should call it something like Honest Bread, Real Tough Bread, Righteous Bread. In fact, though, they are not going to call it anything anytime soon, because, as Ms. Bell repeatedly made clear, it will be a long time before any dough rises. Still, that they had come this far, that they had bankers and an advertising agency and that they were still staying in touch with each other was clearly remarkable.
"You've got to understand that all this started when we were just a bunch of loudmouthed complainers meeting in the Maplecrest bar across the street from the plant," said Jennie Call, who worked for Taystee for eight years as a packer. Before that, she had worked for a printing compa
ny that relocated to New Jersey and another bakery that moved upstate. "At first, there were just four or five us meeting at the bar, but it grew when the closing date got nearer."
Back when the bakery was still running, John Diaz, who is 59, had been in management. As assistant superintendent, he had been Ms. Bell's supervisor and for years hisdealings with the union representative were not the warmest. Now they are good friends and allies in a fight for jobs, brought together by the bakery's closing.
"What Stroehmann's did -- the way they did it -- well, betrayal is too nice a word," said Mr. Diaz, who had worked at the bakery for 20 years. "We all felt violated. They never asked for concessions from the union or the workers. They never offered relocation possibilities. They never discussed things or negotiated. They just left, thinking they could maintain quality and production by paying less wages at bakeries in Pennsylvania. I think that was their plan ever since they bought Taystee Bread four years earlier. They thought they could buy in to the metropolitan market for sales and run away from production."
Joseph Chaffee, another former manager, added: "You know what the severance was? It was 30 hours pay for each year of work after three years."
For Edouard Archange, a 49-year-old father of five, that worked out to about $1,500. Just like most of the Taystee workers, Mr. Archange has not found a job and has been living on his savings and unemployment benefits. "There are no jobs," he said. "All we can do is to start our own bakery."
That idea first came up at the Maplecrest when Ms. Bell said she had heard that in Pittsburgh, bakery workers had somehow managed to put together their own company after their employers moved away. By this time, the angry Taystee workers were spending most of their time trying to organize a boycott of their former employer's products. A group of 30 visited Pittsburgh and learned how the workers there had battled for three years to set up a bakery called City Pride, with equity shared by workers and investors.
"We saw we had a model to work with," said Ms. Bell. She is an exceedingly polite woman, deferring to others, eager to bring everyone into the discussion, but she is clearly a catalyst who combines a marathoner's energy with the enthusiastic hopes of a crap shooter.
They set up the Community-Labor Campaign to Save Taystee Jobs, renting an office at 32-17 College Point Boulevard, not far from the old bakery. They quickly received $121,000 in grants from the New York State Urban Development Council, banks and private foundations to be used as seed money. They commissioned a study from a consulting group in Boston to determine whether a bakery based in New York City could effectively compete in a market dominated by producers who, for the most part, truck in baked goods from plants elsewhere. The study showed that, yes, such a bakery could do well.
A Brooklyn-based nonprofit organization called Leap became the project's sponsor, seeking $10 million to set up the bakery, which, like the one in Pittsburgh, is to be owned by investors and workers. City officials informed the group that they were pressuring Stroehmann's, which still does business in the city, to return $780,000 in tax benefits that were forfeited when Taystee closed. The officials added that the money had been earmarked as an investment in the new bakery. At the moment, plans call for production to begin by the end of 1994.
"It's a long time to wait," said Mr. Archange, "but what can we do?"
Someone said that unemployment benefits would run out by then. Someone else noted that unemployment in the area was twice that of the nation.
"It's our kind of jobs that are disappearing," said Ms. Bell.
Ms. Call said: "We're fighting for our jobs by what we're doing, and if we succeed, it'll lead others to try."
The visitor noted that the effort seemed like a labor of love.
"No, that's where you're wrong," said Mr. Chaffee, laughing. "With the way we were treated, it's more like a labor of hate."

 CORRECTION:
The About New York column on Saturday, about workers who lost their jobs when Stroehmann's closed its Taystee Bread bakery and then decided to open a bakery of their own, misidentified one worker in some editions. He is Edouard Archange.

HEADLINE: Another Surge of Refinancings Sweeps Over Mortgage Lenders

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
American homeowners, who last year pared billions of dollars in interest payments off personal balance sheets by refinancing their mortgages, are at it again.
Fueled by a rally in the bond market that has pushed long-term mortgage interest rates to 20-year lows, the latest surge in refinancing activity began right around Christmas, mortgage bankers said, and has intensified in the last few weeks. 
 "Our call volume has gone from 50 to 60 an hour to 150 an hour in the last week," said Laura Lippman,a spokeswoman at Countrywide Credit, based in Pasadena, Calif., the nation's largest originator of mortgage loans. "Throughout the company, we are probably getting close to 10,000 calls a day on refinancing mortgages."
If it continues, the latest refinancing wave will free huge amounts of money that might otherwise have gone to lenders each month. That money could give added lift to an economy that is already looking increasingly healthy. Unlike other refinancing frenzies in the last year, this one comes as consumers' spirits are relatively high, having risen steadily since the Presidential election.
Mortgage bankers, who have lived through two years of initially hectic and then frenetic refinancing activity, sound somewhat blase about the latest pickup. What is interesting at the moment, they say, is that mortgage applications for new purchases have been rising for six weeks.
 
Contrast to Last Year
 "Last year there was a tremendous volcano of refinancing activity," said Howard Culang, managing director for Prudential Home Mortgage, the nation's second-largest originator of home mortgages. "Now it is growing, but it is more measured."
Still, analysts point out that the bond market, made up of a jittery bunch of traders, could bring mortgage refinancings to an abrupt halt if it does not like the components of the economic program President Clinton is to outline on Wednesday or if it is troubled by the way Congress deals with the package.
Interest rates on 30-year Treasury bonds, which influence mortgage rates, fell to 7.12 percent yesterday, a seven-year low.
At the moment it is not clear which mortgage products homeowners are favoring as they refinance. Last year, for example, many chose to move out of 30-year mortgages and into 15-year loans. Although monthly payments are higher on shorter-term loans, homeowners can pay down debt faster.
The rush to refinance "does not necessarily imply greater spending," said Alan Sinai, president of the Boston Company Economic Advisors Inc. "But it does help the economy."
Yesterday the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, which buys pools of mortgages from lenders, reported that the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell for the eighth week in a row, to 7.75 percent, from 7.80 percent a week ago. The 7.75 percent is the lowest average rate since June 15, 1973, when the rate was 7.73 percent.
At 7.75 percent, the monthly principal and interest payment is $707.23 on a 30-year loan of $100,000. That compares with $834 a month for a similar loan at 9.5 percent.
Average rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, which are often favored by first-time home buyers because of the low initial rate, fell to 5.04 percent, Freddie Mac said, from 5.06 percent a week ago.
Each week the Mortgage Bankers Association puts out separate indexes tracking mortgage applications for refinancings and for purchases.
In the period from late December to Feb. 5, the refinancing index rose 116 percent, said David Lereah, chief economist at the association, but the index, which is at 719, remains well below the peak of 1,354 it hit last July 24.
The association's purchase index has risen 69 percent in the same period, to its highest level since the measure was first published in 1990.
 
One Lender's Outlook
 "We have been doing more purchase business than other business," said Pete Wissinger, an executive vice president at Norwest Mortgage Bank in Des Moines, a mortgage lender that does business in 49 states and originated more than $21 billion in mortgages last year. "But we could see a very robust refinancing market this year if rates stay at these levels or go lower."
It is difficult to imagine that refinancing activity in 1993 will match what took place in the last two years.
In 1991 and 1992, years when the Federal Reserve Board steadily pushed down short-term interest rates to help stimulate the economy, nearly half a trillion dollars in mortgages were refinanced, according to estimates by the mortgage bankers group.
Those refinancings, in turn, pushed down debt service costs by nearly $10 billion, the association estimated.
Nevertheless, bankers said the pool of mortgage loans that have not yet been refinanced remained huge.
 
Still Haven't Acted
 Mr. Lereah said that in August he identified $2.4 trillion worth of mortgages that were candidates for refinancing. "There is a very large pool of mortgage holders out there paying anywhere from 9.5 percent to 10 percent that still have not refinanced," he said. "It may take two or three refinancing booms in a row before these people wake up."
Mr. Sinai, the analyst, said that unless President Clinton's economic address offered serious proposals to cut the Federal budget deficit, and Congress responded to his policies in a credible way, those who had delayed refinancing their mortgages might have missed the boat.
"Those who are grabbing the window of opportunity here are very wise," he said. "The bond market has already improved some on the belief that the President is serious about cutting the deficit. If he really presents a really bona fide deficit reduction program, the bond market will fly. If he doesn't, long-term interest rates are probably going to move higher."

HEADLINE: A Jolt for the Student Loan Stocks

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON

 BODY:
Wall Street received a quick education on the student loan business yesterday, and it did not like what it learned.
The once-hot stocks of the Student Loan Marketing Corporation, known as Sallie Mae, and the Student Loan Corporation fell sharply as some analysts issued warnings to investors about possible changes in the student loan program. 
 President Clinton, who made universal access to Government loans for education a centerpiece of his campaign, is expected to call for a revision of insured lending to college students that would bypass banks and eliminate the need for a secondary market, like the one served by Sallie Mae.
 
'An Uncomfortable Feeling'
 "It's an uncomfortable period," said Jack Morris, a spokesman for Citicorp, which owns 80 percent of Student Loan. "The business in itself is sound. But any business can be affected by outside events."
Only about a month ago, the stocks of Sallie Mae and Student Loan were surging, buoyed by reports that the Clinton Administration was planning no immediate action. In addition, declining interest rates were expected to push up the companies' profits.
Student Loan's shares traded as high as $30.50 last month, up sharply from its initial offering price of $16.75 when Citicorp sold a 20 percent stake to the public in December. But yesterday, Student Loan plunged $3.50, to $18.625, and was the Big Board's biggest percentage loser, with a 15.8 percent decline.
Sallie Mae's stock fell $4.50 yesterday, or 7.1 percent, closing at $58.625 in heavy trading. Last month, it had traded as high as $75.25.
 
Leaders in Industry
 Sallie Mae and Student Loan hold and service insured student loans. Sallie Mae is a publicly traded Government-sponsored enterprise, buying loans made by private lenders. It is the largest holder of student loans. And Student Loan is the nation's leading student lender.
At least four Wall Street analysts, David Hilder of First Boston, Robert G. Hottensen of Goldman, Sachs, Peter Treadway of Smith Barney and Gary Gordon of Paine Webber, have cautioned investors about the stocks in recent days.
Mr. Treadway and Mr. Hottensen changed their recommendations from "buy" to "hold."
Mr. Gordon and Mr. Hilder, while continuing to recommend the stocks, warned investors of "heightened uncertainty" and "volatility." Both noted that an actual decision on the issue was probably months away.
Direct lending by the Government could save taxpayers from $4.8 billion to $6 billion over five years, according to separate estimates issued by the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office last November.
Sallie Mae and other interested parties dispute the savings estimates and have already begun a counterattack. They hired KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm, which called the agencies' findings flawed.
"They're making a $100 billion bet that they can efficiently run and manage a lending program using taxpayer money," said Gisela Vallandigham, a spokeswoman for Sallie Mae. "They presume there will be a cost savings."
Sallie Mae, the 700-member Consumer Bankers Association and the National Council of Higher Education Loan Programs, a group of state guarantee agencies, paid for the Peat Marwick study. Their report said the Government overlooked administrative costs of direct lending or the cost of dismantling the current student loan program.
 
Awaiting the Details
 Details about the breadth of the Clinton Administration's proposal may come as early as next week during Mr. Clinton's State of the Union address or during testimony by Education Secretary Richard Riley before a March 2 House Budget Committee hearing. Mr. Riley has expressed no opinion so far about the proposal, a department spokesman said.
Industrywide, about 7,800 lenders issued $15 billion in student loans last year. Sallie Mae, which issues few loans, held about $24 billion in insured student loans at the end of the year. The company generally issues short-term floating notes on a monthly basis to raise funds to buy student loans from financial institutions. Last year, Sallie Mae raised $11.3 billion from the capital markets.
Student Loan holds $3.2 billion in insured student loans and originated $909 million last year.
As a Government-sponsored agency, Sallie Mae can sell debt at yields just above those of the Treasury. On Feb. 8, the company sold $500 million of six-month notes at a yield just 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, above the three-month Treasury bill. Holders of insured student loans receive a so-called special allowance payment of 3.1 percent.
Under direct lending, the expected savings would come from the Treasury's ability to borrow money at the Goverment's cost of funds and from eliminating the special allowance payments.
Student loan volume is growing because of the increasing costs of education, higher enrollment and cutbacks in grant aid.

HEADLINE: ARTS/ARTIFACTS;
A Time of Guarded Optimism

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
The trucks emptying dealers' booths on the night the Winter Antiques Show closed two weeks ago left with far less than they brought. Crediting the mini sales boom to the recent surge in the economy and President Clinton's election, dealers in most categories said they had bettered last year's figures, despite an attendance lag in the second half of the nine-day event.
Long viewed internationally as the golden calf of all antiques fairs, the show had lost its pre-eminence in recent years, partly due to controversy over what some saw as mismanagement. Hurt by the recession, the event also faced competition from the International Antique and Fine Art Dealers Show held here in October. Now, with the winter show's luster somewhat restored, and the economy eased, sales are improving in American, Oriental and European artifacts as well as in silver and jewelry. 
 "Business was terrific," said the show's manager, N. Pendergast Jones. "We had close to 9,000 people on the first weekend."
Though dealers continued to sell for the next five days, ticket sales were slower. In all, nearly 24,000 people attended the show and the preview, which was about 850 fewer than last year and 10,000 under the 1985 total. The fair was sponsored by the East Side House Settlement, a Bronx-based charity.
"There's nothing left at Marguerite Riordan's," Mrs. Jones said. "We're sending her home with a shopping bag."
Mrs. Riordan, a folk-art dealer from Stonington, Conn., smiled. "That's not quite true," she said. "We've had a very strong show -- half of what was on view on opening night was sold. Our second batch didn't do as well." Among the most admired of Mrs. Riordan's items that found buyers were an 18th-century Massachusetts tea table at $85,000 and a tiger-maple linen cupboard at $65,000. "We sold something every day," she said. "But business was not quite what it was in the late 1980's."
Directly across the aisle, Leigh Keno, another Americana furniture dealer, was nearly as busy. The fashion designer Bill Blass bought a wall clock priced at $14,500. Mr. Keno also sold a serpentine-front 18th-century desk, with an asking price of $220,000.
"The art market has finally turned," said Michael Goedhuis, a London dealer who was showcasing ancient Chinese bronzes from the Warring States period. As the fair was about to end, just before the Super Bowl kickoff, a Manhattan collector bought a pair of bronze lions that had been guarding the entrance to Mr. Goedhuis's booth. The massive, snarling beasts, from an early-19th-century Japanese temple, weighed a ton. Although they had one of the highest price tags at the show, $475,000, the sum was well below the million-dollar offerings at this fair in the late 1980's.
"We changed one wall four times" as objects were sold, said Milly McGehee of Colwill-McGehee, Americana dealers based in Baltimore. Gone from that wall were two hooked rugs, one in a tiger pattern ($6,500), the other covered with hearts ($10,000), and a drum-shaped Hepplewhite wine cabinet made in Maryland ($55,000). "Our most popular item was the pair of log-cabin andirons," Ms. McGehee said. "We could have sold them two dozen times on opening night." The price was $6,800.
Joel Kopp, of America Hurrah in Manhattan, was more cautious. "There's no boom yet," he said, "but people are buying again." Nevertheless, he did sell quilts, paintings and American Indian artifacts. A collector bought the Kopps' $38,000 18th-century quilt, with a center square by John Hewson, a pioneer printer.
European antiques also did well. During the first two days, Karl Kemp, a Greenwich Village dealer, sold 15 pieces of European furniture and decorations, including an 1820's ebony-inlaid Biedermeier writing table from Vienna, which was priced at $16,000. The SoHo dealer Elizabeth Street sold an 18th-century Italian well head of white Istrian stone. Priced at $24,000, it weighed 1,500 pounds and was shipped to Pennsylvania.
Shirley Day, a London dealer in Oriental art, sold eight important items. The costliest -- $90,000 -- was a 10th-century Khmer figure, almost five feet tall.
"We've done better here than at any other fair," Ms. Day said, adding, "including Grosvenor House in London and the Biennale in Paris and the International show."
Rare 18th-century silver changed hands swiftly during the January show. Jonathan Trace of Putnam Valley, N.Y., sold a rococo coffeepot made by Wilmington's Bancroft Woodcock with an asking price of $80,000. And at the booth of the New York dealer Eric Shrubsole, the $45,000 pair of 1752 candlesticks by Edward Wakelan of London was bought by a New York collector.
Jewelry dealers were also satisfied. The most expensive object sold by Peter Schaffer of A La Vieille Russie was an 18th-century English brooch, priced at $29,000. Edward Munves of James Robinson, another Manhattan dealer, said jewelry sales were the best ever in his six years at this show.
"Business improved dramatically on Wednesday, Nov. 4," Mr. Munves said. "Ever since Election Day, our sales have soared."

HEADLINE: A Balancing Act for TriBeCa Zoning

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
IN TriBeCa, city planners have seen the present. And they think it may work.
They are trying to reconcile zoning policy with the realities of the existing neighborhood. Also, in something of a departure, they are trying to coordinate their work with simultaneous designations by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. "I thought it was important to see if we could have zoning and historic district designation complementary," said Richard L. Schaffer, director of the City Planning Department and chairman of the City Planning Commission. 
 "That's a major breakthrough," said Marla G. Simpson, director of land-use planning for Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan. "It's not that anybody has been working against that direction but I think it takes a lot of willpower on the part of agencies to bring their agendas into sync. It's really encouraging that they did that."
Not everyone is encouraged, however. "The worry at our end is that preservation is determining what planning goals should be," said Michael Slattery, a senior vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York. "They've got things upside down."
As it stands today, much of the zoning in TriBeCa seems upside down, at least in its relation to the streetscape. Where five-story structures predominate, zoning allows skyscrapers like the financially troubled 52-story Tribeca Tower apartment building at 105 Duane Street, west of Broadway. Where zoning is meant to retain manufacturers and wholesalers, these industries are drying up and departing.
TriBeCa -- the triangle below Canal Street -- was for many years home to the wholesale butter, cheese and egg markets; dealers in textiles and dry groceries; graphic-arts concerns; warehousers and manufacturers of shoes, electrical goods and machinery.
Planners once called it the "Northwest Goods Handling Area" (although the acronym NoGoHa was never coined). A 1966 plan described the area as one of "small businesses in older buildings, declining employment and an increasingly unattractive environment."
Then something happened that planners had not foreseen. The residential population exploded. Loft dwellers, artists and entrepreneurs were drawn to TriBeCa by the 19th-century scale, by little architectural gems that lined its small streets and by the mix of tranquility and grittiness in the old quarter.
On the other hand were landlords who had held, purchased or assembled properties against the plausible assumption that Wall Street firms might migrate north and city bureaucracies might shift to the west.
As the number of residents increased, so did their concern that the very qualities that attracted them to TriBeCa in the first place would be jeopardized by high-intensity development. But owners feared that preservation or rezoning would greatly limit their ability to exploit these trends, leaving them saddled with antiquated, decrepit structures.
Two years ago, the Landmarks Preservation Commission created the first of four historic districts in TriBeCa. The remaining three were designated in December. A month later, the Planning Department recommended rules to reduce density and preserve the "street wall" formed by buildings in eastern TriBeCa. For the western blocks, planners recommended an increase in density and the removal of some restrictions on residential construction and commercial development.
"What we tried to do was make zoning much more sensitive to the existing fabric of the community," Mr. Schaffer said.
The Planning Commission underscored this aim Monday, when it endorsed the new historic districts, 11 to 1. In its report to the City Council, which can modify or even deny the designations, the Planning Commission concluded that each district "will help sustain the physical and economic revitalization already under way in the area" and is "consistent with plans for the area's future development and improvement."
IF the fate of TriBeCa West is a reliable guide, the Council may remove some properties but otherwise leave the areas alone. The zoning recommendations are now being circulated for comment and are not likely to reach the Council until next year.
The chairwoman of the TriBeCa-Washington Market committee of Community Board 1, Madelyn Wils, said, "The whole idea that the Planning Commission has accepted the fact that preservation makes for good economics is a very big step for the city."
"I believe this is a precedent," she said, "to actually look at a community which is presently in the process of being landmarked and to look at zoning at the same time, and work hand in hand."
City planners noted the 34-page "TriBeCa West Historic District Manual," by the landmarks commission, New York Landmarks Conservancy and Ehrenkrantz & Eckstut Architects, and urged that similar handbooks be prepared for the other districts.
The manual describes building characteristics and materials -- sidewalks, entrances, walls, windows, fire escapes, cornices, parapets -- indicating the contribution made by each to the overall quality of the district.
Metal awnings, for example, are noted as being "significant features in the TriBeCa West district" that "should be retained."
The manual also suggests areas in which owners have some leeway. Since sign bands are a typical feature of upper stories on buildings in the district, painted or applied signs may be found not only appropriate but "in keeping with this historic tradition."
There are even guidelines offered for new construction, giving a prospective builder some idea of what the commission is looking for and what it would probably not accept.
"If you read this, you'll be able to get a sense of what you can do," said Laurie Beckelman, chairwoman of the landmarks agency. "If you're willing to come to the table and follow the rules, you'll get through the system very, very quickly."
Such assurances are not enough to assuage major business and real estate leaders who believe that historic districts -- where any construction, demolition or exterior alteration is subject to approval from the landmarks agency -- seriously inhibit economic development by discouraging large-scale building and forcing owners to go through a time-consuming regulatory maze.
"We are not against preservation per se," said Dr. Barbara L. Christen, president of the Downtown-Lower Manhattan Association. "But we do become concerned that there be a balance between preservation and the potential for growth and development. The unique nature of the downtown community as the economic engine of the region makes it that much more important that you consider maintenance of that balance."
"The proximity of TriBeCa to lower Manhattan is an asset of great potential," she continued. "The intense concentration of financial services is a very attractive resource to the rest of the world. One direction in which it might expand is TriBeCa."
For that reason, she said, the association opposed the "blanket designation" of historic districts and favored individual landmark status where warranted.
Mr. Slattery of the Real Estate Board of New York also said that land-use policy must balance preservation against other needs.
"What's in the best interest of the city includes where growth should take place, what's the acceptable level, what role the neighborhood character should have," he said. "What about these other planning needs? They certainly haven't gotten equal time."
But Mr. Schaffer said that was exactly the point of the new recommendations. "The overall notion was to have balanced zoning for preservation and growth," he said.
On the growth side, he cited the proposal to change zoning in those parts of the Lower Manhattan Mixed-Use District from Murray to Warren Street and from Reade to North Moore Street.
This special manufacturing district was created in 1976 to retain industry, while permitting the conversion of existing buildings into loft dwellings. Within the district, new residential construction is prohibited and prospective commercial tenants are required to get a special permit from the Planning Commission.
CITY planners would allow new residential construction with a floor-area ratio (F.A.R.) of 5, meaning that a building could have 5 times as much floor space as the lot it occupies. Restrictions would be eliminated on the commercial use of ground-floor and second-floor space.
On the preservation side, Mr. Schaffer noted the proposals for Broadway, from Chambers to Walker Street, and Church Street, from Reade to Thomas Street and from Worth to Walker Street.
Zoning now permits towers with a floor-area ratio of 10, but a developer can get a 20 percent bonus for providing a plaza. That yields a floor-area ratio of 12. And the plaza squeezes the building bulk onto a smaller site, therefore pushing the tower higher.
On Broadway, planners recommended eliminating the plaza bonus, to encourage buildings that more closely resemble those around them. Commercial structures would be limited to a floor-area ratio of 10. Residential developers could still build at a ratio of 12 if they also provided lower-income housing.
On Church Street, planners recommended cutting the maximum bulk in half, to a floor-area ratio of 6.
Chambers Street is mixed. The western part of the street is zoned with a floor-area ratio of 5, while the eastern part has a ratio of 10. Planners would even that out to a ratio of 7.5 for most of the stretch between Broadway and Greenwich Street.
The city has not completely retreated from the 1980's vision of TriBeCa as Wall Street North. One major, government-sponsored project still in the pipeline is the New York Exchanges Headquarters proposal on a city-owned site bounded by Greenwich and West Streets, Warren and Murray Streets.
Since it was proposed in 1990, the project has gone through several transformations, shrinking as it went -- but not enough to satisfy its opponents, who do not want the structure built at all.
It was originally to have been a 47-story, 1.2 million-square-foot structure, costing $450 million, to house the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange; Commodity Exchange; New York Mercantile Exchange; New York Cotton Exchange and New York Futures Exchange. Public subsidies and benefits were to amount to about $142.5 million.
The Mercantile Exchange has since split from the group and is now negotiating independently for 260,000 square feet of space in Shearson Lehman Brothers' Faulkner Center, at Greenwich and Hubert Streets.
To accommodate the exchange, substantial interior reconstruction would be necessary. For example, an existing floor slab would have to be removed to create a new trading floor. The city and state are providing about $80 million in capital contributions and tax incentives, said Anthony Mannarino, first executive vice president of the city's Economic Development Corporation.
Some $95 million in public benefits are earmarked for the revised Exchanges Headquarters project, which will cost about $160 million, Mr. Mannarino said. These include a $75 million contribution toward construction, $22 million of which would be recouped through payments in lieu of taxes; $25 million in property tax abatements and $17 million in ground-rent savings, sales-tax savings and low-cost power.
As revised, the Exchanges Headquarters would have about 500,000 square feet, including a 50,000-square-foot trading floor. It would have 10 stories but, at about 170 feet, would be equal in height to a 14-story office building. It is not yet clear whether or how the project will be affected by the prospective merger of the Commodity Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade. "We need to sit down with the Comex group very soon to understand precisely where they are," Mr. Mannarino said.
The director of exchange relations for Comex, Alan Hanson, said that if the merger is approved by the two bodies, the Board of Trade "fully supports the need of the exchanges here to go forward with the new trading facility."
A lawsuit has been filed against the project by several groups and individuals, including the TriBeCa Community Association. The suit challenges the legality of the benefits and subsidies, the adequacy of the environmental impact assessment and the standing of public agencies in the project. An officer of the community association, Nancy Page, said the exchanges "could go into existing space, like the Merc has, and it would be a much better deal for everybody."

HEADLINE: Talking: Subleasing;
Defying The Rules In Co-ops

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
TOUGH economic times can tempt otherwise law-abiding people into questionable dealings. Symptomatic of this has been a rise in the number of shareholders in New York City co-ops who have been subletting without their board's approval.
"Nowadays, whenever anyone calls me to say they have a 'discreet' sublet to offer, I know exactly what they mean," said John Griffin, president of Griffin Realty Group, rental specialists in Manhattan. 
 The shareholder, he said, may offer the doorman several hundred dollars to help maintain confidentiality. At other times, he said, a subtenant is brought in ostensibly as a relative. Mr. Griffin said he refuses to get involved in such dealings.
Deborah Davis, a Manhattan lawyer specializing in co-op litigation, said there had been an increase in the number of shareholders "who are just moving people in."
Experts say the regulations are most likely to be defied when boards drag their heels on requests for approval. The climate of defiance is heightened if the building has a reputation for requiring excessive documentation and then rejecting worthy applicants. And some buildings have made their sublet surcharges so onerous that a shareholder may flout the rules just to avoid the fees.
"I had one woman call me who wanted to know if we could make it all very 'discreet' because if the board found out they would charge her $4,500," said Mr. Griffin. "And that was just for a five-month tenancy."
Board members have been defending their position by arguing that such anarchy chips at the very core of co-op ownership, that one of the primary attractions of a co-op apartment -- in contrast to a condominium -- is the chance to enjoy an enhanced quality of life, in part by retaining veto powers over who can live in the building through screening prospective subtenants.
Boards see other needs for the exercise of those powers. Wilma Gottlieb, president of the 333-unit co-op at 2 Tudor City Place, said that her board was concerned that total freedom for sublets could discourage shareholders from making bona fide efforts to sell.
"And if an apartment is occupied it's also more difficult to sell," she maintained. As a result, she added, the building could eventually "take on a transient nature."
Boards may need to make such views more widely understood. This may be so even if they have made great strides in liberalizing and streamlining sublet policies over the last three years, which may have been done in response to the weaker market and the financial difficulty many shareholders have been facing.
For example, the Tudor Place co-op will now consider a four- or even a five-year sublet if a shareholder can show real hardship or has made a good-faith effort to sell without success, said Ms. Gottlieb. Subletting used to be limited at Tudor Place to one year and was permitted only if the shareholder intended to return.
Many boards, already walking a tightrope between protection and compassion, are unwilling to accept that some shareholders would have the audacity to bypass even a liberalized policy. Thus more and more of them are threatening recalcitrant shareholders with eviction.
But those powers are in jeopardy. In Lincoln Guild Housing Corporation v. Stuckelman, Judge Peter Wendt of New York Housing Court ruled in November that Anna Stuckelman, a shareholder at 303 West 66th Street, had the right to let her grandniece occupy her apartment without board approval.
Judge Wendt based his decision on an interpretation of the state's 1983 Roommate Law, which gave a primary tenant the right to bring one other person to live in the unit without the landlord's approval. Shareholders are frequently classified as primary tenants by the courts because they are, in essence, tenants of the co-op corporation.
THUS, argued Judge Wendt, the customary language in a co-op proprietary lease restricting occupancy to the shareholder's immediate family is contrary to the intention of the roommate law and cannot be upheld. The Lincoln Guild co-op had argued that the grandniece was an illegal subtenant since Mrs. Stuckelman had been in a nursing home at the time.
"This could mean that any shareholder can now put anyone into an apartment at any time," warned Howard Schechter, the lawyer who represented the Lincoln Guild co-op. Indeed, the decision is already being cited as a defense in a similar case involving a co-op at 345 East 93d Street -- Mill Rock Owners Corp. v. Timothy McEvoy.
Moreover, there is now the fear that the decision might embolden even more shareholders to slip unauthorized subtenants into their apartments. Thus, both the Council of New York Cooperatives and the Federation of New York Housing Cooperatives have filed amicus briefs with the New York State Supeme Court's Appellate Term, First Department, where the Lincoln Guild case is being reviewed.
"It could result in overcrowding and over-utilization of a co-op's facilities," said Charles Rappaport, the federation's president. "And then everyone's maintenance will go up. What about security? Soon it won't be safe to live in a co-op anymore."
How should a board proceed in the meantime?
In December, Richard Siegler, a New York City lawyer specializing in co-ops, sent a bulletin to 105 client boards urging them not to feel pressured into even greater liberalization because of the Lincoln Guild decision. He maintains, as do most co-op lawyers, that it will be reversed on appeal.
Assuming Lincoln Guild is reversed, careful monitoring plus compromise could become the most appropriate response. Ms. Davis said that when a nonauthorized sublet came to the attention of her client boards "we normally start by sending out a notice to cure what is essentially a lease violation."
Often this is enough, she said, for both sides to reach a settlement allowing the shareholder to retain the subtenant, provided the subtenant gains retroactive board approval.
If, however, the Lincoln Guild decision is upheld, a board should at least try to keep a current a list of all residents, said Marc Luxemburg, president of the council, "and not allow anyone in who isn't authorized by a shareholder."
But he added that the appeals court might instead only partially reverse the decision. At the very least, this would let a board limit the number of additional occupants and require the shareholder to be using the apartment as a primary residence while the other person was there.

HEADLINE: Gains Tax

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The recently issued advisory opinion referred to in your Jan. 10 Perspectives column about the New York gains tax superficially appears to be an effort by the Department of Taxation and Finance to recognize the reality of a depressed market. 
 The opinion permits foreclosing lenders to calculate gains-tax liability based on current fair-market value of the foreclosed property instead of the amount foreclosed upon, provided the lender acquires a controlling interest in the defaulted company instead of direct ownership of the defaulted property.
Foreclosing lenders are supposed to take heart from this bureaucratic palliative.
Rather than being a road map away from an often artificial gains-tax liability for foreclosing lenders, the advisory opinion may actually lead into a minefield. First, it will not work in the case of an individual, who obviously cannot transfer a controlling interest in himself or herself. Second, acquiring a controlling interest in a corporation or partnership carries with it all of the acquired entity's liabilities, disclosed and undisclosed. Third, it cannot be used if the defaulted entity also owns other real property that is not the subject of the default. Fourth, if the property is owned by a limited partnership whose investors are shielded from personal liability for the gains tax, they would have little incentive to transfer their interests to the lender.
While certain foreclosing lenders may benefit from this advisory opinion, we submit that it is inapplicable in the vast majority of instances. The fairer course would be to implement a uniform rule that, in any foreclosure, gains tax is to be calculated based upon the lesser of current fair market value or the amount foreclosed upon. Fairness could also be enhanced by permitting the basis to be increased by the real costs incurred by defaulted developers. In this way, what in reality is a substantial economic loss that undoubtedly led to the lender's takeover will not be artificially transformed into a tax-generating "gain."
Finally, now that net gains-tax revenues are one-eighth of what they were at their zenith, has New York reduced the gains-tax bureaucracy by a corresponding percentage?

HEADLINE: Effective? Maybe. Profitable? Clearly.

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif.

 BODY:
THE Tokos Medical Corporation, which sells a service that detects early labor in pregnant women, recently started a program to reward obstetricians who ordered it for their patients.
In its files the company called the program "Dr. Deal." The deal: earn up to $20,000 annually on an investment of $1,000. 
 The program, in which 300 to 400 obstetricians nationwide are participating, works like this: The doctors put up $1,000 each to become shareholders in a company set up by Tokos that typically exists only on paper. In return, the doctors pocket 15 percent of the payment for any Tokos services prescribed by members of the physician-owned company. Tokos says participating physicians currently average about $5,000 a year from the arrangement; literature from one Tokos subsidiary boasted that annual earnings could reach $22,500.
When doctors do prescribe it, Tokos's home-monitoring service is not cheap. It costs $100 to $300 a day, or about $5,000 a pregnancy. That's a hard sell among cost-conscious insurers, so Tokos has 20 employees who make the company's case -- and they have had increasing success in persuading insurers to pay.
But a debate is growing about the effectiveness of the home uterine monitor that is the keystone of Tokos's service. The Food and Drug Administration is also investigating Tokos's marketing claims. Separately, there is a scientific controversy about the safety of the drugs Tokos sells to prolong pregnancy.
Some doctors are concerned about not only Tokos's marketing practices but also the willingness of some physicians to take part in its investment plans. "It is a sad day for medicine," said Dr. Benjamin Sachs, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston.
A look at Tokos's marketing efforts highlights one of the most troubling issues in health care: Medical companies often go to great lengths to encourage doctors to use their products, and to persuade insurers to pay for them. And they can succeed even when significant questions exist about a product's efficacy and safety.
Health-care experts say that nothing will change -- and medical costs will never be satisfactorily controlled -- without a systematic effort, whether by the Government or the private sector, to study medical technologies and identify who will most benefit from them.
"This is an extraordinarily pervasive problem," said Dr. Robert H. Brook, director of the health sciences program at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif. "The Government has to step in to help resolve the risks and benefits of these practices and then decide what is going to be used in basic medical care."
 
A Warning for Clinton
 Some experts think the problem so great that the Clinton Administration's effort to reform the health-care system by managing competition among insurers will fail unless it identifies which competing treatments and technologies are most effective. "Managed competition does not have the ability to deal with this problem," said Dr. Mark Chassin, Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health.
Pressure is also growing to crack down on financial-incentive programs that may affect the way physicians treat patients.
Tokos's chairman and chief executive, Robert F. Byrnes, said in an interview last week that his company's investment plan for physicians was both legal and ethical because it compensated doctors for paperwork and other chores for which insurers do not pay. He added that Tokos was helping to reduce the medical catastrophes associated with premature birth, and in the process holding down medical costs by keeping women out of the hospital.
"We have raised everyone's consciousness about the problem of prematurity," he said. "And we are very proud of our system because it works."
But Kirk Johnson, an attorney for the American Medical Association, said his group was investigating possible conflicts of interest posed by physician investment plans like those offered by Tokos. And three weeks ago, a Federal task force recommended an end to plans under which physicians refer patients to businesses that they own but in which they don't participate directly.
"This is a very murky area that we are very concerned about," Mr. Johnson said.
Founded in 1983, Tokos is the leading company in a burgeoning industry that has sprung up to prevent premature births, a leading cause of birth defects and infant mortality.
It is by no means alone in its aggressive efforts to gain acceptance of its product among physicians and insurers. Its two largest competitors, Healthdyne Inc. and Caremark International Inc., also provide financial incentives to physicians to use similar services. And there are many other technologies, new and old, whose efficacy remains unproven. Two examples: positron emission tomography for cardiac imaging, and the use of antigens for detection of ovarian cancer.
The need to prevent premature births is a compelling one. Each year 6 to 8 percent of infants are born prematurely (defined as before the 37th week of gestation), some so early that they die or suffer crippling defects. A troubled pregnancy can be devastating. And associated medical costs can reach $1 million.
Doctors cannot predict early delivery, though women carrying more than one fetus or having a history of early labor are considered to be at greatest risk. And though women can be trained to recognize some signs of early labor, home monitoring detects contractions a woman may not feel. Also, a physician who might have hospitalized a woman for early labor -- at $500 a day -- now may have a cheaper choice.
It is a choice most patients prefer. "If the patient knows about monitoring, God forbid you if you don't provide it," said Dr. J. Joshua Kopelman, an obstetrician in Aurora, Colo.
 
A Growing Acceptance
 The use of home monitoring of pregnancies is growing sharply. Last year, Tokos, which controls about 65 percent of the market, treated about 25,000 patients, a 25 percent increase from 1991. Through the first nine months of 1992, the company had revenues of $124 million.
To use the Tokos monitor, a woman straps around her abdomen a belt containing a sensor that detects uterine contractions. The hourlong reading is made one or more times a day and is transmitted by telephone lines to one of 60 Tokos offices staffed by nurses who analyze the data. Should the data suggest that the woman is experiencing early labor, a Tokos nurse calls her physician, who may prescribe terbutaline or ritodrine, medications dispensed by Tokos in a home-infusion kit, to relax the uterus.
A single monitor reading is $100 a day; additional readings and drugs raise that to $300. Visits by a Tokos nurse, required in the most serious cases, cost extra.
As for the company's profitability, Mr. Byrnes, interviewed at Tokos's headquarters in this city south of Los Angeles, said it had a profit margin of 15 to 17 percent of revenues.
While the company's service is expensive, many people think it worth the price. Deborah Jones, of Wayne, N.J., lost a child after going into labor early. In her most recent pregnancy, her physician prescribed Tokos monitoring and she had a healthy girl. "I found great relief and security in the monitor," she said.
Even many of the company's critics agree that intensive contact between a nurse and an expectant mother, part of Tokos's regimen, may help prolong a pregnancy.
 
But Does It Work?
 But does the Tokos technology itself -- the devices that transmit data on uterine activity to the nurses -- have any benefit beyond a psychological one in producing healthier babies? That is the nub of the dispute.
Some scientists argue that educating the patient to recognize symptoms or simply putting her in daily contact with a nurse would be just as helpful -- and less expensive. Some insurers say they could provide nursing more cheaply than Tokos.
In the mid-1980's, studies by researchers including Dr. Michael Katz, chief of perinatology at the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco, and Dr. John C. Morrison of the University of Mississippi appeared to support the value of the monitoring. But in 1988, Dr. Jay Iams of Ohio State University published a study that set the battle lines.
Dr. Iams said he initially assumed that his study would prove monitoring's benefits by showing that it extended more pregnancies than did simple daily telephone contact between a patient and a nurse. Instead, he found no difference. "I think everyone was shocked," Dr. Iams said.
But in recent years, much of the research both pro and con has come under attack as scientifically flawed. And, lacking a definitive study, the scientists involved in the debate have only dug in their heels.
Those opposing the growing use of the Tokos service, including Dr. Sachs of Beth Israel in Boston, see it as consuming money that might be better used for patient education. But advocates, like Dr. Morrison, who is now a paid Tokos consultant, say it helps a nurse do her job better.
"I think the literature is clear that you need the whole system," he said.
Last year, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a professional group, declined for the second time to recommend the routine use of home pregnancy monitoring for high-risk patients. The group cited, among other things, a lack of clear research showing benefits.
Also, a study by a Canadian team published last year in The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that ritodrine is not effective and in fact can cause health problems like maternal heart arrythmia, and, in rare instances, death. The other drug used by Tokos, terbutaline, is chemically similar to ritodrine.
It is a dispute that has left insurers frustrated over what to do. While a majority of the nation's 73 Blue Cross and Blue Shield programs do pay for Tokos claims, about 20 plans do not. State Medicaid plans are also divided.
But efforts by Tokos's team of 20 people who visit insurers appear to be paying off. The company is getting about 80 percent of its orders approved by insurers, up from about 65 percent in 1990, Mr. Byrnes said.
The company's weapons have been studies like a 1990 report by Dr. Thomas S. Kosasa of the John A. Burns School of Medicine in Hawaii that found that home monitoring of 79 patients reduced insurance costs by $11,500 a patient.
Some insurers agreed that monitoring might avert catastrophic health problems associated with premature infants. "It is less costly to have 10 patients monitored -- even if only one may need it -- than to have one patient with a perinatal disaster and have that baby in the hospital with brain damage for months or for the rest of its life," said Dr. Marvin Blitz, the vice president for medical policy and research at Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield in New York.
Other insurance executives, like Dr. Wade Aubry, medical director of Blue Shield of California, have looked at the data and reached a different conclusion: that there's no evidence that the monitoring -- as opposed to educating the patient or offering counseling -- makes a difference.
No matter who's right, investment plans like Tokos's are coming under increased scrutiny. In the past year alone, Tokos has set up about 40 physician-owned companies nationwide. Some of the groups were set up by a company known as Women's Homecare, a joint venture between Tokos and T<2> Medical Inc., a concern in Alpharetta, Ga., that pioneered doctor-owned companies in the home-care field.
The plans appear to be part of a high-stakes battle for physicians' loyalty. Victor J. Weinstein, an obstetrician in Charleston, S.C., who is a member of the Tokos plan, recalled his initial encounter with company officials. "We said to them, 'Why are you doing this?' " he said. "They said they were afraid of losing market share to competitors. They said, 'We want to make you a part of us.' "
The major concern with such plans is that physicians will prescribe unnecessary services so they can make more money. Another problem: doctors may form loyalties to companies like Tokos and so overlook more innovative or cost-effective treatments.
Federal law bars physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to companies in which they have a financial interest. But it does not cover private patients. The Tokos plan involves only private patients.
 
Doctors Are Divided
 Doctors who use Tokos's services are of two minds on the compensation. Dr. Weinstein, the Charleston obstetrician, said the investment plan was a way of compensating him for added time spent on home-care patients. But Dr. Kopelman, the Colorado obstetrician, said he and his partner decided last year to turn down Tokos's offer of fees to "supervise" cases. "We did not feel it represented any additional time so we did not feel that we needed any additional compensation," he said.
For his part, Mr. Byrnes said he was comfortable with the plans and was checking to make sure doctors were not overprescribing just to make more money. "We invite anyone to come in and look at our books."
He may soon find a taker. "The kind of returns these plans are offering physicians seem way out of line with the investment at stake," said Mr. Johnson of the A.M.A. He said that he had been unaware of the details of the Tokos plan and that the company had not sought an ethics ruling from the A.M.A. on the plan.
Ironically, Tokos may have pushed its monitor so aggressively because of insurers' reimbursement policies. Typically, insurers will pay only for drugs and devices, not nursing services alone, Mr. Byrnes said. And insurers like Mr. Blitz said that if the Tokos monitor proved ineffective, they would use their own nurses, not Tokos's, to talk with patients.
The company's claims in support of its own service have concerned some insurers. "The device was approved in a very narrow way but that is not the way it is necessarily marketed," said Dr. Gerald Silverstein, vice president for the Celtic Life Insurance Company in Chicago, which does pay for some Tokos claims.
Indeed, the company may have overreached in some of its claims. It promotes its service -- the monitor, nursing and drugs -- as effective in reducing premature births. But the F.D.A. has approved only the use of the monitor, not the service as a whole, and only then to detect early labor in the small group of women who have a history of early delivery. Also, the Government has never approved terbutaline as a birth-delaying drug or Tokos's claim that its system can reduce early births.
While it is legal and common for physicians to prescribe drugs and devices for unapproved uses, a company may not market its products for such uses or making unapproved claims for those products.
An F.D.A. spokeswoman declined to comment on her agency's inquiry into Tokos's claims. But Tokos officials said they have recently moved to separate their claims about the monitor and the service.
Mr. Byrnes said the debate surrounding his company had been caused by a small group of scientists opposed to monitoring and by short sellers. The stock, which was trading at $46.25 a share in December 1991, closed at $14 a share on Friday.
 
A Call for Research
 For all the debate, the question of whether Tokos's monitor is worth the price may never be adequately answered. What is needed, many people say, is studies that separate the benefits provided by the monitor from those offered by talking with a nurse.
In recent months, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, a Federal agency, has tried to raise $6 million to finance such a study. But both Tokos and Healthdyne officials turned down a request to help underwrite the research, said Dr. Donald McNellis, the institute's special assistant for obstetrics. (Caremark, the smallest of the three home-care providers, has expressed interest.)
Mr. Byrnes said it was time to move beyond the monitoring debate and finance studies to better identify women at risk of premature delivery.
Dr. Iams said he could understand why there was so little interest among the home-monitoring companies. "They are out marketing their services and making money," he said. "The only thing that this study can do is hurt them."

 
 
SOME QUESTIONS RAISED IN CANADA
 LAST YEAR, Canadian researchers stirred further controversy about Tokos's home-care service. They reported in The New England Journal of Medicine that the drug ritodrine, used to delay delivery, did not appear effective and could cause health problems like heart arrhythmias and, in a small number of cases, death.
In its home-care regimen, Tokos uses both ritodrine and terbutaline, a chemically similar drug, as prescribed by a patient's physician. Terbutaline is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for early labor, but obstetricians use it widely.
The drugs, which are also asthma medications, work by relaxing the uterus. Initially, they are given to a woman orally, sometimes as early as the 24th week of pregnancy. But if a woman has an episode of early labor, Tokos will use a home infusion kit to deliver the drugs by injection.
In October, an F.D.A. advisory panel met to review the Canadian study. It found that ritodrine was effective when used intravenously, but expressed concerns about the drug's safety and recommended that the drug be used only in pregnancies of 33 weeks or less. In terms of oral usage, the panel found that ritodrine was of little benefit at current dosage levels and that further study was needed to see if an effective dose could be found.
As for terbutaline, the panel said that it was "concerned" about its growing unapproved use and asked the agency to look into how it might be best controlled and whether patients should be warned about its dangers.

Photos/Chart: "High-Tech Pregnancy Testing"
 The Tokos monitor is used by an expectant mother at home for an hour at a time. A sensing device records uterine contractions which are tranmitted by telephone to a monitoring station. The average daily cost of the basic service. which can start in the 24th week, is $100.
 At the monitoring station, a nurse reviews the data and discusses possible symptoms of early labor with a patient. She may also provides advice. As the preceived patient risk grows so does the frequency monitoring driving the average daily cost up to $150.
 Should preterm labor begin, patients are put on birth-delaying drugs, such as terbutaline, in an effort to extend the pregnancy. There may also be house calls by a Tokos nurse and the service's cost can rise to $250 or more. As with the monitor, there is scientific debate about the efficicacy of terbutaline, as well as its safety. (Source: Tokos) (pg. 6)

HEADLINE: At Work;
Labor Takes a Happy Breath

SERIES: Next Week: The third in a series of articles about research in work and family issues.

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble

 BODY:
THE labor movement, represented by the leaders of its 33 largest unions, is gathering this week on the sands of sunny Florida for its annual winter meeting. For the first time in more than a decade, it may not actually need the refuge that the swank of Bal Harbour provides. For 12 years, in labor's view, the arriviste and the aristocrat stood shoulder to shoulder against the working person.
Now Citizen Clinton is in the White House and, labor would say, finally a few things are right with the world. Mr. Clinton has signed two executive orders reversing Reagan-Bush Administration positions on rules at Federal work sites and on the use of union dues. He is considering amnesty for the striking air traffic controllers fired by Ronald Reagan. He has appointed Robert Reich to resurrect the Labor Department from the near-death experience it has suffered under 12 years of Republican stewardship. 
 And if Mr. Reich's favorite song is not "Look for the Union Label," he is at least on the same wavelength as the unions and has already put many of organized labor's issues on the top of his priority pile. "We are delighted with Robert Reich," said Rex Hardesty, a spokesman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "We've always said that economic policy was what mattered."
When Mr. Reich meets with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. executive council at Bal Harbour on Tuesday, he is certain to be received more warmly than the most recent Labor Secretary, Lynn Martin, who came and repeatedly stuffed statistics on the decline of the unionized work force into the face of Lane Kirkland, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president.
But, if Secretary Martin was not as polite as the irate council would have liked about labor's numerical strength, the fact remains that the unions have a problem. In 1992, the percent of unionized workers in the private labor force dropped to 11.5, from 16.8 in 1983, the first year for which there are comparable figures. The percent of unionized workers is lower now than at any time since the National Labor Relations Act was passed in 1935,according to Greg Tarpinian, executive director of the Labor Research Association, a labor group in New York.
"If the current rate of decline continues," Mr. Tarpinian said, "5 percent of the private labor force will be unionized by the year 2000." Growth is occurring mostly in public employee unions, which operate under a different set of rules than do private-sector labor organizations.
There is the obvious problem of whether labor can drum up support at the White House and in Congress for a legislative agenda that includes, in the immediate future, a striker replacement bill and modifications to the North American Free Trade Agreement. In the longer term, some labor leaders would like to see on the table such apparently utopian goals as universal health care, labor law reform -- current labor law imposes restrictions on organizing unlike those in any other industrialized country -- and paid family leave.
There is the less obvious problem of drumming up support among the 177 million people in the work force. Mr. Clinton's election, and with it the dispensing of leadership by the generation of the 40's, has made even more conspicuous the fact that the torch has not, by and large, been passed to a new generation of labor leaders.
No one who remembers an elderly John L. Lewis thundering at his foes is likely to criticize the leadership on grounds of age alone. But labor seems to expend little on image management and the sophisticated technology and techniques by which it occurs -- technology and techniques young political consultants and public relations people, for example, take for granted. "You are not going to get the rank and file motivated without using modern tools of communications," Mr. Tarpinian argues.
Some of labor's problems are rooted in American attitudes, especially middle-class, white-collar attitudes. "It's a difficult hurdle for many Americans," said Gary Hubbard, a spokesman for the United Steelworkers of America. "They think they're independent and can take care of themselves."
But America -- the part that's at the mercy of downsizing, restructuring and revamping -- may be catching up with the union movement. Labor is worried about global competition and the loss of high-paying jobs, about the lack of affordable health care, about the decline in the middle-class standard of living and the lack of job security, about the viability of pension funds. Sound familiar, white-collar America?
 
 
 
WHAT THE WOMEN ARE CALLING FOR
 ALONG with many people around the country in the last few weeks, Joyce Miller believes she has been watching the appointment of the Attorney General turn into a women's issue. The woeful Zoe Baird-Kimba Wood interlude, she says, helped highlight a key issue: the lack of adequate child care for all working women. "Women have to reach out to whoever they can to take care of their children," said Ms. Miller, a member of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. executive council and president of the Coalition of Labor Union Women.
Though Ms. Miller is loyal to labor at large, it is her professional duty to serve the interests of union women, not always an easy job in a movement still dominated by men. Though C.L.U.W. is almost 20 years old, only two women serve on the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s executive council. Ms. Miller says women are gradually working their way up the pipeline. They serve now as secretary-treasurers, department heads and high-level assistants.
The pool feeding the pipeline is growing in size and influence. The International Labor Organization reported recently that the number of female union members doubled between 1960 and 1990, to 6.2 million from 3.1 million. The issues? Among others, "Increasing the minimum wage," said Ms. Miller. "Getting more women into the higher paying nontraditional jobs."
She favors paid family and medical leaves. She agrees that possibility was precisely what business objected to during debates about the Family and Medical Leave Act, which grants 12 weeks of unpaid leave. "It will not be nearly the nightmare they're trying to make it," she argues. "Other countries have done this and survived. Look at Germany. They are thriving."

HEADLINE: The Clinton Economic Plan's Winners and Losers

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE economic plan that President Clinton unveils this week will be the biggest earthquake to hit the nation's economy since President Reagan took office 12 years ago, turning many industries topsy-turvy, leaving some badly damaged and some better-off.
The plan will reshape the economic landscape, the President's aides say, by creating a tax credit for business investment, establishing a broad-based energy tax, cutting capital gains taxes for new businesses and seriously attacking the budget deficit. 
 While Mr. Clinton vows that the plan will make the American economy stand tall again, many businesses spent last week greasing their powerful Washington lobbying machines in the hope of knocking down whatever parts of the Clinton program would hurt them, and there should be plenty.
Retailers worry that an increase in the corporate income tax would hit them broadside. Computer makers are terrified that the tax credit for business investment may not include computer purchases. And big energy users, like chemical companies, airlines and metal producers, fear that they would be battered by a new energy tax.
Some executives point out that if the plan hits them too hard, economic sense will drive them to hit Mr. Clinton where it hurts: they would open new plants and create new jobs overseas, rather than in the United States.
"If the Administration decides that it's going to make it more difficult for us to compete by raising the cost of doing business, then new investments are not going to be made in this country," said Paul H. O'Neill, chairman of Alcoa, the nation's largest aluminum company.
While the broad outline of Mr. Clinton's plan is known, many details remain under wraps, with industries struggling to figure out whether they will be winners or losers. There will certainly be some last-minute changes and surprises as the Clinton team rummages around to find $145 billion in annual deficit cuts.
To be sure, Mr. Clinton will sprinkle plenty of goodies into his package. The biggest will be an investment tax credit, which will be manna for the nation's machinery producers. Paving companies and producers of railroad cars are delighted by the prospect of increased infrastructure spending. And plans to slash capital gains taxes for investors in start-up businesses should prove a gold mine for venture capitalists.
At the moment, many business executives feel off balance anticipating Mr. Clinton's economic package, worried about proposals that would hurt their bottom lines, but sharing the President's goal of cutting the deficit. Many question the wisdom of mounting an all-out offensive against specific parts of the plan when the President's credo is shared sacrifice to slay the deficit dragon.
"Everyone will have to pay their fair share," Mr. Clinton told business lobbyists on Thursday. "But if you do, we will all be better off, and the business community will be stronger in the years ahead."
Who knows better than executives that slashing the deficit is vital to reduce long-term interest rates and free up more money for private investment. Indeed, there is a palpable sense among some business leaders that tearing down the Clinton plan would make the nation's long-term economic prospects dimmer than ever.
"No increase in our taxes or costs is welcome," said Arnold M. Nemirow, chief executive of the Wisconsin-based Wausau Paper Mills Company. "However, if it's applied fairly and is necessary to help reduce the deficit long-term, we'll all be better off."
 
Investment Tax Credit
 For business, the investment tax credit will be the sweetener that makes the package's bitter medicine palatable. Administration officials talked last week about a a 10 percent credit on investments in equipment, but noted that the percent could still change. They say the credit will probably be incremental, meaning companies would receive the credits only on investments above a certain level of investment in recent years.
Administration policymakers see such a credit as the most powerful tool for speeding up growth, and some economists say it can produce $10 billion to $15 billion extra in equipment spending this year. The biggest winners will be producers of capital equipment, like machinery makers, and capital-intensive industries, like chemicals and metals. "It's very important for us to have a good investment tax credit," said Milton Deaner, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute.
Despite the broad business support for such a credit, lobbyists sound like screeching alley cats in arguing over what the details should be. The Administration favors a temporary credit to get a quick burst of investment over the next year or two, but Allen Lenz, chief economist for the Chemical Manufacturers Association, said, "It should be a permanent thing because if it's temporary, you just get a little extra puff of investment for a minute."
Fortune 500 companies fear the credit will be aimed at small business, and small companies seem allergic to the complexity of an incremental credit.
"The incremental credit being designed is not small-business friendly," said John Motley, vice president at the National Federation of Independent Business. "Incremental credits are complicated. You need good professional help or computer programs to figure them out, and that costs a lot for our members."
Detroit's Big Three fear the credit will not include fleet sales of cars, and Silicon Valley frets that computers will be excluded. "We are working with Administration officials and folks on the Hill to make sure that computers are included," said Ted Heydinger, director of government relations for the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association.
The question of what time period to use as the base of past investment will certainly lead to heavy-duty lobbying. For example, investment by the aircraft and glass industries was especially strong last year, so those industries might be penalized because it would be hard for them to exceed those levels. "I worry that they'll define it in a way that punishes manufacturers who have invested a lot recently while giving the greatest benefits to those who haven't invested much," said Albert W. Moore, president of the Association for Manufacturing Technology, a group of machine tool makers. "That doesn't make sense."
Not surprisingly, many businesses prefer a broad credit rewarding them for every dollar of new investment.
 
Energy Taxes
 For years, many executives supported a gasoline tax to cut the deficit because it would sock consumers while hardly laying a hand on most businesses. Administration officials, however, have signaled that they favor a broad tax on all energy, because drivers would find a gasoline tax unfair.
In addition to raising revenue, such a tax could conserve energy and reduce pollution. The Administration is leaning toward either an ad valorem tax, a fixed tax on all energy use, or a B.T.U. tax levied on the heat value of different energy sources. Either tax is expected to increase the nation's annual energy bill, now $475 billion, by at least $20 billion.
Manufacturers are fuming, contending that such a tax would greatly harm export-oriented companies. "You're going to have a hell of a fight on any energy tax that significantly increases the cost of production," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers. "We can't afford that with everything else going on."
Take the steel industry. Energy accounts for about $100 of the $450 cost of a ton of flat-rolled steel, and an energy tax could increase costs by $10 a ton. Mr. Deaner, president of the Iron and Steel Institute, said, "The industry lost $3 billion in the last two years, or about $15 a ton, so if you add another $5 to $10 to costs, it really hurts."
Perhaps the hardest hit industry would be aluminum because of the huge amounts of energy used in smelting. "To the degree that there is a differential tax impact on energy-intensive industries like aluminum, the ultimate consequence is going to be the most energy-intensive parts of the industry are going to stop being done in the U.S.," Mr. O'Neill, Alcoa's chairman, said. "They will relocate to places with hydroelectric power or other cheap sources, like Venezuela, Brazil or Australia."
Noting that a B.T.U. tax would hurt his company eight times as much as a gasoline tax, Mr. O'Neill urged a gasoline tax or broad-based consumption tax. Many manufacturers favor a broad consumption tax, like a national sales tax, contending it would encourage investment.
Underlining executives' fundamental differences over taxes, Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, attacked a consumption tax. "Our industry is very opposed to a broad-based consumption tax," she said. "It's regressive. It would dampen consumption, and that would send negative ripples through an already fragile economy."
 
Raising Corporate Taxes
 Few businesses are happy about President Clinton's plan to increase the corporate income tax from its current 34 percent level.
Treasury officials have told him that if he goes through with his campaign pledge to increase personal income taxes on the rich to 36 percent from 31 percent, then the corporate rate should rise to the same level. Otherwise, partnerships, whose members pay the personal income tax rate, would incorporate to qualify for the lower corporate rate.
"We are very, very disturbed with this initiative on corporate rates," said Dirk Van Dongen, co-chairman of the Tax Reform Action Coalition, an association representing scores of trade associations and companies. "Corporations create jobs. Implicit in that is you don't take resources away from them."
The corporate tax rise might hurt capital-intensive companies, like chemicals or machinery, least because they can write off their equipment and would now benefit from investment credits. In painful contrast, financial service companies and retailers would feel the full brunt of this increase.
"We pay a very high effective tax rate," said Ms. Mullin of the retail federation. "We have tiny profit margins, maybe 2 percent of sales in a good year. Anything that increases the corporate rate will hurt us immediately."
Administration officials, eager not to alienate the middle class, say that it is more equitable to raise corporate and personal income taxes than payroll or consumption taxes.
But many companies seem ready to wage an all-out battle against the corporate tax increase, arguing that it clashes with the Administration's plan to encourage investment rather than consumption. That means embracing consumption taxes, rather than higher income taxes.
"Everyone else in the world is moving to consumption taxes, and we're talking about higher income taxes," said Roger E. Brinner, chief economist for DRI/McGraw-Hill. "That's terrible international strategy."
 
Infrastructure
 When President Clinton surveys the nation's infrastructure, he sees not America the Beautiful, but America the Bruised and Battered. Thus he plans to increase investment spending by $10 billion to $20 billion annually over the next four years to repair and renovate crumbling highways, rusting bridges and packed airports.
The Administration is also planning to shower money on high-tech projects, like high-speed rail, a nationwide computer highway and a new generation of pollution-control equipment. All this aims to show an America on the mend, one ready to leap into the 21st Century.
Hearing all this, construction firms and transportation equipment companies think they are about to enter heaven.
Mr. Clinton's ambitious infrastructure plans could increase spending on public investment by 10 percent a year. The CMI Corporation, an Oklahoma-based producer of $500,000 highway-paving machines, expects its orders to jump by 20 percent because of the infrastructure frenzy.
"We see a lot of work resurfacing, rehabilitating and widening highways and roads," said John Lillywhite, a director of project development for the Bechtel Group, the San Francisco-based construction giant. "There should also be a lot of opportunity in light rail and high-speed rail."
Mr. Clinton's infrastructure program has two objectives: to give the fragile economy a short-term shot in the arm and to enable American industry to compete better long-term by making transportation and communications faster and cheaper.
"This program is seeking to speed up the recovery and that means cyclical industries would benefit the most," said Laurence H. Meyer, who runs an economics consulting firm in St. Louis.
The cyclical winners are expected to include machinery and metal companies, truck manufacturers and construction firms.
 
Capital Gains Tax Cuts For Small Businesses
 Tearing a page out of the Reagan playbook, the Administration wants to unleash entrepreneurs, but in a scaled-down Democratic way: slashing capital gains taxes for investments in start-up businesses only. Clinton aides say the President will propose some version of a bill sponsored by Senator Dale Bumpers, another Arkansas Democrat, that would eliminate capital gains taxes for investments held for 10 years in companies with $5 million or less in capital. Investors in companies with capital of $100 million or less would receive a 50 percent capital gains tax cut for stock held at least five years.
Venture capitalists -- who are lobbying to increase the threshold to $200 million -- say such a proposal would encourage mom-and-pop start-ups and create tens of thousands of jobs. "If you have a start-up company with no track record, you don't rush to lend it $100 million," said Barry Rogstad, president of the American Business Conference, an association of fast-growing mid-sized companies. "This proposal helps because it will really reduce the cost of capital."
While preferring this proposal to the across-the-board cuts in capital gains taxes favored by former President Bush, some Democrats fear the proposal will serve mainly as a tax break for venture capitalists.
"Not too many moms and pops are lobbying for this proposal, but a lot of venture capitalists are," said Alan Auerbach, an economics professor at the University of Pennsylvania. One fear is that corporations with capital of more than $100 million would exploit this tax break by dividing themselves into smaller units.
Venture capitalists insist the tax break would help the economy at large. "This is much bigger than the venture capital industry; this is about job creation," said Richard Kramlich, managing partner of New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm.
 
Conclusion
 By no means does the above list cover all of the President's proposals that will affect business. Mr. Clinton's vow to increase income taxes on rich Americans will unquestionably hurt Neiman-Marcus and the Four Seasons more than Wal-Mart and Pizza Hut. Then, the President's plan to limit the deductibility for excessive executive pay will anger company chairmen whose boards may rethink astronomical compensation plans.
For months, Mr. Clinton has pledged to make the research and development tax credit permanent, and that should be a shot in the arm to high-tech companies. His plan to beef up the nation's mediocre job training efforts should also help manufacturers.
Like the public at large, the business community runs the risk of focusing on just the proposals that cause immediate pain without stopping to look at Mr. Clinton's big picture -- a picture that includes deficit reduction, a better workforce, and, the President hopes, lower interest rates and higher profits and living standards.
Last week President Clinton warned business lobbyists to get on board, rather than fight his economic plan. "We have got to change," he exhorted them. "The short-term pain of making changes now is so much less than the long-term costs of continuing to do things the way we're doing them."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
With Volatility Rising, Traders Are Twitching

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
AS details leak out regarding President Clinton's economic plan, the financial markets are getting nervous. Not necessarily scared, but jerky.
There are good reasons for such concerns. While public attention in Washington focused on nannies and gay soldiers, the emerging Clinton economic strategy appears to be based on lessons learned from Ronald Reagan: A President's power is greatest at the beginning of an Administration, while the economic statistics are most important in the last year of a term. 
 The economy was horrible early in Mr. Reagan's first term, a fact that did not prevent his re-election. It was just fine early in George Bush's administration, a fact that did him little good in 1992.
It appears that Mr. Clinton hopes to push through unpopular tax increases, including a broader tax on Social Security benefits, while cutting at least a few spending programs. In the longer term, such a budget-control strategy has a lot to recommend it. But the more immediate impact will probably be negative, as tighter fiscal policy slows a recovery that already is the weakest in memory.
The stock market's current high multiples assume that corporate profits will grow at a good clip. But a weak-recovery strategy would tend to hold down profits, as would an increase in corporate income taxes. The idea of using the tax law to penalize companies whose executives are paid in the millions might not bring in much revenue, but it would set a negative tone in Wall Street-Washington relations. Nervousness related to such talk helped give the Nasdaq composite its worst week since last September, down 1.5 percent.
The Treasury bond market ought to like such talk, but even it had its moments of nervousness last week. Buyers balked at the new 10-year Treasury bond, and for a day it appeared the brokers had bid too high and might suffer big losses. But Clinton tax talk helped push rates back down, producing sighs of relief around Wall Street.
Perhaps the most intriguing indications of nervousness are in the commodities markets. The sudden bull market in lumber -- in which the price of boards for delivery next month has risen from 22 cents a board foot last fall to more than 39 cents now -- took almost everyone by surprise. James Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, suggests it could be heralding a renewal of inflation, but the conventional wisdom is that lumber prices will soon subside.
Even long-dormant precious metals came to life for a couple of days last week. The markets clearly suspect that something is about to change, but are not sure just what.
The increased volatility makes life more interesting for traders -- Nasdaq brokers now discuss the "disaster du jour" -- but does not necessarily encourage investors. Perhaps things will settle down soon, but it is at least as likely that the President's proposals will just set off a long round of congressional haggling, keeping outcomes uncertain and markets unsettled.

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
PC Buyers Will Soon Face Choices Among Work Stations

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
PERSONAL computers and work stations, two of the fastest-growing areas of the computer industry, have been on a collision course for several years. This may be the year of impact.
Sometime later in 1993, the two companies that have set the pace in recent years for PC hardware and software will climb to higher realms of performance. The Intel Corporation is expected to introduce its Pentium microprocessor (nee the 586, successor to the 286, 386 and 486). The Microsoft Corporation will introduce Windows NT, its first operating system designed specifically to take advantage of the power of the Pentium and other powerful microprocessors. 
 At the same time, the companies that dominate the market for powerful work stations are driving down prices, moving ever closer to the realm of personal computers that use the Intel chips. It is now possible to buy a low-end work station for less than $5,000 -- a machine that would have cost at least $15,000 not so long ago.
But the huge corporate market is not likely to switch en masse to work stations, because software, not hardware, is the biggest investment a company makes. Most businesses have already made substantial investments in PC software, and far more software is available for PC's than for work stations, especially for routine work like word processing and spreadsheet calculations. But as even routine business applications demand more processing power, work stations are increasingly attractive.
Sun Microsystems Inc. is the leader in the work station market, followed by Hewlett-Packard, International Business Machines, Digital Equipment and Silicon Graphics. Each is vowing to provide mainstream business customers with work stations that cost less than $5,000.
Most of those work station makers, with Digital in the lead, are also exploring the possibility of creating even lower-cost systems to run Microsoft Windows NT and other operating systems as well as Unix, a powerful if somewhat cumbersome program that is well-suited to tasks like computer-aided design and engineering, data-base management, electronic publishing, software development, video teleconferencing and scientific modeling.
"Digital has kind of beat them to the punch, but H-P and Sun are kicking NT's tires," said Bill Bluestein, a senior analyst for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
Planning a counterattack, several PC makers are in the process of creating entirely new systems using reduced instruction set computing, or RISC. Later this year, the first efforts of the much-ballyhooed alliance of I.B.M., Apple and Motorola will yield its first computer products, generically known as the Power PC family. The Power PC chip is expected to yield performance equal to or slightly better than Intel's Pentium.
As the line of demarcation between personal computers and work stations blurs, businesses will find they have new choices for managing information. And choice, many executives have learned, is a decidedly mixed blessing: confusion may be heaped upon confusion.
Most work stations already employ RISC processors, which use a simple, highly optimized set of commands to achieve high performance at relatively low cost. Work stations also traditionally use variations of the Unix.
But Windows NT may prove to be Microsoft's wild card. The program is expected to have features that rival those in Unix, and Microsoft is a formidable competitor, with nearly 100 million PC's flying its flag.
A delicious twist to the operating system maneuvering occurred recently when the Novell Corporation, the leading maker of operating systems for networked personal computers, acquired Unix Systems Laboratories Inc., the standard-bearer for unifying the Unix world.
The idea of a Unix in every box, from the desktop to the supercomputer, is not new. "It's a war cry that has been heard so long that Rip Van Winkle was probably the first to shout it," said John R. Logan, vice president of the Aberdeen Group Inc., a market research and consulting firm in Boston.
But Novell does have the ears of many corporate PC managers. And the war cry "allows Novell to go head-to-head with Microsoft NT, with the argument that NT is merely a desktop or low-end system," Mr. Logan said. Unix, on the other hand, works on big systems as well as small, he said.
The latest maneuvering in the work station business came last week from I.B.M., whose advanced work station and systems division rolled out a series of new RS/6000 machines, ranging from one with supercomputer power at a cost of $300,000 to a low-end color model that sells for $3,995. (The price for the low-end model, however, does not include a disk drive, which can add a few hundreds to a few thousand dollars.)
"It's an exciting price point, even though they know full well that nobody will buy it that way," said Terry D. Bennett, director of technical systems research in the Beaverton, Ore., office of Infocorp, a market research firm.
"I.B.M. is becoming more aggressive in many ways, and one of the ways is that they're willing to do some of the marketing and positioning games that others did." Even when the disk drive is added, he said, the I.B.M. machines are attractive.
I.B.M.'s history in the work station business is a tale of contrasts. The company invented RISC technology in 1975 but failed to exploit it commercially until three years ago.
In February 1990, I.B.M. brought out the RS/6000 product line as a replacement for its ill-conceived and short-lived I.B.M. PC-RT (for RISC Technology, or Really a Turkey, depending on whom you ask).
In less than a year, the RS/6000 generated $1 billion in sales, and it remains one of the fastest-growing segments of I.B.M.'s business "although things have slowed down a bit," said Nancy E. Battey, director of work station research at the International Data Corporation in Mountain View, Calif. She added, "The arrival of the Power PC in the second half of the year will help I.B.M. get down into the lower cost range."
When I.B.M. reported its disastrous financial results for 1992 last month, the soon-to-be replaced chief executive, John F. Akers, tried to soften the blow by pointing to technologies that he said were the key to the company's recovery strategy. Among those he specifically cited were client-server computing, networking, RISC technology and multimedia, all of which have some relationship to the work station business.
The advanced work station and systems division is one of I.B.M.'s bright spots, and it is expected to become increasingly important as the computer industry in general, and I.B.M. in particular, shifts its focus away from mainframes and supercomputers and toward smaller but increasingly powerful systems.

And Now, the News: G.M., G.M., Then a Word on G.M.

 BODY:

Even with the battering it's taken in recent years, General Motors remains larger than life. And last week, true to form, it dominated the news -- a public-relations bull's-eye one day, a mind-boggling loss the next. First, refusing to just lick its wounds after a jury held it responsible for a teen-ager's death in a G.M. pickup, the company roared onto the offensive, suing NBC for tampering with a truck in a news report. It scored a direct hit, as NBC -- to settle the suit -- issued a stunningly long (three-and-a-half-minute) on-air apology. Then, with no qualms about kicking the downed network, the auto maker suspended advertising on all NBC News programs. (After just a day, however, saying it was satisfied with the apology, it rescinded that ban.) And to thicken the plot, a judge dealt G.M. a setback in its grand plan to close numerous plants -- and gave at least a temporary reprieve to 2,500 auto workers whose jobs are threatened. Saying that by accepting tax abatements G.M. had effectively promised to keep its Willow Run plant, in Ypsilanti, Mich., open through the 1990's, the judge blocked it from closing the plant. G.M. had planned to close it this summer and consolidate operations in Arlington, Tex. Calling the ruling "unprecedented and contrary to both the facts and the law," G.M. said it would appeal. The company had tried to forfeit the tax breaks, but Doug Winters, the Ypsilanti city attorney, said, "We want the jobs, not the money. G.M. is not above the law."
 
Sprinting for the Red
 
Has Carl Lewis gone into accounting? He must have, the way records are getting broken. But corporate America surely hopes these records will last. First, Ford reported a $7.4 billion loss for 1992, mainly because of its retiree accounting, erasing I.B.M.'s recent record for the nation's largest loss. But its title lasted just a day, as General Motors came in with a stunning $23.5 billion figure. Without the special charges, though, there were signs of improving operations. G.M. stock did well, ending the week at $40.625, while Ford shares slipped to $49.25.
 
A Poorer Sears, a New Sears
 
Another fixture of the corporate landscape dumped some hefty numbers onto its balance sheet last week. In reporting a $3.9 billion deficit, Sears, Roebuck cited hurricane-related losses at its Allstate Insurance unit and the costs of scrapping its catalogue. Not to mention its charge for retiree benefits -- $1.87 billion. Later in the week, after pausing to let the news sink in, the retailer looked squarely at the future, vowing to spend $4 billion to give its stores face lifts.
 
More Shrinkage at I.B.M.
 
It may have to rename itself I.B. if it gets any smaller. I.B.M. only recently said it would cut its work force by 25,000, but word spread last week that it could be more like 40,000. The numbers tell the tale of the incredible shrinking company. Workers: 407,000 in 1986, 300,000 at the end of '92 . . . and 260,000 at the end of '93? Stock price: over $100 last summer, $50.75 on Friday.

Short Chapter at Random House
 
Joni Evans has had a bumpy ride at Random House. In 1987 she was recruited to start her own imprint. Then she was named to head the adult trade division. That lasted just a few years, and she then created Turtle Bay Books. But now Turtle Bay is no more. Ms. Evans said she always thought "it would be three to four years before we broke even, and I thought he did, too." But "he" -- Alberto Vitale, Random House chairman -- said, "Conditions have changed."
 
Survival of the Techiest
 
It makes the head spin. You're slogging through the evening's cable offerings -- the 12 talk shows, the 15 football games -- when some long-distance company calls to explain its convoluted advantages. Now it's all getting mixed up together; the cable and phone businesses are cross-breeding, embarking on an odd Darwinian struggle. Last week, in the first deal of its kind, Southwestern Bell agreed to buy two cable systems from Hauser Communications -- the onset of a race to deliver all manner of communications services, like more cable offerings than you'll ever keep track of. Soon, perhaps, you'll reach for the phone to turn on a movie, or turn on the set to call Aunt Nellie -- or finally, in low-tech despair, sit down and read a book.

Hello, Phone -- Get Me Rewrite
 
Meanwhile, phone technology moves relentlessly on. In Nynex's latest bid to improve the human lot, you can say "Mom" and the phone calls your mom. And only yours, mind you. Other voices get other moms. In the system Nynex will soon begin testing, each household member compiles a separate voice directory of dozens of names. Is the system perfect? Well, no. Nynex officials concede that if Dana Carvey barked out "Barbara," the former First Lady's phone could easily ring.
 
HB>THE ECONOMY

 
Clinton Works the Crowd
 
President Clinton laid it out succinctly. "With all these economic improvements, we aren't generating new jobs," he said at his "town meeting." And the deficit, he said, "is about $50 billion a year bigger than I was told." Questioners veered to other topics, but Mr. Clinton kept steering back to the economy. On Wednesday he will propose higher taxes and painful budget cuts, and he wanted to soften up his audience -- to assure them his plan would be "fair to all Americans." He did offer one specific: he will seek to raise the corporate tax rate -- a message he then gave to 200 executives and lobbyists at the White House.
 
Read Their Lips: 'Don't Touch'
 
In casting about for a billion here, a billion there, to hack from the deficit, Mr. Clinton will have to look hard at many sacred items. But some things are more sacred than others -- like Social Security cost-of-living increases. His budget director, Leon Panetta, had proposed a one-year freeze, but Mr. Clinton -- possibly with visions of irate retirees at the White House barricades -- put his machete away. A freeze, falling hardest on the poor, is a far cry from soaking the rich. But he has not ruled out increasing taxes on benefits, since that would not affect low-income people.
 
Inflation Stays in Check
 
 Inflation is well under control even as economic growth gains momentum. Prices at the wholesale level rose a modest 0.2 percent in January. Over the past year the Producer Price Index has risen just 1.8 percent -- a minor gain for an expanding economy.
 
Detroit vs. Japan: No Contest
 
Detroit was armed for battle. Thinking the time was right and the new Administration sympathetic, it had spent serious money preparing to file complaints seeking steep duties on imported cars. But once its plans leaked out, the rock-throwing started. Cries of protectionism filled the air, foreign auto makers and governments trained their heavy lobbying guns on Detroit, and even Mickey Kantor, the top American trade official, voiced qualms. The final blow came when General Motors, bombarded by Japanese pressure, defected. The auto makers, while insisting they had a strong case, saw that without a united front they had no chance and backed off. The move was a reprieve for the Administration, which would have been forced to resolve this sticky issue quickly.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Speed. Freedom. . . . Tolls?
 
Autobahn. The very word spits out images of untamed horsepower, foot to the Porsche floor, the ultimate open road -- in short, freedom. With no tolls, and long stretches with no speed limits, the network of superhighways has deep resonance for Germany, and the world. But again, yesterday's sacred cow becomes today's hamburger. The realities: severe congestion and a German economy whose horsepower is dwindling. So Bonn plans the unthinkable: charging user fees on the Autobahn and eventually privatizing it. Well, there are still video games.
 
Bonjour, Vietnam
 
On the first visit by a Western leader since 1975, Francois Mitterrand promised to double aid to Vietnam -- if human rights improve -- and urged Washington to end its economic embargo. Local radio said the visit showed that the West saw Vietnam's "will to join the mainstream economy."
 
Tax the Other Guy, Not Saudi Oil
 
Saudi Arabia is worried. There's a lot of talk about taxes to cut oil use. And now that Saudi Arabia has replaced Russia as the largest oil producer, the Saudis have the most to lose. This threat also comes just as Saudi Arabia is trying to pare OPEC output to push prices higher. So the Saudi oil minister, Hisham M. Nazer, in Houston last week, pulled out all the stops. Citing "constant discrimination against oil," he called environmentalists' policies "alarming." Oil import fees "defy the logic of geology and economics." And, citing the crying need for global economic growth, he said, "Abject poverty is indeed the worst environmental pollutant."

HEADLINE: VOWS;
Martha Evans and Geoffrey Morris

BYLINE: By Lois Smith Brady

 BODY:
THESE days, when Geoffrey Morris tells people what he does, they often respond by starting a Crossfire-style political debate with him.
Mr. Morris, 27, is the executive editor of National Review, a conservative journal that publishes everything from articles about America's moral decline to ads for Slick Willie T-shirts. Recently, he's been invited to quite a few of what he calls "cocktail parties for the embattled." 
 His courtship of Martha Evans, 25, the assistant to the marketing director of Library of America in New York, a nonprofit publisher of American classics, was thoroughly conservative.
Until their wedding, she lived on the Upper East Side and he lived downtown. "We didn't want to live together without being married," said Mr. Morris, who described the conservative view of marriage this way: "You date for a while and then you find that it's right and then you get married and live together happily ever after, but not before. I think people ideally want marriage to be that way, but economic concerns and other things force them to live together. We tried to get close to the ideal."
Though Ms. Evans and Mr. Morris rarely vote alike -- she's a liberal and a supporter of President Clinton -- on the subject of relationships and marriage, they agree. "You don't have to be conservative to have these views of commitment and responsibility," she said.
While the couple did not share an apartment before the wedding (the bride said she was looking forward to fighting over private space with Mr. Morris) they took many sailing trips together, a true test of compatibility.
In June 1991, when they took a weeklong trip off the New England coast, Sheila Evans, the bride's mother, worried how the couple would fare together on a small boat. She recalled: "We all wondered, 'How is their relationship going to be after such a long, tough sail?' They still liked each other, probably better than before."
He proposed in July, sitting on the sea wall outside her family's house in Cohasset, Mass. "We sat down on the wall," she recalled, "and he started saying things like, 'We've been coming here a lot in the past few years.' Then he said, 'Well, would you take care of me if I was sick?' That's when I knew it was serious."
They went apartment hunting only a few weeks before the wedding. "When we were looking for apartments on the West Side," Mr. Morris said, "one of the brokers looked at me like: 'I've never seen one of you guys in person. You're a conservative and you live in New York?' "
Last Saturday, a layer of new snow covered the roofs and rocky coves of Cohasset. Snow continued to fall as Ms. Evans arrived at St. Anthony's Church, in a white sleeveless gown, long white gloves and a tulle veil as thin and transparent as frost.
The 180 guests, many of them rugged sailors like the bride and bridegroom, didn't seem to mind the storm. One said he was glad to be on dry land.
William F. Buckley Jr., the editor at large of National Review and a sailing partner of the bridegroom, missed the wedding, but responding to a request for comment he sent a fax a few days later from Rougemont, Switzerland. In it he said: "Sailing on the midnight watch to Nova Scotia a couple of years ago, Geoff Morris commented -- mind you, this was 18 full months before the defeat of George Bush -- that there weren't enough conservatives in America. I urged him to do something about that and lo! he discovered the fair Martha." He added, "To be sure, the first job is to bring her around."

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
Saturn Adds a Wagon to the Line

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
FOR a while there, I thought I had figured it out, figured the easy way to get through the winter. Two years ago, I had shelled out 400 bucks for a snowblower, and Long Island hadn't had more than a dusting of snow since that day.
Alas, the magic seemed to be gone, I thought, flailing my way through what was indeed a surprise snowstorm over the Northeast, which unfortunately included the Long Island Expressway. Weaving through pileup after pileup, I was feeling particularly sorry about the two expensively crumpled Mercedes-Benzes at the side of the road. 
 I had time to ruminate, because I was nicely secure in an inexpensive little Saturn with front-wheel drive, traction-control and antilock brakes. The car just threaded its way through the morass of fender-benders and showed again why it has been one of the major successes of recent years.
By now, of course, even casual observers are probably aware of at least part of the Saturn story: How General Motors created a new corporation in Spring Hill, Tenn., to build a world-class car. How a new dealer network of fancy showrooms was created. And how customer satisfaction has skyrocketed as a result of a serious attempt to do everything right.
True, it might be asked why an organization with the resources of G.M. felt that it was necessary to create a subsidiary to do everything right. But the question has been asked, and the answer, after a bit of harumphing, seems to be that the sheer size of the corporation, along with its not always excellent tradition, were getting in the way. By starting with a clean sheet of paper, Saturn was able to do exactly what was needed.
The penciling on that clean sheet started in the early 80's with a planned introduction of Saturn's little import-fighter in 1988. As it turned out, the first car didn't roll off of a showroom floor until the 1991 model year, the delay resulting from concerns for quality that frequently staunched the creative juices and even held down production.
Eventually, though, Saturn came to be. And, according to The Power Report, a generally respected publication put out by the consultancy of J.D. Power and Associates of California, Saturn's distribution methods and customer satisfaction triumphs are being analyzed by nearly every manufacturer in the world.
"Dealers of competing makes are looking for ways to 'Saturnize' their operations in hope of improving dealer profits and customer satisfaction," the publication says.
Within General Motors, the troubled Oldsmobile division has been the first to pay serious attention to the way Saturn is doing business, and John Rock, the division's general manager, has said that he is going to turn Olds into the place to which Saturn buyers will graduate.
Those buyers right now have seven possible choices, including the sedans and coupes and -- new for 1993 -- a pair of station wagons.
Like the rest of the line, the wagons have plastic body panels that are hung on a steel "space-frame," a la the late and occasionally lamented Pontiac Fiero. The polymer panels, which resist dings and dents, are said by Saturn spokesmen to be one reason that buyers are so satisfied.
While the sedan and coupe use plastic side panels, the wagon models also incorporate the lightweight material into the roof and the top-hinged tailgate. In the new wagon, the hood is the sole exterior panel that is stamped from steel.
Under that hood, the two standard Saturn powerplants are mounted sideways and drive the front wheels. The wagons are designated simply SW1 and SW2, with the first being logically more basic than the second.
As such, my maroon SW1 carried the low-level 85-horsepower four. The SW2, which uses the same basic 1.9-liter engine, adds considerable oomph, having four valves per cylinder and producing 124 horsepower. And, given the test vehicle's somewhat emphysemic performance, the more powerful version is probably the way to go.
Fuel economy is good with either engine, ranging from 24 miles per gallon, city, to 37, highway, depending on the configuration. Both engines also can be ordered with a five-speed manual transmission or a computer-controlled four-speed automatic, and the maroon wagon had the automatic. It also had Saturn's optional ABS and traction-control system ($645), which is new this year.
New, too, is a revision in the automatic transmission's shift pattern in the computer, reducing back-and-forth shifts between gears when the vehicle is going up a hill.
The "powertrain control module" monitors vehicle speed in relation to accelerator pedal input. And, when speed drops and more throttle is applied, the computer extends the time in gear or keeps the transmission from shifting. That means that the automatic feels much like the manual.
The full-time traction-control, meanwhile, uses the same computer, along with the antilock brake system and engine controls to prevent the drive wheels from slipping. If the system senses that the front wheels are turning faster than those at the rear, it adjusts the amount of power needed for traction.
Inside, the is also something new in the form of a driver's air bag, which is all to the good. The air bag was a surprising omission in earlier models, particularly after the Saturn's long gestation.
What is not all to the good, however, is the fact that the car also has motorized seatbelts, those annoying and dangerous snakes that slither up and over you whenever the ignition is on and a front door is opened or closed.
That said, the test car was nicely done, with a gray interior in cloth and plastic, and comfortable reclining buckets up front. In back, the wagons have a split bench, and while room is not immense, it is reasonable for a small car. With the seatbacks in the up position, cargo space measures 28.8 cubic feet. Folding them flat increases that to 56.3 cubic feet.
Storage includes a small bin between the buckets, and there is a medium-sized glovebox. The console between the seats holds a reasonably good ashtray and buttons for the power windows, the power sideview mirrors and the power window in the tailgate.
On the road, the ride is good, and the car handles well. But the nicest part might be the price.
The SW1 has a base of $10,895, while the SW2 with its bigger engine begins at $12,195. As tested and fully optioned, the maroon wagon had a sticker of $14,275, not bad for a comfortable -- and comforting -- little vehicle. For taming winter, in fact, it's the next best thing to a snowblower.

From Seed, the Journey to the Perfect Plant

BYLINE: By JOAN LEE FAUST

 BODY:
THOSE who grow their own plants from seed find there is something rather special in the doing. Of course, many gardeners would rather wait until late spring and buy the few vegetable or annual seedlings they need. But just as many delight in growing their own plants from seed.
The greatest advantage in growing your own is the selection possibilities. Many times some of the more unusual flowers or vegetables are not available from garden centers. Also, seed sharing is one of the strongest binds in gardening friendships. 
 There is also the economic side. One packet of seed will yield many, many plants whereas buying several six-packs or pots of seedlings can ruin a modest garden budget. Don't forget, come spring there will be many other expenses: tools to buy, mowers to sharpen, fences to fix, fertilizers to add.
Those who do grow their own seedlings enter into a garden adventure that is difficult to equal, particularly when a special plant is known to be difficult. Many a gardener has boasted to a summer visitor that a particular plant was raised "from a pup."
A novice will often make a mistake of timing, that is planting the seed either too late or too soon. Only through trial and error can this lesson be learned.
The object should be to have the seedlings strong and actively growing so that they can settle in quickly when planted outdoors. Their root systems must be sturdy, for strong active roots will be the basis of the plant's quick establishment.
When seed is planted too soon, the result usually is a lanky bunch of seedlings that flop all over the place. The stems are weak and there are few leaves. Some seedlings even perish before they are ready to go outdoors. Tomato seedlings are a prime example of a rush to have the first ones on the block.
By contrast, seed that is slow to germinate needs a head start if the young plants are to be large enough to handle and settle in when planted outdoors. Snapdragons and petunias are examples.
Some seed does not even need to be started indoors but can be planted directly in the garden as soon as the soil is ready. Others need a cold period or stratification. Some will germinate immediately upon sowing, some seed must be covered to germinate. Still other seed is not covered because it must have light to germinate.
The best way to find the proper method for a particular plant is through study of the seed catalogues, the seed packets or garden books. Once the seed is sown, keep the seed pans moist and warm until germination. Then comes the important step of transplanting. When the seedlings have germinated, they will start to grow rather quickly. Their root systems will begin to fan out in the soil and will need room to stretch.
The soil mixture in which the seedlings will be transplanted is vital, for it will be the mixture that will nurture the developing root system and give the seedlings stem support for growing.
There has been much use of peat moss for potting mixtures, but geologists and soil scientists have begun to question whether this is sound judgment since using up the peat moss destroys a natural process of nature that has taken thousands of years to develop.
Far more practical for home gardeners is the use of a commodity from their own yards, a natural peat replacement: compost. When screened and mixed into the potting mixture, it has similar qualities of peat. Compost retains moisture, contains nutrients and provides a loose quality for root vitality.
Coarse sand can also be mixed with the compost, or a lightweight vermiculite can be substituted. This is a spongy product, derived from mica, that absorbs water.
Perlite, another lightweight porous ingredient, is also mixed in with soils. It is the white globular substance often seen in potting mixtures and seed flats because it tends to rise to the surface. Many ingredients for a mix-your-own potting mixture can be found at garden centers along with the bags already mixed.
The old rule about transplanting seedlings when their second set of true leaves appears is still valid. The seedling leaves usually do not look anything like those of the adult plant. As soon as the plant has grown enough to put out a second set, it is ready to be on its own. For this pricking or transplanting process one important reminder: Never handle the seedling by its stem as it may succumb to the heat of the fingers.
On the other hand, a seedling will always have two leaves, and if one leaf is damaged in the process, there will be a second leaf to grow.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Japan Fears the U.S. Is Its Postwar Pal No More

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
ODDLY enough, one reason Japan worries about Bill Clinton is that unlike John F. Kennedy he never captained a boat that was sliced in half by a Japanese warship, and unlike George Bush he was never shot down over the Pacific. In the iconography of American Presidents as seen from Tokyo, the World War II veterans who went on to occupy the Oval Office never bore a grudge. Instead, they were magnanimous victors who, after vanquishing the old Japan, took an almost fatherly pride in its reconstruction. They remembered the occupation, and regarded the Japanese as a bright, industrious ward who grew into America's strongest ally in the Pacific. Most important, they were usually indulgent of the country's mercantilist tendencies, viewing them as a problem that should not be allowed to threaten the relationship.
The new President, as Japanese have reminded themselves time and again, grew up with a very different Japan. He was a boy in Arkansas when Akio Morita began putting Sony radios into American homes. By the time Mr. Clinton reached law school, Nissans and Toyotas were beginning to jam the streets. As a governor, he frequently took the red-eye to Tokyo in search of Japanese investments and factories for his state. His Japan is first and foremost an economic competitor, hardly in need of America's help. 
 "In the eyes of many Japanese, it seems like a very big generational leap," said Yukio Satoh, who heads North American affairs for Japan's Foreign Ministry. Another senior Government official was more blunt, suggesting that for people of Mr. Clinton's generation, Japan was no longer a "special country."
That alone may explain why, even before Mr. Clinton has said much about trade and economic policy, the Japanese are rushing to redefine their relationship with the United States. They think they have to move fast.
The problem is that visions of what the relationship should look like -- especially in the sudden absence of a common enemy lurking out of Vladivostok -- are being churned out faster than Hondas, and in as many models.
Everyone wants America to remember that, as Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe said in an interview last week, "trade is not the only relationship we have." But on Thursday, no sooner had Mr. Watanabe settled into a chair in the Oval Office than Mr. Clinton started a pointed discussion about cutting Japan's newly ballooning trade surplus with the United States and said removing more trade barriers is to be the first order of business. "That is my job," Mr. Clinton said. Not exactly the warm words about unshakable alliances that Japan had in mind for the first meeting.
Like England, Japan has always spoken enthusiastically about its "special relationship" with the United States. But it is one that was forged first by the occupation and later by mutual economic dependence, rather than by shared culture or even much of a deeply felt meeting of minds. In fact, the United States first promoted Japan's industrial accomplishments largely to channel its energies into something other than militarism. And Japan's role as a vital military base meant security always took precedence over the economic costs.
 
Reversing Priorities
 That began to erode in the late 1980's, during disputes like the one over Congress' attempt to restrict the transfer of aviation technology to Japan. With a President in office who now talks about seven strategic technologies America must preserve, Tokyo is bracing for more of that. While Mr. Clinton seems unlikely to tinker much with the American troop presence here, especially now that Japanese contributions make it cheaper to station soldiers here than at home, there is little question the old priorities are being reversed.
That leaves Japan with some tough choices: Whether to veer harder toward Asia -- a trend that has to some extent begun already with new overtures to China, Vietnam and the rest of Southeast Asia -- and whether to try to mollify or modify its old mentor. In recent months, Japanese officials have been trying them all out, tentatively sketching three different faces of their country:
The Thin-Skinned Retaliator In public, few politicians or diplomats will admit to advocating a don't-push-me policy with the new Administration. But privately, some senior officials say Japan is frustrated that it has grown big but earned insufficient respect. This is the Japan that wants to remind Mr. Clinton of his campaign observation that three-quarters of America's competitive problems must be fixed at home. At their most extreme, such views seem nationalistic. But in the mainstream, they are reflected in recommendations, like one from Japan's biggest business group in December, that Japan prepare to retaliate if the United States unilaterally moves to restrict imports. This is also the Japan that warns America not to be intoxicated by its military power. In an essay this month, Hisashi Owada, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs (and father of Japan's soon-to-be princess) noted Japan's $13 billion contribution during the Gulf crisis and said "it is perfectly clear that the United States could not have fought the gulf war without assistance of this kind."
The Reluctant Superpower This is the Japan that finally lives up to its talk of being America's equal partner, even though its citizenry seems allergic to taking action that might single Japan out. Advocates of this approach say the first examples have come in places like Cambodia, where Japan has sponsored peace talks and has sent troops to rebuild roads but not disarm factions. The problem is that eventually this Japan has to decide whether to be a regular superpower, with a larger military, or continue what Mr. Owada termed "an extremely unnatural existence," that would have to be balanced by extraordinary contributions to the world in non-military fields.
The Reformer This is the Japan that no longer waits for American pressure before opening its markets, building better housing, taking more vacations and turning into what Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa calls a "lifestyle superpower." All this, of course, also increases imports. Few doubt the benefits of putting an end to the cycle of American demands, Japanese refusals and then grudging change that has embittered all sides. But the timing for reform is poor. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party, scandal-ridden and divided, seems more terrified than ever of taking the initiative. The business community, after drinking more than its share during a terrific party in the 1980's, will take the better part of the 90's just getting the poisons out of its system.
This is not to say that Japan will not change in response to the challenges of a new team in Washington; after all, an American named Akebono just became the first foreigner ever to be named a sumo grand champion. But it took 2,000 years.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S RANGE;
Doing More Than Bush, Less Than Advertised

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TRACKING President Clinton's latest pronouncements on Bosnia, the economy and domestic policy, it is possible to divine the parameters within which he seems to be operating early in his term. You can tune the Clinton Administration in on your political dial somewhere between the prudence of George Bush and the boldness of Mr. Clinton's own campaign book, "Putting People First." The sound you will hear is something more than Muzak but less than John Philip Sousa.
And don't go fiddling with the volume control; it's set that way for a reason. "Because Clinton was not elected by a majority he needs to be cautious, and because he needs to be re-elected by a majority he needs to be bold," said Kathleen H. Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. "And that is his dilemma." 
 The balancing act was apparent last week in both foreign and domestic policy. Consider the moment when Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher announced the Administration's new policy on Bosnia. "Serbian ethnic cleansing has been pursued through mass murders, systematic beatings, and the rapes of Muslims," he said. "Our conscience revolts at the idea of passively accepting such brutality." But after this lion-like roar, the policy he then articulated was more befitting a cub: an initiative aimed at demonstrating that Mr. Clinton was doing something more than Mr. Bush -- not just dumping the whole thing in Europe's lap -- but not so much as to entangle G.I.'s in an ethnic quagmire.
Washington would name a special envoy, Reginald Bartholomew, to take part in the negotiations between the warring factions and the international mediators Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen. But Mr. Bartholomew "will not necessarily be at the table," said Mr. Christopher. No American weapons would be offered to Bosnia's Muslims, but Washington would try to team up with Moscow to use leverage to gain Serb concessions. America would contribute to a peacekeeping operation, but only after a settlement.
This approach might be called high-octane Bush, or prudence plus. Sometimes such a calibrated approach is exactly what is called for in diplomacy, and only the next few months will make clear whether it fits the realities in Bosnia. It certainly fits the mood at home, though. Yes, the public says, it is shameful that at the twilight of the 20th century such barbarism still stalks Europe, but if that problem were addressed with all the boldness Mr. Clinton promised during the election campaign, the price could be prohibitive.
On the domestic front a similar balancing act is going on. The President is preparing to send Congress on Wednesday a package of short-term spending programs to stimulate growth, long-term programs to restructure the economy, and new taxes and spending cuts to reduce the deficit. On paper, it will be nothing if not bold. Whether that boldness survives into the final legislation, however, will depend on the interaction of three moods: the country's, the President's, and that of Congress.
Mr. Clinton's economic advisers remain convinced he won the election because most Americans believed that they were not living as well as their parents, and that people are ready to sacrifice for a turnaround, provided the plan is serious and fair. The problem, though, is that in the campaign Mr. Clinton addressed that anxiety with a plan that was serious and disingenuous -- based on a pretense that it could be carried off without pain to the vast middle class.
 
Promises to Keep
 At last week's town hall meeting in Detroit a woman asked Mr. Clinton if he would break his promise not to sock it to the middle class. His answer: "I have said that before I ask the middle class to pay, I am going to ask the wealthiest Americans and companies to pay their fair share and I am going to cut more Government spending. But I cannot tell you that I won't ask you to make any contribution to the changes we have to make." The real question is: What will that woman, and people like her, feel after reading Mr. Clinton's whole plan? Obviously, some people will be unhappy. So how will Mr. Clinton respond when the screaming starts?
Some officials worry aloud that Mr. Clinton is not mean enough -- that members of Congress already do not fear him, and that he does not evince that L.B.J. spirit: "Cross me and you die." But others say such an approach is unrealistic. Of the Democrats in Congress, fewer than 30 percent have worked with a Democratic President. They are not used to following the leader; they have been suckled on adversarial politics in Republican Administrations.
Therefore, Mr. Clinton's strategy will be to persuade them that he will go out and sell those cuts personally to help create a political shield for some very tough votes, and that he will make the Democratic Congress part of the process of shaping his legislative package. He has already given lawmakers a chance to shoot some things down in advance so they will feel part of the process.
How much boldness will survive such a political skeet shoot? "We can't accommodate everybody's concerns, but maybe we can do 80 percent," said one Clinton aide. "If our supporters in Congress at least feel they were part of that 80 percent it is a lot more likely they will vote with us. You just can't send messages down from the mountaintop anymore. Clinton himself went up to Capitol Hill twice last week, and his wife, too. It's a different era."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Housing And Fear Upend Integration

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA

 BODY:
LIKE a family secret that will not stay hidden, the reality of school segregation keeps forcing itself into the light, exposing the unresolved and politically explosive issues of race, class and poverty in American life.
Two current cases raise difficult questions in the long battle to integrate schools. In a civil trial under way in Hartford, Conn., the plaintiffs are arguing that linking city and suburban schools is the only way to produce true economic and racial integration. In Richmond, Va., a judge recently delayed an order to end the practice of "clustering" white students in a few classes at a mostly black school. 
 The cases touch upon desegregation's thorniest issues -- the huge gaps in spending between rich and poor school districts, the connection between segregated housing and segregated schools, the consequences of suburbanization and a backlash against integration by some blacks as well as whites.
These are questions, for the most part, that the Supreme Court has left to lower courts to decide. As a result, the hardest-fought, highest-stakes battles these days are mostly in state courts like Hartford's or Richmond's, over issues that are less blatant than the early fights against racial segregation enshrined in law.
The new cases, over segregation by housing and class, question a fundamental premise -- whether families have the right to leave behind urban problems, schools they consider unsafe, and in many cases, integration, by moving to the suburbs and, in effect, buying better public education.
"I am more convinced than ever that if we're talking about providing really equal educational opportunity, then we have to confront the issue of racial and economic isolation," said William L. Taylor, a veteran school desegregation lawyer.
Both in Hartford and Richmond, courts confronted urban schools that were segregated largely because better-off whites had moved to the suburbs where their property taxes were directly apportioned for schools. In these cases and others around the country, desegregation advocates have pushed to link city and suburban schools, forcing integration and closing huge gaps in spending.
In Richmond, the United States Supreme Court decided in 1973 not to merge the city's school districts with those of two surrounding counties, leaving the schools largely black. As an incentive to keep the remaining white families, two schools put all the white children in a few classrooms, as if to create a "comfort zone" for them, leaving other classrooms all-black. Mr. Taylor believes that the solution was illegal and morally wrong because it resegregates children within schools. When the school board ordered the children to be reassigned, some white parents went to court to block the action.
 
The South's Progress
 But Gary Orfield, a desegregation expert and professor at Harvard University, said that, paradoxically, the grouping of white children could be more likely to promote real integration than the school board's plan to scatter isolated students across overwhelmingly black classrooms. "What you're really looking for is not a school with a few visitors sprinkled around," he said. "You're looking for each group to make some contribution, to be taken seriously."
These dilemmas are nationwide. In a desegregation study published last year, Professor Orfield found that southern schools were far more integrated than those in the
North and West, where segregated schools were actually on the rise. Professor Orfield also found that even when minority parents moved to suburbs, their children's schools remained segregated because segregated housing patterns persisted.
The fuss in Richmond, and on a much larger scale over the past 20 years in cities from Boston to Oklahoma City, also illustrates the political complexities of hammering out a desegregation plan acceptable to parents of all races. Over the last dozen years courts have moved away from ordering busing, aiming instead for a mix of certain required desegregation goals and incentives like specialized magnet schools.
 
The St. Louis Plan
 One possible model for Hartford, where the trial began on Dec. 16, is St. Louis. A settlement there gave inner-city children the right to attend suburban schools, and, since the mid-1980's, about one-third of those eligible, some 14,000 children, have ventured into suburbia, according to Mr. Taylor, who argued the case. Because white parents did not have to bus their children into the inner city, the plan won acceptance. But it also raises certain troubling questions, according to Amy Stuart Wells of the University of California at Los Angeles, who is writing a book about the case.
Black parents had to choose to send their children into a largely alien world, and Professor Wells found that the ones most likely to choose were better-educated, more aggressive, more self-confident families, leaving children of some of the most troubled families behind in the worst schools.
"There are a lot of trade-offs," Professor Orfield said. "If you want to minimize political conflict, the more choice you give, the happier middle-class families are. If you want to make the most desegregation possible, you need a much more coercive mandate, but then there is more initial student flight."
In the Hartford case, lawyers who are suing the state want to assemble a team of experts to determine which plans have worked best. Despite years of negative publicity about busing, desegregation has worked well in dozens of small and middle-sized cities, J.S. Fuerst and Roy Petty argue in a study published last year in The American Prospect.
One answer, said Ronald L. Ellis of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, a lawyer in the Hartford case, is to make sure that all schools are good ones. "If you have uniformity of excellence," he said, "you won't have people leaving."
The open questions are whether such excellence is inseparable from integration -- and whether the ultimate goal is desegregation. Because blacks in many cities have borne most of the burden of busing, and because when all-black schools were closed, many black principals and teachers were reassigned and lost their status, some black parents now argue that they would rather have all-black schools that they can oversee than have a chance to participate in integration. Several recent Supreme Court cases have raised the question, too, of just how extensive desegregation remedies should be.
In Oklahoma City and DeKalb County, Ga., the Supreme Court has left these questions to lower courts. Having resigned themselves to Supreme Court inaction, many desegregation advocates are looking to President Clinton. Professor Orfield hopes that the Federal Government will give desegregation efforts a huge boost simply by ending 12 years of siding largely with those who would halt further desegregation and by spreading the word when integration works.
But President Clinton also faces the risk that shining the light on these murky and passionate issues could provoke a backlash from the very group he courted during the election -- the middle-class suburbanites who have long voted Republican and whose interests are at stake in cases like Hartford's.

HEADLINE: CLINTON PROPOSES ALTERING MEDICARE TO SAVE $35 BILLION

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
President Clinton will seek at least $35 billion in savings from Medicare over the next four years by limiting payments to doctors and hospitals and by trying to increase premiums for elderly people with high incomes, Administration officials said today.
The proposed savings, three times what President George Bush sought unsuccessfully in 1992, are part of what Mr. Clinton describes as a bold program to reduce the deficit and its long-term burden on the American economy. He will announce the outlines of that program in a speech to Congress on Wednesday, but the details may still be modified. 
 Taken together, the proposed tax increases and budget cuts in various Federal programs will save $500 billion to $550 billion over five years, Administration officials said. The last such exercise in austerity, the 1990 budget deal, was expected to save $496 billion over five years.
 
No Expansion in Benefits
 The savings in the Medicare program, which finances health care for 35 million elderly and disabled people, would, at first, be used mainly to reduce the budget deficit rather than to expand health benefits for those without insurance, Administration officials said. Proposals for expanding coverage will be made as part of the President's national health-care plan, which he has promised to send Congress by May 1.
Administration officials say that Medicare and Medicaid, the health program for low-income people, must be part of any deficit-reduction plan because they account for nearly half of the projected increase in Federal spending over the next five years. The Government expects to spend $146 billion on Medicare this year and $80 billion on Medicaid, which are two of the biggest and fastest-growing programs in the budget.
 
Doubling Spending
 In the 1980's, Congress set standard Medicare rates for hospitals, and it established a national fee schedule for doctors, starting in 1992. But it did not stem the growth of Federal spending on health care. And without any change in current law or policy, the Congressional Budget Office estimates, spending for Medicare will double over the next several years, from $129 billion in 1992 to $259 billion in 1998. Under the Clinton proposals, outlays for the program would still increase, but at a slower rate than otherwise.
Another proposal being considered by the Administration would prevent doctors and hospitals from increasing charges to private patients to make up for income lost as a result of the new Medicare limits, officials said.
If Mr. Clinton seeks Medicare savings of the magnitude now envisioned by the White House, he will most likely face opposition from a small army of lobbyists for doctors, hospitals and the health-care industry. The President seems prepared for such a confrontation and may welcome it for political reasons. In separate appearances this week, he and his wife, Hillary, assailed the drug industry, complaining that companies had made excessive profits from the production of vaccine for children.
 
Asking for Sacrifices
 Mr. Clinton has been laying the groundwork for his economic program by declaring that Americans need to make sacrifices for the common good. He will ask farmers, veterans, college students, middle-income families and corporations to share the sacrifice by paying higher taxes or giving up some of the Government largess they receive.
Mr. Clinton will unveil his economic plan and some of his deficit-reduction proposals when he addresses a joint session of Congress on Wednesday. He will provide more details of his budget proposals in late March. The proposed tax increases are the biggest sought by a President in decades.
The likely Medicare proposals include spending limits on doctors and hospitals, an increase in premiums charged to higher-income elderly people and restrictions on doctors' ability to raise charges to private patients to compensate for a reduction or freeze in payments under Medicare.
In addition, Federal health officials said they wanted to prevent doctors and hospitals from raising their charges in expectation of cost controls to be imposed as part of Mr. Clinton's national health-care plan. It was not clear how the Government could control what doctors charge their private patients.
Representative Pete Stark, chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said he saw "no problem" with judiciously limiting Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals.
Doctors have average income of more than $160,000 a year, he said, and some underused hospitals should be closed. But Mr. Stark, a California Democrat, said the savings from such cutbacks should be used to expand Medicare benefits, not just to reduce the budget deficit.
 
Limiting Reform?
 When Mr. Clinton discussed his plans to control health costs as a Presidential candidate in September, he said, "We will dedicate Federal savings from cost controls to expanding coverage to all." But there is no evidence that the initial savings from his proposals next week will be used for any purpose other than to reduce the deficit, which he says is bigger than he realized.
Martin A. Corry, director of Federal affairs at the American Association of Retired Persons, voiced concern about the change in emphasis. "The Administration will narrow its options for health-care reform if it uses all the Medicare savings for deficit reduction," he said.
Federal officials refused to say exactly how Medicare premiums might be raised for affluent elderly people, or what income levels would be affected. Lawmakers will undoubtedly be cautious in view of their experience with a law to provide insurance against catastrophic illnesses in 1988. After Congress imposed extra premiums and a surtax to pay for that program, elderly people rebelled, forcing Congress to repeal it a year later.
Mr. Clinton has conceded that he probably cannot fulfill his campaign promise to cut the deficit in half within four years. But he says he wants to shave $145 billion from the expected 1997 deficit. With no change in current law or policy, the Congressional Budget Office estimates, the 1997 deficit will be $319 billion.
 
Congressional Efforts
 In January 1992, Mr. Bush asked for Medicare changes intended to save $10 billion over four years, but Congress rejected most of them. Aides to Mr. Clinton say he has a better chance of winning Congressional approval because his party has a majority in Congress and he is offering a balanced package of spending changes and tax increases.
In its own efforts to slow the growth of Medicare, Congress ordered that hospitals be paid a flat amount, set in advance, for each patient, starting in late 1983, and it established a national fee schedule for doctors, starting in 1992.
Nevertheless, with rising medical prices, a growing elderly population and the proliferation of potentially useful medical technology, Medicare continues to grow.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that spending for Medicare will double, from $129 billion in 1992 to $259 billion in 1998. It estimates that Federal spending for Medicaid will soar to $146 billion in 1998, from $68 billion last year. Together the two health programs account for 46 percent of the projected increase in Federal spending from 1992 to 1998.
In the last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, the deficit was $290.2 billion, a record. Some Democrats say they believe that a failure to reduce the deficit this year will substantially increase pressure for a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget.
 
Using Different Statistics
 In their battles with Republican Administrations over the deficits, Congressional Democrats repeatedly accused President Ronald Reagan and Mr. Bush of basing their budgets on unrealistic economic assumptions, which overstated economic growth. This, in turn, often led the Republicans to overestimate Federal revenues and to underestimate Federal spending and deficits. Like their predecessors, Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush obtained their economic forecasts from three agencies: the Council of Economic Advisers, the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget.
In contrast, President Clinton and his budget director, Leon E. Panetta, intend to use the economic assumptions of the Congressional Budget Office, which forecasts economic growth at an annual rate of 2.8 percent this year and 3 percent in 1994. The outlook of the Congressional Budget Office is slightly more pessimistic than the forecast of many leading private economists.
By adopting the economic forecast of the Congressional Budget Office, Mr. Clinton wants to show that he is serious about reducing the deficit and has no desire to use gimmicks to minimize the problem, White House officials said.
Cabinet officers customarily ask for bigger budgets than the White House allows. Budget officials said that Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, had unsuccessfully tried to persuade Mr. Clinton to forgo a few of the cutbacks being proposed in Medicare.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Hope: Hostility;
Oddly Enough, if Everybody Finds a Fault In the Deficit Plan, the Better Its Chances

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
When President Clinton drops his economic plan on Congress and the American public next week, the first sounds you hear will be the potshots.
The hostile fire will come from every which way -- industries that would have their taxes increased, people who would lose Government benefits, communities where military bases would be jeopardized, conservatives who want lower taxes and less Government spending, and liberals who want higher taxes so spending can be increased. Cutting the budget deficit is so difficult that almost everyone will have a beef. 
 But the overwhelmingly negative instant reaction should not be taken as evidence that the plan will fail. Just the opposite, in fact. It is another example of the ways of Washington, and it may be a healthy sign for the program.
 
Formula for Success
 In an odd way, the greater the pain and the more widely it is spread, the better Mr. Clinton's chances of success. Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has told the White House that it is politically crucial to create such a large universe of sacrifice that it is difficult for people to say they should be outside it.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, has repeatedly cautioned his troops to reserve judgment, to avoid being swayed by the early opposition, to study Mr. Clinton's entire package carefully before taking a stand.
"People who are offended by some particular thing are likely to communicate," Mr. Gephardt said in an interview. "The people who generally think it's a good idea will be quiet at first."
 
All Ideas Under Attack
 Ted Van Dyk, a Democratic strategist, said he would be more concerned if the opposition was muted. "The far greater peril," he said, "would be to have a program at which potshots weren't taken. That would mean it wasn't bold enough. It wouldn't work. Congress and the public would lose their respect for the President, and his Presidency could unravel."
The early indications are that Mr. Van Dyk has little to worry about. Almost every idea that has been floated in the last couple of weeks, even those that stood no chance of making the final cut, has been sharply attacked. That is one reason the White House is keeping its final decisions so private as it puts the finishing touches on the plan.
Long after top Administration officials had said that Mr. Clinton would not propose a gasoline tax, the American Trucking Associations and several other organizations held a joint news conference this week to denounce such a tax.
After a long opening statement in which he maintained that a gasoline tax would bring the world as we know it to an end, Thomas J. Donahue, the president of the trucking associations, opened the session to questions.
 
The first Question
 This was the first question: "Isn't this press conference a perfect example of why it is nearly impossible for any President to propose anything for reduction of the deficit? How would you cut the deficit?"
This was the guts of Mr. Donahue's answer: "We all stand ready to participate in the solution of the deficit. We all call first for some reasonable reductions in spending that has exploded across this country, and we would all have our own views on how to fairly and broadly increase taxes in a way that would not call on one group of users, highway users, to pay for everybody else's deficit.
"The Constitution encourages and guarantees in this country the right to petition the Government, and we are taking advantage of that opportunity on behalf of tens of millions of Americans, real Americans, that get up every day and go to work and are creating the jobs and earning the payroll checks in this country. And, quite frankly, the suggestion for the purposes of politics that people that would take issue with the Government's decisions on how to tax us are not real Americans makes me mad."
Russell B. Long, the former Senator from Louisiana, used to characterize that kind of lobbying with a ditty:
 
 Don't tax you.
 Don't tax me.
 Tax the fellow
 Behind the tree.
 On another matter, word had no sooner got out that Leon E. Panetta, the budget director, was advocating a freeze in cost-of-living increases in Social Security payments than Congressional offices were besieged with telephone calls from retirees. And several leading Democratic Senators threatened to hold their breath until they turned blue.
Mr. Clinton almost certainly never looked favorably on the idea of a freeze, and a few days after the news broke the White House said so publicly.
Protests then arose over suggestions that the space station and the superconducting supercollider might be cut back or even killed, that money for reserve and National Guard units might be trimmed and that corporate tax deductions might be abolished for "excessive" salaries paid to executives.
After Mr. Clinton told about 200 business executives and their Washington lobbyists at the White House on Thursday that he planned to propose an increase in the corporate tax rate, the adverse reaction was instantaneous. The Tax Reform Action Coalition, a lobbying group whose hundreds of members range from Procter & Gamble and International Business Machines to the Beauty and Barber Supply Institute and Elmer Buchta Trucking Inc., fired off a letter of opposition to the President.
Alan Kranowitz, a White House lobbyist in the Reagan Administration who now works for the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, said, "We will definitely shoot as hard as we can at the tax rate increases."
 
Changes in Pressures
 Junior lawmakers may be swayed by this kind of pressure, but more experienced ones have become inured to it, recognizing that it does not represent the full views of their constituents.
Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, one of the most influential liberal Democrats in Congress, said the nature of lobbying and constituent pressure had changed since he took office 24 years ago.
"You can see it in the mail," he said. "When I came here, most of my mail was from individuals back home who cared about their individual problems. Today, a huge amount of the mail comes from the fact that you have all kinds of associations, councils, organizations, etc., who will send information bulletins to their membership crying with alarm, ringing the bells from the rooftops, saying please descend on Washington and protect your interests or you'll never see Day 3."

HEADLINE: Vaccinations Are Often Free, But Many Children Miss Out

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS

 BODY:
Long after the hour of her scheduled appointment had passed, Michele Bryant sat with her 2-year-old son in the waiting room of the New York City Department of Health clinic in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. She had little choice but to wait it out in the dreary room on a snowy Saturday: As a single mother with a full-time job that offered no health benefits, she had neither the time nor the money to go to a private pediatrician to get her son vaccinated.
"I got up this morning at 6:30 to bring him here," Ms. Bryant said, as her son, Taurean, scurried along the rows of plastic seats, restless after two and a half hours in the clinic. "This is what you have to do. If you love your child, you want them to have the best care you can get."
 
Struggling With Bureaucracy
 Vaccines are free and readily available in public health clinics in New York and many other states. 
 But for every parent like Ms. Bryant, who tries to have her child vaccinated, thousands of others do not try at all or give up after struggling with the public-health bureaucracy. Some, facing a multitude of economic and family pressures, do not think it is worth the trouble. Some are not aware of the importance of vaccinations. And some, in this country illegally, are afraid to bring their children for shots.
To encourage immunization by making it more affordable, President Clinton announced on Friday a plan to spend $300 million next year to increase the number of American children who are vaccinated. White House officials said that as a result, a million more youngsters would be immunized starting this summer, most at public clinics.
The President strongly criticized drug manufacturers for failing to lower their prices on vaccines and for what he called spending on advertising and lobbying at the expense of developing new and better drugs.
Administration officials said they were still considering a plan for the Government to buy the entire supply of children's vaccines and distribute them free. Drug manufacturers dispute President Clinton's assertion that they are to blame for the rising costs of immunization, and argue that they offer substantial discounts on vaccines sold to government programs. The real problem, they say, lies in educating the public about how and where vaccines are available.
Many doctors and health-care experts say free vaccine will not solve the country's immunization problem. They say the lack of a centralized record-keeping system and a concerted educational campaign is partly to blame for the low immunization rate. Those functions are left up to a patchwork of clinics, doctors, hospital emergency rooms and charities. In some cases, record keeping is so abysmal that some children never get vaccinated and others receive the same vaccines over and over.
 
From Pioneer to Laggard
 The failure to vaccinate is so widespread in this country that many health officials speak of an "immunization crisis" in a nation that pioneered the use of vaccines to fight childhood diseases. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, less than half of all children in the country between 2 months and 2 years old are properly vaccinated. In the inner cities and rural areas, proportions are even smaller. In New York City, the Department of Health reports that only 38 percent of schoolchildren have completed the full series of recommended vaccines by the time they are 2, the benchmark age for immunization because the natural immunity a baby receives from his or her mother has dissipated.
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the United States ranks 17th in the world in the percentage of infants vaccinated against polio. Health experts say immunization rates are higher in industrialized countries with a nationalized system for primary health care, like Britain.
"This is one of the true national disgraces we're dealing with," said Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the Children's Health Fund, a nonprofit group that offers health care to children at New York City homeless shelters. "Immunization is a fundamental marker of access to health care for children. The lack of it puts kids at a fantastic level of vulnerability."
Dr. Bruce Siegel, the New Jersey health commissioner-designate, said: "Immunization is one of the areas where we are seeing a step backward 50 years. Children should not be dying of measles in this day and age."
In responding to President Clinton's criticism of drug manufacturers, David J. Williams, president of Connaught Laboratories Inc. of Swiftwater, Pa., blamed lawsuits for driving up vaccine prices.
"The only profiteers in vaccine pricing have been the lawyers who launched hundreds of product liability lawsuits," Mr. Williams said. "If we were to distribute vaccine free to everyone, whether rich or poor, it would drive up the cost of immunization to the Federal Government. It doesn't make any sense to increase spending on buying a product that is in abundant supply when the money could be better used in eliminating the barriers that obstruct access."
 
The Connecticut Experience
 Although Connecticut has a longstanding program to buy and distribute vaccine to doctors and clinics. Dr. James Hadler, the state epidemiologist, said that only 63 percent of Connecticut children receive the full complement of vaccines by age 2 -- only marginally more than in New York and New Jersey, which do not provide all the vaccines doctors need.
"Universal distribution is just a component of what needs to be done," Dr. Hadler said.
Besides Connecticut, 12 states -- Alabama, Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington and Wyoming -- buy vaccine and distribute it free to doctors and clinics. The doctors are allowed to charge a nominal fee, usually $5 to $10, to administer the drugs. Since 1920, Massachusetts has manufactured its own diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, or whooping cough, vaccine, but most other states buy their vaccines.
Thirty years ago, when the measles vaccine was licensed, health officials predicted that the childhood disease would be eradicated within a few years. But after years of decline, measles made a comeback from 1989 to 1991, with 4,000 cases and 23 deaths in New York State alone. State epidemiologists found that more than half the cases were among preschool children, most of whom had never received the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, known as M.M.R.
At the height of the outbreak, health officials gave the M.M.R. vaccine to 6-month-old children, even though it is normally administered to 1-year-olds. When outbreaks subsided, administration at age 1 was resumed. Although few comprehensive statistics on underimmunization are kept, medical experts are convinced it remains so widespread among preschool children that there will be future outbreaks. "Where parents are not having their children immunized, diseases we thought we had under control are going to be popping up all over the country," said Dr. John Lee Clowe, president of the American Medical Association.
Health organizations say that to be properly immunized, all 2-year-olds should have had four shots of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, or whooping cough; three of polio and one of M.M.R. In recent years, two new vaccines, for hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenza type B, have been added to the recommended program.
Because most public and private schools require that children are completely immunized before they enter kindergarten, doctors say that many parents do not realize how critical it is for them to receive all the shots by the time they are 2 years old.
Conversely, doctors and health officials report, a much smaller proportion of children receive too many vaccines. Parents are issued immunization cards to keep track of their children's vaccinations. But Dr. Redlener said that because there is no national registry, children whose cards have been lost or misplaced get the same shots over and over as they move from doctor's office to clinic to emergency room.
For parents like Ms. Bryant, the problem is one of access as much as economics. Commuting two hours each way to a receptionist's job in White Plains from her home in East Flatbush, she has little time during the week to respond to a medical crisis, let alone to visit a doctor for preventive care. She is torn between her need to earn a living and her desire to care for Taurean. "My younger sister takes care of him while I'm at work," said the 20-year-old Ms. Bryant. "But I want to be the one to take him to the doctor. He's going to hurt and cry."
Several months ago, she had an appointment for her son at a city health clinic in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and took a day off from work to keep it. But when she showed up late, she was told she had to reschedule. It was not until she learned of the child health-care clinic in Fort Greene, which recently expanded its hours on Thursday nights and Saturdays, that Taurean was immunized. He was already six months behind. Before his visit, he had never been inoculated against polio and diphtheria.
 
Feeling of Failure
 Health officials say that with costs rising and most insurers refusing to cover vaccinations, more and more middle-class families are going to public clinics for immunization -- or are not having vaccinations at all. Still, the problem is most acute for lower-income and minority parents.
Dana Fort, a 25-year-old single mother, lives with her five young children in a homeless shelter in the Bronx. Some of them are fully immunized, she said, while others are missing several shots. Her youngest child, she said, did not get any vaccinations until he was 9 months old. She said that her frustration over what she believed was her inability to get adequate treatment for herself and her children at local hospitals and clinics sometimes made her reluctant to take her children to doctors.
"It hurts me," she said. "I have cried lots of times because I feel like I've failed my children."
To reach people like Ms. Fort, hospitals and community organizations in inner cities have been trying new ways of coaxing people into clinics and mobile immunization units. Three months ago, Bellevue Hospital Center started a program in which two nurses screen children in the pediatrics emergency room to determine if any vaccinations are needed; of 450 children who have been screened, 72 were immunized. In Jersey City, the State Department of Health set up a satellite clinic in March 1991 next to a local welfare office to find children who did not have all their shots. Since then, 7,000 children have been vaccinated.
But the obstacles to immunization remain daunting. At the Richard Allen Center on Life, a nonprofit child- and foster-care organization in Harlem, immunization outreach workers Danilda Abreu and Pamela Jones say that they would like to go door to door to find the underimmunized, but that they are afraid to enter many of the buildings. Instead, they go to trade schools and churches and community groups, handing out fliers and singing the praises of diphtheria shots.
"A lot of people say to me, it's the wait," Ms. Jones said. "A lot of people don't want to wait. I say, it's better to take one day out for your child than not to have that child at all."

HEADLINE: North Korea Spurns Nuclear Agency Demand

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sunday, Feb. 14

 BODY:
North Korea, in a growing challenge to the International Atomic Energy Agency, said late on Saturday that it would reject a demand to inspect two sites believed linked to its suspected nuclear weapons project. If the effort is pressed, it warned, it will take a "countermeasure for self-defense."
In a defiantly worded dispatch issued by the Korean Central News Agency, the Communist regime of President Kim Il Sung accused the United States of "trying to attain its sinister purpose" by manipulating the Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations affiliate, to spy on "military objects" that are not part of what it insists is a civilian nuclear power project. 
 The installations that the agency demanded to see in a cablegram to the North Korean leadership on Thursday "are not liable to inspection by the I.A.E.A.," the press agency account said.
On Thursday, the Atomic Energy Agency's director general, Hans Blix, demanded that inspectors be given access to two buildings at Yongbyon under a procedure called a "special inspection." The agency has never before used a special inspection to compel the opening of a site that a country has not declared part of its nuclear programs.
Unless North Korea reverses itself, the rejection of the demand appears to set the stage for a confrontation that could soon be referred to the United Nations Security Council. If asked by the agency, the Council has the right to enforce a special inspection, though it is unclear that economic embargoes or other techniques to isolate the country would be effective against a country already as isolated as North Korea.
Last week, agency officials said that if their demand for a special inspection was rejected or simply ignored, Mr. Blix would most likely call an emergency meeting this week of the agency's board of governors in Vienna to determine the next step. Determining whether North Korea is on the verge of becoming a nuclear power is considered a critical test of the agency's competence, especially because of criticism that its inspectors failed to detect Iraq's nuclear weapons program in the years leading up to the Persian Gulf war.
North Korea has permitted six inspections of its installations at Yongbyon, 60 miles north of the capital, Pyongyang, since Mr. Blix visited North Korea last May. But it has consistently rejected requests to see two buildings that the agency, based on Western intelligence reports, believe have been used as a dump for nuclear wastes. Samples of those wastes, they believe, could indicate whether North Korea has extracted enough plutonium from its nuclear reactors to produce crude atomic weapons.
In its rejection of the special inspection today, the North Korean Government said: "The allegation that we have 'suspicious facilities' related to the nuclear problem is a sheer lie. We have no other nuclear facilities than those we have reported to the International Atomic Energy Agency," it said.
The report added, "If we accepted inspection of 'suspicious objects' as demanded by the United States, it would be the beginning of the exposure of all our military objects and bases and would become a precedent of permission for the opening of military bases of all nonnuclear states."
It also said that the agency had "no right to use 'information' offered by a third country" to call for a special inspection. Agency officials said last week, when North Korea made the same charge, that under the guidelines approved by member nations of the agency it had the right to use any intelligence that it viewed as reliable.
In fact, nuclear experts say, they are uncertain what, if anything, they will find if inspectors are ever permitted into the buildings. There have been enough delays since the first requests to open the sites in November for North Korea to move the waste elsewhere.
Because many of the buildings in the Yongbyon area are reportedly connected by a vast array of underground tunnels, such an effort might not be detected by satellites or by high-flying reconnaissance aircraft.

HEADLINE: Clinton Keeps Driving His Message of Public Sacrifice

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Determined to train public attention on the economic package he will announce next week, President Clinton today repeated his pitch that the plan would require sacrifice, especially from wealthy special interests.
But Mr. Clinton also sought to allay fears that his program would lead to drastic spending cuts in important programs. He tried, for example, to quash rumors that he intended practically to do away with plans for a costly space station. 
 "I think you all know I've always been a big supporter of NASA and the space program and the technologies it can represent," he told reporters at the opening of a meeting to discuss his budget plan with House Democrats. "I think that people who care about that will be pleased by the recommendations we make."
 
Radio Address
 The President devoted most of his attention today to the economic plan he will announce to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, and that was the theme of his second weekly radio address.
"Next we will take the battle to the special interests," Mr. Clinton said from the Oval Office. "We will demand that those who see the tax code as a table game to be won, rather than a social compact to be respected, pay their fair share of taxes. I will keep my pledge to restore fairness to the tax code. We'll raise taxes on the wealthiest individuals and companies in our society."
Not letting up with the attack on the drug industry that he opened on Friday, Mr. Clinton asserted: "And I will say to the drug companies, the insurance companies and the others who profit from the status quo, they must join our cause to make comprehensive reforms in our medical care system."
Mr. Clinton's remarks were part of a full-blown Administration effort to sell his economic plan. Leading Administration and Democratic officials are planning to appear on the Sunday television talk shows to drum up public support. The public relations effort will only intensify after the plan is announced, with Mr. Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and much of the Cabinet planning to barnstorm the country to promote it.
 
Possible Midwest Trip

"The President will have a full-court press to make sure the American people understand his economic plan and understand what it's going to do for the country," said George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, "the kind of change it's going to bring to our economy and to the people of this country."
While White House officials said the President may travel to the Midwest at the end of next week to promote his proposal, Mr. Stephanopoulos said it was unlikely that he would accept an offer from Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House Majority leader, to return to Congress the morning after his speech to answer members' questions about the plan.
Mr. Clinton was still working on the package when he met with his chief economic advisers this morning. "I've gotten a lot of good advice, a lot of good ideas," he said of his consultations with members of Congress. "I've basically just been asking for their ideas -- not only in the meetings here but in telephone calls. And I've gotten some good suggestions, some of which we've been able to incorporate."
Later, as opened his meeting in the Cabinet Room with the House members, Mr. Clinton said, "I think they want me to give them a good, credible program, one that will get the economy going."
 
Republican 'Olive Branch'
 In the Republican response to Mr. Clinton's radio address, Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, said he wanted to extend "a political olive branch" to the new President. "While some are already writing his political obituary because of the controversies that have swirled around the White House during the last three weeks," he said, "it is not my purpose to add to the criticism or try to embarrass the President."
But Mr. Cochran, the third-ranking Senate Republican, warned that his party would oppose efforts for "symbolic spending," or to raise taxes or add new taxes, which "would hit many Americans especially hard."
In his address, Mr. Clinton insisted that no one would be unduly hurt by his plan, which is expected to include spending cuts and higher taxes. "Under my economic program," he said, "we will build an America where even the most privileged pay their fair share, not because we want to soak the rich, but because we want to stop soaking the middle class and ask everybody to bear a fair share of the load."
Seeking to show that he, too, had made sacrifices, the President mentioned that earlier this week he ordered staff cuts at the White House and in Federal agencies. He also said he had called an investigation into the cash bonuses given to officials in the final days of the Bush Administration.
"We simply cannot have extravagant payments made to departing bureaucrats and political cronies," he said. "at a time when most people are tightening their belts."

HEADLINE: New Orleans Journal;
A Sulky Undercurrent at Mardi Gras

BYLINE: By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 13

 BODY:
It is Carnival time in the city that is passionate about Mardi Gras. Although the big day falls on Feb. 23, the nonstop celebrating began this weekend, with the streets once again awash in parades and neighborhoods adrift in parties.
But beneath the glittery surface are signs of strain. It is more than a year since a hotly debated city ordinance was adopted to desegregate white social clubs and parade clubs that sponsor the Carnival activities. 
 The furor that roiled the city last year is quieter but still rumbles. At a preliminary parade last weekend, for example, the cavorting marchers threw a mock jazz funeral because three of the oldest groups stopped parading last year because of the ordinance. "I'm mourning for the death of imagination and taste," one marcher said. "Come back, Comus," read a sign carried by another marcher urging the return of one of the missing parades.
There are still 55 parades in 11 days in the city and its suburbs, but Carnival purists say those put on by the Comus, Momus and Proteus groups had infused Carnival with much of its magic. They say they fear that commercial interests will step in to fill the void left by the dropouts.
The parade in the French Quarter last weekend, organized by the Krewe du Vieux, was political in tone, not commercial. The king, Henri Schindler, a float designer, stopped in front of the Boston Club, a symbol of this city's old aristocracy, to send a message to the City Council, which passed the ordinance. Looking ahead to the 1994 municipal elections, he said, "Your days are numbered."
"It's as though classical music has been stopped and replaced by Muzak," said New Orleans Magazine. The magazine said the ordinance has "opened the way for Carnival becoming a totally commercialized festival" rather than "an expression of native ethnic culture."
Critics of the ordinance argue that Mardi Gras is a diverse celebration that has evolved haphazardly and that government should keep its distance. Efforts to to overturn the measure continue, and last month Kevin Schoenberger, a lawyer, filed a suit intended to let the people decide its fate.
Mr. Schoenberger says the group behind the suit is called Don't Mess with Mardi Gras, which is raising money to finance the suit. More than 20,000 people petitioned the City Council last May to bring the issue to a vote; 10,000 signatures were validated as those of voters, the number needed to call for a referendum. But backed by the City Attorney, who said there was precedent for invalidating voter initiatives when the issue would violate the 14th Amendment, the Council blocked the ballot.
The 122-year-old Rex organization, which many consider the heart and soul of Carnival, announced in September that it had opened its doors to "a number of persons from many walks of life and varied backgrounds." In other words, the club had desegregated itself.
True to the club's penchant for secrecy, the announcement included no names. But news accounts here said three prominent black men had been asked to join the club, which traditionally chooses a civic leader as king of Mardi Gras.
A city committee was assigned last year to investigate complaints of discrimination by parade clubs, but no one has complained, said the committee's executive director, Earl D. Jackson Sr., who is black. He says most New Orleans blacks would prefer to join one of the city's many black clubs rather than an exclusive white one.
Even the fans of the three lost parades say the difference in Carnival this year will be invisible to tourists, who are vital to the city's economy. "As far as tourists go," said Dr. James McClain, an economist at the University of New Orleans, "I don't know if they'll even be sober enough to tell the difference."

HEADLINE: Rise of Christian Right Splits a City

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COLORADO SPRINGS

 BODY:
Stung by a real estate market that left shopping plazas and office buildings empty in the mid-80's, this city began to use its reputation for conservatism to tap a growing field of employment: evangelical Christian organizations.
In the view of economic developers, these were enterprises that could invigorate commerce without fouling the natural splendor here at the foot of Pikes Peak. And the religious groups believed they could fit comfortably in a community that prizes the conservative ethic. 
 But as Colorado Springs has become a center for the religious right, with more than 40 evangelical groups now based here, many residents are raising fears that the city is becoming a bastion of religious extremism and intolerance.
 
Effect of Anti-Gay Statute
 "The old conservatism of Colorado Springs was based on economics, rugged Western individualism, a leave-me-alone attitude," said Jean Matthews, 69, who has long been active in the Republican Party here. "But this is all moral issues. And if you don't agree with them, you're evil."
Concerns about the influence of evangelicals have turned into loud protests since the passage in November of a state measure that would ban laws that specifically protect the civil rights of homosexuals. The measure was initiated by a group in Colorado Springs, and this city of 280,000 delivered much of the muscle for its passage, as voters here approved the measure 2 to 1.
In addition to supporting the measure, the fundamentalist groups are telling members how to exert their influence in areas from public schools to Federal legislation.
"This community is moving in a direction that scares us," said Amy Devine, who with her husband, Doug Triggs, recently started Citizens Project, a group she described as a "countervoice" to the evangelicals.
 
Pressure on Teachers
 More than 1,000 people gathered on a recent Sunday evening to share their uneasiness about the growth of the evangelical groups.
"There are a lot of things that I just won't talk about in class anymore," said Barbara Toney, a high school history teacher who said parents who belong to some of the fundamentalist groups have pressed for changes in textbooks. "Teachers feel like we have to be a lot more cautious or a student will go home and tell their parents."
One school in Colorado Springs that was sponsoring a panel on cultural diversity withdrew an invitation to a lesbian after a campaign of telephone protests. A school in the nearby town of Woodland Park has been sued by parents for teaching Greek and Roman mythology; the parents asserted that if those ancient beliefs were taught, so should Christianity. And many schools in Colorado Springs have cut back on Halloween celebrations over protests about the pagan origins of the holiday.
Some leaders in Colorado Springs say the influence of evangelical groups here has been overstated. The combined employment of the organizations is about 2,500.
"There's no big religious conspiracy here," said Mayor Robert Isaacs, who supported the anti-gay-rights measure. "These are good citizens. It's not a hateful community. It's a little more conservative. But that's not a crime."
The largest of the evangelical groups is Focus on the Family, which produces a syndicated radio program featuring Dr. James Dobson, a psychologist who draws on the Bible.
The group, which employs 900 full-time workers, moved to Colorado Springs from Los Angeles in 1991 after receiving a $4 million grant from a local foundation, El Pomar.
Nearly 60 percent of the city's economy is related to military, and as a result, Colorado Springs has sought to diversify, especially with deep cuts expected in the military industry. The evangelical groups were seen as bringing more economic diversity to the city.
Rocky Scott, the president of the Economic Development Corporation, a group that promotes commerce in the city, said the evangelical groups put $36 million a year into the local economy. "These are people who are buying houses, cars, gasoline," he said. "But they are hardly overwhelming."
Eighteen of the groups employ fewer than 15 people.
Focus on the Family, which is housed in a gleaming downtown building with its name in neon, has bought 47 acres near the Air Force Academy to build a new headquarters.
The group organizes letter-writing campaigns to promote what it calls a "pro-family" agenda. Members have been urged to write Congress, for example, to oppose allowing homosexuals in the military. It also conducts seminars that instruct Christians on ways to exert influence.
 
A Welcome Feel
 "When they see something happening in the schools that troubles them, we show them how to contact those schools," said Paul Hetrick, a spokesman for Focus on the Family. "We're not trying to take over the community or Christianize the nation. But we don't believe that a family should feel wrong in expressing a viewpoint that comes from religious values."
Mr. Hetrick said the group had been made to feel welcome here, despite a few instances of vandalism at one of its buildings and the threat of a bomb in its parking lot.
During services at the New Life church, which has 3,300 members and is not affiliated with a denomination, Pastor Ted Haggard warns against the evils of homosexuality and adultery. His followers respond with exuberant clapping and shouts of "Amen!" and "That's right!"
"Nobody should fear us," Pastor Haggard said. "I don't know any guys in the evangelical movement who are hateful or homophobic."
But the evangelical groups have not won the support of many of the clergy here. "They can intimidate people," said Dr. James White, the pastor of the First Congregational Church here.
He said the denunciations of homosexuals had created a hostile climate for gay people. Dr. White said many women here feared that anti-abortion groups, emboldened by the surge in conservatism, would become more aggressive. Already, these groups have sometimes gathered outside the homes of doctors who perform abortions.
Howard Hirsch, the rabbi at Temple Shalom here, said his members viewed the growth of the religious right with trepidation. He said he was offended by the assertion of "Judeo-Christian" ethics by evangelical leaders.
"It seems to me they lop off the Judeo part," Rabbi Hirsch said.
Richard Skorman, the owner of a bookstore and restaurant, said a group of supporters of gay rights had gathered at his business on Election Day to watch the returns. A few days later, a brick was hurled through his window. Mr. Skorman, who is not gay, said he had also received threatening telephone calls.
 
Homosexuals Work Together
 For homosexuals in Colorado Springs, these would seem to be dark times. But in fact, the political climate has infused new life in their effort to guarantee their civil rights.
"Gays in Colorado Springs have always been very conservative and quiet," said Bruce Pfrommer, an advertising executive who belongs to a local homosexual advocacy group, Ground Zero. "But now we have come together. We know we've got to fight."
He said many homosexuals here have lately decided to come out of the closet, including himself, because the stakes were too high to remain quiet.
"A big part of the problem is that people don't think they know any homosexuals," Mr. Pfrommer said. "They do, of course. We need to sit down and tell them who we are. There are a lot of misconceptions. I don't think most people are hateful."

HEADLINE: Cities Attack Police Raises In New Jersey

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Over the last decade, as cities and towns across the region strained to deal with recession, state restrictions on spending and increasing mandated costs, the salaries of many New Jersey police officers have doubled.
In places like Newark, Elizabeth and Trenton, starting police officers earn more than they do in New York and other big cities. And throughout the state, mayors and other local officials complain that police salaries have grown faster than the rate of inflation and are consuming a ever-growing share of the budget. 
 Local elected officials say the reason lies in the state's compulsory-arbitration law, which they contend gives officers the upper hand in contract negotiations. So concerned are they that, for the first time since the law was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support 16 years ago, many of the state's 567 municipalities are joining to seek changes.
But union lawyers and labor negotiators view the complaints as camouflage for political or governmental failure. There is nothing so wrong with the law, they say, that could not be fixed by having municipalities send better-prepared bargaining teams to the table.
The issue is the subject of heated debate in a state perpetually consumed with concern over property taxes, which finance municipal services.
 
A Decade of Pay Gains
 Richard Loccke, a lawyer in Hackensack whose success on behalf of police unions around the state is respected and feared by local officials, said towns often use arbitrators as scapegoats.
"Some of the most screamed-about settlements really had nothing to do with the arbitrator," he said. In effect, he said, the arbitrator takes the fall for a contract that town officials essentially agree to and then walk away from, avoiding angry taxpayers. Once the settlement is announced they can blame the arbitrator.
But no matter who is right, many of New Jersey's cities and counties have some of the best-paid police officers in the country.
A decade ago, officers in New Jersey, particularly in urban areas, were paid somewhat less than their counterparts in Boston, New York, Philadelphia or Washington. By the end of the decade, after 12 years under the compulsory-arbitration law, they were earning an average of about $39,000, almost $5,000 more than officers in those four cities.
In better-paying suburban areas, which traditionally have more resources than the cities, the gains were usually greater.
In Emerson, N.J., for example, Mayor Harvey Truppi says his 19-member police department does good work, it just costs too much. Police wages he calculates, amount to 20 percent of the borough's $5.2 million budget and 80 percent of its total salaries.
In the last decade, base salaries for rookie officers have gone from $20,910 a year to $45,109 -- a 115 percent increase at a time when the Consumer Price Index rose only about half that amount.
 
'Like a Sword Hanging'
 And if officers in Bergen County making top pay get at least a 6 percent raise each year for the next 10 years, as many officers in the state have for the last decade, their base pay would exceed $90,000, according to the state League of Municipalities. "It's like a sword hanging over your head," Mr. Truppi said.
Few officials will say that the police officers are being paid more than they deserve, an argument that they acknowledge privately is hard to justify in an era when even beleaguered taxpayers remain adamant about police protection. Some towns have laid off workers or allowed positions to remain vacant rather than cut into police salaries or hiring.
"Sure they're paid $50,000 or $52,000 a year, but you know what it costs to live in Bergen," Mr. Loccke said.
Mr. Loccke said that consolidation, or regionalization, of some police functions would help save money, but the state's fiercely independent communities are reluctant to join forces.
Because police officers, firefighters and other uniformed public-safety employees are barred by law from striking, the Legislature, in 1977, codified a system of mediation and arbitration, which results in arbitrators' awards about 20 percent of the time. The system encourages voluntary settlements but also allows for a variety of other conclusions, including using an arbitrator to fashion a compromise contract and another procedure called "fair and final."
 
Market Forces Changing
 Under fair and final arbitrations, used in about 15 percent of the cases that go to arbitrators, each side submits a final offer and the arbitrator chooses one. In such cases arbitrators have favored the police unions by a 2-to-1 margin.
Between 1982 and 1992, the average police-fire contract settlement, whether voluntary or imposed, was 7.2 percent a year. The range was from a high of 8.2 percent in 1982 to a low of 6.5 percent in 1992.
Union lawyers, arbitrators and local officials all say that market forces may just be starting to have a delayed effect on awards. Annual averages for 1993 and 1994, based on multiyear settlements in the last two years, have averaged 5.7 percent.
Elected officials and their lobbyists in Trenton assert that the law and its threat of an imposed settlement has had some unanticipated effects: chilling the collective bargaining process by allowing one or both sides to dump their problem in the arbitrator's lap and propelling the awards beyond the towns' ability to pay.
In a statement last month to legislators weighing changes in the law, Gerald L. Dorf, labor counsel to the League of Municipalities, said that unions sometimes prefer the fair and final system because "the employer does not have the luxury of being unreasonable, but must responsibly place on the table a decent position, which then becomes the floor."
The law says the arbitrator must consider such factors as the interests of the public, the financial impact on the government, the cost of living, and comparability -- a comparison of wages, hours and working conditions with those of similar jobs in other nearby towns or private industry.
Local officials say some arbitrators dwell too heavily on comparability, excluding arguments about the communities' ability to pay or the effect on taxpayers.
But arbitrators who settle the disputes often criticize the cities and towns for providing weak cases.
Because they are professional neutrals, they declined to speak for attribution. But they emphasized that, beyond certain requests for more information, arbitrators cannot prompt either party to provide a stronger case.
And customarily, they say, the unions and their lawyers have come to bargain laden with statistics and testimony for the strongest possible presentation.
"The process frequently reflects the skill level of the advocates and and the fact that some towns may be taking too hard a line," one arbitrator said.
 
Changing Market Forces
 "Elected officials have said, 'We'll have to hold onto this position and if we lose we'll blame the arbitrator,' " the arbitrator said. "So it's, let's blame the arbitrator, let's blame the process, let's blame the Legislature."
Mr. Dorf, the labor counsel for the League of Municipalities, said many towns, citing budget concerns, shy away from hiring labor counsel or trying to contest an award in court. Such litigation could cost more than the salary increases, he said.
As for awards considerably higher than the inflation index, union lawyers and labor negotiators contend that there is a lag time before self-correction takes place. This, they say, accounted for increases of 7 percent or more in the last few years, even as the recession deepened.
When the Consumer Price Index was edging above 10 percent at the start of the 1980's, Mr. Loccke said, salary increases were just beginning to rise toward 7 and 8 percent.
"We're not going to see the mountaintop, we're not going to see the valley," he said. "The system should not be a quick fix. It should be a system that provides continuity."
 
A Limit in New York
 Nineteen other states have similar laws, labor experts say, most of which have provoked protests like that in New Jersey.
In New York, the State Conference of Mayors is recommending that a cap be placed on such awards, a proposal also under consideration in New Jersey. And last year, Connecticut amended its statute to permit municipalities to reject the final arbitrator's award, subjecting it to yet one more review.
In Trenton, three amended versions of the law are being considered in the Assembly, each seeking to require an arbitrator to consider a community's ability to pay before comparing proposals to settlements in other towns. The most far-reaching proposal was drafted by Assemblymen William J. Pascrell Jr., a Democrat who is also Mayor of Paterson, and C. Richard Kamin, a Republican of Mt. Olive, in Morris County.
Their bill would limit increases in salary and fringe benefits to no more than the statewide budget cap that is imposed annually by the Legislature on local governments. This year's cap is 1.5 percent.
 
A Settlement in Glen Rock
 Election-year politics casts doubt on the proposals, because of the political strength of the police unions, but Paul DiGaetano, chairman of the Policy and Rules Committee, says he fully expects a bill to be voted out of committee.
In the meantime, officials in places like Glen Rock, a Bergen County bedroom community of 11,000, are trying to make ends meet. Robert Freudenrich, the borough administrator, looks at his budget figures from year to year and sees dwindling revenues and increased costs for mandated items, like sewage disposal and health insurance. On top of that is the budget cap.
"About 2,000 of our residents are senior citizens," he said. "They can't afford bidg tax increases." The recession, he said, lowered property assessments, diminishing the tax base further.
In 1992, he said, $3.1 million of the $8.8 million budget was paid in salaries, 60 percent of that for the police department, whose 20 members make up about a quarter of the total work force. Only five years ago, in 1988, police salaries accounted for 51 percent of the salary budget.
"It has been a very difficult problem," said Glen Rock's Mayor, Jacqueline Kort, who advocates amending the arbitration law. But last Monday, she announced some news that she said came as a relief.

HEADLINE: Entrepreneurial Energy Sets Off a Chinese Boom

SERIES: Stirring Giant -- China's Awakening Economy/First of two articles

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WENZHOU, China

 BODY:
A few years ago, Wang Junjin was a traveling salesman, a Chinese Willy Loman whose second home was a ponderous, creaking sardine can of a train carrying him 38 hours each way to the factories in Hunan Province that bought his badges and insignias.
Mr. Wang found a better way. He and his brother started an airline. 
 Today Mr. Wang, a short, boy-faced tycoon who looks much younger than his 23 years, has far more need for his cellular telephone than for a razor. His Sky Dragon Charter Airline Company offers seven regularly scheduled flights a week and reported revenue last year of $2 million -- some of which went into his $420 double-breasted suit and his $600 24-karat gold bracelet.
"If the Government lets us do it," Mr. Wang said, "we'll do it."
 
Profound Consequences
 His boldness captures the entrepreneurial spirit in China today, and the entire Chinese economy seems to be taking off with as much energy as Mr. Wang's chartered Boeing 737's and other aircraft. Perhaps the takeoff will still be aborted, but there is a growing view that the incomes of China's nearly 1.2 billion people could soar for decades with almost incalculable consequences here and abroad.
China's economic revolution of the last 14 years is already in many ways more profound than Mao's revolution of 1949, for Chinese history is littered with peasant rebellions and new dynasties. But never before in recorded history have so many people -- or perhaps even such a large proportion of humanity -- risen from poverty so rapidly.
Based on comparisons of purchasing power, China may now have the second largest economy in the world, ranking behind only the United States. Such statistics, while open to conflicting interpretation, suggest that China could overtake the United States as the biggest economy in another decade or so.
 
Will China Surpass U.S.?
 "It may well be that when the history of the late 20th century is written 100 years from now, the most significant event will be the revolutionary changes in China, which will soon be Communist only in a rhetorical sense," Lawrence H. Summers, the former World Bank chief economist, wrote last year.
"For more than a century, the United States has been the world's largest economy," Mr. Summers added. "The only nation with a chance of surpassing it in the next generation in absolute scale is China."
What would China look like if it sustains its course? If it reaches Taiwan's per-capita income levels, China will have an economy larger than all industrialized countries in the world combined. It would be a bit like the rise of Japan, except that China has nuclear weapons and nearly 10 times the population.
"It's mind-boggling," said a Western diplomat who studies the Chinese economy. "The amount of change is truly incredible."
"I really feel that it's sustainable, because of all the unfulfilled potential," the diplomat added. "They haven't come close to meeting the level of productivity that they could, in both industry and agriculture."
Assuming that China continues to flourish, there is still a crucial uncertainty about what this means.
Will economic growth lead to an easing of the repression in China and the emergence of a more democratic society? Or will it prop up the hard-liners and subsidize the guns and spies that help keep the Communists in power? There is evidence for both propositions, but the East Asian experience suggests that prosperity and economic pluralism may eventually lead to political pluralism as well.
In the short term, the authorities seem to have demonstrated that they can combine brutal political repression with an economic miracle. No one doubts that China's economy is one of the most vibrant in the world.
Dwight H. Perkins, the director of Harvard University's Institute for International Development, published a book in 1986 entitled, "China: Asia's Next Economic Giant?" If he were redoing it today, he said, he would leave off the question mark -- or at least print it in smaller type.
"I don't see what's going to stop it, unless you can tell me a story of civil war or real chaos amounting to civil war," he said.
Not everyone agrees, and many Chinese are much more pessimistic. They worry about the risk of chaos or even civil war after the death of Deng Xiaoping, the nation's de-facto emperor, who is 88. They point to immense potential problems, ranging from corruption to the gap between economic dynamism and political stagnation.
No present or former Communist country has completed the transformation from central planning to a booming market economy. The East bloc countries -- like Yugoslavia and Hungary -- also prospered when they first introduced elements of capitalism, but they no longer seem so inspiring.
Attitudes abroad about China's prospects have fluctuated sharply over the last two decades, mirroring the boom-bust pattern in China's economy. Skeptics say this is simply another peak in a love-hate cycle that will lead to new disappointment in a year or two.
In the early- and mid-1980's, there was a wave of enthusiasm about China. That disappeared after troops fired on Tiananmen Square protesters in June 1989. The rise of the hard-liners coincided with a cyclical economic slowdown, and all bets were off.
The economy suffered less damage from sanctions and ebbing investor confidence than most expected, however. Last year, China's gross national product grew by a stunning 12 percent, to an official level of about $370 per person -- or perhaps to $2,000 or even $4,000, according to other estimates.
As the variety of figures suggest, Chinese statistics are maddeningly unreliable. On the one hand, they exaggerate growth rates because they do not sufficiently take inflation into account. On the other hand, they do not reflect the huge and growing underground economy -- encompassing everything from sidewalk restaurants to professional scribes who write letters for illiterate peasants. It is unclear which factor is more important, and for all anyone knows the two distortions may cancel each other out.
 
Even a Slowdown May Not Stop Boom
 Almost everyone acknowledges that the growth rate of 12 percent in 1992 -- even if the figure is accurate -- was a fluke. The economy appears to be overheating, running up shortages of raw materials and driving up inflation, and the Government is trying to slow growth rates a bit, something that may cool foreign enthusiasm for what is happening in China.
Yet even if a slowdown is in store later in 1993, some economists believe that an annual growth rate of 6 to 9 percent may be sustainable, on average, for another decade or more.Since 1980, China's economy has grown by an average of 9.5 percent a year, roughly the same level that Japan and then Taiwan and South Korea experienced at their postwar peaks.
At a 9 percent growth rate, economic output quintuples in just 19 years. In contrast, the United States economy has expanded at an average annual rate of about 3 percent over the last 12 years.
The industrial revolution in China is most evident in cities along the eastern coast, like Wenzhou, 250 miles south of Shanghai. The atmosphere along the cluttered shop-lined streets is very much like that of Taiwan two decades ago, with frenetic activity, multitudes of small businesses and a good deal of what Marx would have called exploitation.
"We start at 7 or 8 in the morning and go on until about 11:30 at night," said Zhou Sailu, 37, a peasant who left her village three months ago to work at a shoe factory in Wenzhou.
Many of the workers maintain that routine seven days a week, month after month. They sleep in cubbyholes above the factory floor and take a break only for Chinese New Year and in the slack season around June.
Ms. Zhou left her husband in the village but brought her daughter, 19, who works beside her stitching shoes. They each earn a bit more than $100 a month. When a visitor asked if her husband objected to her leaving home to work all day in a grimy factory, Ms. Zhou smiled patronizingly at the stupidity of the question.
"How could he possibly have any objections?" she asked. "Look how much money I'm making!"
 
Regulation Virtually Disappears
 In any case, it is clear that it is no longer very useful to describe China's economy as Communist, socialist or centrally planned. This year, for instance, the Government says the central plan will account for just 6 percent of industrial production.
Economic sectors like agriculture and industry are already slipping out of Government hands, so overall the state-owned sector accounts for less than one-third of total economic output.
In industry, the output of state-owned companies still makes up half of production, but the share is dropping steadily. By the Government's own predictions, the state share will drop to 27 percent of industrial output in the year 2000, with collective enterprises accounting for 48 percent and private companies making up 25 percent.
These days, the problem occasionally seems to be not enough Government regulation rather than too much. In the last few years, for instance, dozens of factories have turned out useless contraptions that are supposed to make people taller or to expand women's breasts. A company in Shandong Province has learned enough about marketing that it is exporting what it labels in bold English letters "gourmet powder." Apparently this is intended to evoke the cooking secrets of the exotic Orient.
In Chinese characters, the product is labeled more clearly: MSG.
 
Similarities To Other 'Miracles'
 Some economists are optimistic about China's prospects in part because of similarities they see with the "miracle economies" of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. Though the link is unproven, some people note that all these areas were traditionally influenced by Confucianism. They say Confucianism may have left a useful legacy of respect for education and for thrift and savings.
Perhaps as a result of the emphasis on education, China's labor force -- much more than Africa's, India's or Bolivia's -- is literate enough to power an industrial revolution. And the 38 percent savings rate, one of the world's highest, helps finance new investment to maintain the economy's momentum.
Like Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, China went through a process of land redistribution, soon after the 1949 revolution, that evened out the worst inequities in wealth. China's peasants in effect have their own land, giving them more of a stake in the system than many peasants have in Latin America. And in China they have a sufficient base of nutrition, health and education to work productively in the factories sprouting across the country.
China has also adopted -- in contrast to many other developing countries -- the same export-oriented growth strategy as its successful neighbors. It maintains a realistic exchange rate instead of a hugely overvalued currency like that of the old Soviet Union or of many developing countries.
A crucial economic advantage that China has over other developing countries is that it has brought its population growth under control. While China's 14-year-old family planning policies are harsh and coercive, sometimes involving forced sterilization, they give the country an economic edge over nations like Laos or Kenya, where the economy must expand by 3 percent annually just to keep up with the population.
What the statistical comparisons obscure is the powerful yearning to do business that is infecting cities and villages across China. It is often said that 70 years of Communism stunted the entrepreneurial feelings of Russians, but in China tens of millions of people are racing to start new restaurants or factories. Some say that in the current economic boom, China may be the easiest place in the world to make a fortune.
"My nephew is in California, looking after my business interests there," said Zhou Jiangning, the owner of a factory in Wenzhou that produces jade carvings. "But he says that it's easier to make money in China. Expenses are too high in America."
Mr. Zhou earned a profit of $750,000 last year on sales of about $1 million, and he says that profits and revenue are rising by about 35 percent a year. He is an apt representative of China's new gilded age: in the first 15 minutes of conversation, he mentions that his diamond-studded gold Rolex watch cost $16,000 and asks if it is true that middle-class Americans earn less than $100,000 a year.
"Oh," he said soberly, shaking his head sympathetically, "that's not very much."
To be sure, many Chinese find people like Mr. Zhou less inspiring than infuriating. The economic boom is bypassing some inland rural areas, where tens of millions live in caves or rudimentary huts, where meat is a great luxury, where parents cannot afford to send their children to school.
Life has never been fair, but to some Chinese peasants, it has rarely been so unfair. One of Communist China's great achievements was a relatively egalitarian distribution of wealth in a nation that historically had huge disparities; now those traditional disparities are returning with remarkable rapidity.
 
After Deng, The Deluge?
 The one ingredient in the East Asian recipe for an economic boom that appears absolutely essential is stability, so investors are willing to risk their money long enough to get a return. That may be the weak link in China's strategy, for no one knows what will happen after the death of Mr. Deng.
"The best analogy with the economy today is with the way things were in the early 1980's," said a senior Chinese official who is on the pessimistic side. "Then the Government divided up the communes and freed agriculture. Today it has freed the cities in the same way, and there's a burst of entrepreneurship and initiative. But big problems will come up, just as they did with agriculture in the mid-1980's.
"Who knows what will happen after old Deng dies?" he added. "Maybe China will collapse into chaos. There's no chance that the hard-liners can take over again in the long run -- that's not the risk. The risk is chaos."
That view seems to be widely shared. Many believe that if hard-liners ever had a chance of tugging China back to the Maoist era, it was in the aftermath of the Tiananmen crackdown. If they could not succeed then, many Chinese say, they never will. On the other hand, chaos -- or luan, a four-letter word in Chinese -- pops up cyclically in Chinese history, and many economists and officials fear major upheavals that could derail all progress.
"There's a huge potential for conflicts," a Chinese journalist said. "There's the problem of regionalism, and then inflation will come back again. And as the economy develops, people will demand more of a political voice, and the Government won't want to give anything up. We'll see a lot more of these conflicts."
Regionalism is seen by many Chinese as a primary threat because the provinces are clearly gaining power at the expense of the central Government. Localities regularly ignore national laws and policies they dislike, and they establish illegal barriers to goods from other provinces. This reminds Chinese of the rise of regional warlords early in this century, and some fear an eventual carving up of China into states that would resemble divisions in Europe.
 
Some Threats To the Miracle
 Other challenges that could threaten China's economic development over the next decade are these:
*Power struggles will almost certainly follow the death of Mr. Deng, and could lead to turmoil and a coup d'etat. A coup by the armed forces might not be an overwhelming problem for the economy, but some experts do not rule out the possibility of fighting among military commanders and even of civil war.
*Taiwan is suffering from an identity crisis, and there is a possibility that it will eventually declare itself an independent country. China has promised to intervene militarily if that happens, and the result could be an international uproar and sanctions against China. Economic activity might be disrupted for many years.
*Corruption is growing steadily, and at some point it may begin to sap economic growth. Public outrage over Government officials' demands for bribes -- along with anger over decontrolled prices and layoffs from state factories -- could lead to renewed street demonstrations that threaten the Government. If the Government again ordered army commanders to fire on protesters, China would once more be thrown into a crisis.
*A less cataclysmic challenge is simply the mammoth problems that China faces in developing infrastructure and training its workers. Investment in railroads, ports and energy production has lagged, and may not be able to support continued growth at current rates. Education spending is not keeping pace with the economy, so China may not have enough skilled workers to lift itself to a higher technological level of manufacturing.
The Chinese offer other scenarios in which the economy collapses, civil war breaks out and the state disintegrates into regional fiefdoms. Perhaps the important point is simply that there is a persistent cloud of uncertainty about where China is going.
Another cautionary point is that predictions about which developing countries will "take off" are often proven wrong. In the 1950's, the two East Asian economies regarded as the most promising were the Philippines and Burma. Compared with economies of other countries in the region, they have been going downhill ever since.
 
Will Prosperity Foster Democracy?
 Even if China maintains its economic momentum, there are mixed views about whether this will encourage democratic change any time soon. Mr. Deng, as shrewd an analyst of China as anyone, clearly is betting that economic growth will sustain Communist Party rule rather than undermine it.
Yet the East Asian experience suggests that in the long run, economic growth fosters a more open and democratic society. The middle class has eventually sought a measure of political participation, occasionally even toppling leaders who brought them huge increases in standards of living.
The best examples are Taiwan and South Korea, where local leaders were forced by popular pressure in the late 1980's to start accommodating demonstrators instead of shooting them. The middle class was a steadying presence in each country, seeking evolutionary change rather than violent revolution.
A middle class is emerging in China numbering in the tens of millions at least, still a small proportion of the population, which increasingly supply the ranks of senior officials.
Telephones, photocopiers, fax machines, computer modems and printing presses are proliferating, and more Chinese are traveling abroad. While the Government can crack down on protests, it seems virtually powerless to stop the flow of information and ideas.
In Wenzhou and other prosperous cities in the economic vanguard, which may offer a glimpse into the future, there has been almost no overt challenge to the Communist Party. The 1989 pro-democracy protests took place on a much smaller scale in the bustling south than in northern cities like Beijing. Yet in these cities economic development has undermined the Communist Party in more subtle ways, costing it its relevance and prestige.
"Girls don't want a boyfriend who's a cadre," said Xiang Zhengmeng, a 19-year-old waitress in Wenzhou. "We'd like a businessman. That way, we can get more money and live a better life."

Dueling Delis Need Solomon On Cedar Lane

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

DATELINE: TEANECK, N.J.

 BODY:
NOAM SOKOLOW is an entrepreneurial wonder. He began working the kosher catering circuit at age 12, saved his money, skipped college and four years ago, at 21, opened his own delicatessen, Noah's Ark, on Cedar Lane. It's popular among hip Orthodox Jews and is prospering where two delis before him failed. Friday, in the midst of a blizzard, 15 people wait ed for lunch takeouts.
He introduced home delivery, early-bird specials, a frequent diners club. His customers love to roll their eyes and moan about the huge portions. "His rotating dinner specials are a big plus," said George Feintuch, a regular. The clientele considers Mr. Sokolow a hard-driving workaholic, but a fair man. A waiter sidled up to him and whispered, "Mrs. Feintuch wants the sweet potato fries instead of potato pancakes on the special." 
 Out of the side of his mouth, Mr. Sokolow said, "Put it through."
Last summer Mr. Sokolow spied opportunity: A vacant building across the way that could seat three times as many customers. He decided to move Noah's Ark, his meat restaurant, there and open a kosher dairy restaurant at the smaller site where Noah's Ark had been.
Then the trouble began. Owners of five other kosher restaurants on Cedar Lane went to rabbinical court and demanded that Noah's Ark be enjoined from expanding, citing the ancient Jewish law on ruinous competition known as hasagat gvul. "We are not afraid of competition," these owners wrote. "We are only afraid of businesses opened to destroy us."
Mr. Sokolow tried to negotiate a settlement over what he'd be allowed to serve at his dairy restaurant. He nearly had a deal with Jerusalem Pizza. "I said, 'I won't serve any pizza, no falafel in exchange for your dropping the charges.' Then they threw in eggplant Parmesan, baked ziti, tuna melt. They wanted too much."
Ann Arfe, owner of Santoro's, a dairy restaurant that would be hard hit by Mr. Sokolow's new place, wrote the rabbis: "There is absolutely no need for another dairy restaurant in this area. Santoro's is a dairy, vegetarian, fish restaurant that caters to all price ranges and palates." This became known as the "our restaurant is more than enough" defense. It turned nasty. Mrs. Arfe claimed that Mr. Sokolow had "copied the fish and pasta portion of my menu" and accused him of having an "arrogant, chuts panik attitude." (Mr. Sokolow answers, "She doesn't have a patent on fettuccine pomodoro.")
Mr. Sokolow had to submit to a Manhattan rabbinical court. Not to have done so would have jeopardized his kosher certification and cost him his Orthodox clientele. He was sure he'd win. He isn't a big chain. This was plain old American competition.
Wrong! Last fall, the rabbinical court permitted Noah's Ark to move to the larger location, but then shocked many here by refusing to let Mr. Sokolow open a dairy restaurant.
To read the pleadings is to understand the compassion behind the ancient law and the rabbinical court's ruling. Mrs. Arfe wrote: "Noam Sokolow is 25 years old, single, no children, no mortgage, no expenses. We on the other hand have a mortgage, debts, yeshiva bills, two teen-age daughters. Our livelihood is at stake here. This is not a game to us."
Her husband lost a business five years ago. "We took a larger mortgage on our house and also borrowed from family and friends," she said. "Our savings are completely depleted." If Mr. Sokolow opens a dairy restaurant, Santoro's will soon close, she wrote. "We will lose our house and I truly do not know how our family will handle it."
Yet in trying to show compassion, the rabbis have opened Pandora's box. Practically anytime someone here now wants to add a blintz to the menu, the rabbis are petitioned. To see the ensuing entanglements is to understand why the Soviet Union's planned economy collapsed. In December Mr. Sokolow petitioned for a $12.95 lox and whitefish Sunday brunch. The rabbis faxed their approval, but Mrs. Arfe immediately countered with a $7.95 brunch. "She can compete with me," says Mr. Sokolow, "but I can't compete with her?"
He says the lease on the restaurant he can't open is costing him $6,000 a month and asks, "Who's going to pay?" Last week, Fliegel's Fast Food began advertising itself as Fliegel's Family Restaurant, emphasizing deli dishes similar to Noah's Ark. "When I tried putting in a fast food counter and salad bar in Noah's Ark," says Mr. Sokolow, "the rabbis said, 'No, you'll be taking away from Fliegel's Fast Food.' "
Mr. Sokolow, champion of free enterprise, now feels he must play their game. Wednesday he faxed a request to the rabbinical court for a hearing on Fliegel's alleged deli encroachment.

HEADLINE: Saudi Rulers Resisting Pressure From Two Sides

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia

 BODY:
In a high-stakes gamble for King Fahd and his Western allies, including the United States, Saudi Arabia is fighting a wave of Islamic fundamentalist opposition and demands for democratic reforms by tightening one of the most confining political systems in the Middle East.
The measures, which followed a period of liberalization during the Persian Gulf crisis, have included the arrest and imprisonment of militant clerics, a refusal to grant promised political reforms and tighter press censorship, including a ban on the import of satellite dishes. 
 King Fahd, whose family has ruled the country since 1902, is relying on an authoritarian system that does not permit political parties or the right to vote for national and provincial governments and denies freedom of speech, assembly and association.
But the approach has risks for the King. If demands from the Western-educated elite for liberal reforms are ignored, the rigidity of the system may move many in the opposition, especially the young, to embrace Islamic fundamentalism.
 
Close Ties to U.S.
 "If the pressure for change erodes the hold of the Saud dynasty," a Western diplomat said, "it will be a major blow for the United States, which fought the war in the gulf to safeguard not only Kuwait's oil fields, but those in Saudi Arabia."
A country of 17 million, Saudi Arabia is of paramount importance to the United States' strategic interests in the region, especially with Saddam Hussein still in power in Iraq and the Islamic Government of Iran seeking to acquire an array of military equipment, from Russian submarines to nuclear technology.
United States attacks on southern Iraq have included strikes by warplanes based in Saudi Arabia, and the Saudi Government is playing a growing role in providing oil and jobs for the United States.
Saudi Arabia has increased oil exports to the United States 10-fold in the last five years, to 1.8 million barrels a day. It is the United States' biggest foreign supplier, with 24 percent of all oil imports. In the same period, it has doubled its purchase of American goods, buying $8 billion in merchandise.
The increase in American imports alone translates into 50,000 American jobs, according to a senior diplomat. And that figure does not include the $25 billion Saudi Arabia has spent on American military equipment since the end of the gulf war, including a $9 billion order for 72 advanced F-15 fighters.
 
Malaise Is Apparent
 But there seems to be a malaise in the kingdom, where gleaming shopping malls and luxury sedans often exude a sense of well being and security.
The prosperity of past years is no longer a given. The Government no longer guarantees Saudi college graduates a job, and private businesses, which prefer cheaper and often better-educated foreign workers, employ only 10 percent of the workers in Saudi Arabia who are of Saudi origin. Even those who find work must accept wages that have been frozen for a decade.
The emerging economic troubles are in sharp contrast with the opulent life of the royal family, who now number in the thousands.
The practice by some of members of the ruling family of skimming up to 30 percent "commissions" off business deals has led to charges of widespread mismanagement and corruption by the country's business sector. And the ostentatious palaces erected for young princes along palm-lined avenues have set many Saudis grumbling.
 
Welfare State Erodes
 The Government is saddled with budget deficits that have begun to eat away at the lavish welfare state. Schools are overcrowded, there is a shortage of hospital beds, and sections of Jidda receive water only two days a week.
"Saudi citizens today have fewer civil and political rights than they had 60 years ago," said a recent report by the human rights group Middle East Watch.
The decline in living standards, especially in a country where half the population is under 18, has fueled disenchantment.
"In Egypt a corrupt Minister will at least recognize that he is stealing public money," a prominent businessman said, "but here they do not. The royal family has come to believe that they own the whole country. They even see the people as their property."
Saudi officials dismiss the internal criticism as insignificant, but at the same time the state-controlled media have begun a campaign against both Islamic fundamentalism and liberal Western-style democracy.
 
Consultative Council Delayed
 Government supporters point to the King's promise to appoint a 61-man Consultative Council, which while it will not have the power to legislate, will be able to discuss and interpret laws. But the members of the council have yet to be announced despite a September deadline, and the press is no longer allowed to speculate about when it will be formed.
The Government contends that those who criticize it, including many who have sent petitions calling for change to the King, have refused opportunities to push for reforms from within.
"Many of the people who signed these petitions have no guts to really go out and work through the organized system for change," a member of the royal family said. "There are changes. We have the Consultative Council. There is more and more structured participation."
The opposition to the royal family, which usually stops short of calling for its overthrow, is led by two groups -- the Western-educated upper class and the fundamentalists.
 
No Stomach for Confrontation
 But many of the wealthy elite, while fed up with the nepotism and lack of individual liberties, have no real stomach to confront the Government and no real following beyond their own.
"People like us are no threat," a European-educated journalist said. "We will just pack up and spend a couple of weeks in Paris when we get fed up. The threat comes from the fundamentalists, who have the conviction and the courage to challenge the state."
And many Saudi professionals, as much as they dislike the ruling family, dislike the Islamic militants more.
"As members of the elite," a newspaper editor said, "we know we will be among the first to go if the militants take power."
But many middle-class Saudis, who earn an average of $1,000 a month, have begun to heed the calls of militant clerics, who denounce the royal family as corrupt, puppets of the West and too weak-kneed to safeguard the rights of the Palestinians or the Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 
Legitimacy From Islam
 As custodian of the two holiest sites in the Islamic world -- the mosques at Mecca and Medina -- the King is considered to have a unique responsibility, and the royal family derives much of its legitimacy from its special religious function.
The criticism is widespread, although none of it is allowed to be expressed publicly. And the stifling press censorship, which did not allow Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 to be reported until three days after it happened, remains tightly in place.
But clandestine audio cassettes, many of them recordings of fiery attacks on the Government by clerics at Friday prayers, and underground books, including one entitled "The Peninsula's Rulers: Puppets of Satan," are widely available.
Because the attacks come primarily from Islamic militants, the Government is put in a peculiar quandary.
"Saudi Arabia can't take too harsh a stand against these Islamic activities," said Dr. Ahmed al-Tuwaijri, one of the few opposition leaders willing to be quoted by name, "because their whole legitimacy is based on Islam."
 
Petitions Call for Change
 The King has recently been besieged with petitions calling for change, including one last year signed by 107 prominent Saudis that demanded total adherence to Islamic law and attacked official corruption.
The 45-page document called on the Government to end its close ties with the United States and attacked both the refusal to boost the size of the Saudi Army and a legal system that does not allow defense attorneys into the courtroom. It charged the 2,000 inner members of the royal family with corruption and demanded public disclosure of state expenditures. Other demands included an end to the construction of royal palaces from public funds and to the monopoly of land ownership by a "certain elite."
In a rare acknowledgement of public dissent, the petition was condemned by the Supreme Ulma Council, the Government's official body of Muslim clergymen.
The refusal by the ruling family to heed the muffled calls for reform, many critics contend, is aggravating the conflict.
"The demands for reform are meant, in the end, to stabilize the system, because of a fear of collapse," Mr. Tuwaijri said. "The major danger facing the system is a collapse brought about by an inability to reform."

HEADLINE: In China, Incomes Are Low but Everything Is Cheap

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 13

 BODY:
One of the puzzles for many visitors to China is how to reconcile the apparent wealth around them with China's official per capita income of just $370 a year.
Part of the explanation is that interpreting China's economic statistics can be a nightmare. Prices, for instance, are so low that income statistics are misleading. 
 Take Zhu Huiyuan, a 46-year-old security officer at a company in the central Chinese city of Bengbu. His salary is only $25 a month, a fairly typical urban wage.
But Mr. Zhu also gets a half-dozen supplements -- for haircuts, for buying newspapers, for seniority and so on -- that add up to $14 more. His wife, a cook, earns a total of $30 a month in salary and supplements.
While their combined monthly income of $69 a month sounds meager, they pay no income or sales taxes, and expenses are minimal. Apartment rents in China average about $2.50 a month including utilities, bus fare is a penny, spinach costs 6 cents a pound, a winter down jacket is $22, and an evening newspaper costs 2.5 cents. Even a luxury like dog meat is only $1 a pound.
One way to come up with a more realistic value for China's gross national product is to adjust it by valuing production at international prices. This approach, called the purchasing power parity technique, yields a much higher value for the gross national product of China as well as for those of other developing countries.
A potential flaw in this method is that China's products are often of lower quality than Western commodities, so price comparisons sometimes overvalue the Chinese goods. Consider Chinese plates: they look terrific but are often contaminated with lead. Pricing them at the level of American plates would exaggerate their value.
Because of these kinds of ambiguities, different studies relying on this technique have come up with widely varying estimates of the size of China's economy, from about $650 per person to about $4,000 per person. One gauge is that China's figures for life expectancy and average calories consumed are close to those of countries with a gross national product of about $2,000 per capita.
At the highest estimates, China's G.N.P. is substantially bigger than Japan's. At the more reasonable level of $2,000 per capita, China's G.N.P. is about $2.3 trillion, behind the official G.N.P. figures for the United States and Japan but larger than Germany's.
When Japan's income is also adjusted for purchasing power, it drops significantly because of high prices in Japan. A World Bank analysis using United Nations data, for instance, suggests that in terms of purchasing power China's per capita income in 1990 may have been about $1,950, while in Japan it was $16,950 -- compared with the official Japanese per capita income in that year of $25,430.

HEADLINE: The Economy: Pain and Candor

 BODY:
On his 29th day in office, next Wednesday, President Clinton will lay out a plan for economic revival that will be a test of his budget-making ability and his political salesmanship. He emphasized the word sacrifice in his Inaugural Address. Now comes the hammer.
Mr. Clinton seems to be preparing to tell Americans they can kiss the promised tax cut goodbye and say hello to higher taxes all around. 
 The economic argument is fairly straightforward. Getting the deficit down and spending to stimulate long-term growth require more revenues. The political argument is tougher. It will rise or fall on how effectively Mr. Clinton can present his tax increases as necessary and fair.
He will have to speak loudly to be heard over the gleeful Republican chorus of "Told you so, told you so." Here are some tests by which to judge whether the President's plan is both equitable and equal to the task:
Short-term stimulus. Mr. Clinton is likely to propose temporarily increasing the deficit by perhaps $15 billion to $30 billion to drive persistently high unemployment a bit lower. But to make a dent, the package needs to be at least twice as large.
Long-term investment. His campaign plan called for investing $50 billion a year for four years on telecommunications, high-speed trains and preparing a work force for 21st-century jobs. That can be scaled down, but not by much or else Mr. Clinton will have tarnished his central commitment.
Deficit reduction. The deficit is now $300 billion and would be $350 billion in four years if Mr. Clinton did nothing about it. At a minimum, it should be cut below $200 billion. Otherwise, the national debt will continue to grow faster than the economy -- a prescription for economic ruin.
The upshot is that, after adding in the cost of his investment program, Mr. Clinton has to find about $200 billion in budget cuts to bring the deficit down to tolerable levels by the end of his term.
Spending. The first place to look for spending cuts is the military. By 1997 defense spending could be cut by at least $40 billion more per year than is already planned. Next come the huge entitlement programs. Mr. Clinton appears ready to move on Social Security by raising taxes on the benefits for wealthier retirees. But reining in Medicaid and Medicare -- the two entitlements that are out of control -- depends on overhauling the nation's health care system.
Taxes. Before President Clinton reneges on his promise to cut taxes on middle-income families, he must scrounge for every other source of budget saving. His first obligation is to increase taxes on the rich to offset their gains at the hands of the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
He could also reduce deductions for mortgage interest and health care premiums for wealthy families. Altogether, these and similarly targeted tax hikes could raise $40 billion or more. But that would still leave Mr. Clinton's deficit reduction perhaps $80 billion short.
Having already gone after every other source of savings, Mr. Clinton must convince his supporters that he has earned the right to plumb the only one that's left: the pockets of the middle-income taxpayers he had promised to hold harmless.
He seems likely to withdraw his pledge to cut taxes on middle-income families, then go for a broad-based energy tax as the easiest way to get big bucks -- perhaps $50 billion a year by 1997. An energy tax would also help to clean the environment. But if Mr. Clinton goes that route, he must present it as a last resort, and ameliorate the step by casting the tax as broadly as possible.
He must also admit that energy taxes are regressive; they hurt poor families more than the rich. There are ways to protect the poor from the tax, by increasing outlays on food stamps and tax credits for low-paid workers. But there are no good ways to even out the regional impacts, and Mr. Clinton should not hand Sunbelt Republicans like Representative Newt Gingrich a political club by going for a gasoline tax hike this year.
Trade policy. Budget policy alone does not make an economic plan. Another key is trade policy. Mr. Clinton's first task is to complete swiftly the Uruguay Round of international trade talks, but so far he's voiced no such resolve. Instead, his Administration has invited industries to lobby for special protection from foreign competitors. Wednesday is the time to slam this political back door shut.
This package of measures would take guts to push through Congress. But for Mr. Clinton to take the easy way out -- pretending to solve programs but not leveling about the sacrifice -- would threaten the economy and this Presidency.
Bill Clinton promised to "grow" the economy. If he cowers, his political fate may be no better that the man who defaulted on "read my lips."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
No Miracles For Bosnia

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Hardly anything is ruled out for Bosnia, senior Clinton Administration officials told me on Friday. We're still looking at most options, they insisted.
But the subtext was unmistakable: Not now, not for months and probably never will U.S. bombers attack the Serb cannons that are pounding Sarajevo, or send troops to protect the city or provide arms to the overmatched Bosnian Muslims. 
 The Europeans, the Russians, the U.N. won't go along with these actions, the officials explained. In any event, the new Clinton team has reviewed its options and concluded that little can be gained and much risked by using force. "Actually, the Europeans were more dug in against force than Colin," one senior official related, referring to Gen. Colin Powell, the top military commander. "It's all very complicated," the official confided.
Life is not very complicated in Resnik, a refugee camp for Muslims about 30 minutes from downtown Zagreb, the Croatian capital. In Resnik, it is a simple matter of survival. I was taken there two weeks ago by officials of the International Rescue Committee, one of the noble humanitarian groups doing heroic work in ex-Yugoslavia.
The Dutch have been the principal helpers of the camp, but Arab do-gooders have been moving in. The new Arab Muslim benefactors try to bend their Slavic co-religionists to the true ways of Islam, but to little avail. "Where is it written in the Koran that you can't drink slivovitz?" one refugee remarked to me.
I visited with, let's call them, the Paltrak family from the Bosnian town of Prijedor, 11 surviving members from four generations living in a 15-by-15 room in long wooden barracks. "Until the killings and rapings began a year ago, there were no differences between us and the Serbs," said one woman of seemingly iron will. "We even raised chickens together."
"They took my son outside our house and shot him," the grandmother blurted out, almost embarrassed. "Another son, the Serbs took away. If I only knew he was alive, we would stay here five years just to know."
Their nightmares tumbled out in gales of emotion, vivid, specific, palpably true and very simple -- unlike the complicated arguments about policy in Europe and Washington.
Back in Washington on Friday, Administration officials told me that President Clinton had decided on tough new measures to enforce the economic embargo against Serbia. He would also be employing America's full diplomatic might to bring the Serb, Croat and Muslim factions around to accepting a modified version of the Vance-Owen plan for dividing Bosnia into ethnic enclaves.
This plan is well known to the residents of Karlovac, a camp for former inmates of Serbian concentration camps in Bosnia. You reach Karlovac from Zagreb by motoring to the thruway entrance, taking a ticket, driving 45 minutes, paying the toll, winding your way to one of the cease-fire lines between the Croats and Serbs in Croatia and pulling up to the camp in the center of the town. It's like taking the New Jersey Turnpike to a war.
"We could go back and live in peace with good Croats and Serbs as the Vance-Owen plan wants," said one man, an engineer by training. "But all who committed crimes must pay." His words were echoed by a number of the other men.
I asked a woman who sat silently on the floor what she thought. "I would go back to the village only if Serbs were not there. We can't live with those who did this."
"I was with my Serb neighbor, one of my best friends, having tea the moment the Serb police took away my husband and son," the woman continued. "She knew what was going to happen. And she said nothing to me. She knew."
The woman asked me when the Americans were coming. I said I had to tell her I did not think they were coming. Tears filled her eyes. So I told her I was not sure.
But I was sure, even before I talked to Administration officials a week later.
In Resnik and Karlovac, the victims' pain and suffering were inescapably personal, concrete, simple. Their only hope was for an American miracle. In Washington, the policy debates were inevitably abstract and exceedingly complicated -- and the powers-that-be had already eliminated the miracles.

HEADLINE: The Week of the Economy

 BODY:
On Wednesday President Clinton, who in his campaign promised better economic times, will finally reveal his program. He is expected to propose measures to create jobs and to shrink the Federal deficit.
Since Election Day, the economy has shown signs of improving. But many problems remain. The two coasts continue to suffer very high unemployment. Markets for America's exports are in the doldrums, and major corporations are shedding jobs. 
 The President also has longer-term concerns. Productivity has stagnated for two decades, and so have family incomes. Mr. Clinton believes that the Government's biggest contribution would be to stop draining the nation's investment funds. The Federal deficit now absorbs virtually all the savings of American households.

HEADLINE: Education in the Arts Is an Education for Life;
Role for Museums

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Feb. 3-4 series on the decline in arts education suggests anew the crucial role that museums play in supplementing the education of our young people. At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, tens of thousands of students from all five of New York City's boroughs and the surrounding region encounter the greatest artistic achievements of all peoples, from all times and all places. 
 Programs include free classes and apprenticeships for high school students, professional development opportunities for teachers and family passes that encourage students to return with relatives. Like our sister institutions -- such as the Brooklyn Museum, the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Queens Museum of Art -- we struggle to make the arts part of every student's preparation.
But New York's civic museums have been hit by city and state fund reductions that close galleries. These cuts come even as museums demonstrate that they contribute to the economic vitality of New York by attracting visitors from across the country and throughout the world.
The time has now surely come for a re-examination of our budgetary priorities.

UNEVEN RECOVERY
 
The Pacific
UNEMPLOYMENT: 8.9%
Declines in the aerospace, banking, real estate and entertainment industries have taken the bloom off the California perennial. And environmental regulation, traffic congestion and land-use restrictions may slow growth for a long time.
 
The Mountains and Southwest
UNEMPLOYMNET: 6.6%
This diversified economy has proved better equipped than most to weather the recession. Now it has a chance to pick off the high-technology plums from California, whose problems have left some businesses disillusioned.
 
"UNEVEN RECOVERY"
Trouble on Two Coasts
A slow, unbalanced recovery means hard times for California and the Northeast, along with stagnating living standards across the nation. While regional disparities are common, the strains of adjustment are particularly acute this time.
By January, when the national unemployment rate had fallen to 7.1 percent, two of the regions below had jobless rates that were considerably higher. And that spells big trouble for Washington, which must reconcile pressures to get the sluggards moving without overheating the economy as a whole.
 
"UNEMPLOYMENT"
Regional rates in January.
 
The Midwest
UNEMPLOYMENT: 6.2%
The rust belt wasn't invited to the economic party of the 1980's. But by missing the real-estate boom, it escaped the hangover afflicting other regions. Slimmed-down manufacturers are benefiting from export growth.
 
The South
UNEMPLOYMENT: 6.8%
Low wages and pro-business governments give the region an edge in attracting cost-conscious industry. But much of the South still lacks a highly-skilled work force. And the suburban sprawls of Florida and Texas are feeling the strains of pollution and congestion.
 
The Northeast
UNEMPLOYMENT: 7.9%
The Northeast has had many problems in common with California. Connecticut is undergoing the agony of military procurement cutbacks; Massachusetts is suffering from shakeouts in the computer industry and in banking. Increased profits at banks and on Wall Street are beginning to help New York, but the region's old industrial cities may never regain their former vibrancy.
 
"STAGNANT LIVING STANDARDS"

Americans enjoy the highest living standard in the world. But for the past two decades, pay has slid, and more Americans households have had to have two income earners to produce even modest gains in family incomes. The wages and benefits of younger, less educated wo

TEMPLES OF CHANCE
How America Inc. Bought Out
Murder Inc. to Win Control
of the Casino Business.
By David Johnston.
Doubleday, $22.50. 
 In his highly negative account of the casino gambling industry, and in his contention that New Jersey has failed to regulate it consistently in Atlantic City, David Johnston states repeatedly that the use of legalized casino gambling as a short cut to increased tax revenues, new jobs and urban revitalization is a deal with the Devil that only the Devil will win. A Philadelphia Inquirer reporter who covered Atlantic City for nearly four years, Mr. Johnston offers devastating accounts of sleazy and even criminal practices perpetrated by casino operators. He exposes the double standard that state regulatory bodies use to pounce on petty infractions by low-level casino employees while ignoring blatant violations of gambling laws by top management. Yet in "Temples of Chance," Mr. Johnston ignores information that might weaken his case. Eager to show the New Jersey Casino Control Commission as ridiculously soft on casino operators, for example, Mr. Johnston says nothing of the commission's forced closing of Caesars Atlantic City's casino for a single day on a busy holiday weekend -- the equivalent of depriving Caesars of nearly $1 million in revenues -- as a penalty for allegedly enticing a wealthy Canadian compulsive gambler. However, with dozens of municipalities welcoming riverboat gambling and variations on Atlantic City's theme, Mr. Johnston's tales of greed, criminality and duplicity must be heeded.

HEADLINE: Making a Go of It the Old-Fashioned Way, Through Bartering

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
AMONG the things Finn Dankilde, owner of the Pampered Pet, in Fishkill, has acquired during the last three years are a second-hand Audi for his daughter at college, the services of an accountant for his business and his personal tax returns, dental care for all four members of his family, tickets to the Virginia Slims tennis finals at Madison Square Garden and meals at good Manhattan restaurants for his wife and himself.
Yet no money changed hands in any of the transactions. Instead, Mr. Dankilde paid for everything with credit, the "trade dollars" he gets from barter exchange. Mr. Dankilde is a member of the International Trade Exchange, a publicly held barter company with 74 offices and 16,000 members nationwide, known as ITEX.
 
Increased Purchasing Power
 "In terms of volume of business, Westchester is in the top seven nationally," said Bruce Kamm, the head of the New York/Westchester office of ITEX. Mr. Kamm recently completed plans to build a Westchester office in Bedford, not for cash but by bartering for building materials and the services of architects and contractors. 
 A former computer executive who developed on-line services for various companies, Mr. Kamm became a member of ITEX with the intent of bartering his services.
"The system worked so well for me -- among other things, I got a car -- that I decided to leave the computer business, which was overcrowded, and become an ITEX barter broker," he said. "My rationale was that with the recession, a lot of business owners and professionals would be even more receptive to the barter concept in order to stimulate their businesses and move inventories and conserve cash. Most people aren't aware that today 30 percent of all business transactions in the country involve some type of trade or barter. And by the end of the century, it's expected to increase to 50 percent."
On completion of a training course at the corporate training center in Portland, Ore., Mr. Kamm became a trade director with an office in Manhattan. In 11 months he expanded in Westchester.
"The concept of barter exchange is simple," he said, explaining how the system works: businesses profit from bartering by increasing their purchasing power and by finding new customers; members receive credits for what they sell. In order to join, they pay a one-time, $295 membership fee and a commission of 5 percent cash on every barter transaction, plus a yearly $15 cash fee and a yearly $15 fee in trade dollars for association dues and a newsletter. "In return, they get our nationwide list of products and services, which range from accountants and acupuncturists to video productions and well drillers, and everything in between," Mr. Kamm said.
By selling goods and services through the exchange, members earn trade dollars, which are credited to their account, similar to a bank account, Mr. Kamm said. They use their trade dollars to buy from other members. Purchases are made using "trade drafts," which look like bank checks.
"ITEX does all the accounting and record keeping for the exchange," Mr. Kamm said. "Regular account statements are issued to all our members showing them the activity in their account." Members set their own prices on the goods and services they offer for barter.
Bartering, which was once perceived as a slightly shady practice, part of the underground economy that avoided paying taxes, gained respectability with the passage of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1984, which, Mr. Kamm said, required all barter groups to report the value of all transactions to the Internal Revenue Service. Barter transactions are subject to the same taxes as cash transactions.
 
'Barter Can Move Inventories'
 "We're the only public company in the barter business," Mr. Kamm said. "We file regular financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although everything is bartered today, it's particularly useful in a recession when businesses are cash poor or when the demand for business in a particular product is slow. Barter can move inventories. And if a customer wants something very special and unique, part of my job is to help him find it."
For one customer, Mr. Kamm said, a contractor who wanted a luxurious boat in exchange for the trade dollars he earned from doing contracting work for other members, Mr. Kamm found a seller with a $95,000 yacht. "The contractor got the yacht, air fare to London and a trip on the Orient Express for two in return for building an addition on a home for another customer."
Another member wanted to trade a lion; still another bartered two racehorses worth $15,000 apiece.
"Barter transactions aren't always small," Mr. Kamm said. "Some interesting tradeabilities that just came in last week were a brand-new $160,000 sports car, $10.5 million worth of mining equipment and $23 million in medical equipment."
 
A Willingness to Work Is Needed
 Recently, Mr. Dankilde bartered a poodle puppy worth $500 plus another $200 for supplies and $500 for training, housebreaking and an obedience course to a couple who, in turn, sell bridal gowns and prom dresses. In another transaction, he said, he bartered two fish-tank setups totaling $1,700.
"But you have to be willing to work at bartering; unless you use it and understand the system, you will be out of cash -- which is the last thing you want," Mr. Dankilde said. "You have to be a good shopper. But once you understand the process, it can be extremely advantageous. I know it's helped me save cash and move stock, and while it doesn't pay the bills -- you still need cash for that -- you do get opportunities to use your trade dollars for something that can be sold and converted into cash. For instance, if you buy a car with trade dollars and sell it for cash, you end up with cash."
Marilyn Goldberg, the owner of Mari Hube, an art and museum giftware shop on Manhattan's East Side, frequently goes on buying trips and attends trade shows here and abroad.
"We barter a lot of travel, hotel accommodations, magazine advertisements and art supplies," Ms. Goldberg said. "We manufacture and sell original art pieces for museum stores and because we frequently have to have new inventories for our museum customers, we barter our excess stock. It's a good way to lower our inventories and save cash. As far as I'm concerned, I think barter exchange is the wave of the future. We will be seeing more of it."
 
A Half-Cash, Half-Barter Job
 Thomas Honahan is a contractor in Middletown, N.Y. Recently, Mr. Honahan installed skylights and renovated the exterior of the Casalone restaurant in Manhattan.
"The total cost for the job was $25,000, half for cash and half for barter credit," Mr. Honahan said. "I figure barter accounts for 20 percent of my overall business. In exchange for my contracting work, I have acquired a fax machine, air tickets to Aruba, and I'm working on bartering hotel accommodations now. Bartering has helped me keep busy during the recession."
Dr. Jan Gross, who is Mr. Kamm's wife, is a periodontist.
"I've already bartered my professional services for building supplies that were used for the construction of our new house in Bedford, and now I am working on getting the appliances through barter," Dr. Gross said.

HEADLINE: Clinic Lends a Hand in Rocking the Cradle

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON recently described the effects of her first few weeks in the White House.
"There has been so much to do initially," Mrs. Clinton said in a report in The New York Times. "Sleep has taken a back seat. I told Bill we have a budget deficit, an investment deficit and a sleep deficit." 
 If the Clintons want the White House to look like America, they are on the right track -- at least when it comes to sleep deprivation. Like other busy Americans for whom there do not seem to be enough hours in the day, sleep has been put low on their list of priorities.
But viewing sleep as an expendable luxury is a misperception -- and one that is potentially dangerous, say doctors who study sleep.
 
A Price to Pay
 "People have somewhat vague ideas about the nature of sleep," said Dr. Charles Pollak, a neurologist and the medical director of the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at the Westchester division of New York Hospital/Cornell Medical Center here.
"They have the idea that sleep is essentially a waste of time and that nothing useful is being accomplished," Dr. Pollak said. "What they don't understand about sleep is that it is a bodily function that is as necessary as breathing."
The need for sleep will eventually manifest itself, Dr. Pollak added. While a person can get along on a short-term basis with less sleep, over time there will be a price to pay in reduced cognitive function.
And if the brain is short on sleep, the result can be irritability, confusion and depression. The consequences include troubled interpersonal relationships, difficulty on the job and the kind of clouded judgment that leads to serious accidents.
According to a report released last month by the National Commission on Sleep Disorders Research, several of the nation's major accidents, including the near meltdown at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant as well as numerous rail, airplane and automobile accidents, share a common basis: human error related to excessive fatigue. Several doctors at the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center contributed to the report.
There are a variety of reasons why people don't get enough sleep, say the experts who study sleep. In some cases it may simply be a condition of modern life in a difficult economy -- many people working two jobs, enduring long commutes or performing shift work fail to get enough sleep.
But there are others for whom, no matter how much time they spend in bed, sleep seems an impossibility. The National Commission Report said that about 40 million Americans suffer from chronic disorders of sleep and wakefulness, such as narcolepsy, sleep apnea and insomnia. An additional 20 to 30 million people experience intermittent sleep-related problems.
According to the report, the vast majority of people affected remain undiagnosed and untreated. But doctors at the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center say that many people who suffer for years without enough sleep are doing so unnecessarily.
 
A Variety of Complaints
 "Most sleep disorders are treatable," said Dr. Margaret L. Moline, the director of the center. "Basically, the problem is that there is just not enough information in the general public and among health-care professionals about sleep -- what's normal and what is a disorder."
For instance, she said, "most people think snoring is laughable because the noise is funny." But, she added, "it may be caused by sleep apnea, which is a dangerous condition, and while we cannot cure it, there is a very effective treatment."
People who come to the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center for help have a variety of complaints, but most fall into three main categories.
First, there are those who complain of excessive daytime sleepiness. By this they do not mean occasional drowsiness that comes after one bad night of sleep.
This is sleepiness that occurs every day and is severe enough to be disabling -- causing errors at work, car accidents and a basic inability to take part in such simple pleasures as seeing a movie or a concert without falling asleep.
Sleepiness, of course, is caused by not sleeping well, and at the center doctors attempt to discover the root of the problem. One common diagnosis is sleep apnea -- a condition where a person has difficulty sleeping and breathing at the same time. People with sleep apnea snore heavily and can actually be waking up dozens of times a night in an effort to breathe. Sleep apnea can be treated with a machine that regulates breathing.
Another sleep disorder that causes excessive daytime fatigue is narcolepsy. People who have narcolepsy cannot stay awake and alert for 16 hours a day, which is what most people are able to endure. They need to take frequent naps throughout the day.
Not only is this disorder disabling, but it is also frequently misunderstood.
"The most poignant stories I hear are from people with narcolepsy," Dr. Pollak said.
"Often a person has grown up accepting other people's ideas about them as lazy people who are not motivated and not interested in what they are doing," Dr. Pollak said. "They come to believe it is a matter of character because they have no other explanation for why they are falling asleep all the time," he explained.
Narcolepsy can be treated with medication.
A second major category of complaints at the center is insomnia. Insomnia is not a disease but a group of conditions that may have different causes, Dr. Pollak said. The most prevalent is psychiatric -- depression is known to cause sleeplessness.
Long-term treatment means addressing the depression itself, either through medication, psychotherapy or a combination of the two.
 
The Biological Clock
 In other cases people who cannot fall asleep until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning no matter what time they go to bed may have a problem with what doctors call the biological clock. Dr. Daniel Wagner, a staff neurologist at the center, said there is a clock in the brain that keeps track of time.
"The body clock is a relatively rigid function," Dr. Wagner said. "If you change time zones, you can reset your watch but not your brain. That's why you have the symptoms of jet lag."
Dr. Wagner said that research in trying to reset the brain clock includes exposure to bright lights and medication, but, he added, the research remains experimental.
 
Inappropriate Behavior
 People often attempt to medicate themselves for insomnia by using sleeping pills. Sleeping pills are the most widely prescribed type of drugs in the world, doctors at the clinic say. But they warn that prescription sleeping pills are both psychologically and physically addictive, and while pills may be effective for a short-term, specific problem, they are not advisable for chronic sleep disorders.
The third major source of complaints at the center is what doctors gingerly call "behavior inappropriate to sleep." This can include people who act out a dream and punch a bed partner, people who prepare a meal in their sleep and eat it without waking up and children sleep-walking out of bed, down the stairs and out the front door into the street.
Though some of the anecdotes seem amusing, the consequences are far from laughable; often they result in serious injury. The center has seen patients who have injured their spouses, walked through glass doors and been badly lacerated and children who have been hurt during their nighttime ramblings. Often, such conditions can be controlled with medication.
When patients come to the sleep-disorder center they are evaluated in several ways. Almost all patients complete sleep logs, so they can chart their patterns of sleep.
For some, though not all patients, it is useful to obtain sleep recordings, which measure the amount and quality of a person's sleep. The center has four private sleep rooms, each of which, in addition to having a bed, is equipped with infrared lights and a video camera.
Electrodes are attached to the patient, and as he or she sleeps, brain activity, eye movements, muscle tone and heart rhythms are measured. Results are charted on a 20-channel polygraph and can also appear on a computer screen.
When asked how anyone could possibly sleep under such conditions, Dr. Moline said: "Oftentimes, people who have come here have really reached the end of their ropes. They are exhausted."
 
Studies Under Way
 In addition to its treatment of patients with sleep disorders, the center is also involved in research. Three major studies are in progress: one studying methods to reduce the effects of shift work, another on age-related insomnia and a third studying the effects of antidepressant medication on sleep and wakefulness. Volunteers are needed for all three studies.
Doctors say that an occasional sleepless night is normal. For everyday stress, calming bedtime routines can be soothing. But over-worry about sleep problems can also cause additional difficulty in sleeping.
"Worrying about a sleep problem can make it real," Dr. Pollak said. "There are techniques that can help you relax. Drinking warm milk, sleeping on a comfortable mattress, anything that helps you feel confident, calm and relaxed is useful. If that helps you, fine. But an effort to relax can be anxiety-provoking in some people. And if they are suffering from a major sleep disorder, those techniques are usually not a powerful enough treatment."
 
 
 
TIPS ON GETTING A SOUND SLEEP
 Here are some suggestions for getting a good night's sleep from the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center.
*Sleep on a regular schedule seven days a week. ("You have to have a bedtime," said Dr. Daniel Wagner, a staff neurologist. "Bedtimes and wake times are not just for military barracks or children. They are useful for everyone in keeping sleep predictable.")
*Minimize anxiety-producing activities before bed. For instance, avoid arguments and do not pay bills at bedtime.
*Avoid alcohol and such stimulants as caffeine before bed.
*Do not exercise strenuously for several hours before bedtime.
*Do not eat a big meal right before bed.
*Do something relaxing in the hour or so before getting into bed.
*Consult a doctor if you still feel tired after practicing good sleep hygiene.

HEADLINE: Lost in the Name Game

BYLINE: By BETSY ISRAEL

 BODY:
WHAT do you call someone who is 23? (Or for that matter, someone 31 or 18 or possibly 12?)
Journalists, marketing executives -- many over-30's everywhere -- seem suddenly desperate to know. Each week brings a new round of cute, all-inclusive names, each guaranteed to be the generational logo. And with these pronouncements come handbooks and guides to this mysterious New Youth and many talk-show dissections of New Youth character, as well as polls, profiles, articles -- each offering up the definitive traits of the postboom, pre-millennium set. It's as if half the world had just noticed that many, many people were born during the 1960's and 70's. 
 Despite all the fuss, there's little agreement on who they are, except for this: these people have had it rough. They were the children of Watergate, one reads again and again, of newly employed mothers, absentee fathers and mass divorce. They grew up amid precocious sex and drug use, legalized abortion and possible nuclear annihilation, not to mention those "open" classrooms that may have produced the lowest SAT scores in history. And they emerged from childhood in time for AIDS, an unyielding recession and bad rock music. In their favor, it's generally agreed, they can do five things at once: channel-surf, eat, talk on the phone, listen to music and type resumes for nonexistent jobs. But they can't, determined namers say, concentrate on any one activity for more than five minutes.
The fill-in-the-blanks, we'll call them here. The only American generation without a name. Despite countless "This is it!" claims, they still don't have one.
Few, understandably, want to be known as baby busters (as in "from boom to bust") or baby boomerangs (for boomeranging home to one's parents, or worse, boomeranging back to rob or kill selfish, home-owning baby boomers). Time magazine did not exactly wrap things up with the New Lost Generation. And how excited is the average 30-year-old (minus 10) likely to get about twenty-somethings? Others favor the slightly mysterious Generation X, the title of a sardonic, "Here we are!" novel by Douglas Coupland. Or else slackers, from the Richard Linklater film about severely anomic (yet very witty) young Texans. There's been talk of Bradys, after the venerated television sit-com, and even 13ers, for the 13th generation to come of age since Benjamin Franklin's (advocates concede, however, that being named for a floor that elevators don't stop at might be discouraging -- worse even than being named for an antique television show.)
Gabe Doppelt, the editor in chief of the reconstituted, more youthful Mademoiselle, suggested "Cable Generation, perhaps -- because MTV is just one channel among many." The author Joan Kron wrote in a letter to Allure magazine that "Metamorphs" -- a term she devised with Dr. Grant McCracken -- "really best describes the 90's person who believes that he or she can and must change themselves in order to survive."
So the list drones on: latchkeys; technobabies; videos; boomers-nots; cyborgs; posties; protos (for proto-adults); borders; downbeats; mall rats; nowheres; burnouts; remotes; steroids; junks; "sparse," according to the National Journal, or to quote the columnist Russell Baker, "simply numb."
And there would seem to be as many definitions of whom these chilly labels purport to fit. Neil Howe, who wrote "13th Gen" with Bill Strauss, said, "We are talking here about the 80 million people born from 1961 to 1981 -- that's two related waves: the 60's Atari wave and the later 70's group, which we call the Nintendos."
Bret Easton Ellis, 28 and an occasional "Atari wave" spokesman, claims as peers those born between 1961 and 1971. Donna Gaines, the author of "Teenage Wasteland" -- a study of miserable, forgotten suburban "burnouts" -- defines the "bust" as the 37 million people born between 1965 and 1975. And Business Week has staked out the 46 million born between 1964 and 1975, a group of expert shoppers likely to spend some $125 billion this year.
In fairness to the blanks, a truly accurate group portrait will take years to complete. (By some estimates, the youngest members are now 12.) In the meantime, we can admire this rush to define as a marketing ploy on the scale of D-day. Or we can view it as a weird sort of national sport, a professional name game. Or as something deeper, perhaps what Michael Schudson, a professor of communications and sociology at the University of California at San Diego, called "a means of creating community between people who have lost other forms of identification."
"Definition by birth year," he continued, "is really a phenomenon of the past half century, a time in which people have moved around so rapidly that traditional community, familial or spiritual ties do not hold."
One 19-year-old student, who is (or isn't) blank, put it this way: "People without a name tag on are threatening, and so there's got to be a big push to get that tag. You say, 'Hi! I'm from the dog-bowl era!" They say, 'Fine. Here's your discount dog bone.' Is there some reason we can't just live?"
There is. Isolating and naming population segments help marketing executives and advertisers. Create the idea of a subculture defined by tokens of membership, and you sell more toys, movies and books. "No marketer on earth could have ignored those 75 million or whatever baby boomers," said Barbara Feigen, executive vice president at Grey Advertising. "Obviously that was one of the hugest marketing opportunities of the century. It was imperative to comprehend not only the shared chronological age but the mind-set, the common attitudes, sociology and psychology -- what values that unique group brought to the marketplace."
And the true legacy of the 1960's is the idea that the group is the young group, whether it's a New Generation or a Youth Quake or an Explosion or a New Voice.
Studies of spending patterns have shown that when a large number of people turn 25 simultaneously, sales of big-ticket items -- cars and houses, namely -- start to rise. A large number of American citizens will turn 25 during the next few years. And by "reaching out" to them, advertisers will suck up those at either end of the age spectrum, the too young or just too old. (Remember that the only ones who really said "groovy" in 1967 were either 12 or pushing 40.)
This business imperative intersects an odd cultural one: the need to have (or to prove) generational standing.
During the 1960's, the "core" baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1951), became that young generation largely by reviling the one just before them. And as they aged during the 1970's, and actually turned 30, they extended this generational apartheid in all directions. Consider for a moment the lives of the '58-to-'59 group (late boomers? boomettes? yuppies?), who faced countless loyalty tests: Did they really see the Beatles on "The Ed Sullivan Show," or did they just think they did? Where were they during the invasion of Cambodia? ("Seventh grade" was not, needless to say, an acceptable response.) Since that time, testifying to one's pop-cultural legacy -- a defensive litany of childhood television shows, historic rock concerts or political acts -- has become a competitive fact of life. Americans now carry with them an instant age resume, with the generational label as a sort of cover letter.
So why is it so hard to write one for the blanks? For one thing, because the generational markers, all the identifying cartoons and clothes and shoes, now seem to come and go with greater speed. In fact, as the daily tempo of life has accelerated -- and as advertisers have been forced to seek more finely segmented audiences -- the average ID-card "generation" seems to last as long as most sit-com runs. This high turnover rate has created a huge instant-nostalgia market (Great Love Ballads of the late 70's! Television show themes from the Summer of Love!). It has also made it hard for the blanks to set membership ground rules. There are factions within factions, internal tribes with their own identifying T-shirts. Being asked to wear the wrong one is cause for war.
This age egocentrism was summarized recently by two 30ish men on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times. In a tone of muted outrage, they denounced being dumped with the "twenty-somethings," the grungy miscreants they called the cuspers. Instead they claimed to represent a mini-cohort, born between 1960 and 1964, a "boomlet," inhabited now by boomer manques. Unlikely, as adults, to experience much in the way of "boom" -- the great houses and cars and casual sex -- they would settle, thank you, for a better-looking, slimmer demographic.
Which brings up a second labeling dilemma: who'd want to be part of an age group like Generation X or Baby Bust?
"We haven't done any naming of this group ourselves," said Ms. Feigen at Grey Advertising. "But if we do, it will be from a constructive marketing perspective. These names reflect what these people are not, or else they're a reference to some other group. It's insulting. It's shallow. The names don't show any thought given to who these people are, how they feel about themselves."
Under the circumstances, inclusion in this age cohort might reasonably be viewed less as an invitation, a call to comradeship, than as a punishment. (Labeling is always to some extent a hostile act. Yuppie, originally a socioeconomic designation, quickly became a moral slur, a weapon core boomers used to bash the late arrivals.) Just as no one was ever voluntarily "a yuppie" -- and no self-respecting over-50-year-old would admit to being from the Silent Generation -- few want to sign up to be blank.
"The 13er," said Mr. Howe, the author, "shares with his or her peers the collective sense that everything gets tired by the time it gets to them. There's the very real sense that the boomers -- who were the original 'found' generation -- sucked up too much of the oxygen and now there's not enough left." He continued, "Like the first World War I-era 'lost' generation, the 13ers are a sacrificial generation, a clean-up crew who will have to quietly, on their own, take on the messes previous generations couldn't handle." He added, "And they feel as if they will never get credit for it, that all the attention is going, out of guilt, to the generation after them -- the 'baby on board!' kids born post-'82."
IGNORED until last month or so, blanks seem to have a skeptical so-show-me approach to just about everything. And it's this reticence -- known also as a bad attitude -- that ultimately makes the search for an acceptable name so difficult. To the blank, the entire labeling process is transparent and insulting (imagine being the target audience for "Melrose Place.") In short, the 20- and 25- and 30-year-olds just won't buy it.
They make fun of it.
Playing anthropologists, reporters often cite "Generation X," a novel by the very funny, very blank Mr. Coupland, who is 32. What most quote, however, is not the prose itself but the marginalia -- a glossary of terms like "bleeding ponytail" and "legislated nostalgia" -- included to explain key "X" concepts. (His latest novel, "Shampoo Planet," includes an updated Table of the Elements -- PZ=prozac; OP=opinion poll, etc.)
Even the more serious statements of generational discontent sound like an angry parody of 60's rhetoric. "We are twenty-nothing," declared an unsigned piece in The Baffler, a literary journal published by graduates of the University of Chicago, "forever lost to your suburban platitudes; lost to the simple blather of your TV; deaf to your nonpolitics; hopelessly estranged from your cult of 'professionalism,' the brain-deadening architecture of your office complexes." It added, "Your best and your brightest want nothing to do with you."
This refusal to hold still and be tagged -- coupled with the inability to say exactly who is to be tagged -- has led some to conclude that there simply isn't a new generation out there. Perhaps, as Alexander Star wrote recently in The New Republic, the claim to blank generational status is "a myth -- an imaginary resolution of real contradictions." As Professor Schudson explained, "Most generations have a focal point, a traumatic national or political event or a war. Here, you might argue that the one defining cultural experience of people in their 20's is a splintering effect, a true multiculturalism that's nonbinding."
"What you have is commercials," said one 24-year-old woman. "Rollerblading-across-the-Grand-Canyon wish fulfillments. I don't see any organized role models or beliefs. I mean, 'Wayne's World'? Anyway, I think the idea of generations, as isolated organized groups, is obsolete."
What may be obsolete is the idea that one encompassing label can be applied. "Silent" and "G.I.," attached to generations, cover a lot of identifiable ground. "Hippie," "punk" and "yuppie" refer to increasingly smaller patches.
"The world has changed so much in 20 years," Ms. Doppelt at Mademoiselle said. "The state of flux that kids heard so much about in the late 60's is now pretty much permanent. And younger people have -- as we all have -- this information, all sorts of things, flung out at them, 24 hours a day. The mind has to work in a different way." She continued: "That doesn't make them completely different. At least two generations grew up with TV, so some similarities exist, but you have to be much quicker and direct. There's a different sensibility, both more sophisticated and more straightforward."
Richard Linklater, the director of "Slacker," has tried to describe that sensibility, to say what it is that unites and brands his co-blanks. It's not a political stance or a language or even a coherent fashion statement. As he writes in his book on the making of the film, it's experiencing an "incredible kind of -- what? Dissatisfaction, or total nonbelief in everything, but with an interesting sense of humor and irony about it all."
As generational tag lines go, "the Age of Aquarius" was a lot easier to work with.
 
 
 
A GENERATION DEFINES ITSELF
 "I honestly think that the principal experience of people in their 20's is of being caught behind a defining generation and having to settle for junk culture as a unifying symbol. We couldn't rebel against Vietnam, so we rebelled against disco. We missed the 80's boom and all the good jobs were taken, so we invented this slacker psyche, or in my case went to law school. We should call ourselves the late generation. That's really it. You had the generation of our parents that lived by things with which youth is inexorably associated: hippies and political agitation. History didn't leave us that symbolic youth, so all we got left with was 'The Brady Bunch.' "
Charles von Simson, 28, law student, Brooklyn.
 
"I feel, and most people I know feel, something big is about to happen, and we're excited. Especially coming from an African-American point of view, things are so bad that there is a change that has to take place. It can only go so low and people will take things into their own hands to make things happen. In the riots in Los Angeles, it was basically the young people who were outraged, who were fighting back. You didn't see many older people shouting and outraged. It was the older people who were talking about calm. It is exciting to be young right now because things are so critical. I was talking to a friend of mine who was saying that there is a whole new wave that is going to happen. It's a social wave. It's a new feeling of change, that young people who have seen what has happened to past generations are taking control over what they feel is wrong."
Stacy Highsmith, 21, student, North Carolina School of the Arts, Winston-Salem, N.C.
 
"AT least among my friends, we want to do something that is meaningful and fulfilling and something that we hope is going to make a difference. But at the same time, I think all of us have a desire for material comforts, and those two often don't go hand in hand. And I'm not sure that characteristic is confined to our generation. It may be a predominant characteristic of people in their 20's, in whatever era. I don't think there is a definite characteristic of people in their 20's except that they are trying to decide what to do with their lives, and that is going to cause a certain amount of confusion and angst no matter who you are and what you are doing. To say that my group, as people in their 20's living in the 90's, is somehow different strikes me as a massive overgeneralization."
Ed Yim, 25, assistant to the general manager of the Philadelphia Orchestra, Philadelphia.
 
"DOES slacker mean a good thing or a bad thing? For us, I don't think anyone would think that it is bad. Whereas for other people, the problem is to define us, and slacker just barely gets at what our generation is experiencing. I feel like we have seen people or know people who are disillusioned with the American dream and yet at the same time don't feel ready to give up on it. But they are not going to embrace it in its current state. That leaves us with the problem of change, but it seems like an enormous task to change the way our country works. I feel like we are not sure of what the answers are. And if you don't know the answer, how can you work toward a change? So we are sort of caught in a big muddle of trying to see every side of everything and not being able to move forward."
Rachael McNally, 24, high school teacher and drummer for a band calledSleepyhead, Manhattan.
 
"BARTENDING and substitute teaching are both things that you do when you are on your way to doing something else or you haven't decided what to do. By the time my dad was 27, he had started a family. That's a big step. I have mixed feelings about children, not because I don't like them, but I just feel like there are probably more than enough people on the planet and I don't know if they need one more. On the other hand, there are so many people who are screwed up, maybe you could make someone who could do something good. So there is always the contradiction about feeling good about things and feeling bad about things."
Geoffrey Hill, 27, bartender and substitute teacher, Austin, Tex.

HEADLINE: Volunteers Become Partners In Education

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
AS school budgets are cut and more teacher aides and library assistants are let go, schools are increasingly tapping a valuable source of free staffing: volunteers. Parents, elderly people, business executives and others are donating their time to fill the gaps left as budgets have been trimmed over the last few years.
In Norwalk, for instance, the number of parents participating in the Volunteers in Norwalk Schools program has grown from 1,600 four years ago to about 2,500 today. 
 The program coordinator, Jan L. Fiore, said the program began in 1966 with parents running bake sales and monitoring the lunch rooms. Today, the parents help in the library, run computer seminars and tutor children after schools.
"I think people are turning out in greater numbers because they've become aware that the more parent involvement there is in the schools, the better their children do," Ms. Fiore said. "The message keeps getting out that if you're involved, if you're at the P.T.O. meetings and part of school programs, you're doing your child a real favor." James A. Connelly, Bridgeport's superintendent of schools, said parents at four of the schools have donated their time and the materials to construct playgrounds, valued at about $20,000 each. They also help out in reading, writing and math classes, and after-school programs.
"Parents are becoming a partner in schooling," Mr. Connelly said. "We're feeling our way through the area of parent empowerment. The role for parents is no longer just as a helper, we're sharing decisions on policy and governance of the schools, and I think that's going to grow."
Thomas W. Murphy, a spokesman for the State Department of Education, said that even now, when taxpayers seemed to be scrutinizing every nickel spent in the schools, people were usually eager to help when they were asked. "The issue is not usually getting enough parents involved," Mr. Murphy said. "It's developing a program to use them effectively."
There are, however, a few pitfalls for a school district just starting a volunteer program, Mr. Murphy warned. Schools are required to have certified teachers in the classroom; there are insurance implications for parents or others on school grounds, and school boards must take care not to divert work from union members in violation of a contract. "But schools know enough not to place parents in an inappropriate situation," Mr. Murphy said. "We've had few complaints."
 
Corporate Involvement
 Mr. Murphy said no statistics were kept on the number of school volunteer programs statewide, but he agreed it was rising.
"It's not just parents who get involved in schools," Mr. Murphy said. "There are some enlightened companies that allow employees to get involved in school on the company's time."
Few towns with active volunteer programs calculate how much the volunteer services are worth. But in Madison, Schools Superintendent Peter A. Barile said that his board had asked him to estimate how much time had been donated. "Beyond the P.T.O. and associated activities, we found we averaged more than 5,000 hours at each of the six schools -- almost 30,000 hours in all," Dr. Barile said.
He said Madison has different programs that solicit involvement of parents, businesspeople and elderly people.
"We're trying to run a school without walls," Dr. Barile said. "We want the community in our schools, and we want to extend our schools out into the community. I've been here since 1987 and every year we've built the program up a little more. We've now got some people volunteering 20 hours a week."
 
Schools Return the Favor
 And the school attempts to give something back. Dr. Barile said the schools have, for instance, opened their halls to elderly people for walking during inclement weather. "That's saying to them, 'You help us out in the schools, and we'll help you out.' "
Robert E. McDonald ran a hardware store for 16 of the 20 years he lived in Madison. Now, working with George Greim, another retiree, he coordinates school volunteers.
"People seem to be perfectly willing to help if they're asked," Mr. McDonald said. "The problem is in a lot of areas they're just not asked."
Mr. McDonald said that thanks to older people, bar codes were put on the library books scattered through the Madison schools, in order to computerize the collection. Also, a speakers' bureau enlisted about 70 people available to talk to students on 150 topics.
"A lot of our volunteers are retired people who wouldn't normally come into contact with the school," Mr. McDonald said. "We're trying to broaden the expertise available in the schools. And everyone who volunteers gets a great deal of satisfaction from it as well."
Ellen G. Marano of Watertown agreed. "I get a feeling of accomplishment when I know the kids are doing a little better after I've helped them," Mrs. Marano said.
When 10 percent of the teaching staff was laid off in her hometown last year, Mrs. Marano, a nurse who is taking time off from her career to raise three children, began volunteering three days a week, helping students with English composition, spelling and reading. Some of the elementary school classes have more than 30 students.
"The children can't handle that," Mrs. Marano said. "Starting out, they could use a lot more guidance than one teacher can give to a class of 30 students."
And, she said, her help takes a little pressure off the teachers as well.
"They really need the help," Mrs. Marano said. "Actually, they need more teachers, that's what they need."
 
Checking the Eager Beavers
 Dr. Connelly, the Bridgeport superintendent, said the volunteer programs must be tightly controlled so the school did not encounter more problems than it was solving.
"When a parent volunteer comes into the schools, the administration needs to lay out a few rules," Dr. Connelly said. "There are times when parents try to become involved in areas that would be better left to a professional."
For instance, parents who are not education professionals should not be trying to offer remedial education or counseling, he said. But when parents overstep their bounds, it is usually just a matter of being overeager to help, not that they are intentionally taking on more authority than they should, Dr. Connelly said.
"Once you have a clear understanding of the roles, there isn't a problem," Dr. Connelly said.
In fact, so committed is Bridgeport to the concept of parent volunteers that it recently rented space from the University of Bridgeport to open a parent resource center, where parents can go to learn computer skills, receive literacy training or attend seminars on child rearing.
Even in affluent towns that are weathering the recession better than most, volunteers can be an important part of the school program. Brian A. Fagan, Fairfield's assistant superintendent for instruction, said volunteers were integral to the Fairfield Arts for Youth program. Volunteers also coordinate field trips for the science program.
"It extends what the district is able to deliver in terms of the scope and the richness of the program," Mr. Fagan said.
 
Business Provides Mentors
 Where parent volunteer programs have been successful, some school systems have started to branch out. Norwalk, building on the success of its volunteer program, started a mentoring program in 1986, relying on area businesses to allow employees to give up an hour a week to spend with a student.
Dr. Susan G. Weinberger, who coordinates the program, said it has grown by about 25 percent a year the last few years, and now includes 31 companies. It has been the model for similar programs in 16 other communities, including Las Vegas and one in Canada.
"It began before the budget problems but it's become more important since the problems began," Dr. Weinberger said. "You've got kids coming to school who are not prepared, who have no support at home, and who are ready to drop out socially and academically. We give them someone who's there for them, a positive role model, someone who can excite them about staying in school."
Maura E. Romaine, assistant director of community relations for Norwalk Hospital, coordinates a dozen mentors at the hospital, and is a mentor herself to a third-grade girl in one of the city's 19 schools.
"Some of these kids had such a poor self-image that they would stare at their feet while they talked to you," Ms. Romaine said. "You can see them gaining self-confidence as time goes by, and it gives you a wonderful feeling to be part of that."
Mentors encourage the students to do more of what they do well. The student Ms. Romaine works with draws, and after she came into the hospital to see the different jobs people do there, she became so enthusiastic that she drew cards for all the pediatric patients.
Some districts have used parents and other volunteers for a variety of jobs inside the schools. In Cromwell, where the schools were granted a 1.3 percent increase in the budget last year, the lowest on record, more than $400,000 had to be trimmed, and volunteers have helped the school keep many programs going that would otherwise have been eliminated.
 
Filling In the Gaps
 Jefferson L. Prestridge, the Cromwell superintendent, said the budget that passed, for instance, cut all financing for field trips.
"At the elementary school, parents have completely absorbed that activity, and they spend a lot more time at it than we would be able to do," Dr. Prestridge said. "Parents are very interested in filling the gaps. It's a very supportive community, it's just that financially it's very difficult to support the schools because so many people have lost their jobs. So the parents are looking for other ways to support the schools."
One parent comes in and works with a teacher on the track program, and others help with transportation, he said. "Otherwise, 20 kids would not be able to compete in track."
Another parent comes in early each day to run the chess club. One parent who is an engineer has come in to evaluate the energy management system in the schools, saving hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in consulting fees, Dr. Prestridge said.
Cromwell also has an educational foundation. Each summer, parents park cars and shuttle people to the Greater Hartford Open golf tournament, and put the money in a fund used to make grants for teachers to set up special programs. The effort raised $15,000 last year, Dr. Prestridge said.
"In the past we looked on the foundation's grants as something extra, but now it's a vital part of the school program," he said.
 
Advertising for Tutors
 Taking a cue from the systems where it is working, several schools across the state are starting programs to attract volunteers. Paul Copes, Superintendent of Schools in Bloomfield, advertised in the local newspaper last month seeking volunteers to help with basic tutoring activities. Last year his budget was reduced by 10 percent, or $2.3 million, to below the level it was in 1989.
"I would want parent volunteers in the schools even if there had been no cuts," Dr. Copes said. "The motivation is not strictly financial. It's enriching, for both the students and the volunteers, for this interaction to take place. Parents and other adults provide a different perspective for students. They make the course work come alive, based on their life experiences."
For instance, the president of the employee benefits division of Cigna Insurance Company, which is in Bloomfield, agreed to help teach a course on applied economics. But he had to do it early, at 7:15 A.M., so he would not be late for work each day.
"The students had to get there on their own because our transportation system wasn't geared to getting them here that early," Dr. Copes said. "But we had more than 20 students sign up for the course."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Eugene C. Gavin;
Politics From the New Side of the Aisle

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
WHEN State Representative Eugene C. Gavin, a Republican of Westport, was sworn in recently, he became a member of the largest class of freshmen in the General Assembly in recent memory. One-third of the state legislators in Hartford this year are freshmen and, like most of the newcomers, Mr. Gavin won the seat of a longtime legislator who chose not to run for another term in 1992, Elinor F. Wilber, Republican of Fairfield.
Mr. Gavin, who is 39 years old and a native of West Haven, earned a master's degree in business administration and law degree at Rutgers University, and an advanced degree in taxation from New York University School of Law. He returned to Connecticut after college and, after having held accounting jobs with several large companies, became director of state and local taxes for the Coopers and Lybrand accounting firm. Mr. Gavin discussed issues faced by freshmen legislators in a recent interview in his office in the Legislative Office Building in Hartford. Here are some excerpts from the conversation. 
 Q. There are more new legislators this year than anyone can remember. Is that going to help, hinder or make no difference during the new legislative session?
A. I think it's going to help, and I say that for two reasons.
One is, we went through a big debate over the income tax two years ago. Notwithstanding the heat of that debate the mix of the legislature didn't change that much, didn't change at all vis-a-vis Republicans and Democrats. But many of the Democrats I've met so far have run on the same principles I did, which was to get spending under control, stimulating the economy and creating jobs. It seems to me that, philosophically, many of the freshmen are identical, no matter what their party affiliation.
No. 2, I don't think it's going to be business as usual. The electorate is fed up with politics. I think we're all here to help the State of Connecticut, and I think that's going to be the overriding principle.
Q. Are the freshmen meeting in an informal, nonpartisan way?
A. It's not in a caucus per se but freshmen from both parties are invited to various receptions. The House leader had one at his home, and there are other groups having receptions for freshmen. That gives us an opportunity to talk over ideas. Now, as the session gets underway, we get to see each other, have lunch together, and talk things over. It's a building process. We want to get to know each other. There's an openness, and that's important.
Q. What's the hardest part of being a freshman?
A. The hardest part is you're not used to getting as much mail as you do as a freshman. I normally get a lot of mail, but now I'm getting big boxes full of mail every day, at home and at the office. You really have to be very organized to deal with the mail situation -- it could be constituent questions, invitations to receptions, information on various issues, so you have to read it all.
And I don't think many people are aware of how many state agencies and how many state programs there are, or how many lobby groups there are, like college associations, and business associations. I've even heard from a soda association; I had no idea there was such a thing.
Q. Has there been any pressure by the party leadership to make the new members fall into line?
A. There've been some party caucuses already, and I think the leadership has demonstrated a genuine concern that each of us be able to express our viewpoints on different issues. There's really been no reeling in of anyone, if you will, at this point.
At the same time, I believe that in order to be effective you have to have certain party positions and you have to be loyal to those positions. So there's a balance there. But they haven't been hard-nosed about it, and they've been very helpful in fact.
There's a special caucus coming up, in fact, to unveil some of the mysteries confronting freshmen: What are "go lists?" How can a bill be introduced after the deadline has passed, that sort of thing. The leadership has been effective at helping us get acclimated to a very awe-inspiring environment.
Q. When did you first get into politics?
A. My first election involvement was for the mayoral race in West Haven. I was about 10 years old, and my mother was on the Republican Town Committee and my father was a councilman. I grew up in that political environment. They say politics is a disease, and I have it in my blood -- I just want to make sure it's not fatal to me. I even met my wife through politics. We ran against each other in student government at Fordham University.
Q. What do you think about proposals for term limits?
A. To tell the truth, I have a hard time with term limits. I think elections are the people's means to terminate someone. I have a great deal of faith in the electorate. If someone is doing their job they should be re-elected and if they're not doing their job they should be defeated. We've seen it happen.
I remember when Lowell Weicker was the United States Senator from Connecticut. There was a perception there, apparently, that he wasn't representing the state as well as he could. I guess the State of Connecticut is also forgiving, because he's now our Governor, but that seems to tell me that no elected official can go his merry way, either in a real way or in a perceived way, and not incur the wrath of the people.
Q. It's expected there will be a big fight between the big cities and other municipalities over state financing this year. How are freshmen lining up in that fight?
A. Part of the answer is the revitalization of Connecticut. The decline of our cities happened because the cities no longer remained competitive, competitive with the suburbs and competitive with other states. So the real answer, in my view, is the revitalization of the cities. I think the freshmen legislators are going to be very pro-business, and that's going to help the cities.
Once we bring businesses back to our cities, there will be new jobs, and cities will become more attractive places to live. It's not even comfortable driving through some of our cities, and we have to address it or the problems are going to grow and grow, into the areas around the cities. We have to stop thinking city versus suburbs, and realize the cities' problems are Connecticut's problems. As freshmen I think we have a real commitment to the cities, they've given us a lot, and now they're in trouble and we have to help them out.
Q. Casino gambling is expected to be another major issue this year. What will you bring to that debate as a freshman?
A. I think people want to look at it seriously. It's not a question of introducing casino gambling into the state, Connecticut already has casino gambling, in Ledyard.
And casino gambling is hurting taxpaying businesses like the dog track, jai alai and off-track betting. We have an individual willing to invest $350 million of his own money. Casino gambling could also help our tourism industry. We cannot lightly disregard these conditions.
What the focus of debate should be is, if we permit casino gambling in Bridgeport or Hartford, what are we going to do so we don't end up like Atlantic City, how can we structure it so we can be sure casino gambling gives a jump start to our cities. This might be the impetus to get that going.
The question is, how do we do that? I think, unlike Atlantic City, the revenues should be put right back into the city, to make Bridgeport vital again. We're talking about $340 million a year in revenues, 6,000 new jobs. Part of the plan should be specific designation of the revenues into the cities.
If we do it in Bridgeport, use the revenues from casino gambling to improve the port, to improve the airport, to improve the train system. If it's structured right, the restaurants and hotels outside the casino area will benefit, service businesses and retail stores could benefit. The Governor has said he will veto any proposal for casino gambling. But he's also said the cities are one of his priorities, and I think the case can be made for casino gambling, and if it's done right maybe he'll think differently.
Q. Is the legislature going to cooperate less with the Governor this year because he, as well as legislators, face election in two years?
A. The worst thing that could happen is that, simply because the Governor proposes something, we oppose it because he's the Governor and he's not in "my party." Being a freshman I think I'm a bit idealistic. If the Democrats come up with a proposal that makes sense, I'm going to support it.
Our one goal should be to make Connecticut better. Come 1994, I want to be able to say, "This is my record, here's what I fought for." Hopefully there will be some successes. Let's not go after something simply because of who introduced it. There are a lot of legislators who have different backgrounds this time around, there's a new commitment, they want to bring in a more objective approach as opposed to the party approach.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Drinking In Diluted Stanislavsky, Street People Make a Film

BYLINE: By ANDREW MEIER; Andrew Meier writes for Premiere.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

 BODY:
Last year, 138 people without homes died on San Francisco's streets. One of them was a nomadic Vietnam vet who spoke fluent Sioux and called himself Buck. Though he never got the shrapnel out of his skull or the alcohol out of his blood, he did try to find direction in one of the city's more unorthodox recovery programs.
The program, known as the Tenderloin Action Group, was founded in August 1991 by Rob Nilsson, a local film maker, and it invited anyone to act his way off the streets. Within a year, it had grown into a grass-roots workshop that today is finishing a feature film, "Chalk," a smoky pool-hall drama about a small-time hustler set up for a game he cannot win. Mr. Nilsson hopes that the film, which will cost just under $100,000 to make, will be ready for release late this year. 
 With its unlikely ensemble of novices, "Chalk" is not merely a low-budget melange of "The Hustler," "The Color of Money" and "Mean Streets." Rather, it is a film wrought with detail from the biographies of its cast and dialogue in their own idiom. Mr. Nilsson and his co-writer, Don Bajema, created each character with a workshop member in mind, grafting material from their improvised scenes and their own lives.
The cast might seem a sampling from a census of America's dispossessed, including some people who once led stable, middle-class lives. But to Mr. Nilsson, 52, they are "drifters and dreamers who shared the same conundrums of heart and head that confront us all." Having veered away from home and family to face battles with drugs, alcohol and the streets, these actors discovered a sanctuary in the Tenderloin Group. True, few among them were ever mere bundles on the sidewalk, but fewer still required any make overs, costume changes or De Niroesque stints on skid row to assume their roles.
Mr. Nilsson, a graduate of Harvard and the Peace Corps, traveled his own odyssey to make "Chalk." Nearing 50 as the 1980's closed, he was no longer up and coming. His independent films had garnered praise from Francis Ford Coppola and John Cassavetes and awards in Cannes (for "Northern Lights" in 1979) and Park City, Utah (for "Heat and Sunlight" in 1988). Despite his early acclaim, the director was shunned by Hollywood and forced to distribute five of his six films on his own. (The exception was the 1985 drama "On the Edge," which starred Bruce Dern.) The decade had made him thinner and grayer, a sinewy cross between Chet Baker and Clint Eastwood.
Mr. Nilsson spent the 80's practicing his own guerrilla film making, which he calls direct action cinema. It is modeled, he confesses with obvious adulation, on the cinema verite of Cassavetes. Emphasizing improvisation and character over strict plot lines and big-budget effects, he had lionized the struggles of Norwegian farmers, San Francisco cabbies, a disgraced runner and lovers in the final hours of an affair. But he had yet to touch a subject that haunted him daily.
That subject was his younger brother, Greg. For 10 years he had searched for Greg, who had left the family's home in Marin County and begun wandering around the country. By the spring of 1989, the breadlines in the city's Tenderloin district, seething with the down and out, had filled its seamy sidewalks. Every morning, on his way to edit "Heat and Sunlight," Mr. Nilsson would scan the hungry faces in search of Greg's. "About twice a year," he recalls, "my dad would get a call from some hospital in South Carolina or somewhere: 'We've got your son here. What should we do?' " Mr. Nilsson, too, wondered what he could do.
On the set of "Chalk," it is obvious he has found his answer. "This film's not about homelessness," he makes clear, "but it evolved out of my desire to address the issue." In the summer of 1991 Mr. Nilsson moved across the bay from Berkeley, where he lives, into a transient hotel in the Tenderloin, where he spent months writing a script called "Hope for the Fourth Ace."
"It's about a Vietnam vet and his lottery card that has four scratch-off numbers. A game of reverse Russian roulette." Mr. Nilsson shopped it around furiously, even paying his own way to Cannes, only to be "killed with kindness, not offers." Realizing that the homeless were not likely to attract audiences in the recession, he recruited Danny Glover and Whoopi Goldberg to work for scale. "Then James Olmos, Sally Kirkland and Peter Coyote volunteered," he says. While still hunting for the $4 million needed for financing, Mr. Nilsson and his co-producers, Rand Crook and Ethan Sing, searched for an "auxiliary cast," advertising a free acting workshop for anyone in San Francisco shelters. Each workshop was videotaped.
"That raw footage was bottled lightning," Mr. Nilsson says. "It was a collective human cry. You know why you see guys screaming on the street? Because they're wound so tight. Give them a chemical twist, and a spigot opens." Offering nothing stronger than diluted Stanislavsky, Mr. Nilsson pulled together the makings of a film.
"It struck me one day," he recalls; " 'Don't wait for the money. Use video. Turn the warehouse into a pool hall and use these wonderful actors.' " And so, with four donated pool tables, a bar built by the cast, nearly $25,000 from benefits whose attractions were names like Tom Waits, Gregg Allman and Gena Rowlands, and a $6,500 check from a "local angel," shooting began last June.
Ten months earlier, the Tenderloin Action Group had met for the first time. "That night we were just a brave few, fresh from the streets," remembers Edwin Johnson, who plays Watson, the proprietor of the hustler's local pool hall. Strangers on the streets, they discovered in the workshop that they shared painful histories.
"We're all just folks who ran across hard times," says Sharon Jamieson, a thirtysomething graduate of the University of the District of Columbia who spent six months in shelters before joining the Tenderloin Group. Motivated mostly by curiosity, the homeless trickled down to the organization's headquarters, a leaky warehouse in the city's industrial area.
Once a week, nearly two dozen would-be thespians came together. Ms. Jamieson recalls her elation after the first workshop: "It nourished my soul. I'm not saying I'm gonna be another Whoopi in six months, but it gave incentive to wean myself of the streets."
Few of the participants had acted before. Destiny Costa, a 21-year-old with a history of both alcohol and drug abuse, had been a "witch slash tour guide" in a Salem, Mass., museum. Ms. Jamieson had been an extra in "White Men Can't Jump" and "The Mambo Kings."
Mr. Nilsson, it turned out, was spared searching the Tenderloin for his brother. Greg resurfaced and has a small role in "Chalk" as the pool hall's custodian.
Like Greg, many in the cast have found not only an audience but a family. "On the streets," explains Edwin Johnson, "you know a lot of people. But not one can you call a friend." Although their part-time work on "Chalk" is unpaid pending a distribution deal, many members of the Tenderloin Group have found their lives changed. Disdaining alcohol and drug abuse, and becoming accustomed to keeping a schedule, they have now managed to find jobs and, at the least, rooms of their own.
"Chalk" has also proved to be an esthetic adventure. "I wanted to let them mine their own experiences and emotions," Mr. Nilsson says. "There was a lot of kindergarten rote reading at first, so we just found another skein to travel along." The director was careful to guide his actors away from self-indulgence, toward self-exploration. "Rob's different with each of us," Ms. Costa says. "He may be teacher, mentor, brother or father. But he gets us all to open up."
Mr. Nilsson's evolving role falls uneasily on his shoulders. "I'm not an acting teacher," he says. "I trust feeling over acting. My job is just a bit of midwifery."
Yet with an anthropologist's allegiance to authenticity, he kept his writerly impulses out of the script. "People on the street talk like no one could ever write," Mr. Nilsson says with a laugh, quoting one of the Buck's mantras: "Ain't no woman gonna bleed my best thoughts."
The director concedes that in the move from the workshop to the film, "a few got away." One was Neil, by all accounts a natural leading man, but a heroin addict unable to shake the habit.
Though Neil remains in the film in a smaller role, his departure forced Mr. Nilsson and Mr. Bajema into a major rewrite. "I cast one of 'Chalk's' two professionals, Kelvin Han Yee; and our African-American lead suddenly became Asian," Mr. Nilsson says. And filming began on schedule.
Mr. Nilsson is determined to screen "Chalk" nationwide as a testament to his cast. (A New York distributor, Arrow Entertainment, has expressed interest in the rights.) For Mr. Nilsson, the workshop is not enough. "This is not about process," he insists. "I'm an artist. I believe in leaving an artifact behind."

HEADLINE: How Milosevic Stole the Election

BYLINE: By Douglas E. Schoen; Douglas E. Schoen, a partner in the New York polling firm of Penn & Schoen Associates, managed Milan Panic's campaign for the presidency of Serbia.

 BODY:
Milan panic, the American businessman turned Serbian politician, flew to Nis last December not knowing what to expect. He was coming to the town, an industrial center in the southern part of Serbia and a stronghold of President Slobodan Milosevic, for the first major rally of his campaign for President of Serbia. The hope was that at least a few thousand people would turn out.
Initial signs were not encouraging. The Mayor told him not to come, factory managers said they would not receive him and there had been too little time to organize supporters. But when Panic pulled up to the Ambassador Hotel at 3 P.M. he was speechless. There in the town's main square, chanting his name rhythmically and eagerly awaiting his appearance, was a crowd of more than 20,000. 
 "When I began this campaign I was not a politician," Panic told the crowd. "But with this enthusiasm, you can now consider me a professional politician." If he won on Dec. 20, he promised, he would end the stranglehold the Communist Party had held on the country for better than 40 years, work to end the civil war in Bosnia, promote democratization and implement free-market economic policies. He also promised higher taxes and greater unemployment, as state industries were privatized. His economic proposals, while unconventional and potentially disruptive, were greeted with thunderous applause -- in a country where unemployment exceeds 60 percent.
Three weeks before the Nis rally, I had come to Serbia at Panic's request to help develop strategies for the campaign. While I had spent the last 15 years advising candidates, including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Mayor Edward I. Koch in New York, and worked in 18 different countries, nothing prepared me for what I ran into. In all my previous experience abroad, which included work in countries like the Philippines, Bolivia and Panama, there had always been some basic sense of fair play. Naively, I kept thinking Serbia would be the same, or close to it.
THE OUTPOURING OF support in Nis represented something of a vindication for me. I had told Panic three weeks earlier that he should run for President and that he could win. This put me in a distinct minority among his local advisers, who believed the incumbent Communists (they now call themselves Socialists) would never allow themselves to lose an election.
Panic had returned to his native land in July at the invitation of Milosevic to serve as Prime Minister of what was left of Yugoslavia (Serbia and the very much smaller Montenegro). Milosevic had clearly hoped that Panic would legitimize his Government and provide cover for the ethnic cleansing and territorial expansion the Serbs were supporting in Bosnia. But Panic, whose avowed goal was to end the fighting in 100 days, quickly came to believe that Milosevic was the principal obstacle to peace in the region. Panic repeatedly called on him to resign, both publicly and privately, but got no response. He concluded that his only recourse was to mobilize the opposition for the elections.
After reviewing what appeared to be credible poll evidence, I told Panic that Milosevic had lost the confidence of the Serbian people, that the electorate wanted change and that, despite his having returned to Yugoslavia only five months earlier, that he was more popular than the incumbent. I encouraged him to run and indicated that he had better than a 1-in-2 chance of winning the election.
If there were any bias in the polling, I assured him, I presumed it would tend to overstate support for the incumbent authoritarian Government and understate support for the powerless opposition. On the basis of this, Panic agreed to run if the necessary 10,000 petition signatures could be collected in the two days remaining before the filing deadline.
Having worked on petition drives in the United States, I was skeptical that this could be done. Nevertheless, an army of young volunteers -- looking like something out of central casting -- scurried around and gathered not 10,000 but 40,000 signatures before the deadline. I was ecstatic. I was convinced that Serbia would swing inexorably to us as Russia had to Boris Yeltsin, Poland to Lech Walesa and Czechoslovakia to Vaclav Havel.
Once again, the Serbs in the campaign were markedly less optimistic. In different ways, they warned me not to be too encouraged by the poll results. "Don't expect the Socialists to roll over and play dead," one former Tito associate said to me. "They will try every trick in the book."
I said sternly: "Look, I've worked in elections around the world. No leader whose resignation is supported by more than half his electorate can be re-elected. Milosevic is finished." The man smiled and walked away, shaking his head.
FOR PANIC'S RUN, WE DECIDED TO combine the best-remembered aspects of President Reagan's 1980 campaign and President Clinton's 1992 campaign. We asked Serbian voters if they were better off now than they were two years earlier, when Milosevic was elected, and we ran on the economy, with the slogan "Promena Sad" ("Change Now").
When Panic incorporated these elements into his announcement of his candidacy, I was convinced we were on a winning track. But immediately there were problems. The announcement got virtually no coverage on state-run Radio Television Belgrade, the only electronic-news organization that covers the entire country. Its 30-second voice-over report dwelled primarily on the fact that the declaration took place at the American-owned Hyatt Regency.
More ominously, state-run radio and television -- long notorious as instruments of the regime -- began an unremitting assault on Panic, describing him as a traitor to the Serbian people and an agent of the American Central Intelligence Agency. The attacks began the night of Nov. 30 and continued in one form or another for the entire campaign. Still, that night a tracking poll showed Panic with a comfortable lead of eight percentage points.
I brought the results to Panic's villa, expecting him to be pleased. Instead, he was raging about the television coverage. "R.T.B. has just spent 27 minutes attacking me," he said. "There is no way we can win if they keep doing this." I tried to reassure him that we were still leading substantially in the polls and predicted that we would pull further ahead when our own television commercials started. He just shook his head.
Again, I was overly optimistic. Radio Television Belgrade next told us it would broadcast our commercials only after Panic's candidacy was certified by the Serbian electoral commission, which naturally was controlled by the Socialists. Still, I assumed this would be a formality. After all, Panic was the Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, one of the most popular people in all of Serbia and a certifiable hero for making a fortune in pharmaceuticals in the United States.
But I was wrong.
Almost immediately, the commission declared Panic ineligible because he had not been a legal resident for a year prior to the election. The residency requirement had been tagged onto some legislation in early November.
It was not until Dec. 9, with half the 18-day campaign past, that the Supreme Court of Serbia overruled the commission, putting Panic on the ballot. In the meantime, he was subjected to scathing nightly attacks on Radio Television Belgrade, without the opportunity to respond.
Nor was that the end of the matter. The channel refused to run any Panic commercials until it received official notification of his certification. Moreover, the certification had to be received by 3 P.M. for that night's broadcasts. I was not really surprised when the paper work arrived at 3:30.
With the active campaign ending Dec. 17, we had only a week to make our case to the people. But still, I felt we had a powerful message. We produced an ad that started with a picture of Milosevic, asking whether he had really improved the quality of life and the economy. The commercial showed bread lines and gas lines, as well as shots of ordinary Serbs with looks of desperation. It concluded with footage of Panic promising voters a healthy economy, peace and a more democratic society.
The ad never ran. Radio Television Belgrade barred it as too critical of the incumbent regime. I was incensed and told our advertising representatives to do whatever was necessary to get the ad on the air. They removed all references to Milosevic, but kept the shots of bread lines and economic decay. Again, the channel's officials refused the ad. But they said they admired it, so much so that they believed Milosevic was certain to be defeated if it ran. For days, the only commercial we were able to run was a biographical spot on Panic.
Curiously, to me, my Serbian colleagues seemed relieved that the negative commercials did not run. "You have to understand," the finance chairman finally explained. "If we lose, you will not be here Dec. 21 to face the consequences, but we will."
Enough happened during the campaign to convince me that their fears were justified. We assumed every phone was bugged. Some campaign volunteers were just too good to be true. They spoke fluent English and Serbian, had professional degrees or training and had unlimited time to devote to the campaign. They sought no compensation for their efforts. A number of comely young women came forward eagerly volunteering to be my "personal assistant."
While I rejected all these offers, there still were serious leaks. One night, for example, a journalist with Radio Television Belgrade came to our table in one of Belgrade's most fashionable restaurants and complimented us for television spots that had not yet been produced. Panic said half-seriously that the channel probably reviewed the scripts before he did.
Given that there was no expectation of privacy or confidentiality, I conducted one phase of our campaign very differently from the way I normally would. Instead of holding poll results in confidence, I publicized them as widely as possible. We did this to assure voters that Panic was a serious candidate who could actually win.
This credibility was crucial. In every survey we conducted, Panic held a narrow lead over Milosevic. Yet when the pollsters asked voters who they thought would actually win the election, a 4-to-1 majority believed the incumbent would prevail. We needed to convince people they were not alone in supporting Panic.
Going into the last few days of the campaign, virtually every survey showed either a dead heat or a slight Panic lead. The technical end of survey research is relatively far advanced in Serbia and there was little reason to believe that the surveys were flawed. We concluded that, despite our extremely limited access to the press and the very short campaign, we would either win a clear majority on the first ballot or that there would be a runoff with Milosevic, if the minor candidates should siphon off enough votes.
On Dec. 17, the last day of campaigning, Radio Television Belgrade devoted close to four hours to Milosevic's final campaign rallies while making only passing reference to Panic's closing rally in Belgrade, which was attended by more than 150,000 people. Radio Television Belgrade actually pre-empted many of Panic's final paid pre-election commercials to give more free coverage to Milosevic, leaving the Panic campaign with a substantial credit after the election.
WHILE PANIC was encouraged by the enthusiastic support he received from the Serbian population, he was bitterly disappointed with the United States and other Western nations. While Panic could not afford to seem too close to the West, he at least needed a concrete declaration that sanctions would be lifted if he were elected. Yet, no support was offered.
The United States did take one step that, regardless of the merits, proved to be politically disastrous for Panic. Just as the campaign was ending, Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger labeled Milosevic a war criminal for his role in fostering ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. This comment served to isolate Serbia and to allow Milosevic to portray himself as a victim of Western aggression and the only figure strong enough to stand up to American imperialism.
Moreover, the Eagleburger comment -- which included the menacing words that someday, somewhere the United States would get Milosevic -- had to strengthen the dictator's resolve to win the election by any means necessary. The prospect of death by hanging is not something that will typically encourage a despotic leader to loosen up.
On top of that, there were pathetically few outside election observers. The absence of international pressure, particularly from the United States, allowed the Serbian authorities to bar European poll watchers until two days before the election, making observation of the voting very difficult. Milosevic responds to real pressure. That's what got him to the Geneva peace talks. So why didn't we insist on free and fair elections? Why did we stand by meekly while Milosevic stole the election?
The manipulations actually began before the election, when voters who had not participated in the spring elections were systematically purged from the rolls. Sounds innocent enough, until you consider that the opposition boycotted the spring elections. To be reinstated, voters had to go to a central location to check their status and then wait as long as three or four hours at state bureaucracies to register. Needless to say, thousands of people did not even bother to try.
On polling day, from 5 percent to 10 percent of all voters were turned away by state authorities, according to monitors from the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. This figure was confirmed by our exit polling. The interviewers agreed that the vast majority of those who were turned away were younger voters, whom polls showed to be strongly pro-Panic.
Students, who supported Panic overwhelmingly, were required to be at their universities on Dec. 20 in order to register for subsidized housing for the next term, thus making it difficult for them to get home to vote. Ethnic minorities, who make up about 20 percent of the Serbian electorate and many of whom are living with relatives outside Serbia, faced waits of four to eight hours at border crossings on election day. Pre-election polls showed that these voters favored Panic by a margin of better than 10 to 1.
Despite these obstacles, an exit poll of 1,371 voters interviewed at a randomly selected sample of 60 Serbian polling places showed Milosevic and Panic tied at 47 percent. In the capital, between 80 and 90 percent of the voters said they had voted for Panic. Nevertheless, early official projections showed Milosevic with more than 55 percent of the national vote and Panic with around 33. They also showed us losing virtually every polling place in Belgrade.
I could go on. The point is, the Serbian election was a fraud. The great tragedy is that, with a little outside pressure, Milan Panic could have won, possibly ending the most barbaric conflict Europe has seen in half a century. In this election, we were all losers.

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
When Country Life Gets on Their Nerves

BYLINE: By Michael S. Malone; Michael S. Malone is a writer based in Los Altos, Calif.

 BODY:
THESE days, when successful executives grow tired of the corporate rat race and dream of retiring into a life of rustic simplicity, one of the places they eye most longingly is the Northwest, especially Oregon. Land's cheap. Traffic's almost non-existent. And the casual life style looks like an appealing break from the pin-striped boardroom world they know.
But for many of these newly minted country squires, retirement soon looks a lot like the work they left behind. 
 Take Georges C. St. Laurent Jr. In the late 1960's and 70's, he made his fortune through Longwood, Fla., holding companies that developed commercial properties and shopping centers and from his ownership of the Sterno Companies in Tenafly, N.J.
"My life," he recalls, "was one of shooting back and forth in the corporate jet all week long. I never stopped."
Then, in the early 80's, he did stop. Recognizing both that "the capital gains rate was the lowest I thought I'd see in this century and that income and commercial property in Florida was overpriced, I decided to sell as much of my property as I could." Coincidentally, as Mr. St. Laurent was conducting this liquidation, Colgate-Palmolive approached him about taking over Sterno.
Says Mr. St. Laurent, "All of this occurred within a period of 18 months. So here I am in 1985, have just turned 50, with a lot of liquid assets and nothing to do. My wife, Eleanor, and I decided to take a look at where we wanted to live and the life style we wanted to have. We liked Oregon especially, because during the period we were looking, the population was actually decreasing. We found a cattle ranch in the Rogue River Valley near Eagle Point, and moved."
Mr. St. Laurent didn't realize at the time that he was part of a trend. The small towns of the Oregon coast and the Rogue Valley, have become the home of numerous urban expatriates, most of whom are in regular contact with one another. Grants Pass, the nearest city of any size to the 4,000-acre St. Laurent ranch, even features its own little Left Bank of bohemian top execs.
Charles H. Newcomer (yes, he is sick to death of the jokes) is one of them. A former developer and retailer in Los Angeles, he moved to what had been his 200-acre summer home in 1989. "Yeah," he says, "we all know each other. St. Laurent was down here the other day. I guess there's probably more millionaires per capita here than in most cities. We love to swap war stories about the old days. We've all got a lot in common."
One of these shared experiences is the brevity of their retirements. "A lot of these people come to retire and get away from the hectic life style," says Jennifer Kong of the Oregon Economic Development Department. Then they realize it's a mistake.
That's certainly what happened to Mr. Newcomer: "I went fishing twice, walked in the woods 10 times -- and realized that retirement wasn't for me."
So he went back into business -- albeit with an Oregon flavor. His company, Northwest Precision Plastics, employs 100 people and makes specialty injected plastic products -- for electronics and medical equipment and toys. A recent offering is a water gun devised by two local bankers and a financial consultant who like to raft on the Rogue.
Mr. St. Laurent, meanwhile, first set out to avoid the winding mountain roads. "I hired a veteran helicopter pilot, bought a helicopter and spent the better part of the year getting myself rated," he said. "After that I started using the helicopter as my primary mode of getting around the state."
He had no plan of ever going back to work, but made a small deposit in his local bank, a Western Bank branch in Eagle Point, and, as was his custom, having been a board member of Sun Banks in Florida, he asked for a copy of the bank's balance sheet.
"It turned out to be a nice independent bank," he said. "It'd had financial difficulties in the early 1980's and its publicly traded over-the-counter stock was languishing at half of its book value. It struck me as a buying opportunity." Before long, Mr. St. Laurent owned 5 percent of Western Bank's stock. "Then I basically forgot about it."
Two years later, in 1987, while the St. Laurents were in London, Mr. St. Laurent learned that giant U.S. Bancorp wanted to gobble up Western. "I rushed back, studied the situation, and realized that I didn't want Western Bank to go away," he said. By the time of the shareholder vote, Mr. St. Laurent had 18 percent of the stock. He blocked the sale.
Soon thereafter, he was appointed to the bank's board, and within a year was chairman and chief executive -- "and asking myself what I'd gotten into." The bank was not very profitable, it had problem loans, assets were just $300 million. "But I wanted to see how I could be more productive . . . In other words, I was bored out of my mind and wanted to get back into action," Mr. St. Laurent said.
Six years later, Western Bank has assets of $600 million, 38 branches and capital of more than $50 million (up from $16 million). Non-performing loans have dropped from 6 percent outstanding to less than 0.2 percent. Last November, Forbes Magazine named it one of the 10 best small banks in the United States.
"I don't really work that hard," Mr. St. Laurent claims, and describes a typical day sounding like a different century: "I spend a fair amount of time at the ranch. I get the hands together in the morning for instructions and then head on down to the bank."
Like many of Oregon's other bucolic barons, Mr. St. Laurent has strong feelings about the world he left behind. "I see what's happening in the Northwest as the fifth major migration in U.S. history," he said, referring to the flight from cities and suburbia. "This time," he added, "it's technical people who can move their skills and capital to a place that is safe and comfortable."

HEADLINE: More and More Teen-Agers Crowd Shelters in New York

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TROY, N.Y.

 BODY:
It had been a busy night at the shelter; a suspected crack dealer and his family were asked to leave, a mentally ill woman announced that she had just miscarried, though she had not been pregnant, and a shelter worker had told a new arrival, just out of jail, that he could not carry a weapon during his stay.
Amid the confusion, two 16-year-olds sat at a table in the shelter discussing music, Red Hot Chili Peppers versus Tracy Chapman. At first glance, the teen-agers seemed out of place. But at Joseph's House in Rensselaer County and other shelters around the state, teen-agers, many of whom have been abused, have become an increasing presence. 
 Across the state, people who run homeless shelters said they have been slowly overwhelmed by a growing number of young people seeking shelter. Far needier than the classic rebellious runaways seeking adventure, these young people have put new and special burdens on a system that can barely handle the more common problems of homeless families and the mentally ill.
Some shelters that are open to all homeless people "are now almost 100 percent kids," said Shelly Nortz, who heads the New York State Coalition for the Homeless in Albany. "By far the most common thing we hear about homelessness in the recession is that kids are taking over shelters or living in cars and breaking into churches to keep warm."
Advocates for the homeless attribute the change not just to the added economic pressures on families but also to a more general failure of public policy to prevent the wholesale destruction of families and a new awareness among young people that they do not have to tolerate abuse.
While no statistics are available on the number of teen-agers now living on the street or in the state's patchwork of public and private shelters, the advocates say teen-agers are the fastest growing group of homeless people in both New York City and the state as a whole. Elsewhere across the country, shelter providers said they had also noticed an increase in the number of homeless teen-agers, but nothing like what is being seen in New York.
"There's a whole brand new devastating situation," said Richard Dina, executive director of Children's House Inc., in Mineola, L.I., which runs three youth shelters and has seen the number of homeless teen-agers it serves increase by 100 percent from about 225 to 450 over the last three years.
"A few years ago they came to us and you got them right back with mommy and daddy," he said. "Now a lot of them don't have a family base to go back to, so we can't work on getting them back to their families; we have to work on getting them on their own."
In both policy and practice, dozens of people who work with homeless teen-agers said, state government has failed to respond to the change. The state's Division for Youth Services, they point out, will spend $5.3 million on services for homeless teen-agers this year, the same amount it has spent every year since 1990.
And despite an official policy that foster children must have a safe place to go when they are discharged, a number of those working with teen-agers contend the reality is far different. Specifically, these advocates for children say, every time the state sends a child back to an untenable situation at home it is effectively putting the child on the street.
 
Denied Public Aid
 On a local level, a number of county welfare workers still operate under the assumption that these teen-agers can go home again, routinely denying them public assistance, the advocates say, particularly when they came from middle-class families.
Advocates fear that pending legislation supported by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo would dissuade young people from applying for the meager help now available: The budget bill would require those under 21 who receive general assistance to live at home unless there is a specific finding of abuse, and then the state would be required to sue the parents to recover money spent on welfare payments.
Although runaways have traditionally flocked to New York City, smaller cities, suburbs and rural areas are now seeing large numbers of homeless teen-agers who have been abused or kicked out by parents who could no longer afford to support them. Most have not run far and are wholly unprepared for life on the streets.
One 16-year-old who has been at Joseph's House for a month said he still did not consider himself homeless, and he enthusiastically rattled off the names on the labels in the designer clothes he received through a local charity.
"I was thinking about going to Mexico, because I had enough money for a one-way ticket," he said. " I was going to just keep on walking and go to Belize and get robbed by gringos and just experience life in some dangerous places, and get a tan."
He is not the same teen-ager who left home five months ago after he said his mother tried to stab him with a letter opener and subsequently wore out his welcome with relatives and friends, and spent the $500 he had saved from a paper route on cheap hotels. Since then he said he has learned not to trust anyone.
Though he does not smoke, he carries cigarettes to avoid fights with people who ask him for one. He so fears catching a disease that he wears gloves when he shakes hands.
"I've proven I can take care of myself on my own," he insisted, but demurred when Sharon Svolos, Joseph's House program director, asked him when he would like to move into the apartment she had found for him. "I've been thinking, I'm going to be tired tomorrow," he told her. "Can I move on Monday?"
 
Sharing Lessons Learned
 As a 16-year-old girl at the shelter described her history of sexual abuse by her father and stepfather, she drew geometric figures in a notebook and chewed on a fingernail. But when an older shelter resident sat down and began to complain that he was unable to panhandle enough change to buy a pack of cigarettes, she sat up straight and shared a lesson learned.
"Never ask for money for cigarettes," she told him authoritatively. "Don't ask for food, either, or they'll take you out and make you eat." She said she left home because her mother tried to stop her from attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.
Over time, the business of surviving not only hardens the young, but also drains the life from them. Some already appear to have lost all hope for the future.
"Every county we go into is seeing a huge increase and saying, 'What do we do with these kids?' " said Tom Schmitz, director of human services for the Salvation Army's Empire State Division in Syracuse. "Most of them don't have programs."
Rather than sleeping in subways or on city streets, many of the young people in rural areas camp out in the woods, sleep in abandoned railroad cars or move in with friends.
"Across upstate New York, we see them banding together in what I call adolescent families, with four or five of them living together in a trailer as a way to cope, and maybe the oldest one working at a marginal job to pay the rent," said Joseph Walker, executive director of Catholic Charities of Delaware and Otsego Counties.
In suburban areas, they often hang out in malls until the stores close, then sleep in a car or a train station or spend the night with a friend, said John Harper, executive director of a Friend's House, a 13-bed shelter for teen-agers that opened 10 months ago in Middletown in Orange County.
Residents in a number of small towns have started noticing teen-agers sleeping in parks or walking the streets all night. In Norwich, a town of 8,000 in Chenango County, ministers and elected officials formed a committee and collected donations to help find a place for homeless teen-agers to stay. Because the area has no homeless shelter, the county houses some of them in its public nursing home.
But most of these teen-agers refuse that option. "It's not a place you would want to be," said Harry Grant, a retired sales manager who began volunteering full time with the teen-agers three years ago. Working out of the Broad Street United Methodist Church, he delivers food and furniture in his blue pickup truck, and visits youths who call to tell him they are lonely.
 
Problems of Being Too Young
 Even when teen-agers find their way to a homeless shelter, they have a difficult time finding their way out; they have trouble finding permanent housing because they are too young to sign a lease or qualify for public housing. Teen-agers have trouble qualifying for public assistance because welfare workers must first get in touch with their parents, who are still legally responsible for them.
"The first thing the caseworker's going to do is call mom or dad, even though the kid says they've been abusing them," said Colleen Pawling, a lawyer with Neighborhood Legal Services in Buffalo. "The parent is never going to tell a county official that Susie can't come home again, so they're denied" benefits. A successful application by a teen-ager, she said, can take as long as six months.
Deborah Adler, a spokeswoman for the New York state Department of Social Services, said that under state law, teen-agers receive benefits immediately if caseworkers find that their parents' home is unsafe.x
Middle-class teen-agers generally have an even harder time convincing county workers that their parents cannot provide a stable home, the advocates said.
After the percentage of teen-agers in their shelter climbed to about 85 percent, Joseph's House in Troy began a follow-up program last year to help young shelter residents apply for benefits and find permanent housing. In many cases, they lack the maturity and patience that a housing search requires, Ms. Neitzel said, and their past experiences have not made them particularly easy to help.
Not far from the shelter, in a downtown storefront that has been converted into a studio, four formerly homeless young people call their new home the "Hell House of Pain," because each has a history of abuse. But they said they had at least found housing and companionship, and they are Ms. Svolos's success story.
"We get along good in this house; we talk through our problems every day," said a 16-year-old girl who sleeps on a couch in the crowded studio she shares with a young man who is clinically depressed, his brother who has refused treatment for skin cancer and a young woman who until recently had been living in her car. "We're kind of like a family, I guess."

HEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE HONES ALL-OUT CAMPAIGN TO SELL SACRIFICE

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Opening a week that his advisers say could be the most important in shaping his Presidency, Bill Clinton is seeking to sell his economic program with one of the most intensive public relations campaigns ever staged from the White House.
Mr. Clinton will deliver his first televised address from the Oval Office at 9 Monday night as part of an elaborate buildup intended to set the stage before he presents the package -- with its mix of unpopular spending cuts and tax increases -- to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday. 
 White House officials said they borrowed the idea of the Oval Office address from former President Ronald Reagan, who during his third week in office made a plain-spoken public appeal for his tax-cut plan before taking it to Congress.
 
Political Stakes Are High
 But they concede that Mr. Clinton, though his party controls Congress, has a harder sell than Mr. Reagan, who was championing tax cuts, not unpopular tax increases. The political stakes are particularly high for Mr. Clinton because he made the economy the centerpiece of his election campaign.
For much of the weekend, Mr. Clinton was closeted with his top economic advisers to fine-tune the plan. While the overall effort has engaged hundreds of people in the White House, Federal agencies and the Democratic National Committee, Mr. Clinton is as comfortable with economics as many experts in the field, and his advisers said he had not consulted much beyond his economic team and members of Congress.
His involvement in reviewing the plan line by line is strikingly different from that of Presidents Reagan and George Bush, who both left such details to their budget directors.
 
Limits on Health Spending
 Today, Administration officials confirmed reports that they would probably impose limits on health spending and medical prices. "Some kind of cost controls are going to have to be implemented in order to make health care reform work for every American," Leon E. Panetta, the Director of Management and Budget, said on the CBS News program "Face the Nation."
But Mr. Panetta backed down from his position during his confirmation hearings that $2 should be cut in spending for every $1 that taxes are increased. Saying "we recommended that as a target," Mr. Panetta added that the plan had "to be balanced between spending cuts and revenue increases."
The basic program will contain short-term measures to stimulate the economy and a long-term effort to trim the deficit. Officials said the stimulus package would probably include an increase in Federal spending this year by $16 billion and $15 billion in tax breaks for businesses.
To reduce the deficit, there is expected to be a broad-based energy tax; a tax on perhaps 85 percent of the Social Security benefits of the wealthiest retirees; an increase in the top individual tax rate to 36 percent from 31 percent, and an increase in the top corporate tax rate to 36 percent. Among other provisions will be cuts in the payments made to doctors and hospitals under Medicare and deep cuts in military spending.
Developing a political strategy to win public support for the plan is as critical as the policy itself, White House officials said. They said the public support was needed to counter the lobbyists who are already gearing up to fight elements of the plan.
 
'He Could Get Chewed Up'
 "It would be a tremendous embarrassment if he couldn't get this through because, theoretically, he has the partisan support in Congress," said Martin P. Wattenberg, a professor of political science at the University of California at Irvine. "But theory and practice don't always go together, and if there's not enough public pressure on this, he could get chewed up by interest groups."
Monday night's speech is to last about 10 minutes and will be a "scene setter," as one speech writer put it, at which the President will try to win over the public by explaining what happened to the American economy and why people should make sacrifices. The details will be saved for Wednesday. Monday's address will be carried live on the major television networks, including CNN and PBS, and on the ABC, CBS and NBC radio networks, National Public Radio and Mutual Radio.
This has been a week given over to both economic strategy and salesmanship. During one six-hour session at which they reviewed budget options last week, Mr. Clinton and his top aides did not take a dinner break and instead ordered several pizzas. The same group was back in the Roosevelt Room tonight, as they have been virtually every day this week.
 
Campaign-Style Tour
 While Mr. Clinton has already devoted speeches, two radio addresses, numerous meetings with Democratic lawmakers and his first televised town meeting last week in Southfield, Mich., to preparing the public for his economic plan, White House officials said his offensive was far more involved than anything the image-conscious Reagan Administration took on.
The President is expected to pitch the plan in interviews on television networks, to travel to the Midwest and West Coast in a campaign-style tour, and he has scheduled sessions this week with Republicans from the House and Senate to try to win their support.
Members of Mr. Clinton's Cabinet have also been enlisted; members will travel to their home states on Thursday to carry the message.
On "Face the Nation" today, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, offered a preview of what opponents will say about Mr. Clinton's package. "It's the same old tax and spend, not a new idea that I can think of, unless they're keeping something back until he gives his address to Congress," he said.
Anticipating such criticism, Mr. Clinton has summoned a constant stream of lawmakers to the White House for consultations. Though he seeks their advice, White House officials said the meetings were also intended to give the members the feeling that they have not been steamrolled.
 
'Will Shape His Presidency'
 "It's very smart," said Representative Dan Glickman, Democrat of Kansas, one of several members who met with Mr. Clinton on Saturday. "What he wants to do is avoid a situation where congressmen run out after the speech and say, 'We don't agree with X, Y and Z.' It was not a patronizing session at all. He was taking things down as we were talking."
White House advisers said that after an often bumpy start in office over the controversy about lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military and the disputes over his candidates for Attorney General, Mr. Clinton needs to convince the public and Congress that his biggest priority is the economy.
"What we're doing politically is to build the sense that this is big," said Rahm Emanuel, the White House political director. "You'll hear a thousand excuses and a thousand reasons from the special interests why it's good -- but . . . The only answer is that this is a challenge to change the status quo and the business as usual thinking."
Stanley Greenberg, Mr. Clinton's poll taker, called the address on Wednesday "the speech that will shape his Presidency." Saying that people want the President to succeed, he said, "I think people are desperate for a new direction and vision."
As part of the effort, the White House sent top economic officials to appear on the Sunday television news programs to deliver the same orchestrated message that has come from the Administration for days: that the plan will be fair, but will require sacrifice from all Americans.
 
Emphasizing the Cuts
 To convince the public that Mr. Clinton has done his part, his surrogates, whenever they can, are mentioning the cuts announced last week in the White House staff and at Federal agencies -- cuts that are minuscule in the scheme of the entire Federal budget.
The speech Wednesday night is also viewed as crucial in getting the public, and the Congress, to swallow the plan.
His advisers said the President believed that in order to appear credible he had to lay out many specifics in his speech Wednesday. "They want it to be specific," Mr. Greenberg said. "If it's smoke and mirrors, he's going to lose them."
At the center of the effort, of course, has been Mr. Clinton, who for the last several days has convened his top economic advisers around a long wooden conference table in the Roosevelt Room in the White House.
Several participants described the intensive meetings on the condition that they not be identified. Mr. Clinton presides over the sessions from the middle of the table, often drinking diet cola or decaffeinated coffee.
The group usually includes these people: Mr. Panetta, Vice President Al Gore; Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the White House chief of staff; Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury Secretary; Roger C. Altman, the Deputy Treasury Secretary; Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers; Ronald H. Brown, the Commerce Secretary; Alice M. Rivlin, the Deputy Budget Director; Robert E. Rubin, head of the National Economic Council; his deputy, Gene Sperling, and George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director.
Asked how important the package was, one official recalled the sign in the Clinton campaign headquarters that reminded workers that the economy was the central issue. "Remember that famous sign?" he said. "This is the promise to redeem it."

HEADLINE: CHRISTOPHER MAPS A LOW-KEY AGENDA FOR MIDEAST VISIT

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Warren Christopher will make his first trip as Secretary of State to the Middle East on Wednesday, carrying exceptionally modest "talking papers": he will propose neither a new negotiating framework nor a bold strategy to bridge differences, but he will do what he always does first and says he does best -- meet all parties face-to-face and listen to what they have to say.
Unlike James A. Baker 3d, who as Secretary of State in the Bush Administration initially saw the Middle East as a no-win proposition and let the parties come to him for the first two years, Mr. Christopher decided that it was crucial to reinvigorate the Middle East peace negotiations and that he should go to the region himself.
 
His Three Goals
 But if he does get the talks going again, he will be building on a foundation Mr. Baker laid after the Persian Gulf war reshaped the political landscape in the Middle East. 
 There are three reasons for the eight-day trip, senior Administration officials say: to establish personal relationships, to signal that Washington is serious about playing an active role in reviving the moribund peace talks and to assess the commitment of the parties to sustained and serious negotiations.
"The trip itself is really the first step in reinvigorating a process that has been in deep freeze since last summer, when the Bush Administration essentially stepped out," said one senior Administration official.
 
A Longtime Strategy
 Mr. Christopher has never hidden his negotiating strategy. "Careful listening may be the secret weapon," the 67-year-old lawyer who was Deputy Secretary of State during the Carter Administration, said in a 1981 speech, an approach he has displayed in his initial dealings with lawmakers and foreign officials in the last three weeks. "We all have to assess our own strengths and shortcomings, and I observed some time ago that I was better at listening than at talking."
Senior Administration officials say that the background music he will hear on this trip will be a lot sweeter because of a complicated diplomatic move in the United Nations Security Council on Friday.
They say proudly that behind the scenes, Mr. Christopher paved the way for a successful visit with a furious flurry of personal diplomacy to push aside the obstacle that stood in the way of serious talking: the fate of 400 Palestinians banished by Israel to Lebanon.
"We were quite frankly dead in the water as long as this situation was deadlocked," a senior official said.
First, Mr. Christopher persuaded Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel to agree to a complicated formula under which it would take back some deportees now. But that gesture was not enough to satisfy the Palestinians, who vowed to boycott the peace talks until a Security Council resolution demanding the immediate return of all the deportees was fulfilled.
 
A Lobbying Effort
 So Edward P. Djerejian, the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, began 10 days of intensive meetings with Israeli and Palestinian officials, while Madeleine K. Albright, the United States delegate to the United Nations, worked the Security Council.
With Ahmed Snoussi, the chief delegate from Morocco and this month's president of the council, Mr. Christopher and his aides pressed the Security Council to put its stamp of approval on the United States-Israeli deal, and on Friday the council urged the Israelis to take back all 400 Palestinians and called on the Palestinian delegation to return to the peace table.
Prime Minister Rabin welcomed the resolution, not least because it has no enforcement provisions, and said on Saturday through a spokesman that the resolution brought the deportation issue "to its conclusion."
But Hanan Ashrawi, the spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, dismissed the resolution as "another attempt at bailing Israel out."
Even if the Palestinians do not agree to come back to the formal negotiations, Mr. Christopher will meet with their representatives during his trip, which will take him on its first leg to Israel, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
 
Stakes May Be Low
 In that sense, he may have nothing to lose by going. But he may not have much to gain either. The crucial test is not whether he is credited for getting the Israelis out of a muddle of their own making, but whether he can help bridge the fundamental gaps between the two sides.
There is one question officials do not seem eager to answer: with war in the Balkans, American troops still in Somalia, tension with Iraq, a possible trade war with Japan and a tinderbox in Russia, why the push now in the Middle East, which does not involve an immediate strategic interest?
During his Senate confirmation hearings, Mr. Christopher said "helping Russia demilitarize, privatize, invigorate its economy and develop representative political institutions" was the most important security challenge facing the United States in the 1990's. And last Friday, after his first meeting in Washington with Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of Japan, he echoed what Mr. Clinton had said the day before and called Tokyo "the most important partner of the United States."
So why is it not more important to go first to Tokyo or Moscow?
In responding to this question, senior Administration officials say that after his tour of the Middle East, Mr. Christopher will stop briefly in Geneva to meet Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia to prepare for a summit between Mr. Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin. "Kozyrev was not just an add-on," one senior Administration official said, indicating the importance of that meeting.
On the way home, Mr. Christopher will meet North Atlantic Treaty Organization foreign ministers in Brussels, where war in the states that used to be Yugoslavia will top the agenda.
 
Seizing the Moment
 But scrape away the official explanations and officials acknowledge other factors at play. The Clinton Administration inherited the Arab-Israeli negotiations from its predecessor, and it would be blamed for missing a chance for peace if it allowed the talks to founder.
More important, they say, it gives Mr. Clinton a chance to display what he calls an "aggressive" style of preventive diplomacy to deal with problems before they blow up and engulf him. One paradox of his Administration's foreign policy is that the Middle East, long a caldron of seething tensions and hatreds, seems predictable, compared with Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, Iraq and elsewhere.
"We were left with an awful lot of messes from the previous Administration that we had to get on top of," said one senior official. "We had to do an awful lot of cleanup. Now the Administration wants to look to put its imprint on foreign policy and get ahead of the issues. And if there is anywhere preventive diplomacy is called for, it's the Middle East."

HEADLINE: Commission Rejects Great Lakes Flood Plan

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TORONTO, Feb. 14

 BODY:
A plan involving dredging and the construction of flood gates to control water levels on the Great Lakes would be too costly and do little to curb flooding and erosion, a report to a commission overseeing American and Canadian waterways said today.
The study for the International Joint Commission recommended instead that the governments buy shoreline property where possible, insure that new developments are outside flooding range and use existing water controls more effectively. 
 The report is expected to bring protests from property owners, particularly on the shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, where water levels are near record highs. Residents have been demanding flood controls since 1985, when high water levels combined with severe storms to cause hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage. The commission will hold public hearings in several cities, including Buffalo, next month.
Levels of all five Great Lakes could be regulated, the report said, but that would cost as much as $3.6 billion, which, it said, would be "neither economically efficient nor environmentally acceptable."
The flow from Lakes Ontario and Superior can be controlled now, but there are no controls on the middle three lakes -- Huron, Michigan and Erie. Property owners support a proposal to blast rocks to increase the flow from Lake Erie.

HEADLINE: For Foreigners, Pitfalls Abound

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: QINGYUAN, China

 BODY:
Despite a surge in investment and optimism about its economic prospects, China remains a difficult place for foreigners to do business.
American Standard, which made the Chinese President's whirlpool bathtub, says it is now making money at its joint venture in this small southern city, 40 miles north of Guangzhou. But in its first few years it lost money, and like other American ventures it faced an army of unexpected challenges. 
 Transporting goods is a constant headache in China, for trains and ships are often booked up and roads are jammed with trucks. It can take up to six weeks to ship toilets the 700 miles to Shanghai from Qingyuan, which is near Guangzhou.
Banks in this city do not know what traveler's checks are, so they don't accept them. When company executives first inquired about opening a letter of credit, a routine form of payment, the bank had never heard of such a thing. Another problem is the current shortage in the supply of dollars at the official swap centers. This may crimp imports and make it costly for companies to convert local currency profits into dollars.
 
Friction With Partners
 Disagreements and friction with Chinese partners in a joint venture are common. Here at American Standard, executives say the previous Chinese joint-venture partner bogged down decision-making with bureaucratic second-guessing and complained that the Americans were spending too much money when they went out for hamburgers in the hotel coffee shop.
Finding able employees can also be difficult, a legacy of four decades of lax standards at state-owned companies. Some employees sleep, gamble, drink or fight on the job, and the company had to dismiss an employee who would not stop playing cards when he was supposed to be working.
Then in December, city officials told American Standard that it would no longer be able to use ground water. Instead, the factory would have to tap into city water, with a connection fee of $18,000 in addition to monthly charges. The officials were approaching all the joint ventures and state enterprises in the city to propose water connections, and executives thought it had more to do with a need for money than a water shortage.
 
'The Hidden Costs'
 "The hidden costs of running a joint venture are very high," said Ronnie Y. Cheong, a soft-spoken 40-year-old Singaporean Chinese who is head of American Standard's factory here. "The problems will get more serious. They will have to find more ways of making money."
Local officials are not the only ones trying to extract extra money. The Singer Sewing Machine Company's joint-venture operation in Guangzhou receives three to four letters a month from big Chinese department stores that stock Singer's products. The announcements inform Singer that they are planning store-wide promotions and would appreciate "any assistance" -- meaning $500 donations.
"You have to pay," said Jeremy Watson, Singer's general manager here. "How can you not? I call it a tax, in brackets."

HEADLINE: Encouraged but Still Wary, Union Leaders Gather

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAL HARBOUR, Fla., Feb. 14

 BODY:
Gerry and Jack, Rich and Al, and Lane, Morty and Moe, all stalwarts of the once-mighty House of Labor, have every reason to gloat after 12 years of Republican administrations that these men, some past 70, found the most hostile they have ever known. Suddenly, there's no one to hate.
"Look at what happened!" Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, cheered to hundreds of union officers on the eve of their annual winter gathering. That only three of the 32 A.F.L.-C.I.O. union presidents, Mr. McEntee among them, endorsed Bill Clinton in the primaries a year ago has been lost in the pro-labor hints and pronouncements from the new Administration. 
 But the joy many union officers feel after President Clinton's first weeks in office could wane Wednesday night, when they assemble before big-screen television to hear Mr. Clinton's address to Congress and find out more of what he means about the shared sacrifices of higher taxes and cuts in Government programs. They are wary about issues like how far he will go to keep jobs from fleeing south of the border, something unions expect from the trade agreement with Mexico and Canada.
 
A Time of Testing
 And for the unions themselves it is a time of testing. For years, they have blamed Ronald Reagan and George Bush for their shriveling membership, to just 15.8 percent of a 1992 work force of 104 million. That unions survive at all is remarkable, says Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
"We've maintained our membership in a most extraordinary combination of adverse circumstances," he said.
But the decline actually started in the 1950's, when more than a third of the work force was unionized. The question that always arises here is whether the leaders have lost touch with the troops. Only one of the presidents here is a woman, two are black, and most are in their 60's and 70's. In the growing services and retail industries, which account for nearly half the work force and have many women and blacks, less than 10 percent of the workers belong to unions.
 
Doing the Right Things
 But for now, the important thing to Big Labor is the Democrat in the White House who has been doing most of the right things. He reversed two of Mr. Bush's campaign-year executive orders that weakened unions. He appears committed to lifting President Reagan's ban on the hiring of the air traffic controllers whom he dismissed for striking 12 years ago. And he has promised to support legislation barring employers from dismissing strikers.
"We don't expect any President to be a rubber stamp," said Jack Sheinkman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union. "We got the change we wanted."
Only a year ago, Mr. Clinton was the seen as the slick and blow-dried yuppie from the conservative wing of the Democratic Party and a state historically unfriendly to unions.
Yuppie? Mr. Kirkland considered the word and replied, "I don't regard that term as applying to him."
 
His Trust Isn't Blind
 Moe Biller, president of the American Postal Workers Union and a supporter of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's noncandidacy last year, is about as skeptical as the leaders come. "He seems to be trying," he said of Mr. Clinton. "Trust him? At this point, yeah. But I don't put blind trust in anybody."
Here, Big Labor and the Democratic Party seem to be speaking with the common voice of the New Deal era. Labor says it wants what Mr. Clinton wants -- a revved-up economy, jobs, job training, health care. "I feel very good, very positive, very encouraged by the actions I see them taking," said Lynn Williams, retiring president of the United Steelworkers of America.
Mr. Williams said he was stunned to see the President go after the drug companies: "That was a long time coming, seeing a President stand up to the pharmaceutical industry and their indefensible price increases."
The unions have also been astonished to find in Robert B. Reich, whom few would have endorsed for the job, a Labor Secretary who behaves as if he is Mr. Clinton's top economic adviser.
 
Saying the Right Things
 Much as they would like it, people here say they do not expect Mr. Reich to build a Department of Organized Labor. "But the issue is, do they think unionization is good for workers?" said Jo-Ann Mort, spokesman for the clothing and textile workers union. So far, he has been saying all the right things, like supporting an increase in the minimum wage, now $4.25, and endorsing an extension of unemployment benefits before the unions even asked.
Indeed, rather than bicker with the Government, unions have begun bickering among themselves. They think the White House might just start taking their agenda into account. So for the first time in years, they risk discord among their memberships' sometimes divergent interests.
For example, Ron Carey, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, would just as soon scrap the trade agreement. Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America, says the unions here will probably acknowledge that they are stuck with it. "But there has to be financial assistance," he says, for workers who lose jobs to Mexico.
On raising the minimum wage, they appear united in wanting it lifted to its traditional level of 50 percent of the average wage, now about $11.75, an increase to about $5.35. Mr. Reich has said he supports a 10 percent increase, to around $4.70 but has not indicated whether that might be just a first step.
A labor ally in Congress who is here seems ready for more. Representative William D. Ford of Michigan, who heads the House Committee on Education and Labor, said: "The idea of anything less than $5 makes no sense. I don't know of any part of this country where anybody could subsist on less."
For at least as long as the love feast lasts, unions say they are willing to join the President in his appeal for sacrifice. But are they prepared to swallow tax increases for their members?
"Sure!" said Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers. "You can't turn things around with just the richest people."

HEADLINE: Hope Undimmed, Voters See Jobs as True Test for Clinton

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, Feb. 14

 BODY:
 A winter wind gusting across the parking lot of a sprawling General Motors plant concentrates the mind, so the men and women hustling in and out for the afternoon shift change are succinct in their politics.
Nannygate may have launched a thousand newspaper columns in recent weeks, but there is little doubt here about the main event and the big test of the Clinton Presidency. "Keep the economy going," said John Adkins, 52 years old. "Keep us going. Keep us in a job." 
 This is reality-check time in American politics, and it is filled with opportunities and risks for the new President, judging from interviews with more than three dozen voters around this bellwether region, where former President George Bush and Mr. Clinton struggled fiercely for the loyalties of the Midwestern heartland. Opportunities because many voters here, unlike the pundits, are reluctant to declare the honeymoon over. Factory workers, retired people and homemakers talked unapologetically about their hopes that Mr. Clinton would, this week, begin to address the nation's economic problems decisively.
 
'I Think He'll Try'
 "You have to give him time," said Phyllis Pursiful, a 45-year-old food-service worker at the University of Dayton, after acknowledging and setting aside a few misgivings of her own. "I think he'll try."
Opportunities, as well, because many people talked with unusual, if grudging, acceptance of new taxes. The 1992 Presidential campaign in general, and the candidacy of Ross Perot in particular, seems to have left people with a sense that the deficit has to be tamed -- for the good of everyone. "I think he's doing the best he can with what he's got to work with," said Juanita Erbaugh, who runs a small day-care operation. "I think we'd have taxes no matter who got in."
But there are risks for Mr. Clinton as well here. Hopes are fragile. The cynicism that fueled the 1992 campaign is just below the surface, and people are holding Mr. Clinton to his promise of tax "fairness."
"I think he should tax the real rich," said Jessie Bigler, who turned out on a frigid Saturday afternoon for a senior citizens lunch at the local Democratic club. Viola Fearing, a friend, chimed in, "The real rich," and a few minutes later added, "I also don't think all those big shots in Washington should get raises all the time."
 
People Are Nervous
 Up at the front of the Democrats' hall was a huge, heroic portrait of the man invoked more than once when people talked of the challenge facing Mr. Clinton: Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Montgomery County, which includes the city of Dayton, was an extremely competitive area in last fall's election. Mr. Clinton ultimately eked out a very narrow victory over Mr. Bush with Mr. Perot a respectable third. The Dayton area is heavily reliant on General Motors, which has about 20,000 employees in the region, and on Wright Patterson Air Force Base, which employs about 27,000. While unemployment has run below the national average, the vagaries of the defense and automobile industries elsewhere keep people here nervous.
"One of the reasons for that," said Robert Premus, an economics professor at Wright State University here, "is that this region had a series of major plant closings back in the 70's and the early 80's. We're talking plants taking out 5,000 jobs at a clip. I think people were concerned they'd have more of the same."
Wesley Wells, president of Local 775 of the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers, also argued, "In this valley, we've got people concerned about where their kids are going to work, what kind of jobs they're going to get."
For all these reasons and more, Mr. Clinton's promise to preserve and rebuild the manufacturing job base is taken very, very seriously here. Don Rich, who works at General Motors and heads his local union's political committee, argues that the good-paying manufacturing jobs that were once a solid path to the middle class are simply less and less available. "There's nothing a kid from high school can go to now," Mr. Rich said, noting that the average age at the G.M. plants was now in the late 40's. "An inner-city kid just doesn't have a chance."
 
Willingness to Give Time
 This sense that the problems in the economy run deep works to Mr. Clinton's advantage with many voters. For example, Larry Newberry, another auto worker, dismisses the early negative reviews of Mr. Clinton's performance, demanding, "What can a person do in -- what's he been in, three weeks? four weeks? We've had 12 years of being sold down the river, and I think two or three weeks is not going to make much of a difference."
Moreover, Mr. Clinton's carefully orchestrated buildup to his economic address has gotten through: "Cutting the White House staff was an important first step," said Suzanne James, a home health-care aide in Dayton, who urged the President to move on quickly to cutting Congressional benefits.
But Mr. Clinton's backtracking on campaign promises has also gotten through to many voters, and while many are tolerant, some are not.
"He should do what he promised," said Betty Shaw, a 62-year-old retiree shopping at the Wright-Patterson commissary on a busy Friday afternoon. "He promised the middle class they would get a tax cut and there would be jobs. I've been a Democrat all my life, but I don't think I've ever been as disappointed."
And even some committed deficit-cutters, like Bill Cheslock, a guidance counselor who said he had voted for Mr. Perot, voiced skepticism that the revenue raised by new taxes would really go toward balancing the books. "If I were convinced it would go to the deficit, it wouldn't bother me," Mr. Cheslock said.
 
People Are Ready
 For all of that, most people interviewed seemed convinced that the nation needed dramatic economic medicine, although they were pleased that Mr. Clinton had virtually ruled out a freeze in Social Security cost-of-living adjustments.
"He'd better not touch that," said Millie Klepinger, 80, as her friends nodded assent.
People seemed ready for something big. "We think there will be taxes, but I think he's going to try to get things under control, don't you?" asked Wanda Crum, who also works for G.M.
The district's Congressman, Tony P. Hall, a Democrat, said he sensed the same anticipation throughout the area. Back in Dayton this weekend, Mr. Hall told a reporter that Mr. Clinton would set the tone for the rest of his Administration in the next 10 days. The sense of moment is, indeed, strong.
"There is hope here," Mr. Hall said. "There's an anxiety, a nervousness, an anticipation. They're waiting. This is what they voted for. They want change."

GRAPHIC: Photos: "I think he's doing the best he can with what he's got to work with," Juanita Erbaugh said of President Clinton. Mrs. Erbaugh, who runs a small day-care operation in Farmersville, Ohio, is shown with her charges Logan Riley, 5 months old, and Bethanie Jacobs, 5 years; Bill Cheslock, a guidance counselor from Minister, Ohio, voiced skepticism that the revenue raised by new taxes would really go toward balancing the books. He held his daughter, Kara; Larry Newberry, right, an auto worker at the General Motors plant in Dayton, Ohio, dismisses the early negative reviews of Mr. Clinton's performance, demanding, "What can a person do in -- what's he been in, three weeks? four weeks?" He stood next to Wanda Crum, a co-worker. (Photographs by Mark Lyons for The New York Times) (pg. A12)

The Economy 
 President Clinton is seeking to sell his economic program with one of the most intensive public relations blitzes ever staged from the White House. He will deliver his first televised address from the Oval Office tonight as part of an elaborate buildup intended to set the stage before the package is presented to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday. [Page A1.]
This is a time filled with opportunities and risks for the new President, judging from interviews with more than three dozen voters in the Midwest. Unlike the professional pundits, many voters are reluctant to declare the honeymoon over. [A1.]
Union leaders will be watching the President closely after years of exclusion from Republican administrations. [A10.]
The Clinton economic plan will trumpet spending for education, job training and public works as the key to building a richer nation. But these investments could prove a big gamble, since the public may not see the benefits for years -- if ever. [D1.]
American corporations have mounted an offensive, attacking the White House plan to increase the corporate income tax by asserting that it collides with the President's goal of stimulating investment and jobs. [D1.]
Central New Jersey, a hub of the pharmaceutical industry, is feeling pressed by the campaign to contain health costs. [B1.]
 
International
Regional trade agreements are providing a big spur to Latin America's economies. The accords also drop tariffs for overseas trade, sharply expanding markets for U.S. companies. [D1.]
China has finally begun to generate an industrial revolution and the nucleus of a middle class eager to buy foreign products that used to be unavailable to the nearly 1.2 billion people within Chinese borders. [A1.] The Clinton Administration has begun to review trade policies toward China, but does not expect to reach any decisions for a month or two. [A6.]
Giat Industries of France won a $3.5 billion order for battle tanks from the United Arab Emirates. The losing bidders are General Dynamics and Vickers P.L.C. of Britain. [D2.]
OPEC's oil ministers began talks on reducing oil production, with small and large producers disagreeing over what constitutes equitable burdens. [D4.]
Kodak is sharply curtailing its research activities in Japan, seeking voluntary resignations and telling college students it had agreed to hire that there would be no jobs for them. [D4.]
 
Companies
Foodmaker Inc. has canceled plans to open 85 restaurants this year, citing declining sales following news reports of food poisonings at its Jack in the Box fast-food chain. [D1.]
This is the time of year that makes or breaks gross revenues for seed companies like Pioneer Hi-Bred International. [D1.]

The Media Business

HEADLINE: A Season for Selling Seeds to Sowers

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JEFFERSON, Iowa, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Until his wife phoned with the news that their pickup truck had skidded off icy State Highway 4 into a ditch, Lindsey Larson had been happily reminiscing with Dan and Sue Tronchetti about their high school days. They had also been chatting about last year's bumper crops of corn and soybeans, and what he planned to plant this spring.
Mr. Larson's wife was not hurt, but he was anxious to help her get the truck back on the road. So he set his coffee cup down by the plate of cookies and quickly signed a check for the seed he was buying this year from the Tronchettis. "You fill in the amount when you get it totaled," he told Mrs. Tronchetti. 
 Except for the blank check and quick exit, the visit had been business as usual for the Tronchettis during Pioneer Days, the sometimes hectic but always convivial week in February when they and several hundred other Midwestern farmers who sell Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc.'s seed do a large chunk of their business. For Pioneer, the industry leader in seed, and for most of its rivals, this is the time of year that makes or breaks gross revenues.
 
Hybrids by the Hundreds
 "The farmer has quite a selection job," said Robert N. Wisner, a grain marketing economist at Iowa State University. "There are hundreds of different hybrids." Among the considerations for each corn variety: strength of the stalk; resistance to rot, insects and diseases; length of growing season, and the time it takes the ears dry after harvest.
Pioneer, which derives 80 percent of its sales from corn, has maintained a strategy of investing heavily in the development of premium products and then charging premium prices. That approach faltered during the 1980's when rivals seemed to be narrowing Pioneer's average-yield advantage, but the company has regained momentum in recent years.
"Our sales are up 30 percent this year," said Dan Tronchetti, 36, a farmer himself and now in his second year as a dealer, too. Besides Lindsey Larson, his customers include Lindsey's father, Duane, who stopped by to pay for his own order and ended up staying for lunch. Lindsey's brother, Loel, would come by later the same day.
"We even have an Asgrow dealer who's going to plant 100 percent Pioneer this year," Mr. Tronchetti added, referring to the Asgrow Seed Company, a unit of the Upjohn Company.
So far, 1993 looks like another prosperous year for Pioneer, despite the uncertainty for corn prices after last year's record harvest, which the Agriculture Department estimated at nearly 9.5 billion bushels.
Farmers here in central Iowa had record yields in 1992, and several Pioneer seed lines ranked among the most successful. Dealers say many farmers are now increasing the amount of Pioneer seed they plan to plant. Last year, the company estimates, its market share grew to 38.7 percent from 36.7 percent.
Other big seed companies are also expanding their business, mostly at the expense of smaller rivals. Corn is the nation's largest crop and, unlike hard wheat and others, cannot be produced at high yields from seed retained from the typical farmer's crop. More than 200 companies are involved in the business of distributing new seed corn each year, many of them small regional companies that repackage seed bred by others.
Most dealers, meanwhile, view seed sales as part time, and only the most successful net more than $30,000 a year from the business.
 
Warmth in the Warehouse
 The seed deals may be closed in a dealer's kitchen or parlor, in a storefront, or in an office set up in a corner of a warehouse like the huge metal shed the Tronchettis have rented on the outskirts of this town, an hour's drive northwest of Des Moines.
In nearly every case, the surroundings include a liberal supply of coffee and soft drinks, baked goods and other treats, and a comfortable space for neighbors to visit with each other and the dealer before any money changes hands.
"This is one of the few days we heat the warehouse," said Mr. Tronchetti, guiding a visitor past high stacks of corn and soybean bags to tables with snacks, Pioneer gifts and displays of awards to farmers who achieved yields of 200 bushels an acre last year.
Most dealers have a wide range of "thank you" gifts, from small items like pens and soil thermometers to green Pioneer jackets with the company logo. The Tronchettis give some away immediately and are raffling others.
At the storefront Pioneer dealership run by Clarence A. (Hap) Springer and his wife, Ruby, a few blocks away in the center of town, Mr. Springer shakes his head over the proliferation of gifts.
"You got to count on spending $5,000 to $10,000 on giveaways," Mr. Springer said. The Springers were the sole Pioneer dealer in this town for nearly 40 years, until the company allowed the Tronchettis to open up, after their negotiations to buy the Springers' farm supply store collapsed. Mr. Springer said that he has lost a handful of customers to the Tronchettis but that overall business was up.
Some farmers will spend a couple of hours socializing before completing their business in a few minutes. The Springers' store encourages such activity by the prominent location of a long, cushioned church pew Mr. Springer jokingly calls "the liars' bench."
 
Seed Money
 The deals seem to get more complicated each year. Farmers may till land owned by as many as 10 landlords -- retired locals, banks, corporations, out-of-state investors -- under a variety of cost-sharing arrangements. They may spend as little as $500 for five bags of a special variety of corn they want to test on 15 acres, or tens of thousands of dollars for hundreds of bags, each with 80,000 seeds.
Most also order soybean seeds at the same time, although not necessarily from Pioneer. Asgrow has been the longtime leader in soybeans. Pioneer, which entered that business only 15 years ago, says it is challenging for the top position, and dealers use the rising discounts based on total purchases to encourage customers to buy both types of seeds from them.
Mr. Tronchetti also keeps a sample bag of Pioneer alfalfa seed just outside the office door to remind his neighbors that the company sells more than corn and soybeans.
 
Promotions Elsewhere
 Other corn companies also have seed days and promotional events to close sales, many timed to come just before or after Pioneer Days. Dekalb Plant Genetics, the second-largest corn seed company, this year renewed a tradition by having some dealers organize lunches and presentations by company agronomists to small groups of farmers.
The Northrup King Company, which is neck and neck with ICI for third place in corn seed sales, calls its events Good Farmer days and typically concentrates them in March. Northrup is a subsidiary of Sandoz Ltd. of Switzerland, and ICI is owned by ICI P.L.C. of Britain.
The flood of checks now coming in is the end of a long selling process that actually began last summer, when farmers got a look at how their crops were doing. That is when they began to chat informally with dealers about what they might like to use the next year.
 
Field Work
 Such courtship gets more serious during harvest. Some dealers make it a point to visit customers in the fields. Mr. Springer, who gives his age as "over 70," likes to hitch a ride in combines to get first-hand impressions.
While Dan Tronchetti and his brother, Barry, harvest the family's crops, Sue drives out to customers' fields with a $7,000 weigh wagon that she and her husband bought at Pioneer's suggestion. The wagon gives customers an immediate reading on the productivity of Pioneer and other varieties, while Sue gives out candy bars and soda.
The fall is also the time when farmers get a look at the results in test plots, where side by side grow existing varieties and new seeds that Pioneer and other companies are considering marketing.
 
Ordering Early
 These days, with farmers getting much quicker and more complete information on the yield of their crops, many are willing to decide what they want for the next year within weeks of completing the harvest. Increasingly, orders are placed and even settled by early January. Pioneer is encouraging the trend by giving a 7 percent discount to orders completed by "year-end," which worked out to be Jan. 4 this year.
The key discount, though, is the 6 percent one that runs through Pioneer Days. After that, a farmer gets only 2 percent off full price for buying by early April. Other major companies compete by offering slightly better rates or slightly later closing dates.
The major thrust of the seed companies is to get farmers to buy earlier, said Mr. Wisner of Iowa State. That, along with the decline in the number of farmers and the increasingly businesslike approach of the survivors, may slowly be undermining the social and economic significance of events like Pioneer Days.
"The pace of life, even here in Greene County, has changed," Mr. Tronchetti said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Gambles on Plan For Federal Spending

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
The economic plan that President Clinton introduces on Wednesday will trumpet spending for education, job training and public works as the key to building a richer nation, his aides say. But these investments could prove the biggest gamble of his Presidency.
The reason: the public may not see the benefits for years -- if ever. 
 Though these spending plans could put thousands of people to work quickly in highway construction or other projects, many experts say it will be 5 to 10 years before the measures produce a noticeable pickup in productivity and competitiveness, which is their underlying aim.
President Clinton is keen to spend more to help poor children by expanding Head Start, for example, but it will be a decade or more before these children enter the labor force as skilled workers. Similarly, it is likely to be a decade before an ambitious nationwide computer network is in place, enabling laboratories and businesses to communicate better and lower their costs.
 
Short-Term Impact
 Many Americans will no doubt want to see a tangible return on this spending soon because Mr. Clinton plans to increase investment by such a large amount -- aides say $140 billion to $200 billion over the next four years. Indeed, the bold promises of investment that helped elect Mr. Clinton in 1992 might come back to haunt him in the 1996 Presidential campaign if he has nothing to show for them by then.
"We can expect a payoff on these investment projects, maybe in four to six years," said David A. Aschauer, an economics professor at Bates College who is an expert on public-sector spending. "But a four-to-six year time horizon poses a serious political problem -- it's not conducive for voters to re-elect this Administration."
Some experts assert that many projects will never pay off at all. If big payoffs were feasible, they say, business would already be doing the spending.
If the economy grows at a strong rate through 1996, voters will probably not question Mr. Clinton's program. Many Americans will simply conclude that the program has worked, even if growth has come for other reasons, like increased exports.
But if the economy inches along slowly and unemployment remains high in 1996, Americans will probably scrutinize the spending plan and ask, "Where's the beef?"
Mr. Clinton then might have to use all his political skills to convince the public that the investments are not futile. The President, economists say, will have to tell Americans not to expect a short-term fix for economic problems decades in the making, like inadequate job training, crumbling bridges and overcrowded airports.
"America knows these problems have been accumulating for 15 years," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said in an interview. "There are no magic fixes, no magic bullets."
To justify his spending plan, the President is expected to explain how increased investment is essential for generating faster growth and higher living standards. In the view of many economists, the slowdown in American investment helps explain why American living standards are growing so slowly and why American industry has lost so much ground to its German and Japanese counterparts.
"By the decade's end, Japan and Germany were investing more than 12 times what we spend" as a percentage of their output "on roads, bridges, sewers and the information networks and technologies of the future," Mr. Clinton said during the Presidential campaign. "To reclaim the future, we must strive to close" this "investment gap."
 
For the Children
 In his inaugural address, Mr. Clinton called for sacrifice -- including consuming less today to allow more public and private investment for tomorrow -- to build a brighter future for America's children. With this in mind, the big economic question is whether Mr. Clinton can persuade Americans -- who in the 1980's seemed addicted to feel-good oratory and living beyond their means -- to wait for long-term results.
"What he has to say to people is, 'I'm doing this for your children. They're the ones who are going to be the beneficiaries,' " said Herbert Stein, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Richard M. Nixon.
According to Administration officials, Mr. Clinton's economic plan will include spending on airports, bridges, highways, high-speed railroads, pollution-fighting equipment, sewers and an information network linking computers across the nation.
But many people, especially conservatives, are skeptical. "The idea that there are huge returns to infrastructure investments just waiting to be plucked is wrong, in my opinion," Allan Meltzer, an economics professor at Carnegie-Mellon University, said.
Speaking about computer networks and pollution equipment, Mr. Meltzer added: "If these projects had a fast payback, you wouldn't need the Government to come in and do it. Businesses would be rushing to do it."
There is another side to Mr. Clinton's investment plan, one calling for better education and job training. This effort will include sending all poor children to Head Start day-care programs, providing more for public schools and creating a nationwide apprentice program to teach skills to students who do not go to college.
"Fully funding Head Start or immunizing all children -- these things have a payback," Mr. Reich said. "There is a huge public payback in terms of higher productivity and lower social costs, but those paymakers are not immediate, some do not come until these children are teen-agers or even later."
 
Realistic Expectations
 Administration officials say some aspects of Mr. Clinton's investment plans will provide quick returns, while others, like plans to build high-speed trains, might not produce results until well into the next century.
Beyond the issue of time, many economists worry that a Government prone to pork-barrel politics will choose projects with dubious payoffs. Critics conjure up images of six-lane highways into the hills of West Virginia.
Mr. Clinton's plan to spend far more on job training should in theory make tens of thousands of workers more productive within a year or two -- and these workers and their companies should feel the return on that investment fairly soon.
Repairing roads also should produce quick results. "Fixing potholes means fewer broken axles, less wear and tear on tires and fewer alignments," said Roger E. Brinner, chief economist for DRI/McGraw Hill, an economics consulting firm in Lexington, Mass. "That should help drivers in Boston and truckers on interstate highways."
But how soon these things will translate into a one-tenth of one percent increase in productivity or economic growth is another question.
"All this stuff is going to be gradual," said Charles L. Schultze, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Jimmy Carter. "You have to think in terms of decades, which is not to say it shouldn't be done. You have to tell people to be realistic, and they should understand that Rome wasn't built in a day."
Building an overpass to relieve traffic congestion -- and reduce shipping costs -- often takes four or more years from design to completion. An airport takes even longer, and building a nationwide computer network might take a decade or more.
While acknowledging that such projects might take five years to produce noticeable gains in productivity, Jeff Faux, director of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group, said, "In the first few years these projects will produce a lot of economic stimulus." He said that spending about $40 billion more a year on highways and other projects would create almost one million more jobs and stimulate billions in private investment.
Mr. Stein, the economist in the Nixon Administration, is convinced that if Mr. Clinton presents a cogent case for investment, Americans will prove willing to wait for a long-term payoff.
"Americans have typically invested in their children," he said. "They broke the Great Plains, they plowed all that land so that their children could live better than they did."

HEADLINE: Corporations Attack Plan To Lift Taxes

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Even before President Clinton introduces his economic package, American corporations have mounted an offensive, attacking his plan to increase the corporate income tax by asserting that it collides with his goal of stimulating investment and jobs.
Lobbyists' letters are pouring into the White House to protest such an increase, which Administration officials hint will raise the corporate income tax to 36 percent from 34 percent now. 
 "Everyone knows that we have to create more jobs because we have a relatively fragile recovery," said Dirk Van Dongen, co-chairman of the Tax Reform Action Coalition, a group of 300 corporations and trade associations. "This proposal is counterproductive because it takes away from businesses the very asset they need to create jobs: their surplus dollars."
 
Sharing the Burden
 Administration officials and many Democrats defend plans for a higher corporate income tax, suggesting that the pre-emptive howls from the business community show that it is acting like any other special interest group whose ox has been gored.
Corporations should join all other Americans in making some sacrifice to reduce the deficit, advocates of the tax increase say. Besides, Mr. Clinton's political advisers have told the President that before he calls on the middle class to pay higher taxes, he must ask the well-off to cough up more revenues -- and that means asking corporations to pay more, too.
Supporters of an increase in the corporate income tax note that as a percentage of the nation's gross domestic product, revenues from this tax have plunged 40 percent from the 1970's and more than 50 percent from the 1960's.
Advocates of the increase say the main reason for this decline is that the corporate tax rate has been reduced repeatedly, while business lobbyists say the primary reason is that corporate profits are down.
Supporters of a higher corporate tax rate see the issue as a matter of equity. "Over the last decade or two there has been a shift away from the corporate income tax and toward the personal income tax and, in particular, payroll taxes," said Max Sawicky, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal Washington-based research group. "A little bit of a tilt in the opposite direction is not worth fighting about."
Increasing the corporate income tax to 36 percent is expected to increase tax collections by $6 billion a year. The Government expects to collect $105 billion from the tax this year without a rate increase.
 
Bentsen's Backing
 When President Clinton spoke to business executives and their Washington lobbyists last week, he said that Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen had convinced him that if the Administration raises the top personal income tax rate, it should raise the corporate income tax.
Treasury officials fear that if the top personal rate were to rise to 36 percent, from 31 percent now, and the corporate income tax were to remain at 34 percent, that would encourage financial shenanigans in which individuals and partnerships formed corporations so their income would be taxed at the lower rate.
Many companies see the plan for a higher corporate tax as a betrayal of the spirit of the 1986 tax act, in which businesses gave up loopholes for a lower corporate income tax.
"The idea was to take taxation out of business decision-making, to make taxation as simple and fair as possible, so that business could focus on economics in their decisions" said David Berenson, national director of tax policy for Ernst & Young. "If you ratchet up corporate taxes, that means more business decisions will be based on taxes, and not on efficiency and what's best for the economy."
 
Competitive Concerns
 An argument against this tax increase is that by raising the cost of capital it would give American companies one more incentive to move operations overseas.
Several business executives interviewed said the plan to increase the corporate tax flew in the face of Mr. Clinton's plans to re-establish an investment tax credit. The former will reduce after-tax profits and discourage investment, while the latter will increase after-tax profits and encourage investment.
 
Industries Divided
 Some industries are far more opposed to the corporate tax increase than others. Retailers, who have a high effective tax rate and few write-offs, are livid about the plan, while capital-intensive industries, like steel, appear willing to go along with the increase in exchange for getting the investment tax credit back.
James M. Poterba, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said raising the corporate income tax would penalize companies that have already made investments, while the investment tax credit would favor new assets.
"The proposal on the table is a move toward encouraging incentives to new investment and financing it with taxes on old assets," Mr. Poterba said. "That should be a pro-investment, efficiency-enhancing policy."
If the goal is to encourage investment, he said, then it would be wise economics to finance the investment tax credit with a consumption tax, rather than a corporate income tax. Whether it would be wise politics is, of course, a different question.

HEADLINE: Why Would Anybody Want To Be Owner of The Post?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
For sale: Newspaper losing $300,000 a week with poor niche in highly competitive market. Unique opportunity. Previous owners have lost tens of millions of dollars.
Such an ad never appeared in The New York Post, but a candid description of the business challenges facing anyone buying New York City's most troubled tabloid newspaper would describe it that way. 
 So why, people in and out of the newspaper industry ask, has The Post lured not only Steven Hoffenberg, its would-be publisher, but, apparently, a handful of other well-financed people who appear interested in stepping in if he falters?
"It's very, very hard to make a case that this is a rational investment," said John S. Reidy, newspaper analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
The Post has been weakened by years of losses, slipping advertising revenue and declining readership. During his ownership of the paper, Peter S. Kalikow has tried to repair a fundamental financial flaw -- the absence of a Sunday edition. For many publishers, the Sunday paper brings in more than half their annual profit.
In the end, Mr. Kalikow's Sunday edition failed, ceasing publication in November 1989 after eight months, and a loss, he said, of $25 million. And that, Mr. Reidy and other newspaper analysts say, is only a hint of the depth of The Post's problems.
Mr. Hoffenberg is buying The Post by putting up $6 million to, in essence, replace Mr. Kalikow's bank as the newspaper's lender and by promising to provide the cash it needs.
He also said he would pay as much as $4.5 million in employees' withholding taxes that Mr. Kalikow failed to pay. Mr. Kalikow's failure to turn over that money to the Government helped precipitate the newspaper's financial crisis.
As any buyer would have to under these circumstances, Mr. Hoffenberg is assuming The Post's liabilities. He is also taking over the collection of money owed it.
Mr. Kalikow has not opened the newspaper's books to anyone other than Mr. Hoffenberg, but people involved in efforts to save it said the estimates put The Post's liabilities at $11 million, apart from separate pension obligations.
About half of the liabilities other than for pensions, it is believed, would have to be paid only if the paper closed and the owner had to make severance payments to employees.
The other $5 million to $6 million, people involved in the transaction said, would be offset if The Post's new buyer could collect $6 million to $7 million owed the paper.
The Post's pension liabilities may be about $20 million. Some of those who have been involved in financial discussions at the newspaper said there may now be money available to cover only about half of that.
A buyer would become responsible for the total obligation, including finding a way to finance the pension obligations not currently provided for.
Under Federal law, Mr. Kalikow, as the seller of the business, would remain responsible for the pensions for five years as a backup to the new owner. But his responsibility may be largely theoretical, as he is bankrupt.
No one can answer with certainty what has drawn Mr. Hoffenberg, and other potential buyers, to The Post. But among those closest to the deal, there is no shortage of theories. Here is a sampling of the best of them:
THE ALTRUIST. This is Mr. Hoffenberg's favorite. He says he wants to save a New York institution and was drawn into the role of publisher more deeply than he had planned because of the severity of the paper's financial crisis. He has repeatedly denied any other intention.
FIGHT THE REGULATORS. This is the Securities and Exchange Commission's favorite. Agency lawyers broadly hint that Mr. Hoffenberg popped up at The Post only because the watchdogs were on the verge of filing a suit accusing him of defrauding investors in his Towers Financial Corporation.
They suggest that he hoped to help himself by harnessing the status and influence that comes with being a newspaper publisher.
They also suggest he is using The Post to create a platform and a business vehicle for himself as his old one appears to be collapsing under the weight of the S.E.C. attack. Suggestions that he may put The Post in bankruptcy have added fuel to the idea that he is looking for a financial safe haven.
DEBT COLLECTION PLAY. This may be Mr. Hoffenberg's least favorite. It contends that he may want to "save" The Post as little more than a debt-collection maneuver, much like those he has specialized in at Towers.
By buying the newspaper essentially with the $6 million in credit -- and at little real cost to himself because the money would be replenished unless The Post's problems multiplied -- he could, according to this theory, profit by collecting its debts (making, perhaps, $5 million quickly).
THE GREATER FOOL. A standby in the newspaper business, it suggests that anyone who would buy a paper believes there will always be someone else who will be similarly entranced by the idea of becoming a guest at the cocktail parties of the powerful. And that next buyer might even be willing to provide the seller with a healthy profit for his trouble.
Adherents of this theory contend that no other explanation could explain why anyone would buy a newspaper that lost lots of money, even under the stewardship of as shrewd a newspaper operator as Rupert Murdoch. Just the 1987 loss, Mr. Murdoch's last year as publisher before he sold to Mr. Kalikow, is reported to have been $17 million.
REAL ESTATE PLAY.It suggests that entrepreneurs see The Post's river-view headquarters in lower Manhattan as a low-cost development site.
Under Mr. Hoffenberg's purchase contract, the Bankers Trust Company has reduced its mortgage on the building to $15 million from $25 million, essentially giving The Post's buyer a block of Manhattan real estate suitable for, say, an apartment tower.
The only problem with this theory is that, in the still depressed New York real estate market, it is not clear that anyone other than a starry-eyed newspaper suitor would buy The Post's patch of real estate.
BETTER MANAGEMENT. This one is said to be a favorite of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and his aides, who have taken an active role in trying to persuade monied people to buy The Post.
They imply that Mr. Kalikow may have lacked the management savvy a new owner could apply profitably. A new editorial strategy -- more clearly defining The Post's target audience, for example, or turning it once again into an afternoon paper -- might revive its franchise, proponents of this notion say. .
The theories keep coming, including wild scenarios of as-yet-undetected methods of milking dollars from The Post, whose union-level employees have not had a raise in seven years.
But none of the theories seem fully satisfying in the search to understand why a newspaper that has teetered on the edge for years appears to be drawing buyers, including Mr. Hoffenberg.
"Everybody in New York is asking: What is going on with this guy?" said Fred Drasner, the co-publisher with Mortimer B. Zuckerman of The Daily News.
Mr. Drasner, no novice at newspaper finance, said he was one New Yorker who cannot completely explain the lure of The Post.

HEADLINE: Pharmaceuticals' Blue Chip May Be Fading

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SOMERVILLE, N.J., Feb. 10

 BODY:
Central New Jersey, an international center of the pharmaceutical industry, is being pushed to center stage in the United States' campaign to contain health costs.
Scattered across the state's midsection -- in the rolling hills here, the corporate campuses of Princeton, the urban clutter of New Brunswick and elsewhere -- is the world's largest concentration of companies that create and market prescription drugs, companies whose steady growth and investment have been the envy of other corporations even in recessionary years. 
 Now, the pharmaceutical industry finds itself under siege from insurers, hospitals, Congress and the Clinton Administration, which calls the containment of health-care costs a major priority in its fight to reduce the Federal deficit. On Friday, the President singled out the industry for criticism, calling its prices "shocking" and saying drug companies are spending too much on advertising and lobbying.
In New Jersey, sometimes called the medicine chest of the nation because it is home to the main research arms of 10 of the world's 18 largest drug companies, the big question now is how the pharmaceutical makers will adapt: whether they can continue to stand out as models of growth, profitability and, by many measures, community involvement.
 
Fear of Turning Gray
 Some fear that economic and political pressure will transform the industry from a cutting-edge producer of high-technology products into just another graying American manufacturer. That has threatening implications across a region reeling from huge manufacturing job losses, including the impending shutdown of the General Motors assembly plant in Tarrytown, N.Y., and thousands of layoffs by I.B.M.
In what some analysts call an omen for the industry, Bristol-Myers Squibb said in October that it was cutting 2,000 jobs in its pharmaceutical group, based in Princeton.
New Federal regulations, combined with fierce competition in the industry, "are going to drive the margins out of the pharmaceutical business over the next five years," said Raymond C. Egan, executive vice president of the Bristol-Myers Squibb group, which has 38,000 employees.
Although fewer than 300 people would be laid off in New Jersey, where the pharmaceutical group has 6,000 employees, other cuts are to be made in the state through attrition.
 
'Pressure on Prices'
 "There is certainly going to be increased pressure on prices, and adjustments have to be made," said Patricia Danzon, a professor of health-care management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.
She said cuts may come first in administration and sales. Other experts expect cuts in research and development, which, like administration and sales, are heavily concentrated in New Jersey.
"The health-care industry in the United States has been the most innovative in the world," said Jack Herdklotz, the president of Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals, a German company that built its Somerville headquarters in 1970. It is completing work on a $20 million molecular neurobiology research center here to develop drugs for Alzheimer's disease and other disorders.
 
Traditions of Involvement
 He said that to contain costs, Hoechst-Roussel was considering producing more generic drugs, and relying more on licensing or other cooperative ventures with outside laboratories and researchers.
Cutbacks could affect more than the pharmaceutical concerns' own employees, since most of the companies have long traditions of community involvement in New Jersey.
In New Brunswick, a once-declining industrial city where Johnson & Johnson built a new headquarters in 1975, the company in January opened a day-care and "parenting center" for teen-age mothers at New Brunswick High School.
In Nutley, Hoffmann-La Roche won an award last year from the Environmental Protection Agency, in part for its programs to recycle waste. Other drug makers have been widely cited for volunteer work and for gifts to community programs.
 
'The Most Admired Industry'
 In its current issue, Fortune Magazine calls pharmaceutical makers "the most admired industry" in the United States and singles out four New Jersey drug makers for praise: Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, Johnson & Johnson, Bristol-Myers Squibb and the Schering-Plough Corporation, based in Madison.
Brenda J. Bacon, who is Gov. Jim Florio's chief of management planning and his top adviser on health-care issues, said, "We need health-care reform, but not by harming one of our strongest industries, and we are sure the Clinton Administration does not want to solve one problem by creating another."
The debate over how to contain medical costs is creating political headaches for Mr. Florio and his administration. Although he is a close political ally of Mr. Clinton, the Governor is under pressure from his own state's pharmaceutical executives to carry their message to Washington.
Ms. Bacon said Mr. Florio planned to meet with top pharmaceutical executives the week of Feb. 14. She said he would urge them to agree to voluntary limits on price increases for prescription drugs, but only if the same limits were agreed to by the entire pharmaceutical industry.
 
Division on Price Limits
 So far, two of the New Jersey companies -- Merck and Hoffman La Roche -- have told state officials they would agree to voluntary limits, in which their prices for drugs already on the market would not be raised above the consumer price index. Others have balked, saying the idea is too broad and leaves them no flexibility in pricing drugs that have only small, highly specialized markets.
New Jersey drug makers were having problems even earlier. Bristol-Myers Squibb, the only major New Jersey pharmaceutical maker that has announced job cuts in recent years, complains about a set of Federal rules made in the Bush Administration requiring pharmaceutical companies to charge Medicaid recipients no more for their drugs than they charge large-volume buyers.
That law has forced some companies to repay large amounts to state Medicaid programs. Bristol-Myers Squibb said it would owe Medicaid $100 million in rebates this year.
The drug companies have been squeezed by a growing reliance on health maintenance organizations, which vigorously negotiated discounts on prescription medications by buying them in bulk. And they have felt pressure from large hospitals and clinics, which have adopted limits on what they will pay for drugs.
 
Convenience or Low Cost
 One result has been a rapid increase in the use of generic drugs, which cost far less than their brand-name counterparts, or medications that may require patients to sacrifice convenience for lower costs. For instance, many customers are opting for drugs that are cheaper but require more frequent doses.
This month, the Clinton Administration said that it would favor a Federal program to buy vaccines en masse for the lowest price possible, and provide them free for school immunization programs.
In a report to the Senate that was bitterly contested by the industry, researchers concluded that several companies that had pledged not to raise their prices faster than the rate of inflation had done so in 1992.
"This report adds to the mounting evidence that voluntary price restraints simply don't work," said Sen. David Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat. Among those singled out were Merck and American Home Products.
 
Vast Profits in 1980's
 Despite the mounting economic and political heat, industry analysts say they doubt that the nation's largest pharmaceutical companies will veer far from the strategies that produced vast profits in the 1980's.
"The lifeblood of the industry is new products," said Robert Hodgeson, a health care analyst for Cowan and Company in Boston. "These companies will be looking for efficiencies, but I don't see major cuts in research and development."
That may help New Jersey, which has become a global vortex of drug research. A study by Hal P. Eastman, associate dean of the graduate school of management at Rutgers University, found that the state's large pharmaceutical companies increased their annual research and development budgets nearly fourfold in the 1980's, to a total of $1.93 billion in 1990.
"Our most important approach is still to find breakthrough therapies," said Timothy G. Rothwell, president and chief executive officer of Sandoz, the United States subsidiary of a diversified Swiss chemical and drug concern, which established its base in East Hanover during the early 1950's.
Despite the potential threat from new Federal regulations, Mr. Rothwell said the company needed access to American scientists, hospitals and clinical trials. By the end of the 1990's, he said, it will increase its staff of scientists to 1500 from 600, and its overall employment in East Hanover to 4,000 from 2,500.
"We know the environment is changing, and there will be more pressure on prices," he said. "But our intent is not to slow down."

HEADLINE: Rent-to-Own Stores Becoming a Consumer Issue

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
Buying on the installment plan is the American way. But it requires credit -- unless you're shopping at what is known as a rent-to-own store. These stores lease everything from televisions to vacuum cleaners on a weekly or monthly basis to customers -- without the need for credit checks and with the promise of eventual ownership.
Although installment payments are low -- usually less than $20 a week -- the charges at these outlets are far higher than the interest rates charged by banks or credit-card companies, often running as much as 200 percent. As a result, products end up costing three or four times their retail price. 
 Customers, most of whom are low-income individuals, end up paying $1,000 or more for a $200 television. And the sales tactics of these outlets have also been called into question by consumer advocates.
 
 
New Jersey Legislation
 In fact, rising consumer complaints as the industry has expanded over the last decade have led 31 states to pass laws to regulate these operations. The latest to consider such legislation is New Jersey, where a bill was introduced in the General Assembly last month requiring increased disclosure to customers by rent-to-own operations.
The proposed New Jersey law -- as well as the measures that passed in the 31 other states -- does not go as far as some consumer advocates would like and is, in fact, supported by the rent-to-own industry.
"There's no question that these laws provide a significant amount of substantive protection to consumers," said Chris Korst, legal director for Rent-A-Center, the nation's largest rent-to-own chain with over 1,000 stores and sales of $600 million to $700 million a year -- a 25 percent share of the market.
But critics say these laws do little to protect consumers from what Neil Fogerty, director of the Consumers League of New Jersey, based in Montclair, characterizes as "loan sharking" by such operations.
 
 
Disclosures Required
 The New Jersey legislation requires certain disclosures, including the weekly cost of an item to be rented, the number of payments required before ownership, the total cost to the consumer at the end of an agreement and a description of the goods.
But only Pennsylvania puts a cap, of 18 percent, on the annual interest rate a rent-to-own store can charge. The other states excuse rent-to-own stores from compliance with state usury laws that limit interest rates. Unlike Pennsylvania, they classify these transactions as rentals rather than sales -- as does the New Jersey bill -- which disturbs some consumer advocates.
It is the promise of ownership that attracts customers to the stores, argues Dave Sciarra of the New Jersey Public Advocate's office, a state agency that opposes the bill introduced in New Jersey. He maintains that the stores are not just renting, but selling merchandise.
 
 
'Service to People'
 Yet the industry says that without its service many Americans would not be able to buy common household items. "We provide a service to people who don't necessarily have the means to put down a huge down payment or buy a product outright," said Nancy Johnson, spokeswoman for Thorn EMI Rental Americas, which owns Rent-A-Center.
About 20 percent of Rent-A-Center customers are unemployed or on public assistance, according to Mr. Korst.
"Rent-to-own companies gear their advertisements and sales practices to low-income people who do not believe that they have a lot of credit options," said Margot F. Saunders, managing attorney in the Washington office of the National Consumer Law Center, which is based in Boston.
Charlene Mathis, who lives in a public housing project in Jersey City, for example, agreed to pay one rent-to-own store more than $21 a week for 87 weeks to buy a television and a videocassette recorder. The total cost came to more than $1,800 for items that retail for about $250 each. That represents an annual interest rate of more than 200 percent.
 
 
'I Learned My Lesson'
 Ms. Mathis, who never completed her contract because she could not keep up her payments, went to Rent-A-Center because she didn't have $500 but did have $21. "I was trying to make a bargain," she said recently. "I learned my lesson. I went out there and saved my money and bought a new TV for $90."
As Ms. Mathis learned, retail stores are cheaper. At Provideo, a retailer in Washington that allows customers to pay through a two-year installment plan, a $250 television would cost no more than $330, at an interest rate of about 19 percent, according to the store's manager. Customers who want to buy on credit fill out a short application form and the store runs a credit check, which means customers must have a major credit card or have paid off a loan.
At Rent-A-Center, there is no credit check. The company simply verifies the residence given, the source of income and contacts one or two of the six references a customer is required to provide.
The industry's rapid expansion is evidence that consumers like rent-to-own companies, Mr. Korst says. Modeled after a marketing practice outlined in English law called hire-purchase, the rent-to-own industry has grown swiftly since it emerged in this country in the late 1960's.
In 1992, there were 8,000 stores, up from 3,000 in 1983, according to the Association of Progressive Rental Organizations, a trade group. The industry, which includes large chains and operators who own only two to three stores, rang up $3.5 billion in revenues in 1990, according to the group. Most stores are in inner cities.
 
 
'Unique Package'
 "We are growing because we combine a unique package of goods and services that people can't find anywhere else," like free maintenance, free delivery and no long-term commitment, Mr. Korst said.
Yet in addition to weekly payments, there are other charges, including late fees, home pickup fees, and liability and reinstatement fees, levied if a customer who has missed a payment wants to continue the agreement.
Mr. Korst calls consumer advocates' attacks on rent-to-own companies "utter nonsense" and denies that the businesses even charge interest. "An interest rate does not make any sense in a rental transaction that terminates every week or every month," he said, adding that only 25 percent of all contracts result in ownership.
Critics of the industry say that the high termination rates stem in large part from the industry's sales practices. Many outlets allow customers to fall behind on their payments early in their contracts, but use those late payments later in the cycle to repossess property.
 
Lawsuits Cited
 Practices such as this have led to individual and class-action lawsuits in Minnesota, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and New Jersey.
Madeleine L. Houston, director of litigation for the Passaic County Legal Aid Society, filed a suit in 1990 on behalf of Iris Green, who had paid Continental Rentals in Paterson, N.J., close to $4,000 on five items before the property was repossessed when she could no longer afford to pay. The $4,000 was more than the full value of all the products. Ms. Houston charged that the stores should be covered under sales laws putting caps on interest rates.
One amendment being considered by New Jersey legislators is a provision mandating that once someone has paid double the cash price of an item, that person automatically owns it, according to Paul DiGaetano, the Republican Assemblyman who sponsored the legislation.

HEADLINE: Rural Home, a City Job and a Modem;
Technology Gives Professionals Best of 2 Worlds: Fast Track and a Woodstock Address

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINGSTON, N.Y., Feb. 8

 BODY:
When the sleek purple, white and orange overnight delivery truck first pulled up to Shaun Johnston's quiet country lane, it looked to him like a spacecraft, so outlandish did it seem in that rustic setting.
But such courier trucks -- and modern wonders like fax machines and computer modems -- have made it possible for a graphic designer like Mr. Johnston and a growing number of other professionals from New York City to live a simple life in the country. 
 Only five or six years ago, advertisers, commercial photographers, video producers, corporate lawyers and book editors generally had to live in or near big cities like New York to survive. But new communications systems have enabled them to do business with customers around the world while living among the farms and hills of places like Ulster and Dutchess Counties.
 
High Response in Sleepy Place
 "I'm running a real high-quality, high-response operation from up here, and this is a sleepy place," says Mr. Johnston, who designs informational brochures for the pharmaceutical industry and, at the moment, labels for the Paul Newman food line.
The self-employed professionals who make up these cottage industries are distinctly different from the flower children of the 1960's and early 1970's who dropped out of the rat race and moved to the country to open leather and tie-dying shops. These professionals do not want to give up their satisfying, high-paying careers. They just want to live in a less frenzied locale.
And they are different from their long-rooted counterparts in the Hudson Valley whose businesses cater mainly to local residents. This new wave wants to sustain the glamour and electricity of doing business in Manhattan, and the newcomers have chosen homes close enough that they can go in for weekly meetings and catch up on industry gossip.
 
Far From Business Hubs
 The emergence of Stewart Airport outside Newburgh as an important hub even makes it possible for them to have national aspirations, to see clients in Toronto or Boulder, Colo., as Pete Mathieu does. Trying to move closer to his 104-acre farm, he started an advertising agency in the village of Montgomery -- population 2,000 -- whose accounts include Perrier and Celestial Seasonings.
"New York's got a sense of itself that isn't totally right," Mr. Mathieu said. "It matters less where you are than what you do."
The trend is hard to quantify. But various census studies of "business services" show sharp and persistent growth in counties like Ulster and Dutchess, said Dr. Ann E. Davis, director of the Marist College Bureau of Economic Research. The number of Dutchess residents employed in business services rose from 2,459 in 1986 to 3,784 in 1992. In Ulster, it jumped from 901 to 1,482.
Longtime residents are aware a new type of cottage industry is forming. From sidewalk chats with newcomers, and from the restaurants, shops and theaters that are catering to the tastes and wallets of the exurbanite influx, these residents realize that their lives, too, are changing.
"The number of such people is still very modest but is increasing very rapidly," said Geddy Sveikauskas, editor of The Woodstock Times.
 
Ties to the Other Village
 He sometimes needles the newcomers for their recidivist passions for artists' colonies like Woodstock.
"They want to see people they would see on Eighth Street," he said, referring to the bustling East Village commercial strip. "They feel that's what separates them from the boondocks."
Sandra Hilton, president of the Ulster County Board of Realtors, estimates that she and other real-estate agents sell 200 homes a year to transplanted professionals, many who were lured here by weekend homes.
"We have always had weekend buyers, but now a lot of New Yorkers are looking for permanent," she said. "They have business connections with the city, but don't physically have to live in the city."
In New York City, the life or death of a business can depend on speed. Clients want everything finished yesterday. Mr. Johnston and his wife, Susan, who designs catalogues for the Book of the Month Club and others, could not have maintained their clientele by promising them layouts and scripts in the mail.
 
Computers and Trucks
 Computers, with their telephone modems, make it possible for Mr. Johnston to transmit intricate layouts and stylishly doctored photographs to New York and get a response from a client within five minutes. Larger layouts and proofs can go aboard an express delivery truck and arrive at his client's Manhattan office the next morning.
"Your workday is between Federal Express delivery and Federal Express pickup," says Mr. Johnston, a native of England.
Allison Craig once worked for the high-powered advertising firm of Young & Rubicam. Four years ago she joined two ex-New Yorkers weary of the stress and the impersonality of large organizations, and, along with a fourth partner, started CCMR Advertising in Kingston, about 60 miles north of Madison Avenue.
The upstart firm's pitch to clients like Berlitz and United Press International is that they can offer a New York level of quality and experience but at a much lower price. Office rents in Kingston's historic quarter are 15 percent cheaper than in Manhattan. And with Woodstock nearby, her agency can call on an assortment of musicians, artists and writers to turn out an ad or promotion.
 
Horseback in 15 Minutes
 "Our clients really don't care where we're located," she said. "They're looking for sound strategic thinking and good creative work and that can come as easily from Kingston as it can come from Manhattan."
On a wooded road just across the Hudson in Rhinebeck, George Langa runs a modern video studio that among its ventures produces in-flight entertainment for USAir.
"Fifteen minutes from here, I can be on a horse farm riding a horse," Mr. Langa likes to say. "Technology-wise, you're not isolated anymore. Life-style-wise, you are isolated, and that's a positive thing."
G. Brewster Cole, the chief executive of a 46-employee engineering firm specializing in municipal water distribution systems, realized three years ago that he could run his company from a telephone and computer. He moved up to a cabin in Woodstock, though he keeps a cot at his Little Falls, N.J., headquarters for weekly overnight visits.
 
Gradually Breaking Free
 Those who make the move do so gradually, and with considerable anxiety. After his New York company collapsed in 1988, Mr. Johnston felt somewhat lost and decided to work out of his one-acre weekend home in Tillson, a few miles north of New Paltz. Gaining a client, he boldly opened a one-room office in Kingston. It has now expanded into a six-room suite with five employees.
For three years, his wife, Susan, had to spend several days every week in New York away from him to continue designing catalogues for the book club.
"It was very difficult and I couldn't see how to break free because I loved my job," she recalled. "Then they started talking about bringing the Macintosh computer into the Book of the Month Club. And I said, 'Ha! This is my ticket out of the city.' "
Since November 1990, she has been working on a Macintosh in the backyard shed of their Tillson home. That shed also contains a studio in which Mrs. Johnston can pursue her other love, drawing pastel landscapes. She still travels into the city by bus one day a week for planning meetings and for her own psychic fix.
"I miss the camaraderie of an office," she acknowledges. "I miss showing my work and getting feedback. Working alone is very isolating."
Several weeks ago, the Johnstons found a buyer for the West End Avenue co-op they had been renting out, and while emptying the apartment they were surprised that they did not feel particularly sad.
"We left there a long time ago," Mrs. Johnston said.
The Kingston area lacks the critical mass of professionals some businesses demand. So when one of his computer graphics specialists recently left to have a child, Mr. Johnston spent several nervous days wondering how to replace her. But he met a good candidate right on the bus into New York.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Housing Organization Finds Itself in Another Cuomo's Hands

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
FIVE years ago, as the first 25 homeless families moved into an imaginative prefabricated housing project in Brooklyn, Andrew M. Cuomo pondered a future political career and reflected on his father's.
He said he would be reluctant to run for office from New York while his father was still Governor. Suppose Mario M. Cuomo happened to be holding office someplace else? 
 "He will be in New York State if he's serving in elective office," Andrew Cuomo said.
Since then, Governor Cuomo was re-elected again and passed up two opportunities to run for President. He is still in New York and if Washington beckons, it will most likely be for an appointive post. As of two weeks ago, though, Andrew Cuomo was in Washington as President Clinton's nominee for Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for Community Planning and Development.
The position will give him wide discretion and visibility to replicate nationally the policies his commission on the homeless recommended last year to Mayor David N. Dinkins. It will also give him a chance to lobby for the construction of homes for the homeless similar to the ones built in Brooklyn and elsewhere by Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged, or H.E.L.P., an organization Mr. Cuomo founded.
Mr. Cuomo's title has been retired, but his organization has been placed in good hands. The executive vice president will be Ilene Margolin, who is currently the associate executive director for operations of the Federation Employment and Guidance Service, and formerly an adviser to the Governor on homelessness. The unsalaried chairwoman will be Maria Cuomo Cole, Andrew's younger sister. Ms. Cuomo Cole, who was a partner in a public relations firm until this year and a H.E.L.P. board member, is married to Kenneth Cole, the shoe designer.
"We could have either really let go or try to continue and fulfill Andrew's agenda and his dream, which is to continue on a national level," Ms. Cuomo Cole said. "We want to keep a family commitment."
Critics complained sometimes that Mr. Cuomo was able to keep that commitment only because he is the Governor's son. No matter. Plenty of progeny never even try to emulate powerful parents.
"We feel confident that other cities will be able to implement this formula without their having any familial relation," said Ms. Cuomo Cole.
"The H.E.L.P. concept was to provide immediate homes for homeless families and support services to find permanent homes. That was our covenant with homeless families. They, in turn, participated in the program by staying off drugs and committing themselves to drug treatment and cooperating with the support staff in training and counseling."
With eight sites serving more than 4,000 people a year in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Albany, Westchester and Suffolk, H.E.L.P. has evolved into what it describes as the largest private provider of housing for homeless in the nation. New projects are pending on 14th Street in Manhattan and in Harrison in Westchester.
Last year, H.E.L.P. itself graduated into becoming an innovative provider of permanent housing. Genesis Homes, a visually striking sanctuatuary in Brooklyn's East New York, houses 150 families evenly divided between the working poor who pay monthly rent of $500 to $700 and the formerly homeless whose rent is federally subsidized. Tenants share any savings if the time and effort they invest in clerical, maintenance or security duties pare the project's annual budget. Welfare mothers who join job-training classes will receive free day care for their children.
The agenda for Genesis and its suburban counterpart, Equity Homes, is simple: to create public-private partnerships that increase the supply of housing for low-income and lower- middle-income families in low-density economically mixed projects in which vital social services are available to provide "prevention before intervention."
Equity Homes plans to sell subsidized two-family homes for about $160,000 to homeowners who agree to lease the second apartment to a low-income tenant eligible for Federal rent subsidies.
Genesis, with Ms. Cuomo Cole at the helm, marks another beginning for a concept that defies partisan politics and ideology. Its first principle is work, not welfare, which to be achieved requires an investment in education, training and child care and that jobs be available. Its second principle promotes independence because "government programs which treat a person as a mere recipient of entitlements can destroy one's sense of pride, value and control." And it limits government's role to planning, financing and regulating while private providers develop and operate the housing and other services.
Those principles are economically and politically sound if advocates for the homeless succeed in melding conscience with the plight of the poor with the middle-class self-interest that predominates in Washington and New York. After the Board of Education ousted Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez last week to protest his social agenda, Governor Cuomo, who raised his family in Queens, reminded the rest of New York that it might well have been the Chancellor rather than the board that had lost touch.
"There has been a syndrome for a long time if you're in Manhattan to see things a little bit different than you see them in Staten Island, Queens and Brooklyn. And I think the 4-to-3 vote -- right, wrong, for better, for worse -- probably reflects where that population is."

HEADLINE: Latin America's Regional Trade Boon

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Feb. 14

 BODY:
After years of nationalistic trade protection, Latin America is finding that regional trade agreements can provide an enormous spur to its economies.
Not only are the accords increasing trade within Latin America, but they drop tariffs for overseas trade as well, and the result has been a sharply expanding market for the United States. 
 "Historically, Latin America's intraregional trade has been zilch," said Peter B. Field, director of the Enterprise of the Americas program at the North-South Center in Miami. "But in the last two years, intraregional trade has exploded."
In the latest regional agreement, signed here on Friday, the Presidents of Venezuela, Colombia and five Central American nations knocked down another stack of trade barriers.
In a previous agreement, signed in March 1990, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay agreed to set a timetable to phase out all regional tariffs by the end of 1994. In response to the liberalization, trade between Brazil and Argentina jumped 50 percent in 1991, a growth rate that was repeated last year. Encouraged by such startling increases in commerce, Latin America's leaders no longer treat regional integration as an abstract ideal.
In January of 1992, Colombia and Venezuela abolished bilateral tariffs. That year, trade between the two Andean neighbors jumped 60 percent. After a bilateral open-skies agreement was signed in 1991, the frequency of weekly flights between Caracas and Bogota jumped to 31 from 7.
Over the last year, four Andean nations -- Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela -- inaugurated duty-free regional trade. But over the last three years, these nations, plus Peru, slashed their average external import tariffs by two-thirds. In 1989, the average tariff on goods imported from outside the Andes was 41 percent. Today, the average is 13.6 percent.
In the southern common market, known as Mercosul, external tariffs are being cut by more than half to reach a 20 percent ceiling by June. Mercosul, comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, encompasses about half of Latin America's economic activity. Chile, South America's only other large economy, has a flat external tariff of 11 percent.
"There is nothing to be feared from regional subgroupings if they lower trade and investment barriers, clearing the path toward larger cooperative agreements in the hemisphere," David Rockefeller, former chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank, said in a speech last year at a seminar on integration of the Western Hemisphere.
Bearing out Mr. Rockefeller's words, American exporters discovered that Latin America was the world's fastest-growing market for American goods.
In the first quarter of 1992, United States exports to Latin America and the Caribbean increased 32.5 percent from the corresponding quarter a year earlier. Meanwhile, American exports to the rest of the world grew only 4.4 percent.
In 1991, American export growth figures were similar: an 18 percent jump for Latin America and the Caribbean and a 5.3 percent rise for the rest of the world. With United States sales to Latin America jumping an estimated 30 percent in 1992, Latin America was the only region where the United States had a trade surplus.
 
 
Good for the United States
 "As these countries start to get their houses in order, and start to open up, the United States is going to be a major beneficiary," Mr. Field said, referring to a resumption of Latin economic growth after the stagnant years of the 1980's debt crisis.
As an indication of how serious they are, Latin American nations have gone beyond lowering external tariffs to abolishing import licenses, exchange controls and import quotas.
"Eighty percent of nontariff barriers have been thrown out," Adolfo Lopez Bustillo, a statistician at the Andean group's headquarters in Lima, Peru, said last month in an interview. Last year, Andean regional trade jumped 18 percent to $2.1 billion -- the largest increase since the group was formed in 1969.
In Venezuela, the shift toward a free market is as clear as the changing scene at the land border with Colombia. Where Indian women used to slip across border trails with contraband produce hidden under their billowing skirts, large tractor-trailers now rumble through simplified border controls.
 
 
Improvements at the Border
 "My trucks used to spend two days at the border; now they spend three hours," said Andres Duarte, the owner of a commodities trading company here. "Ford Venezuela and General Motors Venezuela are now exporting to Colombia."
After a free trade agreement between Colombia and Ecuador took hold on Oct. 1, border merchants were so disoriented that they briefly blocked the Pan American Highway. But with under-the-table trade now history, official trade increased threefold in the last quarter of 1992.
The timing of Latin America's regional agreements vary.
With the recent creation of the Andean Free Trade Zone, tariffs immediately dropped to zero for trade between Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela. In contrast, a 1991 Chile-Mexico free trade treaty calls for phasing out all bilateral trade barriers by 1998. Similarly, bilateral free trade agreements that Chile hopes to sign this year with Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador are only expected to become fully operative by the end of this decade.
In the biggest leap in the 24-year history of the Central American Common Market, three countries -- El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras -- are to abolish all trade duties by March 1. In contrast, a free trade pact signed in August by Mexico and these countries, plus Nicaragua and Costa Rica, is to become fully effective only by the end of 1996. Similarly, the agreement signed here on Friday by these five Central American nations, plus Venezuela and Colombia, would allow fully free regional trade only by the end of the decade.
A Mexico-Colombia-Venezuela free trade pact that is to start in January is expected to only phase out tariff barriers by the year 2000.
 
 
Slow Approach
 Mexico is believed to be taking a slow approach to this subregional pact out of fear of complicating American Congressional consideration this year of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is of far greater importance to Mexico. That agreement includes rules on product origin intended to prevent Mexico from becoming a trampoline for Colombian and Venezuelan goods to enter the United States duty free.
As in all trade associations, Latin America's uneven economic policies slow the integration of trade.
In Mexico, where gasoline costs $1.40 a gallon, businessmen complain that Venezuelan goods benefit from subsidized production costs, because gasoline sells in Caracas for 33 cents a gallon.
In Argentina, industrialists complain that their nation's overvalued currency has brought an avalanche of Brazilian goods. Causing a severe strain to Mercosul, Argentina watched a 1990 trade surplus with Brazil of $776 million turn into an estimated 1992 trade deficit with that country of $1.1 billion.
Behind the alphabet soup of regional trade groups, the welter of timetables and the web of bilateral agreements, an overriding goal is to make individual Latin American countries more attractive to foreign investors.
"During the three years that we have been negotiating Nafta, we have already received more than $24 billion in overseas investment," Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the President of Mexico, told leaders assembled here.
Doubling and tripling market sizes, the free trade pacts are prompting companies to consolidate duplicate operations and to seek out foreign partners as they confront new competition.
Near Sao Paulo, Brazil, Kodak do Brasil is building a distribution center to start supplying the Mercosul market later this year. In Argentina, PASA Petroquimica is forming a joint venture with Monsanto as it faces new competition from Brazil in plastics.
 
 
'Dress Rehearsal'
 "I think Mercosul is a dress rehearsal for Brazil to become more competitive, to prepare for an eventual entry into the world economy," said Arturo Jose Furlong, president of Samring S.A., a flour mill in southern Brazil.
Here in Caracas, more than 50 of Colombia's largest companies have set up offices to explore sales and joint ventures. In return, Venezuelans last year bought four Colombian banks. Reflecting accelerating trade and investment, air traffic between here and Bogota has quintupled, reaching 54,000 passengers in the seven months after the open-skies pact took effect.
Encouraged by these results, Latin leaders predict that regional integration will only accelerate.
To promote physical integration, governments are planning to construct during the 1990's two superhighways -- one linking Caracas and Bogota, and the other linking Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires.
At a closing news conference on Friday, Venezuela's President Carlos Andres Perez announced that the next summit meeting of the Presidents of Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela would be with Caribbean heads of state interested in signing a regional free trade pact.

HEADLINE: French Tank Wins Contract Over U.S. and British Rivals

BYLINE: By Reuters

DATELINE: ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates, Feb. 14

 BODY:
France won a $3.5 billion order today from the United Arab Emirates for nearly 400 battle tanks, against tough competition from the United States and Britain, two of its allies in the Persian Gulf war.
The contract for Leclerc tanks was announced shortly after the opening of the largest military arms show in the gulf. More than 350 weapons manufacturers from 34 countries displayed their wares in what has become the world's most important arms market. 
 The Leclerc tank, made by France's state-owned Giat Industries S.A., had competed for the contract against the Abrams M1-A2 made by the General Dynamics Corporation, based in Falls Church, Va., and the Challenger 2 from Vickers P.L.C. of Britain.
The president of Giat, Pierre Chiquet, said 390 Leclerc battle tanks would be sold to the Emirates, plus 46 armored support vehicles, bringing the total number of vehicles involved to 436.
 
 
First Export Order
 It was Giat's first export order for the Leclerc, which was developed in the late 1980's and previously sold only to the French Army.
A spokesman for the United Arab Emirates, Gamal al-Suweidi, said, "It was a difficult decision choosing between three superior tanks." He did not give the value of the deal, but arms experts said it was at least $3.5 billion.
Mr. Chiquet said only that it was worth more than $3 billion. He said the tanks would be delivered by 1999, with the first five reaching the Emirates in 1994.
The Challenger and the original M1-A1 version of the Abrams were battle tested in the gulf war two years ago. In October, Kuwait agreed to buy 236 of the newer Abrams tanks for its military.
 
 
General Dynamics' Reaction
 Don Gilleland, a General Dynamics spokesman, said the decision "is not critical to our survival," adding that the company had "orders to take us to the mid-1990's." Production of the M1-A2 affects some 5,900 jobs in Warren, Mich., and Lima, Ohio.
Vickers, however, might be forced to shut one of two factories in Britain for lack of sufficient orders, experts said.
Last year, Vickers lost Kuwait's $4.5 billion order for 256 tanks to General Dynamics' M1-A2. The experts said a $300 million deal with Oman in January would prove insufficient to prevent the company's retrenching.
Britain and the United States remain the region's main arms suppliers, but France, eager to penetrate the lucrative market, has close military ties with the Emirates. It sold Mirage 2000 fighters equipped with American armament and air-defense systems to the Emirates in the mid-1980's, and military experts said the two sides might soon enter fresh negotiations for more Mirage 2000's.
 
 
Giat to Reinvest 60% of Deal
 Mr. Suweidi said Giat had agreed to reinvest 60 percent of the deal's value in joint-venture projects in the Emirates as part of that nation's so-called offset program, requiring foreign sellers to invest in its economy and introduce new technologies.
Last month, General Dynamics' Land Systems division offered to create a United States-based holding company that would make investments estimated at $1.5 billion in the Emirates in exchange for the tank order.
Giat officials said that at the Emirates' request, the tanks would be powered by a 1,630-horsepower engine made by the Deutsche Aerospace unit of Daimler-Benz A.G.

HEADLINE: Minority Caucus Adding Political Power in Albany

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 14

 BODY:
When New York State Assembly leaders began talking recently about raising income tax rates for the state's wealthiest residents, few thought much would come of the idea.
But for members of the Legislature's black and Puerto Rican caucus, the mere existence of a debate over the question has offered a sense of vindication. For five years, they have championed tax increases to avoid budget cuts. For five years, they have fought almost alone. 
 If this year is different, it may indicate a changing political climate, ushered in by President Clinton. But to members of the Legislature's minority caucus, it may also illustrate their growing clout in Albany.
"What you're hearing is a recognition of what the caucus has been saying for seven years," said Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, a Bronx Democrat. "It's either taxes or cuts, and we cannot afford to cut any more."
As the New York State Association of Black and Puerto Rican Legislators, which is run by the minority caucus, concluded its annual conference in Albany today, there was a sense that their time had arrived. With 35 members this year, six more than last year, the caucus is larger than ever before. All but seven are Democrats in the Assembly, making a united minority caucus a potentially formidible force within the 150-member lower house.
 
A Complex Web
 In the complex web of regional politics that dominate the Legislature, the caucus has also emerged as a vital voice for New York City, one that is perhaps more important this year than in the past.
The Assembly's Demcocratic majority, now 101 strong, has more suburban and upstate members than in the past. And because many of those new members are from traditional Republican strongholds, they are considered more vulnerable and in greater need of support from the Assembly leadership.
To many Assembly watchers, that could mean New York City members will lose leverage in a political body they have traditionally dominated. That battle, they say, must increasingly be waged by black and Hispanic members, who now hold 28 of the 58 seats in New York City's Assembly delegation.
"In the past, the impression was you didn't have to worry about the city, that the Assembly Speaker and the delegation will take care of it," said one city official. "But as the Assembly's Democratic majority becomes more upstate, the city delgation has to act more as a united delegation, and that's where the caucus comes in."
 
Emotional Support
 But whether that can happen remains in question. Begun largely as a mutual support group by a handful of black and Hispanic legislators about 30 years ago, the caucus often remains a loose-knit body that provides its members emotional, but not always political, support, legislators say.
"They're not particuarly effective in speaking as one voice," said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat. "We are all fairly parochial on issues. Like the rest of us, if they have an option of doing something good for the city versus for their district, the general approach is to do something good for the district, which gets you recognition."
In another indication that the caucus may play a greater role in the Assembly this year, Assemblyman Albert Vann, a Brooklyn Democrat, has been appointed chairman of the Assembly Corporations, Authorities and Commissions Committee.
Assigned to oversee independent authorities, including the Port Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the committee has wide-ranging effects on transportation and economic development. For Mr. Vann, who for years was chairman of the Children and Families Committee, the new position could broaden the caucus's influence beyond its traditional bastion in social-service committees.
Sounding a theme that resonated throughout the association's weekend, Mr. Vann said in an interview that he would use his committee to expand economic oppportunities for black and Hispanic New Yorkers.
"The important thing is to expand the economy for everyone," he said. "And as we do that, we should provide opportunities for minority- and women- owned businesses."

Three Painters' Views of Black Life in America

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Tonight comes the premiere of "The Living Canvas," a new PBS series about art. Presided over by Billy Dee Williams, who describes himself as "a painter who acts," the hourlong program offers a view of his off-camera, on-canvas work and the efforts of two other black artists, Dean Mitchell and Thomas Blackshear 2d.
Mr. Mitchell, whose representational style may remind you of Hopper or Wyeth, tells of his desire to celebrate the hard-working people of the rural Florida town of Quincy, where he was brought up. You have probably seen the work of Mr. Blackshear, known professionally as T.B. II, on advertisements for Coca-Cola and Anheuser Busch; he recently turned out a set of portraits of eminent black Americans for the United States Postal Service. Black entertainers figure in Mr. Williams' somewhat abstract paintings. 
 In keeping with African-American History Month, the documentary takes notice of the aspects of black life in America that appear in all the work as well as its special meaning for black youths.
 
'Nova'
'Can Science Build a Champion Athlete?' PBS, Tuesday at 8 p.m.
(Channel 13 in New York)
How is it that athletic records keep being broken? Tonight's answer on "Nova" gives credit to high-tech analysis of what makes champions run and swim faster, jump higher, shoot straighter and so forth.
The program shows how computer imaging breaks down the movements of athletes to find the most efficient uses of their strength, talent and energy, enabling trainers to take it from there. The material is interesting, and the slow-motion pictures of record-breakers in action are always a treat, but perhaps the most significant reason offered tonight for the astounding achievements of recent decades is the breaking down of racial and economic barriers to athletic competition.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Walker Left to Defend One U.S.O.C. Policy

BYLINE: By FILIP BONDY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Dr. LeRoy Walker, the first black president of the United States Olympic Committee, today found himself in the uncomfortable position of defending the organization's appointment policies toward minority-group members and women.
As a relatively uneventful U.S.O.C. board of directors meeting neared its close, Dr. Evie Dennis, superintendant of a Denver school district and an assistant to the U.S.O.C. president, attacked Walker and the board for failing to fill committee chairs and other power positions with blacks or women. 
 "You look in this room, you see white males," Dennis said. "I said this back in the 70's, and we've only picked up a few black members since then."
"It seems to me the committee thinks naming a black president is all it's got to do," Dennis added. "I think it's ridiculous when you consider the number of medals being won by black athletes."
The U.S.O.C. board of directors has 99 voting members. Of these, 24 are women and 11 are black (including two of the women). On the 21 committees for 1993-1996, there are four chairwomen, a sub-committee chairwoman and no black committee chairs. Three chairs will be named within the next two weeks, and Walker said he was trying very hard to fill them with minority members or women.
"You have to tell me who they are first," Walker said, referring to potential black candidates. "It's a high priority, but unfortunately, I didn't get enough help yet."
Walker said he was seeking minority and female candidates from several available sources: members of the executive committee, staff members, members of the board and members of the Athletes Advisory Council. Walker displayed nomination forms, in which candidates were to be coded according to race and gender.
"This would have been illegal a few years ago," he said, of the classification system he is trying to employ. "Now, they have to tell me who these people are, or I send them back the forms. I think the committee members are getting the message."
Dennis, however, insisted that she had submitted a list of possible minority-member hires to Walker who could fill several posts.
"I just hate to see this organization slip back," Dennis said. "Dr. Walker has to do more."
Alpha Alexander, who is black, is a sub-committee chairwoman for competitive grants. Alexander said she believed Walker was working to improve the representation by minority members, but Alexander said she was still concerned about what she called, "the good-old boy network."
 
'Reflection of Society'
 "This is 1993, and the Olympic Committee has to be a reflection of society," Alexander said. "Just because Dr. Walker is the first black president, that shouldn't take care of that group. They keep saying women and minorites are coming, but is it going to happen?"
Alexander had been one of the sponsors who successfully nominated Andrew Young and Arthur Ashe as public-sector members of the committee. Alexander said she came to the meetings in Phoenix saddened by the death of Ashe, but vowed to work to replace him with another black member. Alexander said she planned to nominate Rachel Robinson, the widow of Jackie Robinson, for Ashe's vacant post.
In other matters, the board of directors meeting closed today with mixed financial disclosures. The U.S.O.C. boasted a remarkably healthy budget, with record projected revenues for the 1993-96 quadrennium at $388 million and surpluses projected in the tens of millions.
The committee expressed a commitment to the San Diego training center, and a capital campaign to raise $21.5 million to complete renovations under way at the Colorado Springs Olympic training center.
The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, however, was less boastful. Charles Battle, executive vice president for the group, admitted that his organization had overestimated the amount of early interest and sponsorship money the 1996 Games would attract in 1992, a year with the Olympics in Albertville, France, and Barcelona, Spain.
 
Deals Left Undone
 The Atlanta group has lowered its projected profits to about $16 million for the 1996 Games, but Battle said the organization was all but done completing the political and economic deals that would allow the ambitious Olympic Stadium to be built, at the cost to organization of $207 million.
To build the stadium, which will be renovated after the Olympics for use by the Atlanta Braves, the Atlanta organization must reach agreements with the Braves, the city of Atlanta, Fulton County, the county's recreation department and the neighborhood surrounding the stadium. There is still a bailout plan to build a cheaper, temporary stadium if one of the many sides involved backs out.
"We've been a reactive organization in 1992, but we're committed to becoming a pro-active organization in 1993," Battle said.

HEADLINE: Big Science, Big Budget Cuts

 BODY:
As the Clinton Administration and Congress search for ways to cut Federal spending, frugal eyes are inevitably turning to the two biggest scientific projects now underway -- the $8.3 billion superconducting supercollider now being built in Texas, and the $30 billion space station. Billions have already been sunk into each project. But if the pain is to be spread fairly, these two research behemoths must be cut along with other vital programs. It is disheartening to hear that the Administration may be yielding to pressure to preserve them.
The easier call is the space station, a costly engineering project that has become, as some critics describe it, "an entitlement program for the aerospace industry." In a perverse inverse relationship, as the costs of the project have risen, the justifications for it have diminished. 
 Last year two expert panels pooh-poohed the notion that studies of materials in space would quickly produce anything of commercial value, supposedly one of the main goals of the station. Other reviews have made clear that the station has only one important goal that can't be met on Earth: it would serve as a base for biomedical studies of what happens to humans and animals who remain in space for long periods.
Such information is needed before humans can safely travel to Mars and beyond in the next century. But there are almost certainly cheaper ways to get it. Like designing a smaller station devoted solely to biomedicine. Or finding ways to extend the shuttle flights for long-duration medical tests. Or making even better use of the small, electronically primitive Russian station already in orbit.
Some budget cutters may be tempted to stretch out this grandiose public works project on reduced annual rations. But it would be far better to kill the present design and replace it with a smaller biomedical platform.
A harder call is the supercollider, a huge scientific instrument, some 54 miles in circumference, that will be built underground in Texas. By all accounts, this is a pioneering research project designed to yield secrets of matter that cannot be found any other way. Digging has just begun on its enormous underground tunnel and some surface buildings are already up.
The project poses two major risks. One is inevitable in basic research: the secrets learned may not be all that exciting. In any case, the knowledge gained will probably have little impact on important social or economic problems. This will be pure science at its purest. The other risk is that, as budgets tighten throughout government, a big-ticket item like the collider may siphon off funds from potentially more important, small-scale research.
In a parting shot of honesty, the Bush Administration finally acknowledged that foreign partners are unlikely to share much of the burden. So now U.S. taxpayers will have to provide another $5.5 billion to complete this project.
Few laymen are in a position to grasp whether this esoteric physics project is worth that kind of expenditure. But there is a way to force the physicists themselves to decide. If they want another $5.5 billion, let them mothball enough of the existing but obsolescent high-energy machines to cover the costs. If they aren't willing to pay that price, then society need not feel obliged to buy them a new machine.
Cutting these big science projects will not be easy. Both benefit the home state of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who can be counted on to fight for their preservation. And President Clinton, while angling for votes during the campaign, pledged to support both projects. But with pain-sharing now a political imperative, Big Science must do its share.
