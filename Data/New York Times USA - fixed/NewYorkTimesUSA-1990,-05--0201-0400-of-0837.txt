HEADLINE: Faster, Better Concorde Is Planned

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 7

 BODY:
The British and French aircraft makers that built the Concorde are expected to announce on Wednesday an agreement to study and design a second-generation supersonic aircraft to carry twice as many passengers as the Concorde and have almost twice its range.
Aerospatiale, France's largest commercial aviation company, said today that it would announce ''an important agreement'' on Wednesday, and several French newspapers reported that it and British Aerospace would announce an accord that aims to have a 250-seat ''son of Concorde'' in service in the year 2005.
Aerospatiale officials, who say the new aircraft will cost between $9 billion and $14 billion to develop, add that they hope American, Japanese and possibly even Soviet aerospace companies might join the project to help spread the huge costs.
 
Invitations to Others
They spoke specifically about inviting manufacturers like the Boeing Company, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to help. Both McDonnell and Boeing, which abandoned a supersonic project in the late 1960's, are already studying the development of a new supersonic transport. 
Because the development costs are so great and the market is limited, however, it would be foolish for two competing groups to develop new supersonic aircraft, the Aerospatiale officials said. But with their expertise and experience in supersonic transport, it is clear Aerospatiale and British Aerospace hope to lead any worldwide consortium formed to develop a new Concorde.
For more than a year, Aerospatiale officials have acknowledged that they have been studying a new supersonic transport, a super-Concorde, that would be designed to overcome the Concorde's shortcomings: it carries only about 100 passengers, is inefficient in the use of fuel and has a range of only 3,700 miles.
According to Le Figaro, a Paris daily, and La Tribune de l'Expansion, a business daily, the new supersonic carrier would accommodate between 200 and 300 passengers, use fuel far more efficiently than the Concorde and have a range of up to 7,500 miles. That range would enable it to fly from the United States or Europe to the Far East. A flight from Europe to Japan would take the new plane five hours, compared with 12 hours now.
The new Concorde would also be a bit faster, flying at almost 2.5 times the speed of sound, or Mach 2.5, compared with the Concorde's speed of Mach 2. The speed of sound is roughly 750 miles an hour.
Aerospatiale officials said the worldwide growth in long-haul traffic demonstrated a rising need for a new generation of economical supersonic transports. Company officials added that they hoped to sell more than 500 of the aircraft, which the French have dubbed FAST, for ''Future Aircraft of Supersonic Transport.''
''We are confident that it is technically feasible,'' one Aerospatiale official said. ''For us the real question is whether it is financially feasible.''
 
Only 13 in Service
British Aerospace and Aerospatiale had hoped to sell about 300 Concorde aircraft, but today there are only 13 of the aircraft, which had its maiden flight in 1969, in commercial service. The Concorde, which cost about $2 billion to develop, proved a gigantic commercial flop for its two state-owned manufacturers and for the French and British Governments that backed the project.
The sharp rise in fuel prices in the 1970's made the Concorde largely uneconomical. Its limited range prevented it from serving the fast-growing market from the Far East to Europe and the United States. In addition, protests about noise pollution severely limited the routes it could fly, which hurt it, especially in its efforts to serve the American coast-to-coast routes.
The 13 Concordes in commercial service are profitable for British Airways and Air France, the only two companies that fly them. The Concordes fly from Paris to New York in three and a half hours, half the seven hours needed for a typical passenger aircraft. The Concordes are used for the most part on regularly scheduled trans-Atlantic routes, but British Airways and Air France also rent them out for luxury charter flights.
 
Large Market Seen
''There is a large market for supersonic transport,'' said Wolfgang Demisch, an aviation analyst with UBS Securities. ''It's a large market that will remain until someone seizes the intiative. My guess is that the super-Concorde is a step in the right direction.''
The Concordes in service are due to be retired between the years 2000 and 2010.
The French newspapers said that British Aerospace and Aerospatiale would need five years of research, eight years of production and two to three years of tests before the new aircraft could go into service.
Last December the two companies that produced the engines for the Concorde announced an agreement to study the demand and technology for a new engine for the next generation of supersonic aircraft. Those two companies are Rolls-Royce and Snecma, as the Societe Nationale d'Etudes et de Construction de Moteurs d'Aviation is known. Aerospatiale officials said, however, that they would consider engines from other manufacturers as well.
Aviation experts see the next-generation Concorde as a step toward the development of aircraft that will fly five or more times the speed of sound.

HEADLINE: A Tire Maker Outdistances Rivals

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FINDLAY, Ohio, May 7

 BODY:
At a time when most tire companies are merging in the face of global competition and shuttering many factories, the Cooper Tire and Rubber Company is thriving as an independent and expanding its capacity.
By eschewing business with automobile manufacturers and focusing on the growing and less cyclical market for replacement tires, Cooper has achieved a record in the last decade that is the envy of giants like Goodyear, Bridgestone and Michelin. Its profits have increased at a compounded rate of 22 percent annually and its share of the domestic replacement-tire market has doubled, to 10 percent. And with the recent acquisition of Uniroyal Goodrich by Michelin of France, the prospect of Cooper as a takeover target has received new attention from many tire executives and some analysts. 
The success of Cooper can be attributed in good part to its ability to win over many independent tire dealers, which account for nearly two-thirds of the replacement-tire sales in the United States. It has done this by ''building a reputation as a reliable supplier with up-to-date plants,'' said Harry W. Millis, an analyst with McDonald & Company in Cleveland. What is more, Cooper is popular with the independents because it does not have retail outlets that compete with them, as do the bigger tire companies. (Cooper also sells tires through the independents under a number of private labels, including Atlas, Western Auto and Pep Boys.) Margins in the replacement-tire market are higher than in the new-car market because tire makers sell to car manufacturers at a discount. And demand has been appreciably higher than in the new-tire market because people are driving their cars longer. While people may postpone purchases of cars, they continue to replace their tires.
Cooper, which was founded 75 years ago, has also prospered through a lean operation. Indeed, its Spartan headquarters in this quiet town in northwestern Ohio look like an old high school, with old-fashioned furniture and linoleum floors. There is little in the way of plush offices and fancy furniture here.
Cooper's strategy has worked well enough that the company's plants have been running at full capacity and the company had to acquire an old Firestone plant in Georgia to meet demand.
''Cooper decided long ago to become a niche player and they have become the quintessential niche player,'' said Dennis J. Byrne, an economics professor at the University of Akron who studies the tire industry. ''They have never tried to become a major tire company. They have built up tremendous dealer loyalty and they are a well-run, low-cost company.''
 
Earnings Spurted in '89
Last year Cooper had net income of $58.2 million, up 41.6 percent from $41 million in 1988. Sales last year came to $866.8 million, a gain of 15.9 percent from $748 million the year before. Meanwhile, Cooper's stock, which traded at $8 to $10 five years ago and about $30 a year ago, closed yesterday at $39.125, up 62.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Some executives of rival tire companies suggest that Cooper's stock price has been raised by takeover speculation. Cooper is the only remaining publicly traded tire company apart from Goodyear. ''There have been a number of takeover rumors about Cooper in the last two to three years,'' a senior executive at Goodyear said.
Already, consolidations have reshaped the tire industry. General Tire was acquired by Continental A. G. of West Germany in 1984, and Firestone was purchased by the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan in 1987.
 
A Potential Suitor
Much of the takeover speculation about Cooper has involved a large foreign tire maker eager to gain a foothold in the replacement-tire market in the United States. The most frequently mentioned potential suitor is Pirelli S.p.A., the Italian tire maker that three years ago lost to Bridgestone in a bidding war for Firestone. Pirelli subsequently bought the smaller Armstrong Tire Company, but is still said to be interested in another acquisition in the United States.
Ivan Gorr, the chairman of Cooper, said that takeover rumors were nothing more than a consequence of being a publicly traded company and that there was little worry among Cooper executives that a bid might emerge. ''Everyone is potentially a takeover target,'' Mr. Gorr said. ''But on the other hand, we are not a company that has resources that are not being used. Our split-up value would not be any greater than the value of the whole. Because we've done well and we're growing, our share price has been at reasonable values.'' Analysts agreed.
William T. Fitzgerald, Cooper's president and chief operating officer, added: ''Anyone interested in acquiring Cooper would have to be really interested in the tire business. Then they would have to be able to demonstrate that they could run the company better than we can. That's a combination that would be hard to find.''
 
Stock Price Defended
Mr. Gorr and others here say the company's share price reflects not so much takeover speculation as profitability, solid strategy and a committed work force that can add to its income by as much as 13.5 percent through profit sharing.
The 60-year-old Mr. Gorr, who became chairman last November after 17 years with the company, takes pride in the fact that Cooper operates only three retail tire stores, unlike Goodyear, Firestone and others that have operated national networks of retail tire centers. ''We have only three stores and they are in cities where we have plants and we use them to train our people,'' Mr. Gorr said. ''But, other than that, all of our tires are sold through independent dealers, who know that we're not in competition with them. Our aim is to assist them, rather than to compete against them.''
Automobile and truck replacement tires account for 80 percent of Cooper's sales. The remaining 20 percent represents sales of industrial products like inner tubes, reinforced hose, and door and window seals.
While Cooper has shown steady gains, some analysts question whether the company's performance might soon be hurt by mounting competition from larger tire producers that, suffering from low growth in sales to auto makers, are looking more to the replacement market.
Mr. Gorr said Cooper could easily counter any potential assaults through a number of strategies, including building upon its small presence in foreign tire markets, now about 4 percent of Cooper's business. ''We are able to respond quickly to what happens in the marketplace,'' Mr. Gorr said. ''We're an aggressive company.''

HEADLINE: First-Quarter Productivity Declined 1%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
The productivity of business in the United States fell an unexpectedly sharp 1 percent in the first quarter of 1990, despite the biggest gains in the manufacturing sector in nearly three years, the Labor Department said today.
The decline in non-farm productivity, a measure of efficiency and competitiveness of American businesses, compared with a revised advance of five-tenths of a percent in the fourth quarter last year.
The drop in the first quarter this year was the largest since a 1.3 percent decline in the first quarter of 1989. The first three months of the year are often sluggish after the holiday season. 
Economists were expecting a modest gain in productivity, which gauges the output each hour of all workers.
The figure is considered of long-term importance for the nation to reduce its trade deficit because American companies must produce more at lower costs.
''It is negative for the trade deficit because productivity weakness means we lose out in competitive terms internationally,'' said Michael Englund, an economist at MMS International Inc.
Manufacturing productivity, frequently stronger than overall results, rose a brisk 4.1 percent, exceeding a 3.1 percent gain in the fourth quarter. It was the strongest climb since the second quarter of 1987, when the index advanced 7.2 percent.
 
One-Time Factors
But one-time factors - the return to work of striking Boeing Company workers, a climb in output at aerospace supply companies idled by the 1989 strike and a rebound in productivity of West Coast companies after the San Francisco earthquake - accounted for much of the spurt, economists said.
After eliminating these factors, the results are gloomy, analysts said.
''The jump in manufacturing productivity is nothing to cheer about,'' said William MacReynolds, a United States Chamber of Commerce economist. ''It reflects a severe cutback in jobs and hours worked, another manifestation of the economic slowdown.''
Manufacturing hours slid 3.2 percent on top of a 4.3 percent drop in the previous quarter. Output rose a meager eight-tenths of a percent against a revised 1.3 percent fourth-quarter decline.
''For the whole economy, the numbers look pretty atrocious,'' said David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc.
Core manufacturing productivity showed no improvement from its average annual rate of about 3 percent, he said.
 
Inflationary Fear
In addition, unit labor costs in the non-farm sector rose by a stiff 4.9 percent on top of a revised 5.5 percent fourth-quarter gain, Mr. Wyss said.
''If this persists, it has to be passed on in prices, which is inflationary,'' he said.
For all business sectors including farming, productivity declined five-tenths of a percent, compared with a four-tenths of a percent climb in the previous quarter.
Hourly compensation in the nonfarm sector rose 3.9 percent, compared with 6 percent in the prior quarter. But after taking inflation into account, real wages fell 3.9 percent against a 1.9 percent fourth-quarter advance, the department said.
Manufacturing compensation rose 3.2 percent, slowing from a 7 percent fourth-quarter climb. But a jump in consumer prices in the first quarter led to an effective 4.5 percent decline in real wages.

HEADLINE: O.E.C.D. Chief On Textiles

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 7

 BODY:
The international drive to reform the world's trading system will fail unless industrial nations agree to scrap their barriers to textile imports from developing countries, the head of the O.E.C.D. said today.
 
Jean-Claude Paye, Secretary
General for the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, said his group's members must back up their words with actions if they want international trade talks, known as the Uruguay Round, to succeed. 
The Uruguay Round, which aims to increase worldwide trade by eliminating barriers to imports, is scheduled to wrap up by the end of this year.
Developing nations, particularly those in Asia, have been pressing rich countries to abolish the so-called Multi-Fiber Arrangement, which governs most world trade in textiles through bilateral tariffs and quotas. It will expire in 1992.
Mr. Paye, who was here to take stock of the United States position before the O.E.C.D.'s annual ministerial meeting at the end of this month, urged industrial nations to get rid of the Multi-Fiber Ararangement.
 
He also called on the United
States and Europe to take steps toward settling their dispute over trade in farm goods when they meet in Paris at the end of this month.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines on Worries About U.S. Unemployment

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday against most major currencies, as the West German mark strengthened and concern continued over the United States unemployment rate.
Gold prices strengthened. Gold rose $1 an ounce, to $371.90, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $371.70, up 40 cents from late Friday. 
Traders said the currency market continued to feel the effects of Friday's unemployment report, which showed the jobless rate rose from 5.2 percent in March to 5.4 percent in April, the highest rate in more than a year.
Andrew Hodge, vice president of corporate treasury services at Bank Brussels Lambert in New York, said the unemployment report ''was not only weak, but it raises the question of whether we're seeing a slowdown in the service sector.''
The report touched off concern that the Federal Reserve would be reluctant to let interest rates rise because of the signs of economic weakness. Mr. Hodge said interest rates, which have risen in recent weeks, have been a prime supporting factor for the value of the dollar.
Higher interest rates tend to make the dollar more valuable relative to other currencies.
Mr. Hodge said the mark rose relative to most other currencies after officials of East and West Germany gave assurances that the imminent merger of the monetary systems of the two nations would not disrupt financial markets or be excessively inflationary.
The mark also continued to be increased by the negotiation of a West German metalworkers' union contract on Friday that was viewed as less inflationary than many had feared, he said.
Against the West German currency, the dollar fell to 1.6556 marks, from 1.6660 late Friday.
In Europe, where London markets were closed for a holiday, the dollar fell against the British pound. One pound cost $1.6710, more expensive than $1.6595 late Friday. In in New York, the pound cost $1.6685, up from $1.6635 late Friday.
In New York trading against the Japanese currency, the dollar bought 158.15 yen, down from 158.30 yen late Friday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.75 yen to close at 157.80 yen. And in Europe, the dollar was quoted at 157.55 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday, included: 1.4310 Swiss francs, down from 1.4430; 5.5615 French francs, down from 5.5930; 1,214.50 Italian lire, down from 1,221.00, and 1.1633 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1629.
In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $371.70, up from $371 late Friday. In Hong Kong, gold rose 34 cents to close at a bid $373.10.
Silver prices also rose. Silver for current delivery traded at $5.016 an ounce, compared with $5 late Friday on the Commodity Exchange.

HEADLINE: Savings Bailout Agency to Allow Large Cuts in Prices of Real Estate

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Seeking to speed up the nation's savings and loan bailout, the Government today agreed to permit big markdowns on the $16.4 billion worth of real estate and other properties it has for sale.
The board of the Resolution Trust Corporation, which manages the day-to-day affairs of the bailout, voted unanimously to permit the agency's local managers and national directors to cut prices on the appraised value of the real estate that it inherited by seizing troubled savings institutions.
The plan allows them to reduce prices immediately by 15 percent below the appraised value on properties that have not sold for six months, and then by another 5 percent on those still not sold after another three months. The vast portion of the assets the agency has to sell is real estate but the properties also include cars, planes, furniture and office equipment.
''We have concluded that holding on to property is too costly to the taxpayer,'' said L. William Seidman, chairman of the trust corporation, after he and the board's three other members voted. The others on the board are Comptroller Robert L. Clarke; T. Timothy Ryan Jr., director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and C. C. Hope Jr., a board member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. ''I think it is time to get this property off the shelves and sell it,'' Mr. Hope said. 
 
Backed by Administration
The price-cutting plan, which has the full backing of the Bush Administration, also permits the agency to reduce by as much as 30 percent below appraised values the prices it can accept on parcels of real estate and other assets sold at auction. That provision is in preparation for the agency's first major auction, which is scheduled for July, when it is planned to sell as much as $300 million in appraised volume.
The plan is the latest in a series of new policies put into effect in recent months by the agency to remedy the slow start of the bailout.
It also represents an attempt by the trust corporation to reduce the loss to the Government. If the plan is as successful as trust agency officials expect it to be, the accelerated sales would reduce the cost of the bailout, thus lowering the nation's budget deficit.
The plan is essentially the idea of Mr. Seidman, who has recently come under pressure from White House officials to leave because of his independence. But he has said he will decide the day of his departure and is proceeding with his ambitious plan to sell 141 institutions at a cost of more than $50 billion by the end of June.
Trust agency officials denied that their new approach to the nation's biggest real estate liquidation would permit investors to make windfall profits on everything from Houston golf courses to Miami hotels and Denver condominiums. But they admitted that their aim was to make the properties more attractive to private-sector buyers.
Mr. Seidman has said for months that the most critical aspect of the agency's task was to liquidate its inventory of troubled real estate efficiently. Seventy percent of the real estate is in the Southwest - primarily in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arizona, and other pockets of major concentration are in Colorado, Florida and California.
 
Fears on Market Effect
But one of the major concerns is whether such cut-rate pricing, which some have warned could lead to dumping of properties, will have a spillover effect on local real estate markets, not only depressing the value of thousands of homes, but causing strains on healthy banks and savings institutions.
In recent months, however, both members of Congress and many industry representatives who initially warned about dumping have muted their criticism and even begun to support a plan to quickly sell off the trust agency's real estate.
''I think a lot of people would expect our reaction to be utter horror, but we are cautiously optimistic that this will work,'' said David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. ''We don't believe they want to dump and realize they need to search for true market values.''
''The objective is the correct one,'' said Donald W. Crocker, president of J. E. Robert Companies, a national real estate firm. ''If, in fact, they have exposed the property to the market adequately and have given people a reasonable opportunity to make offers at the appraised value, and still don't have a deal, it is obvious that the asking price is higher than the market price.''
Mr. Crocker added that he was not concerned about the program depressing further local real estate prices. ''Frankly, my view is that having sales take place and moving excess inventory into private hands so you reduce the amounts of properties that are boarded up, that are fenced in, that are eyesores, is what you need to do to signal to everyone that things are going to start coming back,'' he said.
 
New Flexibility Is Seen
William D. North, executive vice president of the National Association of Realtors, hailed the plan as introducing ''some marketing flexibility.''
'' This is exactly what happens in the live real estate marketplace,'' he said.
Trust agency officials said that in the long run, not selling the assets would keep already weakened real estate markets depressed with little hope of a recovery. ''The overhang of these unsold assets freezes the market in place, and until that overhang is sold you can't break that freeze,'' Mr. Seidman said. The primary reason for selling now at reduced prices is that, so far, eight months into the bailout, very little real estate has been sold and is essentially deterioriating under Govenrment supervision. And for every day the agency holds onto these assets, the losses mount, as does the ultimate cost for the taxpayer of the savings and loan debacle.
Trust agency officials and even many real estate experts have estimated that the cost of not selling the $16.4 billion inventory of single-family homes, undeveloped land, partly completed apartment complexes, vacant office buildings and other assets is as much as 20 percent of its total value a year. That would translate into an added cost to taxpayers of more than $250 million a month, or almost $9 million a day.
''Thus, if you can get 80 cents on a dollar now, it's worth selling it,'' said Lamar Kelley, director of the asset and real estate management division of the trust agency.
 
Revisions Previously Adopted
Before today's new pricing policy, the trust agency had already adopted a series of revisions in its measures for handling the savings and loan bailout. Plagued by bureaucratic infighting and unrealistic approaches to selling institutions, the agency decided to give buyers of sick savings institutions up to two years, rather than six months, to return to the Government assets they deem unsellable.
The agency also reduced the down-payment requirements on assets bought by the public with Government financing to 15 percent, from 25 percent. It began a program to sell insolvent institutions to interested buyers before they are seized by the Government and a plan to assist nearly insolvent but viable savings and loan associations that have a reasonable chance of avoiding failure.
William Taylor, president of the trust agency's oversight board, which rules on broad agency policies, said in a letter to the trust corporataion that he endorsed the new plan and supported ''a higher degree of flexibility and a less mechanical formula in order to expedite asset sales.''
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said the Bush Administration wanted ''the assets to be disposed of as rapidly as possible.''
 
Endorsement in Congress
Representative Bruce Vento, a Minnesota Democrat who is the chairman of the House Banking Committee's trust agency panel, also endorsed the plan. ''The R.T.C. properties have a shelf life problem,'' Mr. Vento said. ''They are not like red wine. They do not get better with age. Quicker sales will mean savings to the Government in the long run.''
Under the two-part plan, if the trust agency has had, for example, an office building to sell for six months with no acceptable offers, it can immediately mark the price of that down by 15 percent below its appraised value, without getting a new appraisal. If the building does not sell after another three months, the price can be cut another 5 percent. But after the total 20 percent drop, a new appraisal is required to reduce the price further.
Single-family homes can be marked down after only four months.
For auctions, the agency can sell any asset that is valued at under $100,000 in a so-called absolute auction, which means that the property is guaranteed to be sold that day to the highest bidder, no matter how low the bid is, provided it has been widely exposed to the market.
However, for properties valued at $100,000 or above, the agency has to set a reserved price below which it will not sell the property. But that price can be as low as 70 percent of the appraised value of the property.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. PANEL VOTES TO ADD $60 BILLION TO POOL FOR LOANS

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
After three years of contentious negotiations, rich and poor countries agreed today on a 50 percent increase in the resources of the International Monetary Fund, giving it the money to speed market-oriented economic policies in Eastern Europe and help third world countries cut their debt burden.
The $60 billion that would be pumped into the 152-nation lending organization after each Government ratifies the accord, a process that could take up to 18 months, would reinforce the I.M.F. as the central pillar of the monetary system. After ratification, the fund could tap as much of that money as needed.
The agreement, reached early this morning after a series of compromises by members of the I.M.F.'s policy-making Interim Committee, also codifies the realignment of world economic power that has taken place since 1945, when the institution was founded. 
 
Britain Drops in Rank
Britain's place as No. 2 in the institutional rankings of voting strength, which it has held throughout the postwar period, is being taken by Japan and West Germany, which will share the ranking.
Britain and France will now share the next position. The United States continues to command the largest vote, about 20 percent, retaining veto power over major decisions.
Since capital contributions are in line with voting strength, the United States would put up 20 percent, or $12 billion, of the $60 billion. Japan and West Germany would each put up 6 percent, and Britain and France 5.5 percent.
''Each country had to put a little water in its wine to come to an agreement here,'' said Michael Wilson, Finance Minister of Canada and the Interim Committee chairman.
Michel Camdessus, the former French central banker who is managing director of the I.M.F., said the institution was now well placed to meet the tremendous challenges of the 1990's.
Among the concessions made by Washington was to bow to a 50 percent rise after initially arguing that no increase was justified and later insisting on a limit of 35 percent.
The Bush Administration also accepted a demand of third world countries that negotiations on the next capital increase begin in 1993, two years earlier than it had wanted.
But because of the dominant role of the United States in the organization, it could easily delay any agreement until it felt a need was justified - as it has done over the latest negotiating cycle.
''After all, we still control the process,'' said a senior Treasury official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The new role for the monetary fund in Eastern Europe, where $715 million of I.M.F. assistance is already backing the Solidarity-led Government of Poland in its program that is practically a cold-turkey conversion to a market economy, is expected to help the Administration sell the capital increase to Congress.
''I.M.F. legislation is always difficult here,'' said Robert Browne, staff director of the House Banking Committee's Subcommittee on International Development, Finance, Trade and Investment Policy.
''But I suspect in the end this will go through because of interest up here in the debt strategy and helping Eastern Europe.''
Because of the complex way the monetary fund works, the money does not increase the Federal budget deficit, but the Bush Administration still faces a battle in Congress, where any form of foreign aid is unpopular. Technically, the money represents an exchange of assets. The United States makes the dollars available on call, but increases its own rights to borrow the currencies of other nations as needed.
The I.M.F. makes short- to medium-term loans, mostly around three years, to countries having trouble making ends meet. To qualify, borrowers must pledge tough economic measures, like cutting subsidies, selling state enterprises or revamping public administrations.
 
Seal of Approval
The I.M.F. helps create the programs and monitors progress. Its seal of approval helps borrowers line up other sources of capital, possibly from the World Bank or commercial banks. If the borrower falls short of meeting the I.M.F. targets, it risks a cutoff that jeopardizes the other forms of assistance.
In the past, some client states, like Zambia, Jamaica, Egypt and Venezuela, have accused the I.M.F. of causing human suffering through austerity programs.
But in recent years such criticism is being heard less. One reason is that many governments have come around to the belief that market-oriented policies improve economic performance. In addition, I.M.F. programs are now being set up with greater focus on economic growth.
The World Bank, which was founded along with the I.M.F. after World War II, makes longer-term loans for big public projects like irrigation, highways, schools, hospitals in developing countries. Its membership, like the I.M.F., recently voted to double its capital.
In a capital-short world, competition is likely to be keen for the new resources.
Among countries expected to ask for money are Poland, for a second loan, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Brazil, Morocco, Argentina and Indonesia.
In the past year the I.M.F. has committed close to $10 billion to Mexico, the Philippines and Venezuela.
Officials say the Soviet Union will not become a member, and therefore able to borrow, until at least the middle of the decade. The timing depends on the progress of market-oriented economic changes undertaken by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
This is the ninth time that the monetary fund has come to members for additional funds, and it represents the largest infusion of all.
 
Behind on Payments
In the deal worked out this morning, the United States and other developed countries won a tough plan to deal with the problem of countries that are far behind in their loan payments to the fund.
Nigeria and India were among countries that objected but then joined the consensus that permitted conclusion of the agreement.
The arrears plan has to be formally accepted by a vote of at least 85 percent of the members if the capital increase is to go forward. This linkage was a sine qua non of the United States.
Eleven countries are more than six months overdue on $4 billion of loans. In the Bush Administration's view, the existence of such large arrears could undermine the credibility of the fund and weaken the case before Congress for the infusion.
The plan calls for delinquent countries to lose their voting rights if 70 percent of the executive board approves, but special efforts would be undertaken to help such countries improve their economic conditions and win their rights back, provided they are willing to impose heavily supervised economic policies.
''It is in the interests of the arrears countries themselves to have clear rules of the game,'' said the French Finance Minister, Pierre Beregovoy, in explaining the plan to reporters today.
He called the suspension of voting rights ''a kind of warning,'' before use of the ''ultimate weapon,'' expulsion from the fund, an action that has yet to be taken against any member.

HEADLINE: BUSH BUDGET CHIEF SOUNDS THE ALARM ON A RISING DEFICIT

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Raising the pressure on Congress to negotiate a budget settlement, the White House warned today that without agreement on major reductions in the deficit, the Government would face mandatory cuts of up to $100 billion this fall.
Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, gave Republican lawmakers projections indicating that the deficit for the 1991 fiscal year could be as high as $165 billion, while the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law requires that it be no more than $64 billion.
 
Suddenly, Higher Stakes
In his original budget proposal to Congress in January, President Bush forecast a deficit of about $100 billion. To reduce that to $64 billion, he called for $36 billion in spending cuts and modest increases in airport landing fees, highway user fees, taxes on phone service and the like.
Over the past two months Mr. Darman has increased the figure on spending cuts to $40 billion to $50 billion. But today's even larger estimate of the deficit and the cuts needed to reduce it seemed intended to alarm legislators into reaching a quick agreement. Today Mr. Darman estimated that the needed cuts would range from $60 billion to $100 billion, depending partly on how the costs of the savings and loan rescue are counted and partly on interest rates and other economic measures. 
 
Fears on Economy
Mr. Darman attributed his gloomier projections to rising interest rates, a decline in Government revenue and the increasing costs of the savings and loan bailout. These reasons offered clues to Mr. Bush's new willingness to discuss tax increases. The Administration fears that a high deficit will cause increased competition for loans as the Government is forced to borrow more, leading to high interest rates that could set off a recession just in time for the 1992 Presidential election.
White House officials said Mr. Bush's concern that the economy might be weakening was deepened by last week's report that unemployment had risen from 5.2 percent to 5.4 percent. He set up a meeting with Congressional leaders on Sunday to plan a ''budget summit'' meeting and on Monday allowed his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, to say tax increases were on the table in those talks. [Page B8.] Normally, tax cuts and increased spending - the opposite of the steps now being discussed at Mr. Bush's urging - are the prescription to revive a sagging economy. But the White House has decided that reducing the deficit is the first priority for sustaining the seven and a half years of economic growth that is a leading factor in Mr. Bush's popularity.
Today's forecasts, outlined in meetings with Republican leaders in the White House and on Capitol Hill, seemed intended to strengthen Mr. Bush's hand in negotiations with Congress over the 1991 budget by raising the stakes for a quick agreement and laying the economic justifications for any tax increases.
Specifically, Mr. Bush's aim today seemed to be to prepare Republican members of Congress for the possibility of a tax increase, a politically unpopular idea in an election year.
 
A Message for Democrats, Too
But the message was also aimed at Democrats in Congress. Mr. Bush, who is hoping to lure the Democrats into a budget deal with his new willingness to discuss tax increases, hopes to avoid any debate over taxes later in the year, when Congressional elections are in full swing.
Mr. Bush is to meet with Democratic and Republican Congressional leaders again on Wednesday, and both sides predicted that the budget summit meeting would be convened soon. To entice the Democrats, who bear scars from Mr. Bush's skill in portraying them as wasteful advocates of higher taxes, Mr. Fitzwater promised today that negotiators could propose any idea ''without being politically castigated for it.''
But both sides are eager to avoid being tarred as tax raisers, and Democrats remain wary on this third day of the White House's budget offensive. By some people's reckoning, Democrats would stand to lose politically by either endorsing a tax increase or helping a White House that is suddenly nervous about a recession. Next, a National Lottery? Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the Republican whip, said a long list of ''revenue increases'' were ''in the mix,'' including a national lottery and a value-added tax, a national sales tax of 1 percent. He said Mr. Bush had not endorsed or rejected any of them, but predicted that an increase in income-tax rates was out of the question, for political reasons if nothing else.
''George Bush is the oldest pro in the village as a political man,'' Mr. Simpson said after the White House meeting. ''No one is going to come out here and say that we're going to do anything at all with income tax.''
Despite White House efforts to reassure the opposition, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, sought to stigmatize the Democrats as the true authors of the current thinking about a tax increase. ''I don't think there's any question in this country which party is addicted to tax increases and which party is reluctantly willing to negotiate,'' he said.
Although some Democrats suggested that some sort of tax increase was inevitable, most seemed intent on making Mr. Bush say so first.
Otherwise, Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona said, ''I don't think the Democrats are going to talk taxes.'' Senator Paul Simon of Illinois said: ''Clearly, there has been an attempt to paint the Democrats as forcing the President's hand on taxes. There's a general consensus that the President has neither defined the problem nor suggested what we should do as a solution.''
In his meetings with Congressional officials today, Mr. Darman said the size of the deficit for 1991 would depend largely on how the savings and loan rescue is handled.
The budget chief said the Administration would have to reduce the deficit by $100 billion to reach the Gramm-Rudman target if the money spent to buy assets of failed savings and loan institutions is calculated as part of the Federal budget.
If it is removed from the calculation, as many lawmakers and Administration officials would like, that would still leave a forced reduction of about $60 billion under the Gramm-Rudman law, Mr. Darman told lawmakers today.
Under the bailout program, the Government buys the assets of failed savings and loan institutions and then tries to sell them, usually at a discount.
 
Bailout Calculations
When money is spent to take over the institutions, it increases Government outlays. When the assets are sold, the proceeds are recorded as income.
Since the purchase and the sale do not necessarily come in the same fiscal year, the Administration and most members of Congress argue that they distort the size of the difference between income and spending.
They say the bailout program should therefore be removed from the Gramm-Rudman calculations.
Although that would reduce the pressure on the Congress and the Administration this year, since it would reduce the size of the deficit, the savings and loan rescue could be removed from the deficit calculation only as part of an overall budget agreement.
Mr. Fitzwater said today that Mr. Bush had outlined three broad objectives for the budget negotiations. He said the President wanted a budget that would maintain economic growth, and an agreement with Congress on a long-range program to reduce the deficit. Some Democrats said such an agreement did not seem likely.
Mr. Bush will also continue to argue for two items he and Ronald Reagan have long called vital: a Constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, and the power to veto individual items in a spending bill without rejecting the entire measure.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Kenyan Dispute Grows a Little Testier

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, May 8

 BODY:
A Kenyan Cabinet member accused the United States today of supporting the opposition, another step in the dispute between the United States and Kenya over the future of democracy in this nation. The American Ambassador denied the accusation. 
The Minister for Livestock Development, Elijah Mwangale, was quoted this morning in The Kenya Times, the newspaper of the nation's sole political party, as saying that he had information to the effect that Kenyan dissidents in the United States were using the Ambassador to pour money into the country to disrupt it.
Mr. Mwangale said Kenya would ''not tolerate treasonable activities by Americans living in Kenya.''
The American envoy, Smith Hempstone, denied that the United States was supporting Kenyan dissidents.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Hempstone characterized Mr. Mwangale's statements as ''arid nonsense.'' The envoy added, ''It is well known that if anyone knows about illegal money, he knows about it.'' He did not explain what he meant.
Last week, Mr. Hempstone said Congress favored economic aid to countries that ''nourish democratic institutions, defend human rights and practice multiparty politics.''
President Daniel arap Moi took exception to the comments and warned that foreign diplomats should not meddle in the internal affairs of Kenya.
A traditional ally, Kenya received $65 million in economic aid last year, one of Washington's largest grants in sub-Saharan Africa.

HEADLINE: EUROPEANS WEIGH FUND TO AID EAST

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 6

 BODY:
The 12 European Community nations are discussing a plan to help Eastern Europe break away from barter-based trading and start trading in convertible currencies as Western countries do, European officials say.
The idea is to create a revolving fund of dollars or other hard currencies from which Eastern European nations could borrow to settle their trade debts with each other. These loans would be repaid when the borrower earned a trade surplus.
Such a fund would enable Eastern European countries to stop using the inefficent trading system, coordinated by the organization known as Comecon, that links them with each other and the Soviet Union. Instead, they would start exchanging goods at world prices paid in convertible currency. This would promote the competitiveness of their economies and help sustain Eastern European trade. 
 
Control vs. Market Forces
All Eastern European currencies, like the Polish zloty and the Soviet ruble, are called soft, or nonconvertible, because the exchange of those currencies is governed by strict rules and controlled by the Government. Western currencies like the American dollar or the West German mark are all hard, or convertible, meaning that their value is determined by market forces and they can be freely exchanged for other currencies at prevailing market rates.
In a recent interview, the Italian Foreign Minister, Gianni De Michelis, discussed the European plan for a such a hard-currency fund, similar to the European Payments Union the United States created to assist Western Europe's recovery after World War II.
But he said the plan had run into difficulties because the Soviet Union also wanted such benefits and had warned that any attempt to exclude it would be regarded as ''an unfriendly political act.'' The community's position is that extending the plan to cover the Soviet Union would be too costly.
The Italian Foreign Minister said the warning reflected the Soviet Government's ''desperate need'' for Western assistance in modernizing its economy.
The Soviet warning creates ''a political dilemma'' for the community, he said. A quarrel now over trade and finance would sour relations with Moscow just when the West wants the Soviet leadership to accept a united Germany's inclusion in NATO and other changes.
 
'It Would Be Expensive'
Mr. De Michelis said, ''It would be expensive to replace all Comecon and guarantee the convertibility of the ruble.''
Senior Eastern European economic officials attending a United Nations conference said the community idea, though still at the exploratory stage, had been well received in Eastern Europe. But they also said it would be difficult and expensive to include the Soviet Union.
Dr. Karel Dyba, director of the Institute of Economics in Prague and an adviser to the Czechoslovak Government, said such a fund would help Eastern European nations ''stop exchanging shoddy goods and start trading in real money.'' This, he went on, would prevent ''a massive destruction of East European trade, leading to recession.''
Dr. Dyba said a pool of about $1 billion would probably be enough to finance Eastern European trade balances in convertible currency. But if the Soviet Union is included, he said, the cost will rise to ''many billions.''
He said the Soviet Union would probably have a massive trade surplus with Eastern Europe if trade was measured in dollars, because the main Soviet exports to Eastern Europe are oil and raw materials, while the goods it imports in exchange tend to be of poor quality and unsalable in the West.
 
Financing Modernization
The European Community, the United States and other Western countries have pledged $1 billion in aid to Poland and Hungary and are setting a new bank to finance modernization of Eastern European and Soviet industry.
In an interview devoted to the changes in Europe, the Italian Foreign Minister said the community and the Eastern Europeans had reached substantial agreement on the ''political architecture'' of a more unified continent linking Eastern European nations more firmly to the community.
All agree, he said, that the Eastern European nations should join the 21-nation Council of Europe and accept the jurisdiction of its Human Rights Court by 1991. The council was established in 1949 to promote democracy and unity in Europe. Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia have already started negotiations on membership, and Romania will soon do so shortly.

HEADLINE: U.S. WILL OPPOSE AID IN OZONE PLAN

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has decided to oppose an international plan that would grant $100 million to developing nations to drastically reduce the use of chemicals that are depleting the earth's protective ozone layer, officials said today.
A State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Richard G. Darman, director of Management and Budget, and John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, insisted on the decision to oppose the plan over the objection of Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly. The decision is regarded by officials as a crucial part of President Bush's environmental policy but one that could eventually be reversed. 
Representatives of the United States and other nations are are expected to take up the ozone proposal, which has strong support in Europe, Wednesday in Geneva. The meeting is designed to lay the groundwork for a conference in London next month that would strengthen a 1987 treaty that restricts the chemicals, cholorofluorocarbons, or CFC's, and eliminate production of the industrial chemicals outright.
 
Emphasis on Economic Growth
The State Department and the Environmental Protection Agency are trying to persuade President Bush to reverse his decision in time for the London conference.
President Bush has repeatedly pledged that his concern for the environment, but critics maintain that his words are stronger than his actions. Mr. Darman and Mr. Sununu have emphasized economic growth over environmental considerations in previous debates on such issues.
The proposed prohibition on CFC production would require the development of substitutes for their use in refigerants, solvents, foam insulation and a wide variety of other products.
Scientists say the chemicals persist in the atmosphere, destroying ozone, which shields the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Such radiation can cause skin cancer and immunological problems in humans, harm wildlife and crops.
 
Use of World Bank Suggested
India and China, which together make up more than a third of the world's population, never signed the 1987 treaty, the Montreal Protocol.
India informed American oficials last month that it would not participate in the ozone treaty without substantial financial and technical aid from the industrialized countries. The Indians informed the United States that they and the Chinese would procede with plans to continue CFC production. They also said that without such aid not only would developing countries refuse to join in the ozone treaty but that a number of countries that had already signed would withdraw. They did not identify the countries.
Mr. Darman reportedly opposed any financial aid to developing countries to help them with environmental programs. Mr. Sununu was said to suggest that the World Bank could finance such programs.
White House officials were also said to have discussed the possibility of denying World Bank loans to countries that refused to sign the ozone treaties.

HEADLINE: Yes, Cut the Deficit. Then What?

 BODY:
Will the budget deadlock finally be broken this time? President Bush's willingness to hold wide-open talks with the leaders of Congress is encouraging. But ultimate success depends on an agreement that goes beyond honest deficit reduction and addresses urgent national needs.
Preoccupation with the deficit-reduction process has been unavoidable. But it distracts from the budget's purpose - to shape policy. Conditions are ripe to do just that. Eased East-West tensions invite cutbacks in defense. The question is no longer whether to trim, but how. At the same time, unanticipated developments in the economy force a fresh look at the whole range of budget issues. Rising interest rates and drooping tax collections have sent the deficit back up again. 
To shrink next year's deficit to the $64 billion target in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law would require severe spending cuts that are unacceptable to the Administration and Congress alike. So despite his distaste for new taxes, even Mr. Bush now seems to be willing to consider them.
For a while, political Washington's attention will be riveted on this opening for tax increases, and understandably so. It's a dramatic new element in the budget debate, long overdue. Political realism suggests that the increases won't be large and won't quickly wipe out the deficit. But with added revenue, and savings in defense and entitlement programs, there will at last be funds to ease the deficit paralysis. The more difficult question remains: How should the Government use them?
What's needed is a plan that looks beyond one year and one arbitrary target. For too long, domestic needs have been shortchanged by spending for military security. The President and Congress now have the opportunity to focus on social and economic security.
Two prime contenders for better funding are programs to give disadvantaged children a better start in life and repair the nation's infrastructure. But there's pressure for more of everything. Genuine needs for education, drug programs, AIDS research and Medicaid confront powerful interests that want still more for space, technology and farm programs.
The new negotiations won't settle details, but it's essential that there be broad agreement in good faith. Democrats are properly wary of being tagged once more as the advocates of tax-and-spend. The Administration, for its part, wants assurance that Congress will honor whatever agreement emerges on spending cuts.
Such mutual suspicion will only keep both sides from seizing the rare opportunity that presents itself. They can break the paralysis of budget battles, year upon year, or they can concoct yet another smoke-and-mirrors solution that solves nothing.

HEADLINE: Congress Provides Open Forum on Soviet Data

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In his April 27 column, ''Intelligence Fiasco,'' William Safire misleadingly criticizes the Joint Economic Committee for publishing Central Intelligence Agency estimates of the size of the Soviet economy and defense establishment.
The J.E.C. makes available a wide range of research on the Soviet economy, including declassified reports from both the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency. All Western estimates of Soviet economic conditions are uncertain, due to Soviet secrecy, questionable official statistics and the absence of market prices and a freely convertible currency. Within our Government, the C.I.A. has the greatest capacity to monitor the Soviet economy. By publishing its estimates, the J.E.C. offers researchers, government experts, scholars and the media the opportunity to examine the intelligence community's views. 
Mr. Safire did not mention that the J.E.C. has invited critics of the C.I.A. to testify and contribute to the debate. Five of the eight economists he cites favorably have been invited to testify. Every three or four years, the committee publishes a massive study of the Soviet economy.
The committee has never taken a position in the debate. At times, J.E.C. members have expressed serious disagreement with C.I.A. positions, and J.E.C. members express differing opinions among themselves in interpreting C.I.A. evidence. Mr. Safire says the C.I.A.'s ''views were expressed'' in a letter to the editor from the staff of the J.E.C. in response to one of his previous columns. The committee did not write to either the editors or to Mr. Safire on this matter and when asked, Mr. Safire could not produce any such letter.
There is no hard evidence that proves or disproves the C.I.A. or its critics, and the effects of the military burden on the Soviet economy have not been fully understood. That is why the committee has provided an open forum for widely differing views.

HEADLINE: Bush's Second Chance on China

BYLINE: By Winston Lord; Winston Lord was Ambassador to China from 1985 to 1989.

 BODY:
June 3 marks the first anniversary of the massacre of innocents in the streets of Beijing.
It is also the deadline for President Bush to decide whether to recommend continued most-favored-nation trade treatment for China.
This irony poses a dilemma - and offers a major opportunity - for the Administration. In one stroke, President Bush can close the breach between Capitol Hill and the White House on China policy, forge a common American front and promote Chinese human rights and U.S. national interests. 
He should invite Congress to join him in crafting a joint statement for the first weekend in June. The essential components:
* An eloquent tribute to the Chinese who demonstrated and died for the aspirations America has supported elsewhere in the world.
* Extension of most-favored-nation trade status for one year, with the openly expressed purpose of supporting progressive forces in China, protecting concrete American interests and maintaining the framework for future American-Chinese relations. (This status entitles China to the standard treatment that the U.S. grants almost all other trading partners.)
* Explicit reaffirmation of such existing measures as the suspension of military ties, the freeze on liberalization of technology exports and the postponement of World Bank loans.
* Determination to move ahead on related issues, such as positive consideration of Taiwan's application to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and enlarging future immigration opportunities for Hong Kong citizens.
* A substantial increase in Voice of America funding to overcome jamming of programs beamed to China.
* A meeting between President Bush and selected Chinese studying in America to exchange views on China and American policy.
There are solid grounds for revoking most-favored-nation status.
Both the preamble to the relevant statute and its legislative history include concerns for human rights.
The situation in China has greatly deteriorated this past year: executions, purges, imprisonment, surveillance, political indoctrination, the rollback of many economic reforms - all cloaked in the Big Lie.
The xenophobic regime has launched attacks on Western values and crude invective against the U.S. It muzzles foreign correspondents and jams the Voice of America.
Revoking most-favored-nation treatment, which would increase pressures on Beijing, would be the strongest signal of censure to date.
There is also the specific legislative criterion of free emigration. While many are still allowed to leave China, new restrictions have curtailed others, including students and scholars. Obviously, both dissidents in our embassy and tens of thousands in jail cannot move. Countless Chinese have no chance of getting exit papers or dare not even try.
In any case, the most potent argument for revocation is that extension of most-favored-nation status could be misconstrued by China's hardliners. In internal policy debates, they could argue that they can repress and reap commercial benefits, too.
Unfortunately, this view has been reinforced by Bush Administration actions: its unrequited conciliatory gestures; the double standard between China and support for democracy in Eastern Europe, Latin America and South Africa.
Beijing might conclude that there is no limit to our toleration of its abuses. So might Mikhail Gorbachev, as he contemplates his policies toward the Baltic states and his summit meeting with Mr. Bush on the eve of June 3.
For these reasons, simply extending most-favored-nation treatment would be a grave mistake. If the other steps outlined above are not undertaken, this trade status should be ended.
On balance, the arguments favor extension of most-favored-nation treatment - if imbedded in a larger package. Termination would trigger serious consequences.
First, it would hurt the wrong people in China, reducing their leverage in the struggle for its future.
The most severe impact would be on the sectors we wish to support -entrepreneurs, business people, Chinese in the coastal areas and open cities. They are the ones most dependent on foreign trade and investment and most committed to reform and contact with the outside world.
The regime, meanwhile, would use America as a handy scapegoat for China's floundering economy.
Second, termination would undermine Hong Kong. Seventy percent of China's $12 billion in exports to the U.S. passes through there. Millions working in Hong Kong and southern China would be affected. As Hong Kong residents look with trepidation toward 1997, when Britain turns Hong Kong over to China, this is no time to deal them additional economic and psychological blows.
Third, it would harm many Americans. Consumers would pay more for certain products; importers would need to look elsewhere; exporters would face retaliation by China. Business people in China and Hong Kong would lose markets and investments, perhaps permanently. Competitors in Japan, Europe, South Korea, Taiwan and elsewhere - where governments would not follow our lead - would profit, at America's expense.
Fourth, it would undercut our long-term objectives. While granting China new privileges would be wrong, we should be wary of dismantling frameworks like most-favored-nation treatment and the related overall trade agreement that were carefully constructed during the 1980's.
Once commercial and personal links with progressive forces are severed, repairing them would be difficult. We will need them in place when a more moderate regime allows us to resume full cooperation. That time is not far away.
President Bush has an opportunity to heal wounds on the single foreign policy issue where he has provoked heated debate and about which he may care most deeply. He can align himself solidly with the Chinese people for the first time and restore the bipartisan approach that marked our China policy for two decades through five Administrations. Congress, torn on the trade issue, would respond positively to a Bush initiative that made clear where this nation stood. Together, the President and Congress can send a powerful message to the transitional leaders in Beijing and to the Chinese people who herald a more hopeful future for their country.

HEADLINE: Adirondacks Report Upsets Residents

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OLD FORGE, N.Y., May 8

 BODY:
After holding hearings from Long Island to Buffalo, the Commission on the Adirondacks in the 21st Century released a final report today in Albany, where the fate of its proposals for preserving the area's wilderness will largely be determined.
People here in this North Country village are hoping for a say in the process, which they say will determine the fate of their livelihoods.
''The Adirondacks are a special and a different place, and of course protecting that is a good idea,'' said Don Kelly, the zoning officer for this village and the surrounding town of Webb in the southwestern Adirondacks. ''But there's also a fatalistic view here that we'll really wind up having no say about our future.'' 
Apprehension over the commission's report is high here and in many of the other 104 communities within the ''blue line'' that defines the Adirondack Park. The pace of new home construction, the amount of privately owned land, even the size of merchants' signs and the noise from motorboats, would all be curtailed under the sweeping recommendations of the commission.
 
'A Last Clear Chance'
The panel, appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, concluded that New York State had ''a last clear chance'' to preserve the wilderness character of the Adirondacks. And it proposed a one-year moratorium on nearly all construction within the park, new restrictions on building, and further state purchases of private land.
Today, as many environmental groups rushed to embrace the panel's recommendations, some local leaders were skeptical. Despite the report's endorsement of ''revitalization'' programs for Adirondack hamlets and more state aid for the health, education and housing of year-round residents, they said, the larger effects of the report's proposals could be crippling.
George P. Hiltebrant, the Webb town supervisor, said that the zoning restrictions and a proposed one-year moratorium on new construction permits on nearly all lakefront property would be ''economically damaging,'' to the town.
''I think the environment is an important thing and we have to protect it,'' he added. ''But to just say 'Stop!' is going too far.''
 
'Great Open Spaces'
The commission's chairman, Peter A. A. Berle, said that the program outlined today would benefit people in the park by fostering both ''great open spaces and dynamic hamlets'' that would keep the Adirondacks ''unique in the American scene'' for generations.
The primary reason for the tension here is that the Adirondacks, while frequently referred to as the largest park in the lower 48 states, are not a park in the sense of Yellowstone or Yosemite: About 58 percent of the park is in private hands, though much of that must be preserved as forest under existing regulations.
While the amount of private ownership would decrease to 48 percent under land acquisitions proposed by the commission, the question remains how public concerns about protecting the park's overall character should be reconciled with private-property rights.
The commission is now advancing recommendations that, through the state's purchase of conservation easements and a program of transferable development rights, would channel most new construction into about one-tenth of the park's 6 million acres.
 
Construction Has Soared
That would clearly slow the current pace of development. But the costs of such restrictions, both to the state and to the people who make their living here, are now likely to be at the heart of the debate that will determine whether the proposals will become law.
In the town of Webb, construction of new homes has soared in recent years, and many of the town's 1,700 year-round residents depend on that construction for their paychecks.
The lakefront construction moratorium would have an immediate impact, said Mr. Kelly, the zoning officer. Nearly one-third of the 249 new residences constructed in the past four years are on the Fulton chain of lakes, and several more projects are pending.
''The people who sit on our town boards are as concerned about overdevelopment as anybody else,'' said Mr. Hiltebrant, the town supervisor. ''But to have more rules imposed from the outside is not fair to us.''
 
Public Presentations
A realtor in town, Chuck Eldridge, said that new restrictions in the Adirondack Park could drive up already escalating prices of real estate, aggravating the housing problems of year-round residents and penalizing others who look for a summer place here.
The recommendations will now be the subject of public presentations across the state. How soon or even whether they will go before the Legislature is largely up to Governor Cuomo.
The Governor, who charged the commission with finding a way to head off an era of ''unbridled land speculation and unwarranted development that may threaten the unique open space and wilderness character of the region,'' did not comment today.
Several lawmakers have said he is likely to gauge public reaction to the report before deciding whether to press for adoption of any of the major recommendations. A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, Gary G. Fryer, said the Governor planned to back implementation of ''at least some'' of the proposals.
 
Battle Lines Being Drawn
While the Governor and legislative leaders remain consumed with the long-overdue state budget, battle lines are already being drawn over the report among private lobbying groups.
The Adirondack Fairness Coalition, an 800-member group of residents that says it seeks to balance park protection with economic growth, criticized the report today for ignoring economic concerns and said it contained ''some of the most radical controls ever proposed for private land'' in America.
''Adirondackers aren't paving mountaintops,'' said the group's director, Andrew Halloran. ''There is no development crisis.''
But the executive director of the nonprofit Environmental Planning Lobby, Lee Wasserman, praised the report as a ''watershed document.''
''Anyone who loves the Adirondacks, who knows how lucky New Yorkers are to have this resource within our borders, has to be pleased,'' Mr. Wasserman said. ''The steady pattern of developmental abuse could not be sustained without irreparably damaging what makes the Adirondacks unique.

HEADLINE: Experts on Hill Sift Taxes to See Which to Raise

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
As the White House and Congress lay plans for formal budget negotiations, fiscal experts on Capitol Hill are beginning to examine a long list of possible tax increases, ''user fees'' and tax-loophole closings that could yield $25 billion or more for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, and even larger amounts in future years.
The options theoretically encompass everything from a national sales tax to eliminating the home mortgage interest deduction. But most lawmakers believe that political and economic realities have already severely circumscribed their choices.
Republicans say that if they are going to accept tax increases, they must have guarantees that the new revenue will be used to reduce the deficit, not to finance domestic spending. Democrats say that to produce a tax package large enough to make negotiations worthwhile, there are only three real revenue sources: the income tax, energy taxes and excise taxes. 
And members of both parties remain skeptical that an agreement can be reached, either on spending cuts in popular programs like agriculture and Medicare or on tax increases.
 
Some Likely Combinations
At this preliminary stage, the most likely combinations of revenue sources appear to be an oil import fee, probably coupled with some type of gasoline or energy tax, a capital gains tax cut combined with an increase in the top income tax rate for high-income taxpayers, and excise taxes on wine, beer, liquor and cigarettes.
Two other potential revenue sources may figure in the tax negotiations: a levy on securities transactions similar to the one imposed in Japan and in many European countries, and taxes on fringe benefits like employer-provided health insurance plans.
Despite the White House contention that budget negotiations will be ''unfettered'' by any preconditions, lawmakers in both parties expect the Bush Administration to draw the line at raising income-tax rates and to confine real bargaining over tax increases to items like excise taxes and fees on various Government services and activities.
The exception may be a rise in the top tax rate for high-income taxpayers, a proposal that is likely to be the Democratic price for agreeing to President Bush's proposal to reduce the capital gains tax rate.
 
Cutting the Gains Rate
Capital gains, the profits on sales of stocks, real estate and other investments, are now taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, either 28 percent or 33 percent for most taxpayers. The Administration contends that cutting the gains rate would raise money by encouraging investors to sell off their existing assets and by stimulating new investment and economic growth.
Under the Administration's proposal, in 1990 profits on an asset held for one year or more would be taxed at a rate of 19.6 percent. In 1992, the asset would have to be held two years to qualify for that most preferential rate. In 1993 and thereafter, it would have to be held three years. Taxpayers who hold assets for shorter periods would receive proportionately smaller breaks, but would still pay less than they do now.
Democrats contend that reducing the capital gains rate would benefit only the wealthiest taxpayers. They insist that any proposal to reduce it must be accompanied by measures to insure fairness for lower-income taxpayers.
One possibility is a plan to eliminate the ''bubble'' in the current tax rate system, which allows wealthy taxpayers to pay a top rate of 28 percent on their income, while taxpayers with lower income are taxed at a top rate of 33 percent.
 
Higher Taxes on Cigarettes
The least politically painful tax increase would involve the Federal tax on cigarettes and alcohol. While such taxes hit consumers directly in their pocketbooks, lawmakers in both parties say the new health consciousness means it would be both good policy and good politics to raise such taxes now.
Cigarettes are now taxed at 16 cents a pack. Doubling that tax, the Congressional Budget Office says, would raise nearly $14 billion over the next five years.
Beer, wine and liquor are taxed at different rates. The beer tax, which has not been increased since 1951, comes to about 16 cents a six-pack. Wine taxes, now 17 cents a gallon, have also not been raised since 1951. Taxes on distilled spirits, which were last raised in 1985, are now $12.50 a proof gallon.
Adjusting the beer, wine and liquor tax rates so that they are all based on alcohol content and raising them to $16 per proof gallon would bring in an estimated $37 billion in the next five years.
 
Energy and Environment Taxes
Such an increase would translate to 81 cents for a six-pack of beer, 70 cents for a bottle of wine and $2.54 for a bottle of liquor, the Congressional Budget Office says.
Energy and environment taxes involve dozens of potential revenue raisers, from taxes on polluting chemicals in the air and water to those on gasoline, imported oil and utility bills.
The Federal tax on gasoline, last raised in 1982, is now 9 cents a gallon, and the Congressional Budget Office calculates that each 1-cent increase would raise $1 billion for the Treasury.
Imposing a fee of $5 a barrel on imported oil would raise $8.5 billion in 1991 and nearly $47 billion over five years, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.
Congressional tax and budget say there may also be discussion of taxing a host of fringe benefits provided by employers, from health and life insurance to parking and athletic- club fees. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the current tax exemption for employer-paid health and life insurance premiums will cost the Treasury of $55 billion in 1991.

HEADLINE: Bush Seems Concerned That Economy May Slip

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Just when it seemed clear that the economy had once again avoided sliding into recession, thereby further confounding those who still profess belief in business cycles, President Bush appears to have decided that the seven-and-a-half-year expansion is, in fact, at risk.
Within hours after his top economic adviser received word on Thursday of a surprisingly weak April labor market, the President phoned the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell, to propose a budget summit meeting at which no subject, not even higher taxes, would be excluded. (The chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, now Michael J. Boskin, receives job data and other figures the day before they are released to the public.) To be sure, one statistical report -albeit probably the most important indicator of monthly economic performance - is not by itself weighty enough to prompt a major shift in policy. In this case, moreover, the lack of real job growth last month resulted perhaps as much from exceptionally warm weather as from the beginnings of an oft-predicted but elusive business downturn. 
But Friday's report came at a particularly inappropriate time, coinciding with ever-escalating estimates of the cost to the Government of rescuing savings and loan depositors, the arrival in town of foreign central bankers and finance ministers for a meeting of the Group of Seven industrial nations and a disconcerting rise in inflation.
 
Widespread Pessimism
In addition, there is this week's giant Treasury financing, uncertainty surrounding the economic restructuring of Eastern Europe, the woes of the real estate and ''junk bond'' markets and, according to at least one poll taker, widespread pessimism among consumers.
There are also domestic political stirrings that may have underscored the worst fears of the Bush White House: that the economy could have a sinking spell, if not in this election year, then as President Bush is seeking re-election in 1992.
Not all of the economic forces, of course, point in the same direction. If, for example, the American consumer goes on strike, this would reduce anxiety over inflation. Then the Federal Reserve would presumably be able to push interest rates down instead of wondering whether it should push them up further.
Tuesday's meeting of the Fed's chief monetary policy body, however, is expected to result in neither tightening nor easing of money. This is because the economy itself is emitting mixed signals.
This, indeed, has been the case throughout much of the recovery that began in late 1982, an expansion already the longest in peacetime and approaching the record set in the 1960's, during the Vietnam War.
The lack of a widespread recession recently has prompted some to wonder whether the traditional business cycle - booms that end in inflation-arresting busts - has become a relic.
Most economists think not, though they suspect that slumps may now be less severe and less frequent. Among the reasons cited are improved control of inventories, increasingly credible monetary policies that reassure business and investors that inflation will not be allowed to get out of control, greater world economic integration, the fruits of techology, tax cuts and greater fiscal restraint, even in the United States.
''We don't see the inevitability of the repetition of past cycles,'' Ernesto Hernandez-Cata, an economist for the International Monetary Fund, said the other day.
Economists and some politicians have also concluded that expansions die not of old age but of bad policy. But it is not quite clear what this might be, particularly in the present circumstances.
Ordinarily, President Bush's implied acceptance of tax increases, whatever multi-syllable word is employed to disguise them, is not the medicine to prescribe if recession seems to loom. The simple antidote would be lower taxes, not higher.
In this case, President Bush and his advisers may well be calculating that a tax increase, combined with accompanying spending cuts that the Administration could presumably exact, would keep interest rates at levels that would sustain economic growth and not choke it off. Rates assume increasing importance as Government borrowing swells for the savings and loan rescue. The Treasury is already in the embarrassing position of having to borrow each year all the money needed to pay interest on its huge $3 trillion cumulative debt.
 
Recession Would Be Costly
A recession, the Administration must also figure, cannot be tolerated for this would reduce revenues - they are already falling somewhat short - while raising outlays. There would simply be less economic activity to tax and spending would rise automatically to pay for such cushions as unemployment insurance.
Yet it may well be that the Administration is simply playing it safe, that the economy is not really at risk and that the decline in private-sector jobs and the rise in the unemployment rate last month will prove an aberration.
That is still the bet of most independent economists who point to various other recent figures - on gross national product, factory orders, the Government's forecasting index and others - to argue that the expansion will continue.

At Wesleyan, a Day to Reflect on Racial Tension

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIDDLETOWN, Conn., May 8

 BODY:
Hundreds of Wesleyan University students gathered this afternoon on the broad campus green to sit and tell stories of hate and fear.
Organized by students as ''Unity Day,'' this was an attempt at catharsis after a month of rising racial tensions and violence against property, including the firebombing of the president's office a month ago and vandalism last Friday that left a dining room at the Center for Afro-American Studies spray painted with racial slurs and threats.
With the administration's blessing, many classes were canceled today and the day's curriculum became instead what one student called a ''community soul-search.'' Some spoke of their hopes, others of their fears. 
''We don't know who wrote that stuff - we don't know if he's sitting here, or over there, or if he will get into your room at night,'' said Andrea Harris, a black freshman who had organized one group of students into a discussion of violence against women in general and black women in particular. ''It's really hitting home how dangerous it is.''
 
Sense of Identity Destroyed
Faculty members, administrators and students said the increase in racial strife here has done far more than destroy the end-of-term calm at Wesleyan, long considered one of the most aggressive elite private institutions in recruiting minority students and incorporating cultural and ethnic diversity into the curriculum. Many people spoke of the damage to the school's sense of identity as an island of tolerance.
Officials say about 10 percent of Wesleyan's 2,700 students are black; 9 percent are Asian-American, and about 4 percent are Hispanic. The university has also incorporated cultural differences into mainstream courses.
''If you studied modern dance at Wesleyan, that meant modern black dance along with Balanchine and others,'' said Robert G. O'Meally, an English professor who left Wesleyan last year after 11 years for Barnard College in New York City. ''If you studied American literature, it was Richard Wright along with Hemingway. It's a very special place.''
But now there are questions that have fed suspicions and fueled tensions. No one yet knows, for example, why the firebombs were thrown or who threw them. And many students and teachers said that the attention paid to the violence has overshadowed larger concerns about the departure of black professors like Mr. O'Meally, and the long-term direction of the university under its new president, William M. Chace.
 
Paring the Curriculum
Mr. Chace, who took over in late 1988, replaced Colin G. Campbell, who was president for 18 years during a period that some faculty members described as a sort of golden age. Almost immediately, Mr. Chace announced that economic pressures would require a paring of Wesleyan's 997-course curriculum.
About the same time, said the chairwoman of the Afro-American Studies Program, Erness Brody, ''a dramatic exodus'' of black professors began. Over the last two academic years, 6 of the 11 black faculty members who were either tenured or eligible for tenure left.
Mr. Chace, who met with students on Monday for what a school spokesman, Bobby Wayne Clark, called ''four hours of unadulterated rage,'' said today in an interview that the faculty members who left did so for personal reasons or for jobs at larger or more prestigious institutions against which Wesleyan could not compete.
 
No Arrests
Professor Brody, in an open letter also signed by eight other black faculty members, said the university should have done more.
''If the administration had a coherent policy to retain minority faculty, they might have remained,'' said the letter, which was published in a recent issue of the campus newspaper, The Argus.
On April 7, while Mr. Chace's office in the South College building was closed and unoccupied, someone threw a bottle containing a flammable liquid through a window, causing about $60,000 in damage. A few weeks later, another firebomb was thrown against the wall of the rowing team's boathouse.
Although no one was arrested in either crime, students and faculty members said that suspicion quickly focused on a loosely organized group of vocal black students who had spoken most harshly against Mr. Chace, and who had seemed at times to be condoning violent measures.
 
'A Larger Problem'
The spray-paint incident last week, in the basement of the Malcolm X House on the edge of campus, further raised the level of recrimination and emotion by putting the question of the bombings in the crudest racial terms. ''Nigger bombs,'' was written on one wall. The writing on another wall made an obscene reference to black women that was interpreted by many students as an invitation to rape.
Mr. Chace said today that he considered the latest incident a cynical and calculated provocation rather than an actual statement of racism.
''The perpetrator knew the kind of dissent and chaos he would be sowing on campus,'' he said.
For many students today, the message - repeated in many cases almost like a dirge - was that Wesleyan was simply caught in the same rising tide of intolerance that has been witnessed on other campuses across the country. For all the promise of its curriculum, its history of diversity and the green New England ambiance of its campus, the university cannot escape the larger forces of society, they said.
''It's a larger problem,'' said Julie Doar, a senior in Afro-American studies and one of the organizers of Unity Day. ''But you have to do something. I want people to just let people be.''

HEADLINE: In Looks, a Sense of Racial Unity

BYLINE: By LENA WILLIAMS

 BODY:
YOUNG Americans seem to be looking more alike these days. And that's not all. Young people of different ethnic backgrounds are acting and sounding a lot alike, too.
White males are wearing dreadlocks, fade haircuts and African medallions; black men and women are going blond and sporting Metallica T-shirts. There are black Valley girls and white home girls.
Large lips are the latest Hollywood look, so some white women are fattening theirs up with silicon injections. Meanwhile some black women are painstakingly making up their lips to achieve a thinner, more typically Caucasian lip line. 
Michael Bolton, a white pop musician with a soul-inflected, blues-based vocal style, has beaten out black challengers for New York Music Awards' prestigious soul music title. And the hip street vernacular of black youths has become so mainstream that even Madison Avenue executives are using it in television commercials.
''I call it the darkening of white America,'' said Dr. Charles W. Thomas, a professor of urban studies and planning at the University of California at San Diego who is writing a book on the black-white crossover phenomenon. ''What we are seeing is white people being totally engulfed in black life style and behavioral patterns. It started with the music. Now you see it in fashion, religion and expression.''
At the same time, Dr. Thomas and other experts in black culture noted that more blacks are adopting white styles and social patterns than at any time since the early 1960's. They say many blacks may not realize that in imitating whites, who in many ways are imitating black culture, they in essence are reclaiming their own culture.
Dr. Thomas said, ''We are seeing the black middle class doing what E. Franklin Frazier, the black sociologist, accused them of doing in the 1950's: 'poor imitations of whites' without understanding that they are reclaiming what is already theirs.''
Alana Valencia, a 15-year-old black high school student who lives in Washington, is critical of the trend. ''We call them the 'Wannabees,' '' she said. ''The black kids who 'wanna be' white and the white kids who 'wanna be' black.''
The trend, which started in the mid-1980's, is predominant among young people, which has led to speculation that it is a fad. Some, however, believe the phenomenon is an expansion of a cultural exchange that dates to the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920's and 30's, when whites flocked to Harlem nightclubs and dance halls, regarding black life as exotic.
But the degree to which blacks and whites have immersed themselves into each others' culture and life styles, at a time when many cities seem to be more racially divided and reports of race-based hate crimes are on the rise, has even some of the experts scratching their heads.
''I've been puzzled by this,'' said Todd Gitlin, a professor of sociology at the University of California at Berkeley. ''It's kind of like, one color fits all. I don't quite get it, although it's not unprecedented. Whites, no matter what their racial feelings, have tried to look darker for some time. This new phenomenon is in that tradition.''
Dr. Alvin Poussaint, associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard University, said black styles have crossed over but that there is more going on than meets the eye. ''The stigma has been removed from features that were Negroid and thus considered inferior, like thick lips,'' he said. ''We're seeing a freeing up of style, just like there was a freeing up of sexuality in the 1970's.''
The trend is not exclusively American.Around the world, a universal standard of beauty is emerging,projecting a multi-racial mix. Indeed, it's difficult to tell the race or nationality of models on some magazine covers.
''They're like a little bit of this and a little bit of that,'' said Audrey Smaltz, founder of Audrey Smaltz and the Ground Crew, a fashion support services concern in New York City. ''They're these beautiful caramel-colored children who can be accepted by blacks, whites, browns and yellows.''
A growing number of black celebrities are flaunting new looks and attitudes. There's Michael Jackson, who despite denials, appears lighter in complexion and thinner in nose and mouth; the new golden locks of Shari Belfonte, the actress daughter of Harry Belafonte; the occasionally green or blue eyes of Oprah Winfrey, courtesy of contact lenses.
Meanwhile, the managers of the white pop-music group New Kids on the Block acknowledge it is a clone of the black group New Edition.
Vernetta Lynch, a 20-year-old Washington college student who is black, said she once dyed her dark brown hair blond, but ''just to see how it looked, not because I was trying to be white.''
''It is unbelievable,'' she added. ''The white girls are all wearing these imitation gold door-knocker earrings, have these short, sassy haircuts and talking like, 'yo, home girl,' and the black girls are acting like, 'wow, golly gee,' in their little Sperry docksiders. We're all mixed up.''
Although some blacks view the imitation of their life style as a form of flattery, others say it is cultural theft.
''I think some blacks may feel a little vindication that the things that were rejected in the past, whites are trying to adopt,'' said Dr. Poussaint, who is black. ''It is in a sense flattering. What bothers blacks most, though, is that they aren't given attribution for their contributions, and there is a feeling that it will be usurped by whites and blacks won't get any economic gain from their own styles or music.''
Erik Simon, a 28-year-old white Californian who has a mop of two-toned dreadlocks that are mostly peroxide-yellow, said of his looks: ''Some people are offended; usually older black women don't like it. But others think it's neat.
''I've never had anyone say, 'Why can't you just be white?' but you can tell just in the way they say things or look at you that they disapprove.''
Mr. Simon said he started growing his locks about a year ago by not washing his hair for six months and vigorously rubbing his head every morning to snarl the strands. He said he decided to wear his hair in the Rastafarian style to shock people, more than anything else.
''It's not like we're stealing it from them,'' said Mr. Simon, who works in a Long Beach pet store. ''It's the new punk. In the other direction, you can see black guys shaving their heads, which is a ripoff of the English punk-rock style, too. There always is that sort of trading between radical blacks and whites.''
Jonathan Roberson, 32, a black New York hair stylist who recently dyed his hair blond, has noticed that a growing number of his black clientele are lightening their hair.
''I think blacks have come to a point where they are making more of a crossover than whites,'' Mr. Roberson said, adding that whites have always mimicked black hairstyles, like the Afro in the 1960's. ''We used to be hung up on four walls of staying in this black identity. If you didn't, you didn't get the support of your brother. Now we're becoming more individual.''
A survey being conducted on how 12- to 15-year-old black girls in Oakland define beauty has found that many have contradictory images of themselves.
''So far, I've found that many of these girls have strong identities as young black ladies, and yet they held on to these choices that seem to have more of a white standard of beauty,'' said Maxine Snow, a graduate student in sociology at University of California at Berkeley who is doing the research for her doctoral thesis. ''For instance, they seem to borrow white standards of beauty in terms of long hair or blond hair and light skin. Yet, in terms of adopting styles, most of them say they didn't want to act or look white.''
Ms. Snow said that the girls come from different socio-economic groups, but that many lived in homes where positive black identity was stressed.
The practice of adopting ''white'' standards of beauty was highlighted by an essay, ''The Bluest Eye,'' in the January 1988 issue of Essence magazine. The author, Elsie B. Washington, a senior editor at the magazine, denounced the growing tendency of black celebritites, trendsetters and ''just plain folks'' to ''alter their natural-born God-given dark eyes,'' by wearing tinted contact lenses.
''Green and blue contact lenses are a groping to identify with all that has been presented - erroneously and slanderously, I contend - as better than us,'' Ms. Washington wrote. ''In my mind, I'm connecting this blue-eyes-green-eyes trend with the current anti-black mood around the country. I'm connecting it with another trend that glorifies and promotes mixed-race (read light-skinned) models and screen heroines, even in films that decry the maltreatment of blacks by whites.''
But there is another view: that perhaps some of the preconceived notions, stereotypes and perceptions that blacks and whites have of each other are gradually changing.
''Everybody puts a little into their own special blend,'' said Orlando Taylor, a 15-year-old black sophomore at Aviation High School in Long Island City, Queens. ''No one takes offense if there is a particular style that is black or white. Whether someone who isn't black or white is wearing it doesn't really matter.''

HEADLINE: WINE TALK

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
GLOOM and doom. If anyone on the wine industry's mailing lists were asked to sum up the current mood among professionals, it would be hard to come up with three more descriptive words.
Consider: in spite of all the hype and hard sell of recent years, wine consumption per person is less now than it was in 1980. Table wine, the one segment of the market everyone thought was poised for explosive growth 10 years ago, declined 8 percent during the 1980's. Without wine coolers, which the industry persists in counting as genuine wine, all wine would have rounded out the decade down 10 percent.
Ten percent may not sound disastrous, but in 1980 the experts were all convinced that wine shipments would double over 10 years, with the biggest growth in generic table wines, or jug wines, the stuff we know as California burgundy and chablis. 
What's happening instead? Big wineries in California's Central Valley, the giant wine factories that specialize in jug wines, are shutting down. The gallon - or more recently, four-liter - jug could soon be a relic.
According to Impact, a trade publication, 86 million cases of generic wine were shipped in 1985; last year the figure was 73 million, the lowest in the decade. The jug wine market declined almost 20 percent in the 1980's. In a decade that saw significant price increases for most wines, jug prices increased very little because of fierce competition.
In fact, the only jug wine among the top 10 from California to post any serious gains recently is one few consumers have ever heard of: William Wycliff. The wine is made by the E.&J. Gallo Winery and is sold mostly to restaurants as a bar wine.
Gallo, by the way, still holds a commanding lead in the generic category, with a 41 percent share. Its Carlo Rossi brand is the nation's leader, while the regular Gallo label, which appears on Hearty Burgundy and other wines, is second. Carlo Rossi was down 5.7 percent last year and the Gallo-label generics were down 7.4 percent, Impact said.
Sparkling wines were up 30 percent compared with 1980, but all that growth occurred in the first half of the decade; since 1985 they have been steadily declining. Jon Fredrikson, a California industry consultant, cites greater awareness of the laws against drunken driving. Most sparkling wines, he points out, are consumed at celebrations away from home.
The figures for foreign wines are even more ominous. They reached their high point in 1984, when they accounted for 26 percent of the American wine market. Since then, they have fallen off by nearly half, to less than 14 percent of the market.
Is wine finished? Is it destined to go the way of the Studebaker, the straw hat and the long-playing record? Probably not, though the people who stoutly maintain that this is just a cyclical decline are the same ones who painted such rosy pictures for the industry 10 years ago.
But there is a silver lining, and it's called trading up. The already somewhat hackneyed phrase is ''drinking less but drinking better,'' and for the most part, better means varietal. A varietal wine (as opposed to a generic wine) bears the name of the grape from which it's made, like chardonnay, zinfandel or cabernet sauvignon.
In 1985, the California wineries shipped out 20 million cases of varietals; by 1989 that figure had nearly doubled, to 38.5 million cases.
Theoretically, the consumer is becoming more sophisticated and more prudent at the same time. Health concerns and tougher enforcement of drunken driving laws have prompted everyone to cut back, this theory holds, so they can spend more money on the smaller amounts they now buy and drink.
Well, O.K., but it would sound more convincing if it weren't for white zinfandel. In 1989, this bland, faddish drink made up more than a quarter of the entire varietal category, something over 10 million cases. Whether someone who has switched from a good red jug wine to white zinfandel is ''drinking better'' is open to question.
Big grape surpluses in the early 1980's gave many wine newcomers a chance to sample good varietals at exceptionally low prices. For a time, decent varietal wine could be found for $3 a bottle.
That all ended in 1987 and 1988, when the surpluses were depleted and prices began to climb, but a new market had been created. What's more, good California varietal wines can still be found for $5 and less.
The economics of the premium market - wines selling for $3 a bottle or more - are especially interesting. Shipments of premium wines in 1989, about 30 million cases, made up about 28 percent of all California table wine shipments. But the premium wines brought in about $1.1 billion, while the far larger generic, or jug, category came to only $810 million.
The serious decline in imports was mostly a result of the decline in the dollar: in 1987, a dollar bought only half the French francs it did in 1985. Waning interest in Lambrusco, the big-selling Italian wine in the early 1980's, also contributed to the drop-off in imports.
Even so, just as with domestic wine, there were a few bright spots. French wine shipments last year were up 63 percent over 1980, giving them almost 30 percent of the entire imported wine market.
Australian wines, which showed major gains in the United States earlier in the decade, slipped somewhat in the past two years, but wines from South America, particularly Chile, began to have a serious impact. Mr. Fredrikson, the California wine consultant, predicts continued growth for French and South American wines.
The widespread interest in wine is still a new phenomenon in this country, and as the experts have so amply demonstrated, no one knows which way the market will go.
But while the market continues to change, one thing will remain constant: with 3,000 different wines on the market in this country, it's unlikely that there will ever be a shortage of good, reasonably priced wine.
TASTINGS
 
Rubicon 1982, Niebaum-Coppola Estate, Napa Valley, around $30.
Thirty dollars is not an inconsequential sum to pay for a bottle of red wine, but in this case it is actually something of a bargain. The Coppola of Niebaum-Coppola is Francis Ford Coppola, the film director and producer. Back in the early 1970's, he purchased the historic Niebaum estate in the Napa Valley and set about restoring it to what it was in the days of Gustave Niebaum, the founder of Inglenook Vineyards. Rubicon is Mr. Coppola's proprietary label. The wine is rich, velvety and garnet red. It's mostly cabernet and is meant to compete in the same league as those other ultra-premium wines with Latinate names, Opus One and Dominus. This it does with considerable success and at a lower price than either of those. Mr. Coppola has so far refused to release any Rubicon until seven years after the vintage, which makes the 1982 the year most likely to be found in shops. But not too many shops: total production of Rubicon is only about 3,500 cases a year. The 1982 probably will be at its best from 1992 to 1997.

HEADLINE: Sales Below Estimate at a 2d Auction

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
Willem de Kooning's ''Palisade,'' an abstract parkway landscape from 1957 in bold, colorful strokes, was sold for $7.2 million at Sotheby's in New York last night. The price was the highest paid in an auction at which the selectivity of the market became clear. Although 10 records for the works of artists were rewritten, several major paintings did not sell, and others brought prices at or below their estimates.
At the end of a sale of 87 art works, 55 had sold for a total of $55.9 million - against the house expectations of $86.6 million to $112.9 million. In Monday night's sale at Christie's, 52 of the lots offered were sold for a total of $40.2 million, against an estimate of $50 million to $71.8 million. 
 
'Lesser Things Are Not Selling'
The de Kooning at Sotheby's was one of many works that brought a price lower than Sotheby's expectations, in this case $8 million to $10 million. To the buyer, the Chicago dealer Richard Gray, the development means ''a little sanity has crept in once again,'' he said.
''The market has softened, it is apparent this week, and it was quite apparent in London a month ago,'' Mr. Gray continued. ''This is a continuation, a tightening of the market. The things at the top are selling at the low end of the estimates or below. At the middle, things are also selling at the low end. And the lesser things are not selling.''
Lucy Mitchell-Innes, who heads contemporary art sales at Sotheby's, said last night's price for the de Kooning, although below the estimate, was the second highest ever paid at auction for a work by the artist. Last November, de Kooning's ''Interchange'' was sold at Sotheby's for $20.7 million.
''The auction houses are not policemen,'' she said. ''We do not police the art market we simply reflect it.'' Ms. Mitchell-Innes also said sales of contemporary art have increased 20-fold since 1984.
Richard Weisman, an art collector and investor from Seattle, said ''I thought it was better than last night, but the market was really teetering. The stars of the show are being sold - but just barely on the estimate, whereas the stars until six months ago were going well above estimate. The art market appears to be taking a major correction.'' #2 Bacon Works Sold Among the records for artists at last night's sale was $5.5 million for Cy Twombly's 1971 blackboard painting, about 10 by 16 feet. Mr. Twombly's previous record was $1.7 million, paid for a painting that was sold in November at Sotheby's.
Other major paintings, including two portraits by Francis Bacon, were sold at prices below expectations. ''Study for a Pope,'' from 1957, brought $5.5 million in a sale to a Japanese dealer who was not identified, and ''Portrait of Lucian Freud'' was sold for $3.85 million to an unidentified American collector.
A West Berlin collector and dealer, Reinhard Onnasch, who bought Robert Motherwell's ''Open No. 184 (With Charcoal Lines)'' from 1969, for $165,000, said the problem with this week's sales is that the auction houses put the reserves - the price below which an artowrk will not sell at auction - higher than they would have six months. Mr. Onnasch said that ''the market has dried out during the last two years,'' increasing the competition for artworks - and causing an increase in the prices collectors and auction houses expected they would bring.
The major disappointment last night was de Kooning's ''Woman as Landscape,'' a swirled abstract from 1955. Expected to sell for $9 million to $12 million, it went unsold.
 
The Hype Is Gone
Many dealers insisted that the lower prices paid did not indicate a major downturn. Thomas Ammann, a Zurich dealer said: ''I don't think at all it is a recession. I sold this morning a Rothko. The hype feeling - that everything sells at any price - is gone.''
Andre Emmerich, a New York dealer, who paid a record $1.04 million for Morris Louis's ''Nun,'' a colorful abstract from 1959, was positive in his assessment of the results of both nights. ''It is quite normal what occurred,'' he said. ''If you compare what happens at gallery exhibitions and at art fairs, to sell two-thirds of what is offered is doing well.''
The surprises of the evening were Ad Reinhardt's ''Abstract Painting,'' from 1958, which was sold for $2.53 million to an unidentified Japanese collector, and Richard Diebenkorn's ''Ocean Park No. 40,'' from 1971, which was sold for $1.76 million - a price almost double the presale estimate - by a buyer who was not identifed.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Shrinking the Old-Tire Mountain: Progress Slow

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
A variety of companies are making progress toward ways to put to good use the hundreds of millions of tires Americans throw out each year. But environmentalists say the new technology still falls short of conquering on its own a problem that has become one of the nation's most notorious.
Everyone agrees that the most environmentally sound way to deal with a used tire is to retread it. But that only temporarily staves off the day when the tire is too damaged or worn to be safely renovated. Last year, according to Government estimates, American drivers threw out 279 million tires. Those tires joined 2.5 billion to 3 billion others already choking landfills and blighting roadsides, vacant lots and riverbanks, where they attract disease-carrying mosquitoes and pose fire hazards.
The dumping occurs even though improvements have been made in systems that shred tires for re-use or better disposal in landfills, in processes that burn tires as a fuel in place of coal, oil or wood, and in breaking up old tires into raw materials. Those materials can then be used in new rubber and plastic products or as substitutes for concrete in road paving. 
The problem: none of the recycling methods have been attractive enough economically even to keep up with newly disposed tires, much less make a dent in the existing mountain of scrap tires.
''It is simply cheaper to throw them away than to recycle,'' said Representative Esteban E. Torres. Democrat of California, in a bill filed in February to encourage tire recycling.
The Torres bill and a similar measure in the Senate set out to change that economic balance. They would force the tire industry to recycle about a quarter of its products - and to increase that figure by about 5 percent annually - or buy ''permits'' from others who run tire recycling programs. Tire producers would get twice as much credit toward their quota, under the legislation, for tires that are recycled into new products as for tires burned as fuel.
It is easy to see why backers of the bill feel that Government intervention is needed. Tires have been getting more complicated as manufacturers tinker with their design and composition to improve performance. In addition to natural and synthetic rubber, tires may now incorporate a wide range of chemicals, minerals, natural fibers and metals.
No one wants to tell the manufacturers to stop improving tires. But each change seems to have added to the technical challenge of efficiently burning the tires or, better yet, breaking them down into components that can be re-used.
 
Machinery Costly
The machinery required to separate materials and cut the tire down to ''crumb rubber'' or even smaller salt-sized grains for easy reprocessing into new products can easily cost $2 million or more.
When rubber is further reduced to particles the size of those in talcum powder, it can be cooked with various oils in devices known as digesters to make a polymer that can be easily molded into a wide variety of products. That expensive process, known as reclaiming, was used at more than 30 plants as late as the 1960's. But as tires became more complicated, tire companies shut down their reclaiming operations, and only two independents survive. ''It's pretty much a lost art,'' said Michael Rouse, president of Rouse Rubber Industries of Vicksburg, Miss.
But as interest in tire recycling grows, more and more machinery companies are attempting to improve shredding and related equipment. And start-up concerns like Phoenix Technologies Inc., which is based in Jacksonville, Fla., are working on new designs in the hope of sharply reducing operating costs.
Phoenix's approach relies on standard chopping and steel recovery equipment to produce halves of passenger tires that can be flattened under 1,000 pounds of pressure, then fed into a rotating drum with carbide-alloy teeth that mesh with teeth on a base plate.
Phoenix says that on the first pass its shredder can cut 350 tires an hour into 3/8-inch pieces, a size that requires multiple trips through most existing shredders (or one trip through a sequence of shredders). The shredder will be coupled with other equipment, like demagnetizers to remove metal, cyclones to blow fibers like nylon out of the mix, and granulators for further shredding.
 
One More Obstacle
Even when rubber is finally separated from other tire components, a major hurdle remains for those who want to recycle it. In making tires, rubber is strengthened in a heat-intensive process known as vulcanization that links strands of rubber with sulfur bonds. No one has figured out a simple, environmentally acceptable method to break those links. That drastically limits the ability of recycled rubber to bond with new rubber or other materials.
''Trying to use rubber again is like trying to grind up old bread into flour and then baking a new loaf from it,'' said John C. Zimmer Jr., a business and technology analyst at the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company.
While a number of entrepreneurs have proclaimed breakthroughs in processing that allow them to use high proportions of reclaimed rubber in new plastic products, they have stumbled on their way to market. Rubber Research Elastomerics Inc. of Minneapolis persuaded public and private investors to put up nearly $10 million for a recycling plant in northern Minnesota to make the granular ''crumb rubber'' it needed to produce a material it calls Tirecycle, for a number of household and industrial uses. But the plant functioned poorly, piled up heavy losses and was surrendered last autumn to the local county government. Small amounts of Tirecycle are now being produced for Elastomerics at a plant in Wadsworth, Ohio.
Similarly, RW Technology Inc. of Cheshire, Conn., has had trouble getting its Typlax out of the starter's gate. It has demonstrated that the material - which consists of reclaimed rubber that has been chemically altered so that its surface bonds well with plastics - can be used to make products like carpet backing that is two-thirds recycled tires. But RW has yet to show it can reliably produce Typlax in significant quantities.
Recycling experts say such products may well succeed, but only when they attract both manufacturing and marketing expertise. And success is likely to come in a series of niche markets that may not have a major effect on the overall disposal problem.
''People like RW have tried to sell this as a commodity, like rubber itself,'' said Greg Koski, president of Phoenix Resources Ltd. of Leominster, Mass., who developed Typlax under a research contract with RW. ''But it's more like an engineered plastic that requires a sharp strategic marketing plan with plenty of technical help for each customer in fine tuning the formulation and developing methods for processing it into products.''
 
High Energy
Tire companies say that using scrap tires as a ''sweetener'' to improve the quality of fuel used in a boiler makes sense because their energy value per pound is higher than coal's. While expensive scrubbers are needed to cope with the air emissions from burning tires, some users, like cement companies, can use many of the metals and other unburned components in their products.
The most ambitious effort to date to use tires as fuel is at the Oxford Energy Corporation's power-generating station outside Modesto, Calif., which burns up to five million tires annually, producing 100 kilowatts of electricity - enough to power 15,000 homes.
The plant burns whole tires. But it has experienced repeated problems with its system for feeding tires into the boiler and shutdowns to deal with accumulations of slag on the boiler walls that interfered with thorough burning.
It operated at a loss last year despite receiving 8.5 cents a kilowatt-hour from the the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, about five times what it would cost the utility to generate that electricity from steam plants fired by natural gas.
Oxford, based in Santa Rosa, Calif., is confident it can cut costs and improve efficiency with new plants. It is building a larger plant in Sterling, Conn., and plans several others.
 
The Best Hope
Those who believe that burning tires is nearly as environmentally shortsighted as dumping them see rubber-based road pavement as the best hope for creating a mass market for recycled tires. Rubber-based asphalt costs 40 percent more than concrete, but can be laid more thinly and saves money in the long run because it lasts up to three times as long, said the Rubber Asphalt Producers Group, a Phoenix-based trade association.
It estimates that 45,000 tons of rubber - about six million tires' worth -went into roads last year. If 25 percent of the nation's annual paving work used rubber asphalt, 200 million scrap tires annually would be consumed, said Russell Schnormeier, the group's technical director.
Demand is growing steadily, but proponents of rubber asphalt need to reduce the price differential, develop equipment that makes it easier to store and apply their product, and overcome a legacy of quality problems.
They also have to overcome powerful opposition from traditional paving contractors, some of which fear a decline in business if pavement lasts longer, and the wariness of state highway officials about paving roads with proprietary products instead of standard concrete-asphalt.

New 3-Year U.S. Notes Sell Well

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Driven by a record bid from small investors, the Treasury sold $10.5 billion in three-year notes yesterday, with the yield rising to 8.74 percent, the highest level in a year.
The rise in interest rates over the last few months had led analysts to project that demand from individual investors would be strong, but the size of the bids exceeded expectations.
At the first leg of the quarterly refunding auction, a total of $37.3 billion worth of bids was received for the securities. The average yield of 8.74 percent compared with an average of 8.43 percent at the previous three-year sale on Feb. 8 and with 9.12 percent at the refunding auction on May 9, 1989. 
Noncompetitive bids, which are a good indicator of demand from individual investors and smaller commercial banks because these investors are willing to buy the securities at the auction's average price, were a record-high $2.5 billion.
The figure was far higher than the $1.75 billion in noncompetitive bids submitted at the auction of three-year notes in February 1989, which had been the record.
Market analysts said they were pleased with yesterday's results, but added that the auction shed little light on the prospects for the new 10-year notes and 30-year bonds that will be auctioned today and tomorrow.
 
'Fairly Discrete' Events
''By all the standard criteria, this was a very good auction,'' said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., firm that provides research and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets. ''But history has shown that these three auctions have been fairly discrete events.''
Because of their much longer maturity, 10-year and 30-year securities tend to be more speculative investments than three-year notes. As a consequence, they tend to appeal to a different base of potential investors.
Reflecting a worry that has haunted the credit markets in recent years, Mr. McCarthy and others expressed concern that foreign investors, an important source of demand for the 10-year and 30-year issues in the past, may choose to pare back their purchases at the upcoming auctions. Without a good bid from overseas, particularly Japan, yields on the new securities may have to move higher in order to sell the securities.
Traders at Japanese investment houses said that they might place bids on 25 percent to 30 percent of the $20 billion in 10-year and 30-year securities to be sold, a level that would be roughly unchanged from the bids they placed in February.
By late yesterday in the when-issued market, the 10-year notes were offered at a price to yield 8.81 percent, off slightly from 8.82 percent late Monday. And the 30-year bonds were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.80 percent, down from 8.82 percent on Monday.
The new three-year notes were sold as prices firmed in the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds.
In late trading, the benchmark 8 1/2 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 96 5/8, up 5/32, to yield 8.82 percent, down one basis point, or hundredths of a percentage point, from yesterday.
Among note issues, the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 98 27/ 32, up 3/32, to yield 8.77 percent. And the 8 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 11/32, up 2/32, to yield 8.68 percent.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills fell slightly. By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.77 percent, down one basis point. Six-month bill rates fell by four basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.78 percent.
 
Pennsylvania Serial Bonds
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania offered $185 million of serial bonds at competitive bid.
A bid from a group led by Chase Manhattan Securities Inc. won the issue, which consisted of serial bonds with maturities from 1991 to 2010. The bonds were reoffered with coupons ranging from 6.15 percent in 1991 to 7.25 percent in 2010.
Meanwhile, prices of actively traded issues in the secondary market for tax-exempt bonds posted gains of about half a point.
Activity in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds was very sluggish, with most issues unchanged on the day.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Small Business, Large Mirage

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
THESE are disillusioning times. Evangelists steal, athletes cheat and even old Bossy the cow has been caught wreaking death and destruction. But at least one culture hero remains untarnished: the small business, America's engine of employment and prosperity.
Well, not quite untarnished. ''Employers Large and Small,'' a study to be published next month by Harvard University Press, turns a gimlet eye on the legend and finds it hollow. According to the authors, James Hamilton and James Medoff of Harvard and Charles Brown of Michigan, small businesses make no special contribution to employment, productivity or social mobility. 
What small business does seem especially good at, the authors argue, is winning political friends and influencing Congressional votes. And as a result, they say, small businesses are getting a free ride that is hard to justify.
Back in 1981 an economist named David Birch estimated that small businesses created eight out of ten new jobs. And since then everyone from Republican Presidents (Ronald Reagan) to Democratic Senators (Dale Bumpers of Arkansas) to business lobbyists (Richard Lesher of the United States Chamber of Commerce) have been repeating the statistic like a mantra.
In fact, the authors contend, Mr. Birch erred by counting new jobs in small plants and stores that were actually owned by large businesses - here defined as companies with 500 employees. The actual figure, they believe, is closer to the six out of ten calculated by the Small Business Administration than Mr. Birch's eight out of ten. And even this ''right'' number, they contend, represents the answer to the wrong question.
Small businesses may create the majority of new jobs, the authors concede. But small businesses are also responsible for most of the jobs that are lost because 60 to 80 percent fail within five years of starting up. From 1976 to 1986 the share of jobs in businesses with fewer than 100 employees actually fell to 35 percent from 36 percent.
According to the authors, moreover, the typical job in a small business is nothing to write home about. Wages average about 10 percent less than big business pays, even after adjusting for the lower skill levels demanded by small employers and the greater likelihood that the job is in a low-wage market.
That is not all the bad news. Small businesses offer less on-the-job training, as well as a greater prospect of being laid off in lean times. And benefits are typically inferior: Small businesses are only half as likely to underwrite a pension plan.
There may well be some intangible benefits in being part of a small business - direct contact with the boss, for example, or the prospect of rapid promotion. But apparently there are some special frustrations as well.
Between 1973 and 1977, 30 percent of the employees of small businesses quit, compared with 21 percent of the employees of big ones. And while small businesses are less likely to be unionized, that may have more to do with lackluster recruiting than with employee attitudes: A Harris poll showed that a higher percentage of small-business workers would vote ''yes'' in a certification election.
Myths can sometimes be socially redeeming even if they are not entirely true. One might argue that the excessive respect of Americans for the virtues of small enterprise - and its flip side, their dislike of big business - safeguards competitive markets and economic liberties.
The fallacy here, the authors suggest, is that small businesses have become as adept as big ones in using the political system to achieve narrow economic ends. Unlike giant corporations, the ''little guys'' - car dealers, bankers, funeral directors, insurance brokers - are influential citizens in every Congressional district. And their trade associations have learned to mobilize the troops when hostile legislation or regulation threatens.
Money is no problem: A 1983 survey showed that households with assets of $500,000 or more owned 80 percent of all small businesses. And political action committees representing small businesses contributed one-quarter of all PAC money received by incumbents during the 1984 senatorial campaigns - the same percentage as organized labor. Congress has not been shy in expressing its appreciation, delivering everything from subsidized loans to tax breaks to a kinder, gentler touch on health, safety and consumer regulations.
Any serious effort to limit the influence of small businesses (or big ones) turns on effective curbs on campaign financing. But that is no reason, say the authors, to leave attitudes toward small business entirely in the hands of the image-makers.

HEADLINE: Survey Cites Problems At Black Companies

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The nation's largest black-owned companies, hurt by weakness in the economy last year, had virtually flat sales and a sharp decline in employment, according to a survey by Black Enterprise magazine.
The annual survey of black-owned companies indicated that sales for the 100 largest industrial and service companies were down 3.8 percent in 1989, to $4.28 billion, although sales for the nation's 100 largest black-owned automobile dealers were up 8.4 percent, to $2.52 billion. Sales for the combined list of companies were up three-tenths of 1 percent, the survey said.
Earl G. Graves, the magazine's editor and publisher, said that figures reflected the economy's general sluggishness. ''This is the first year we have seen this kind of sluggishness in the list,'' Mr. Graves said. ''Construction is not exactly booming, the publishing industry is down, automobile sales are down, and there are a number of other industries that are having problems,'' he continued. ''Black-owned businesses are part of the mainstream, and they mirror what happens in the economy.'' 
For the economy as a whole last year, corporate profits fell 3.5 percent, to $271.9 billion, from $281.8 billion in 1988, and employment edged up 1.5 percent, to 117.9 million, from 116.1 million in 1988, according to Government figures.
Employment for the nation's top black-owned industrial and service companies plunged 10.4 percent last year, and employment for the 100 largest automobile dealerships was down 1.3 percent, resulting in a total decline of 9 percent, the magazine said.
 
Additional Problems Seen
In the survey, Black Enterprise added that there would be additional problems in the near future for many companies on its list because of declining military spending and what it called a diminishing commitment by Government agencies to affirmative action programs and plans that reserve a portion of contracts for minority companies.
''Black entrepreneurs will have to rethink their strategic focus and restructure their organizations, if they are to keep their competitive edge and reap profits from the ensuing chaos,'' Mr. Graves said. ''In other words, black business is going to have to get leaner, stronger, better.''
Last year, there was a 10.2 percent increase in the combined sales of the companies on the two lists. Because almost all the companies on the Black Enterprise list are private, net income figures are not available. To qualify for the top-100 industrial and service list, a company must be at least 51 percent owned by black entrepreneurs and must have operated for at least a year, Black Enterprise said. It must manufacture or sell a product or provide an industrial or consumer service.
Heading the list for the third consecutive year was TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc., which includes the international operations of the Beatrice Companies. The holdings were purchased three years ago by the investor Reginald F. Lewis. The company, based in New York, reported sales of $1.51 billion in 1989, accounting for about a third of the sales on the list of industrial and service companies. But the company's sales were down from the 1988 level of $1.85 billion, primarily because of the divestitures of several businesses.
In second place was the Johnson Publishing Company, the magazine, broadcasting and cosmetics company based in Chicago. Johnson Publishing's sales totaled $241.3 million last year, up by 11.5 percent from $216.5 million in 1988. The company, whose magazines include Ebony and Jet, led the ranking three years ago.
In the No. 3 spot again this year was the Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Company, which reported $240 million in sales, up by 14.3 percent from the $210 million reported in the previous year's survey.
There were 21 new companies on the industrial and service list, Black Enterprise said. Those ranged from the 11th-ranked Network Solutions Inc., a systems integration company in Herndon, Va., to the Granite Broadcasting Company of New York, which was no. 18 in the survey.
Other newcomers included 34th-ranked Orchem Inc., a manufacturer of industrial chemicals operated by Oscar Robertson, the former professional basketball player, and Drew Pearson Enterprises Inc., a maker of sportswear that was ranked 74th on the list.
Nineteen of the biggest companies from 1988 - two-thirds of them auto dealerhips - sought bankruptcy court protection from creditors during the year.

HEADLINE: Stocks Extend Gains as Dow Rises 11.94

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stock prices extended their gains yesterday for the seventh day, with the Dow Jones industrial average spurting 11.94 points, to 2,733.56.
Most of the gain came in the final minutes as computerized program traders moved in. Analysts said that investors were waiting for results of the Treasury's $30.5 billion refinancing - and the direction of interest rates - before deciding where to commit cash. Nervousness over the refinancing is expected to continue today and tomorrow as the sales continue. 
Stock volume remained sluggish, rising slightly to 144.23 million shares from 132.76. Advances outnumbered declines, 813 to 650.
Most major groups weakened, but utilities, oil, automotive, retail, insurance and military stocks gained. As widely followed leaders, I.B.M., rose 1/4, to 110 3/4; Digital Equipment 3/8, to 88 7/8, and Compaq Computer 3/4, to 105 1/4.
Hungry for any sign of takeover fever, traders pushed up the price of American General, the Texas insurer, by 1 1/2, to 50 1/2, in heavy trading. Torchmark, the Alabama insurer, which originally made a hostile takeover bid, rose 1/4, to 45 3/4. There were rumors of interest from Chubb, another big insurer, but after Chubb said the notion was ''false,'' its stock rose 3/4, to 88 1/2.
Among the strong moves, UAL rose 3 1/4, to 157 1/4; Williams Companies, the pipeline concern, 2 1/8, to 33 1/4, after Dan Dorfman, the Cable News Network financial commentator, said the stock was attractive. Ethyl, the oil chemicals company, rose 2 1/8, to 27 7/8, after saying it would seek approval for a gasoline additive to reduce smog and improve performance.
Republic New York rose 1 3/4, to 45 1/4, after it said that Edmond J. Safra, who already controls 29 percent, had received Federal Reserve approval to buy 1.5 million more shares, or 4.5 percent.
With the huge Treasury refinancing package weighing heavily on both the stock and bond markets, stock prices moved narrowly throughout the day. Early in the session, stocks first fell a couple of points, then rose a few, then fell a few, constantly turning, almost as if traders were unable to decide whether to buy or to sell.
Birinyi Associates, the Manhattan securities research house, said that a four-minute buy program before 10 A.M. lifted the market 2.47 points but that two subsequent sell programs before noon brought it back down 4 points. An eight-minute buy program just before the end of the day carried the market back up nearly 9 points.
Among the Dow industrials, Minnesota Mining rose a point, to 81, in brisk trading after Allen Jacobson, the chairman, told stockholders that 3M expected a fifth year of higher sales and earnings.
Amgen, the drug company, fell 1 3/8, to 64 1/4, after two industry groups backed Congressional steps to curb misuse of laws giving tax breaks and other incentives to companies that develop therapies for diseases where the profit potential is small.
Sotheby's, the auction house, fell 7/8, to 19 5/8, after Christie's reported lower-than-expected sales on the first day of its art auction in Manhattan.
The S.&P. 500 index rose 1.48, to 342.01; the Amex market-value 0.25, to 347.58, and the Nasdaq composite 0.61, to 431.84.

HEADLINE: Rating Cuts For 2 Banks

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service reduced the long-term debt ratings yesterday of the Chemical Banking Corporation of New York, the nation's sixth-largest banking company, and Fleet Norstar Financial Group of Providence, R.I., the 16th-largest banking company.
The lowered ratings resulted from Moody's special review of the risks to banks and savings institutions from real estate lending. That review, which is more thorough than Moody's has conducted in the past, has led to rating cuts for more than 40 banking companies and savings institutions this year.
At Chemical, senior debt issued by the holding company was cut to Baa-3 from Baa-2, while long-term deposits of Chemical Bank were cut to Baa-1 from A-3. The holding company's commercial paper and the bank's short-term deposit ratings were unchanged at Prime-3 and Prime-2 respectively.
Moody's said lower ratings were justified by ''the deteriorating Northeastern economy'' and Chemcial's exposure to real estate loans to third world countries and loans to highly indebted companies. The rating agency said it was worried that Chemical's profits would be hurt by the need to increase its reserve for loan losses.
Joseph G. Spohholz, Chemical's chief financial officer, said ''we strongly disagree'' with the rating change. He noted that in the first quarter Chemical reported a decline in the level of problem loans.
At Fleet Norstar, Moody's cut senior debt of the holding company to Baa-1 from A-3 and long-term deposits of Fleet National Bank to A-2 from A-1.

HEADLINE: Home Resale Drop Is 1.6%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 8

 BODY:
Ex-isting house sales declined 1.6 percent in the first quarter, a real estate trade group said today, as mortgage rates anchored themselves in double digits and prices in many areas continued to rise.
The National Association of Realtors said sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.81 million units in the period, down from 3.87 million units in the fourth quarter and 3.90 million in the first quarter of 1989. 
At the same time, the survey showed the median price of existing houses rose 5.2 percent, to $95,900, up from $91,200 in the corresponding period of 1989. The median price means half of the homes cost more and half cost less.
Mortgage rates also rose from 9.83 percent as the year began to 10.22 percent as the quarter ended, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association.
The survey covered sales of existing single-family detached houses, town houses, apartment condominiums and cooperatives.
By region, the West posted a 3 percent sales increase, followed by the South, which was up seven-tenths of a percent.
The Northeast has the largest decline, down 5.5 percent, and sales were down 4.9 percent in the Midwest to 980,000 units.
The West also experienced the sharpest gain in median prices, up 7.6 percent, to $143,700. It was followed by the Midwest, where costs rose 6.9 percent, to $74,200. Prices advanced 2 percent each in the Northeast and South. The median price in the Northeast was $146,200, while it was $85,800 in the South.

HEADLINE: Food Prices Cause Concern

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 8

 BODY:
A survey of consumers has uncovered what may be a growing unease over the health of the American economy, an industry group said today.
The Food Marketing Institute, a trade organization representing the nation's supermarkets and allied businesses, said its annual survey of food shoppers found a growing concern about food prices for the first time in nearly a decade. 
''We are seeing early warnings that price may be starting to increase as a general concern,'' said Timmothy Hammonds, a vice president.
The group's survey of 1,005 shoppers, conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation, found that 96 percent of those questioned cited low prices as a critical factor in where they spend their grocery money.
The figure was up four percentage points from a year ago.
The group said the increase was significant because since 1982 concern about prices had been declining while interest in convenience and saving time had been on the rise.
The survey also found that the average weekly household grocery bill held stable in 1989 at $74. In 1981, the average weekly cost of food buying was estimated at $55 per household.
This year's survey also found that the fat content of food has emerged as the biggest nutrition concern for consumers, outpacing cholesterol and salt.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Mead Data Trying to Stay No. 1

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAYTON, Ohio, May 8

 BODY:
In the last decade, the Mead Corporation moved swiftly and surely into the top rank of the multibillion-dollar electronic information business. But it is finding that staying there is getting tougher all the time.
Mead Data Central, the $400 million-a-year subsidiary of the giant Mead forest-products company, is constantly facing new competition matched against its Lexis and Nexis information services. There are some 800 computerized services battling for bits and pieces of the electronic publishing market share, up from about 300 just five years ago.
At the same time, profit growth has recently slowed for Mead's core information retrieval service: Lexis, which is used mostly by lawyers and legal scholars to research court decisions, and Nexis, which serves up news articles published in magazines and newspapers. 
To hold on to subscribers and to mine new ones, Mead Data continues to add several new services to that group, which saw revenues jump 30 percent last year. Among the newest is an electronic library of English-language publications covering Europe. Mead hopes the material will be of interest to American companies seeking to do more business overseas.
 
Other Operations Erratic
Mead Data's performance has never been more important to the corporate parent. Earnings have declined or become erratic at some other operations of the 147-year-old company known for lumber, paper, packaging and office supplies.
Mead recently reported that its net income fell 25 percent in the first quarter because of weaker prices for some grades of paper and costs related to new programs.
While Mead Data brought in less than a tenth of the corporation's $4.6 billion in revenues last year, it has been the corporation's fastest-growing source of operating cash. Last year, Mead Data's revenues were $401.3 million, up from $307.8 million the year before and from just $23 million in 1979. Profits reached $36.9 million, up from $34.2 million a year earlier.
Many big and small companies, attracted to an industry where revenues have been moving upward at 18 percent a year, have found profitable niches next to Mead Data by selling computerized information on everything from Chinese patents to nonferrous metal technology.
Big challengers include large media corporations like Knight-Ridder Inc., Reuters Holdings P.L.C. and Dow Jones & Company. Others are smaller companies like the West Publishing Company of St. Paul, which rivals the Lexis legal service.
So far, Mead has managed to stay ahead of most of them by pumping more and more information on more and more subjects into its computer-controlled data base of 75 million documents and by looking for ways to offer them more quickly and at a lower cost.
But the competition is trying to do the same. So for Mead Data to maintain its revenue growth of about 20 percent a year, company officials say it must compete on several fronts. It must lure new customers from professional fields where it has already won a following - lawyers, doctors, journalists and top business and government officials.
And it must get those customers to turn to Mead Data first each time they want information, since many subscribe to more than one information service. ''We compete on a daily basis,'' said Jack Simpson, Mead Data's president.
In recent years, Mead has added topics like over-the-counter drugs, Canadian financial data, and tax liens on file in every state. And Mead officials are pushing the European service as a timely addition in light of sweeping economic changes in Eastern Europe and the plan by the 12 nations of the European Community to drop internal trade barriers by the end of 1992.
 
Growing Access to Publications
The new service, which is part of the Nexis system, gives subscribers access to the texts or abstracts of 44 English-language publications, like the Economist weekly news magazine and The Financial Times.
''Knowledge is power,'' said Mr. Simpson, a 46-year-old former executive at the International Business Machines Corporation who has guided Mead Data Central's rapid growth since his arrival in June 1982. He said that businesses were increasingly looking for knowledge to give them an edge over the competition and that Mead Data's 240,000 subscribers included all 500 corporations on the Fortune list of the nation's largest industrial companies. Mead Data says it has more than a million users, because many companies have dozens of people who use the services.
Encouraged by its success in electronic publishing, the Mead Corporation is developing other nontraditional products, hoping to establish new markets. At the top of the list is a color-copying process the company calls Cycolor. It is designed to lower the cost of making fast and high-quality color photocopies by using specially coated paper rather than expensive machinery. But in the last three years, Mead set aside total losses of $109 million related mostly to Cycolor development costs, including $52 million last year.
Partly because of the continued development costs, Mead's first-quarter earnings fell to $39.5 million, or 62 cents a share, from $52.6 million, or 81 cents, a year earlier. Revenues edged up 1 percent, to $1.14 billion, from $1.13 billion in the 1989 quarter.
Mead hopes to make money eventually by selling the Cycolor paper to corporate offices and small printing companies. But some analysts say it may take several years before color copiers become widespread enough to make Mead's paper a profitable business.
For now, the momentum is with Mead Data Central's Lexis/Nexis. Lexis began in 1973 as the company's first public information service. Using it, a lawyer wanting to review right-to-die cases for all 50 states could pull the information in less than 30 seconds. The cost would be $27 plus 58 cents a minute to peruse it, Mead said.
 
Appeal of Services
Using a computer terminal and printer linked by telephone lines to Nexis, which started in 1979, the general information service, a reporter anywhere in the country seeking articles published this year about Donald J. Trump's marital difficulties could pull up more than 100 articles on the topic. Doing so would cost about $35.
Nexis offers the full text of articles that appear in more than 450 business and general publications, like Business Week, Fortune, The New York Times, The Washington Post and Tass, the Soviet press agency.
The services' appeal quickly becomes clear to anyone who has ever toiled through indexes of periodicals at the local library.
Mead Data, based in the Dayton suburb of Miami Township, prides itself on taking precautions to make sure the operation does not fail.
If there is a power failure, the Mead network can run indefinitely on five diesel generators.
And concrete barriers have been set up to prevent an errant vehicle from flying off a nearby road into the complex and interrupting vital computer links.
The Lexis staff processes court documents from more than 2,000 Federal and state jurisdictions by feeding papers into machines that read the typewritten characters and store them in the computer system.
A group of 70 workers then scans the data, correcting typographical or other errors.
One of Mead Data's strongest competitors is Dialog, a Knight-Ridder subsidiary that has about 400 data bases. Among them are the full text of McGraw-Hill publications like Business Week. Dialog is adding 50 newspapers from Knight-Ridder's Vu-Text unit, including The Chicago Tribune, The Boston Globe and Knight-Ridder's own newspapers, like The Philadelphia Inquirer.

Hotels Given Face Lifts In Manhattan

BYLINE: By Richard D. Lyons

 BODY:
MANHATTAN hotels, from the expensive small boutique lodgings to the larger chain properties and the more down-market inns, are in the midst of a restoration and renovation binge that is reshaping at least 25 properties.
Among them, the Drake Swissotel, on Park Avenue, is spending $52 million on renovations; the Essex House and Ritz Carlton, on Central Park South, $60 million and $35 million; the St. Regis Sheraton, on Fifth Avenue, $50 million; the Algonquin, on West 44th Street, $20 million, and the Mark Hotel, on East 77th Street, $30 million.
In addition to renovating all its rooms, the Drake Swissotel will build a new entrance on Park Avenue that is to be incorporated into a separate lobby bar, install five new high-speed elevators, increase space for meeting rooms, and expand its Lafayette restaurant. The renovations are expected to be finished in a year. 
A much larger property, the 1,700-room Waldorf-Astoria on Park Avenue, finished a $110 million renovation three years ago, while the 800-room Plaza on Fifth Avenue is in the midst of a $150 million overhaul. The Sheraton Corporation has declined comment on reports that its Sheraton Centre and Towers and City Squire properties on Seventh Avenue in midtown are in line for a collective $150 million face lift.
Such huge investments might seem odd, coming at a time when the New York area economy has softened and hotel-occupancy rates are falling. But experts in the hospitality industry insist that new investment makes sense in the long run because the city will continue to be an international attraction for tourists and business travelers.
''The present drop in business activity in New York is certainly a temporary thing, and we're looking 10, even 20 years ahead for the return on the funds invested in our renovation,'' said Jacques A. Hamburger, general manager of the 640-room Drake Swissotel, at 440 Park Avenue at 56th Street. ''With all the new hotels coming on line in Manhattan, the older properties have to renovate to moderize their traditional amenities and provide new systems in order to remain competitive,'' he added.
Moreover, according to those in the industry, renovating existing properties is often a better business strategy than starting from scratch because of the higher costs of new buildings.
''For many investors, it is still cheaper to buy and renovate an old hotel than build a brand new one, especially so in Manhattan, where real estate prices are so high,'' said Raymond N. Bickson, general manager of the 185-room Mark Hotel, 25 East 77th Street near Madison Avenue.
Arthur Adler, a hotel specialist with the consulting and accounting firm of Laventhol & Horwath, said much of the renovation investment was coming from foreign sources. The Drake Swissotel, for example, is owned by Switzerland's Swissair, and the Mark by a partnership of the Rafael Group Hoteliers, London, and E. William Judson, New York.
''Many foreign companies have demonstrated their willingness not only to pay for renovations, but even to overpay when they buy properties in Manhattan because, for them, a presence in the New York market is important strategically,'' Mr. Adler said. ''New York is a stable market relative to other hotel markets around the world and the foreign investors are counting not only on day-to-day operations to make money but also on the appreciation of these properties as a safe long-term investment.''
Mr. Bickson of the Mark Hotel agreed that the New York market remained strong. ''The average daily room rates at deluxe boutique hotels in this area are around $250, and the occupancy rates compare very well with those in similar properties in the other gateway cities of London, Paris, Hong Kong and Tokyo,'' he said.
Laventhol & Horwath, which tracks occupancy rates, noted that the latest data indicate that occupancy rates rose in February to 68 percent of capacity, almost 2.5 percentage points higher than in February 1989. Over the last three years, however, there has been an overall decline to a yearly average of about 76 percent in 1989. Still, the outlook is considered bright.
''The Manhattan lodging industry will continue to do well in the 1990's due to an overall room shortage, a healthy international tourism industry, and favorable year-round rates, which in turn can be invested in renovations,'' Mr. Adler predicted.
Stephen W. Brener, a hotel-management expert in Manhattan, pointed out several other reasons behind the upsurge in renovation, noting that hotel investors ''would never invest their money in renovations unless they had to, and they have had to because of increasing competition and Local Law 16.''
Enacted by the Board of Estimate six years ago, Local Law 16 mandates the phased-in installation of sprinkler systems and smoke detectors in most large hotels. These fire-safety systems are complicated to install and extremely expensive, almost forcing major renovation of the rest of the property itself.
''Hotels have a life cycle just like trees and, indeed, people, and many properties in New York simply got tired,'' Mr. Brener said. ''They need periodic rejuvenation to attract business and remain competitive.''

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Finishes Day Mixed After Rising a Bit Abroad

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed mixed in United States trading yesterday after strengthening slightly in Europe, but money brokers said the underlying direction of the American currency remained unclear. Gold prices fell.
The currency dealers said some outside influences were affecting the dollar, notably pent-up appetite for the currency in London after a three-day holiday weekend there and a surprisingly good sale of new American debt securities at a quarterly Treasury refunding auction yesterday in Washington. 
The dollar demand helped strengthen the currency, but the Treasury auction discouraged dollar buying because it suggested that United States interest rates would not rise significantly, some of the traders said. That could make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors relative to other primary currencies.
Despite the Treasury auction's immediate effect, Zlatko Glamuzina, the chief dealer at the New York branch of Banco di Sicilia, suggested that the long-term trend for dollars would remain strong.
But Scott Greene, the chief dealer for the New York branch office of Bank Julius Baer & Company of Switzerland, suggested that the currency of choice increasingly looked like the West German mark, reflecting the optimism about the economic dynamism expected from a reunited Germany.
''The vulnerable side is the down side for the dollar,'' Mr. Greene said. ''All we need is a slight push there.'' Others expressed reluctance to trade dollars, preferring to await the final outcome of the Treasury auction tomorrow, as well as any economic insight derived from reports on American retail sales and inflation for April, which are due to be released on Friday.
In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 158.13 Japanese yen, from 157.80 yen on Monday. Later in London, it fell to 157.92 yen. In late New York trading, the dollar fetched 157.63 yen, down from 158.15 yen on Monday.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.6697, from $1.6710 late Monday on European markets. London markets were closed Monday for a national bank holiday. By the time trading closed in New York, the pound brought $1.6705, more than its $1.6685 value late on Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those late Monday, included: 1.6575 West German marks, up from 1.6556; 1.4310 Swiss francs, unchanged; 1.1639 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1633; 5.5685 French francs, up from 5.5615, and 1,216.00 Italian lire, up from 1,214.50.
In gold trading, the Republic National Bank in New York quoted bullion at $369.90 an ounce late yesterday, down $1.80 from late Monday.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, bullion for immediate delivery fell $1.90 an ounce, to $370. Earlier in London, it fell $369.75, down from a $371.45 bid on Friday. The London market was closed on Monday.
Silver for immediate delivery fell 2.7 cents an ounce, to $4.989, on the Comex. Earlier in London, the metal fell 4 cents an ounce, to $5.01.

HEADLINE: Economic-Political Unrest Erupts In Violent Protests in South Korea

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, May 9

 BODY:
In the largest anti-Government demonstrations in nearly three years, thousands of students marched through the streets of Seoul and other major cities to protest the apparent consolidation of power by a new political party controlled by President Roh Tae Woo.
The demonstrations, which broke into violence as the newly created party held its inaugural convention, came as political and economic tensions in South Korea were running high as the result of wildcat strikes, economic reversals, and harsh Government measures.
After taking over downtown Seoul for several hours tonight, the students set fire to the United States Information Service building.
Flames gutted at least one large first-floor room of the four-story building and smoke and water from firefighters caused extensive damage after students tossed firebombs through smashed windows. The protesters also burned the offices of the governing party in at least two provincial cities, and protests were reported in several other cities as well. 
As often happens in South Korea, protests against the Government turned into anti-American actions because of the alliance between the United States and South Korea, and the presence of some 40,000 United States military forces in the country.
 
One Student Is Injured
It was the first time that the U.S.I.S. building, which houses an agency that is widely seen as the propaganda arm of the United States Government, had been set on fire. No one was wounded in the fire. One student was hit on the head by a tear gas canister and was hospitalized, according to an unconfirmed report. Information on the number of arrests was not immediately available.
The attack on the building was part of a nationwide protest by an estimated tens of thousands of students against the formation of a new party headed by President Roh.
The party, the Democratic Liberal Party, was formed in February when two opposition parties joined the ruling camp. Since then, the party has been wracked by infighting.
Today, a senior official of the new party was quoted as saying publicly that because the party now has a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly, it was considering amending the Constitution to introduce a parliamentary system of Government.
The change is widely viewed as a mechanism for consolidating the party's power and prolonging its rule beyond the planned presidential election in 1993, when President Roh, a former general involved in the previous military government, had originally pledged he would step down.
Students, who had been losing public support for their radical movement, have taken the offensive and attacked the party's merger as a return to Korea's authoritarian past. A slogan spray-painted on a downtown bank building today read: ''Dissolve the Democratic Liberal Party. Step down, Roh Tae Woo.''
A faltering economy, including a double-digit inflation rate, sagging exports and skyrocketing housing costs, have increased the level of anxiety. The Dong-A Ilbo newspaper carried a public opinion poll today that showed that popular support for the new governing party had fallen to 13.9 percent from a peak of over 60 percent after the party merger was announced.
In recent weeks, the economic troubles have prompted angry protests. In Ulsan, more than 20,000 workers at the Hyundai Heavy Industries shipyard went on strike, demanding higher wages. The businesses hit by strikes this spring range from steelworks in Pohang to the Korean Broadcasting System in Seoul. Prices on the Seoul stock market have plummeted. Distraught investors have stormed stock brokerage houses, wielding bricks and placards. Other demonstrators have protested soaring real estate prices.
''The administration has not been able to gain public confidence in the consistency of its policies,'' President Roh acknowledged in a speech to the nation on Monday. ''The public now is skeptical about even the Government's determination to consolidate stability.''
Mr. Roh accepted some of the blame for ''a pervasive sense of anxiety,'' but insisted that the answer was even tougher Government measures in the political and economic realms.
''We are at a crossroads,'' President Roh said, ''one branch leading to progress onward and the other leading to chaos.''
 
From Campuses to Downtown
After rallies on campuses in the early afternoon, students gathered at spots in downtown Seoul. They tried to converge on the heavily guarded City Hall plaza about 6 P.M., witnesses said. Students battled riot policemen up and down streets, breaking up sidewalk blocks and heaving rocks and firebombs.
The police fired round after round of tear gas, blanketing parts of Seoul for hours. At least two police buses and a command jeep were set on fire.
About 1,500 students overpowered riot policemen guarding the U.S.I.S. building about 8 P.M. They pelted the four-story building with chunks of concrete, smashing about a dozen windows. Students forced flaming gasoline bombs through the steel grates and smashed windows, then started the fire in the agricultural trade office, which promotes American farm products in Korea.
The students then fought back riot policemen and firefighters for about 30 minutes while the fire spread. Firefighters from a United States military base and Korean firefighters eventually reached the blaze and battled it for about an hour.
 
No Estimate of Damage
Windows on the third floor of the colonial style building were smashed and glass littered the sidewalk, while large rocks covered the street. Embassy officials could not immediately provide an estimate of the damage. [In Washington, a spokesman for the State Department, Richard A. Boucher, said two United States guards were slightly injured, The Associated Press said.] The protests were the most violent in the capital since 1987.

HEADLINE: A Phone in Your Pocket? Tryout Set for New Service

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The Federal Communications Commission has granted a cellular telephone company experimental licenses for a new type of telephone network that will greatly expand the number of callers who can use cellular service simultaneously.
The new systems are expected to lead to wireless phone systems within offices, allowing employees to carry lightweight pocket-sized cordless handsets about with them, even when they leave the building to go crosstown.
Known in the telephone industry as personal communications networks, the new systems are different from current cellular services in that they use high microwave frequencies, which have a shorter range. Because the signals will not travel very far, the same frequency can be used on different floors of a skyscraper without causing interference.
 
Limit Now Is 832 Channels
Current cellular systems rely on a few large radio towers to transmit signals in a radius of a few blocks to a few miles; within that area only 832 channels are available at any one time. The new systems will rely on many low-powered transmitters, each the size of a file cabinet or smaller, that will transmit signals across a limited area. 
Instead of the 832 channels available on Wall Street under the current system, for example, the new systems could provide hundreds of channels in each building. Thus, many more callers could use the systems at the same time.
The new systems' handsets are smaller and lighter than current cellular telephones because the low-powered signal needs only a small battery. Millicom Inc., the cellular telephone company that received the F.C.C. licenses, is using a new method for encoding calls, enabling it to use fewer electronic components in the handset.
The handset will come with a credit card-sized microprocessor that can be programmed to set up conference calls or to give different rings depending on whether friends, business associates or strangers are calling. The handset's speaker is a slit below the key pad, and the earpiece is a black rectangle above the key pad. The greater capacity of the new system means its construction costs are spread over a larger customer base, making it likely that the new service will be considerably less expensive than current cellular service.
The new systems would be an alternative service to both existing cellular systems and also to local telephone service that relies on wires and fiber-optic cables. As such, they pose a threat to cellular companies and local telephone companies, which are responding by increasing the capacity of their systems and asserting that they are the most qualified parties to operate the new systems.
The F.C.C. decision, reached Tuesday and announced yesterday, awarded the two-year licenses to Millicom for systems in Houston and Orlando, Fla. The New York-based company said it would spend $20 million to build a 25,000-subscriber system in Houston and a 20,000-subscriber system in Orlando. Both systems are scheduled to go into service within two years, the company said.
In December, the British Government selected three consortiums to build nationwide cellular systems using the new technlology. The consortiums have announced plans to spend $1.7 billion each to build their systems and plan to begin service in London in 1992.
Cable and Wireless P.L.C., the leader of one consortium, predicts that the charge for using its system might exceed local wired telephone rates by only 10 percent. That would be far less expensive than cellular calls made using current technology.
The eventual price of personal communications network service in the United States cannot be forecast yet, said G. Todd Hardy, Millicom's general counsel.
Millicom and several other American telephone and electronics companies are members of the consortiums building the British system.
 
Differences With Britain
The introduction of the new systems in the United States lags the beginning of such service in Britain because the United States has a less dense population, which requires the construction of more radio transmitters, and because most of the needed high-energy microwave frequencies are already in use, said Janice Obuchowski, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information.
''In some sense, our success in radio-based services is now coming back to bite us,'' she said.
Millicom's plan to build the systems in Houston and Orlando is technically feasible, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company told the F.C.C. in a recent filing.
The technology involved will someday threaten the existing monopolies of local telephone companies, said Richard B. Snyder, A.T.&T.'s cellular business development director. ''I fundamentally believe that P.C.N.'s are going to be the first serious means of competition for local communications,'' he said, referring to personal communications networks.
 
Challenge to Bell Companies
The seven regional Bell operating companies, which were created by the 1984 breakup of A.T.&T., currently provide 80 percent of the local telephone service in the United States. They say the new cellular systems will supplement their networks but not replace them.
Millicom says it will beam calls directly from one of its transmitters to the next. The Bell companies say it would make more sense to connect the transmitters through the local telephone network.
Consumers will ''use the wireless phones in addition to the wired network,'' said Eric F. Ensor, the director of worldwide wireless strategy for the BellSouth Corporation, the nation's second-largest local telephone company, after the Bell Atlantic Corporation.
Mr. Ensor said BellSouth was researching the new technology and might begin field tests soon. If the Millicom experiment succeeds and regional or municipal licenses are issued for personal communications networks, BellSouth will apply for them, he said.
 
The Big Technical Problem
The new systems face an especially tough challenge from what has always been the biggest problem with cellular telephone service: avoiding the interruption of a conversation when the user of a handset goes beyond the range of one transmitter and into the range of another.
Cellular telephones automatically hunt for an available channel as they come within range of the next transmitter, but some experts say that new channels cannot be found quickly enough if the handset is in a fast-moving car. The new systems must hunt faster and more often because they use many more transmitters.
J. Shelby Bryan, the chairman and chief executive of Millicom, said urban auto traffic sometimes moved fast enough to create such a problem for users of his company's system, but not very often, particularly in congested cities like New York.
Transmitters that use the system in rural areas can use higher power and accommodate vehicles moving at up to 80 miles an hour, a spokesman for the Cable and Wireless consortium said.
Millicom and any other company that wants to start a high-frequency cellular system in the United States must deal with the clutter of microwave signals. Many large corporations already use microwaves to carry their voice and data communications, bypassing the local telephone networks. The F.C.C. chose Houston and Orlando for the Millicom experiment because those cities already have a heavy volume of microwave traffic and the commission wants to determine whether interference will result, said Maureen P. Peratino, a spokeswoman for the commission.
 
Improving Existing Systems
Cellular companies are racing to expand the capacity of their systems by installing more and lower-powered transmitters and by developing digital switches that use computers to squeeze more calls on the same frequencies.
The Nynex Mobile Communications Company is now creating transmitter areas in New York as small as one or two city blocks and may someday have transmitters that serve a single skyscraper, said James J. Gerace, a spokesman for the company. Within the next two years the company also will install digital switches that triple the number of calls handled on current frequencies, he said.
For all the excitement about the new systems, justifying their expense may be difficult because it might be cheaper to upgrade existing cellular systems than to build another system, said Herschel Shosteck, a cellular telecommunications economist in Silver Spring, Md.
The personal communications networks may eventually be offered to residential customers as well as businesses. In Britain, the systems will be offered to both urban and rural residential customers, allowing someone to walk to the park or drive to the store without leaving the telephone behind. Mercury Personal Communications, the consortium led by Cable and Wireless, plans to cover 30 percent of Britain's population with its transmitters by late 1992, 60 percent by 1994 and 97 percent by 1998.

HEADLINE: Israel Is Bolstered and Its Foes Are Weakened by Change Sweeping Europe

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, May 9

 BODY:
In a region where one side's gain is taken gleefully as the other's pain, Israel has emerged as the beneficiary of changing times in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, while the Arab world confronts the losses.
Most obviously, the growing flood of Soviet Jewish immigrants, whose numbers reached a record high of more than 10,000 last month, has encouraged Israelis to believe that their land will be fortified by the influx of skills and numbers -the prognosis that forms the core of Arab and Palestinian apprehensions.
And since the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe last year, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia have restored the ties that were broken by most Eastern-bloc countries after the 1967 Middle East war. After its acceptance of shared blame for the Holocaust, East Germany is seeking to renew ties with Israel. Last week Bulgaria too revived its relationship, and Yugoslavia is reportedly considering a similar move. 
The shifts end an era of unquestioning Communist support in Eastern Europe for the Arab cause. Israel believes that in practical terms the developments will deprive the Palestine Liberation Organization of training and military supply installations in Eastern Europe, said Dan Neveh, an Israeli Foreign Ministry aide.
 
Israel Preoccupied Internally
''We feel better if many countries that were supporters of our enemies are no longer supporters of our enemies,'' he said.
There are other gains, too: the Soviet Union, for instance, has served notice that it will limit arms supplies to Syria, traditionally held to be the gravest Arab threat to Israel, thereby perhaps reducing the risk of military adventurism.
But it remains unclear whether a perception of a reduced Arab threat implies conciliatory Israeli attitudes or whether Israel itself has any long-range view of how to exploit the changes.
''How can we here sit quietly and say there's less tension between the United States and the U.S.S.R. so everything will be O.K.?'' said Avi Pazner, spokesman for the caretaker Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir. ''The moment there is a perception in Arab eyes that it is possible to win a military victory over Israel, you can be sure that you will have a war in the Middle East.''
Prof. Itamar Rabinovich of Tel Aviv University's Dayan research center said ''the country has been so preoccupied with domestic affairs that it does not respond properly'' to the changes.
On the whole, he said in a telephone interview, change in the Communist world has produced a greater readiness in some Arab countries to talk peace, but those shifts have not yet been placed on an Israeli agenda dominated by domestic crisis and the reverberations from the Palestinian revolt in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Israel's coalition Government collapsed in March over disagreements about American proposals for an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue to end the uprising, and since then the nation's political energies have been consumed by the effort to build a new administration.
At the same time, the perception of a reduced threat from Damascus ''has been more than compensated for by the rise of a threat from Iraq. Saddam Hussein has restored the warlike option,'' Professor Rabinovich said. Last month President Hussein, boasting of Iraq's chemical weapons capability, threatened to wipe out half of Israel if Israel attacked Iraq.
Iraq won widespread Arab applause as a focus of militancy against Israel largely because of a sense that other approaches in recent years had failed to soften Israeli hostility toward the Palestinians.
To undertake an avowed peace effort and secure a dialogue with the United States, Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the P.L.O., recognized Israel's right to exist and renounced terrorism in late 1988. But he has secured little in return, deepening a sense of Arab frustration and disillusion.
''We should not be surprised to discover that the candle that the Palestinians were forced to see at the end of the tunnel was nothing but an optical illusion,'' said Salama Ahmed Salama, managing editor of the Cairo daily Al Ahram. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt said last week that he did not believe that Mr. Shamir was interested in peace efforts.
The immigration of Soviet Jews, which could total 100,000 before year's end, has increased Palestinians' suspicion that Washington is deliberately bolstering Israel and undermining the Palestinians by barring the immigrants from the United States.
Many of the thousands of Soviet Jews who have arrived in Israel in recent months are urbanites and professionals, whose first choice would not be to settle in the largely rural West Bank. Most, thus far, have sought new homes around Jerusalem and inside Israel itself. But that has not stilled instinctive apprehensions rooted in a history of mistrust and dispossession.
''It is going to be at the expense of the Palestinians,'' said Radwan Abu Ayyash, head of the Palestinian journalists association. ''How can you imagine that these people will not be settled in the occupied territories?''
Israel's economy is strained, with unemployment running at almost 10 percent and bereft of visible resources for absorbing the Soviet arrivals beyond foreign, mainly American, aid -potentially a lever to pressure Israel into accepting a dialogue with Palestinians. But some officials believe Israel can overcome such pressure.
 
Arabs Try to Close Ranks
Mr. Pazner, Mr. Shamir's spokesman, said: ''I think the U.S. knows very well that no economic pressure is going to work and this is why it wasn't applied and is not going to be applied now. They know how we are going to react.'' Many Arab officials say that as Israel extends its relationship with Eastern Europe and Soviet Jewish immigration increases, the Arab world has been forced to fall back on older reflexes, and a renewed quest for unity to confront what are seen as perilous developments.
''On just about every front, the Arabs are looking at situations they have not had to cope with before and which have consequences far beyond their control,'' said an Arab diplomat in Cairo.
Officials in Egypt, Syria and Jordan have all said in recent weeks that the end of superpower rivalry - and the opportunity it provided for playing off Washington against Moscow and vice versa - leaves the Arabs few options but to try to close ranks.
King Hussein of Jordan has sought to draw closer to President Hussein of Iraq. Syria and Egypt have ended a rift of many years caused by Cairo's 1979 peace treaty with Israel. Syria itself, anxious to shed United States opprobrium as a sponsor of state terrorism, has pressed for, and sought to gain credit for, the freeing of two American hostages from Lebanon. Both men, Robert Polhill and Frank Herbert Reed, were released via Damascus.
But characteristically the effort toward broad Arab unity remains stymied by inter-Arab division, and proposals for an Arab summit meeting to weld a common position remain deadlocked over a long-running and bitter dispute between Syria and Iraq.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
Thatcher Urges Lithuanian To Compromise With Soviets

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 9

 BODY:
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today urged moderation and compromise on the visiting Prime Minister of Lithuania, the Baltic republic that proclaimed independence from the Soviet Union two months ago.
Mrs. Thatcher's aides said that she had been encouraged by the hour-and-20-minute meeting she held at 10 Downing Street this morning with the Lithuanian Prime Minister, Kazimiera Prunskiene, and that she would send a message to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union reporting on the conversation. The Soviet leader has imposed a partial economic blockade on Lithuania and demanded that it rescind its declaration of independence, made March 11. 
Mrs. Prunskiene said Mrs. Thatcher had ''absolutely, unquestionably'' supported independence for the breakaway republic. ''I expressed the hope that she would not stand on the sidelines but would use her good relations with Mr. Gorbachev,'' she said.
But a British official said Mrs. Thatcher had told Mrs. Prunskiene that while Britain had never recognized the Soviet annexation of Lithuania in 1940 and sympathized with its desire for independence now, she favored a compromise solution that would preserve the gains of East-West relations brought about by Mr. Gorbachev's policies.
 
Oil Stocks Running Low
''The two Prime Ministers left the meeting this morning saying that they saw absolutely eye to eye on these issues,'' William Waldegrave, a minister of state in the Foreign Office, said later in the House of Commons. ''Both agreed that there is no reality of progress without a diplomatic and negotiating process being developed,'' he said.
Mrs. Prunskiene said at a news conference today that Lithuania would run out of some grades of oil by May 25 if the blockade continued, but that there was still plenty of food. Lithuania would not withdraw its declaration of independence, she said, but was ready to suspend some of the measures passed since March.
Mrs. Thatcher's attitude encouraging dialogue and compromise is part of a coordinated NATO approach. President Bush saw Mrs. Prunskiene in Washington last week, and President Francois Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany jointly urged Lithuania last month to suspend some of the actions taken since independence.
Mrs. Prunskiene, who also met today with leaders of the opposition Labor and Liberal Democrat parties in the House of Commons, told reporters after her meeting with Mrs. Thatcher that she had been ''very pleased'' with their talk.
 
'Foot-Dragging' by Soviets
British officials said Mrs. Thatcher was concerned that Mr. Gorbachev was coming under increasing pressure from the Soviet military to crack down in Lithuania, and that he had stiffened Soviet positions in arms control talks with the United States and the NATO alliance.
In Brussels last Thursday, NATO's Secretary General, Manfred Worner, noting that the Vienna negotiations on reductions in conventional forces in Europe had slowed down in recent months, said there had been ''foot-dragging'' by the Soviet Union. The British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, also said in Brussels that there were fears that the Soviet Union was ''moving rapidly toward a state of confusion.''
Mrs. Thatcher has often urged her partners in the European Community to be cautious and avoid making statements about Lithuania or other matters that would jeopardize Mr. Gorbachev's position. ''I don't think the Prime Minister has lost faith that he'll get through,'' one of her aides said today. ''She thinks he's a most resourceful politician, and perhaps thinks he has to be.''

HEADLINE: To Save Fish, Judge Curbs Lowering of Lake

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BISMARCK, N.D., May 9

 BODY:
In a dispute centering on the longtime drought afflicting the upper Great Plains, a Federal district judge today ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to bow to the wishes of three states and limit releases of water from a major Missouri River reservoir until June 1 in order to protect fishing.
The judge, Patrick Conmy, granted a request by North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana to stop the corps from lowering the reservoir, Lake Oahe, by three feet until the end of the month. The corps filed a notice today that it would appeal, United States Attorney Steve Easton said. 
The states contend that if the annual May release of water from Lake Oahe is allowed this year, it will wipe out the lake's walleye spawn. But the corps argues that the release is necessary to protect navigation downstream.
 
Corps' Actions Anger States
Officials of the three states said the legal dispute reflected growing anger at the corps's management of the entire Missouri River system during a drought now entering its third year in the upper Great Plains.
''The fish spawn are symptomatic of a much bigger problem,'' said former Gov. William Janklow of South Dakota, the lawyer for the three states. ''That's the neglect, the abuse and the disregard that ofttimes comes from people within the bureaucracy that make decisions.''
The lake is in North Dakota and South Dakota. Montana joined in contending that the corps was managing the system in favor of navigation in lower-basin states, to the detriment of recreation and wildlife in upper-basin states.
Charles Findlay, a Justice Department lawyer representing the corps, argued Tuesday that Judge Conmy had no authority to dictate how the agency should manage its system of six Missouri River dams.
But Judge Conmy said today that he was ''unwilling to accept an interpretation that would place any governmental agency beyond the scope of judicial review of actions having a direct economic effect upon thousands of citizens.''
 
Loss of Tourism Feared
The corps has many complex considerations to make in deciding how to handle the system, Mr. Findlay said, arguing that Judge Conmy's order would not be in the public interest.
But the states maintained that if the lake fell dramatically, walleye eggs laid in shallow water would be exposed and destroyed, a development that Mr. Janklow said would cost the states $20 million in lost tourism. ''We don't live in wealthy states,'' he told the judge. ''We have very limited economic opportunities available to us.''
The corps had argued that the three states' request would effectively end shipping in the Missouri's navigation channel, which stretches from Sioux City, Iowa, to St. Louis.
Another argument by the corps was that the states' request could impede the nesting of two federally protected rare birds, the piping plover and the interior least tern. The states dispute that there is any danger to the birds.

HEADLINE: Computers and Other Targets;
How Japan Learns, and Wins, Even by Losing

SERIES: First of two articles

 BODY:
Japan's Fifth Generation Computer project, now in its ninth year, has met so few of its vaunted goals that Japanese officials are now plotting another course toward achieving superiority in advanced computers. Observers who scoff at industrial policy can cite this as another failure of government attempts to pick winning technologies. Yet the opposite lesson is correct. 
For it's by just such methods that Japan has built from scratch a world-class computer industry that may soon overtake America's - methods that Americans would do well to scrutinize.
The Fifth Generation project was designed to develop computers capable of translating languages and understanding speech. It has failed to do that but has succeeded in other ways, like creating a large corps of computer researchers in Japan.
Far from cutting its losses, Tokyo is continuing the project, but it now has embarked on another huge initiative - an industrial effort to master the computing architecture known as parallel processing. The fizzling of the Fifth Generation project, even after an investment of $250 million, is insignificant in the context of Japan's larger strategy.
High on skilled people and low on natural resources, Japan's leaders decided in the 1950's that they wanted a computer industry. Instead of waiting for the market to create one, Japan set out to do so itself.
Tokyo's building blocks were companies supplying electrical equipment to the telephone system, like NEC, Hitachi and Fujitsu. Japan's industrial policy agency, MITI, created a demand for their computers by forbidding imports of similar machines. I.B.M. was allowed to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in Japan but, as Ezra Vogel recounts in his book ''Comeback,'' MITI prevented it from producing computers competitive with Japanese models.
Within these protective walls, MITI was careful to insure that its fledgling computer companies competed fiercely. At the research level, it also subsidized cooperative ventures designed to close the technology gap with I.B.M.
For years these efforts failed. When I.B.M. introduced the 360 series in 1964, it widened its lead. The 370 series in 1970 prompted I.B.M.'s American rivals, General Electric and RCA, to throw in the towel. But MITI kept on going, learning from each failure. In 1980 its cooperative research program on computer chips struck gold by creating commercially valuable technology. This, along with plentiful capital, led Japanese chip makers to dominate the pivotal market in memory chips.
Meanwhile, American computer companies had sold too much of their technology too cheaply to Japan. NEC, Hitachi, Fujitsu and Toshiba had at last closed the gap. When MITI launched its supercomputer project to beat the American leader, Cray, Japanese companies quickly produced machines of comparable power. By 1986 the combined research budgets of Hitachi, Fujitsu and NEC were twice I.B.M.'s.
After MITI's decades of careful tending, the Japanese computer industry has grown into a colossus. It now possesses commanding strengths in memory chips, chip-making equipment, flat-panel displays, laser printer engines and optical disks. By 1992, projections show, its share of the world market will have reached 42 percent, up from 10 percent in 1980. The U.S. computer industry's share, by contrast, will drop from 82 percent in 1980 to 38 percent by 1992.
''Over the past 40 years,'' says the President's Economic Report for 1990, ''the world has learned that excessive government involvement in the economy leads to unsound decisions . . . slows growth and costs jobs.'' That may be Washington's experience. But Japan's skillful bureaucrats have always followed a different philosophy. In the computer industry, they seem to have proved their case.

HEADLINE: Cerebral Tax Folly

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The proposed state sales tax on ''cerebral service'' industries such as management consulting and public relations (news story, May 1) will have a disproportionate impact on New York City over the rest of the state, because the majority of these service companies are in Manhattan.
The proposed legislation is more than unfair, it is counterproductive. It will drive business out of the state, as clients seek services in venues not subject to a tax. Many New York companies have operations in other states and could purchase services elsewhere. Similarly, many management consulting and public relations companies have offices outside the state where work could be performed.
The growth of ''cerebral service'' industries in the last decade has had a positive ripple effect on the entire New York City economy. The proposed tax will have a negative impact on this growth. We estimate that companies with revenues of $5 billion employing 100,000 people will be affected. In the short term it may cause a reduction in jobs; long term it will impede future job creation.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Alphonse and Gaston

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
George Bush could use the charming manner and glib tongue of Ronald Reagan, now that the President is trying to get out of the tax corner he painted himself into in 1988.
As Governor of California, Mr. Reagan once pledged that he would not tolerate a tax increase; on that issue, he said, his feet were planted in concrete. When events nevertheless forced him to agree to higher taxes, Mr. Reagan cheerfully called in reporters and told them that the noise they heard was the concrete cracking up around his feet.
Unfortunately for him, Mr. Bush has shown neither the verbal nor the political agility to extricate himself gracefully from his own cheap but effective campaign pledge: no new taxes. Instead, his Budget Director's cries of alarm about the deficit have pushed Mr. Bush and the Congressional Democrats into the old game of Alphonse and Gaston: you go first and I'll follow. 
Mr. Bush has invited the Democrats to negotiate on what's to be done about the deficit, supposedly with all possibilities on the table, and with neither side to attack the other for whatever either might propose. All involved are well aware, however, that this translates into Bushspeak about as follows:
''Gee, fellows, we can talk about anything but maybe the graduated income-tax thing; but, golly, if there's going to be an increase, sorry, hard cheese, but you Democrats have to propose it. Then I'll just have to tell the taxpayers I'm going along only because you big tax-and-spenders left me no choice.''
Witness Senator Alan Simpson, the Republican economic whiz from Wyoming, who said with his usual eloquence: ''No one is going to come out here and say that we're going to do anything at all with income tax.''
And witness Representative Newt Gingrich, the Republican hit man from Georgia: ''I don't think there's any question in this country which party is addicted to tax increases and which party is reluctantly willing to negotiate.''
Not, of course, that Gaston can't play the game as well as Alphonse. ''We have absolutely no interest in asking for taxes and having a reluctant-bride President,'' one wary Democrat confessed. Of course not. Both sides are less concerned about the supposed need for higher taxes than about ducking the blame.
It's not clear, however, that higher taxes are required. To cut the deficit? The economy has been expanding since 1982, despite huge annual budget shortfalls. To sustain the expansion? A tax increase, reducing public spending power, is not the usual pump-priming prescription. To hold down interest rates? The relationship is not proven, and rates have come down from their early-80's peak, despite the continuing deficit.
With both sides ''negotiating,'' however gingerly, a tax increase conceivably lies ahead (a bizarre prospect in an election year for 435 members of the House). If so:
* Why not accomplish something other than holding down the deficit, specifically with new taxes on oil and gasoline? Demand for these is relatively elastic, the potential revenue is enormous, and beneficiaries would include at least the air we breathe, public transport and national security.
* Why not soften the blow against middle- and lower-income Americans, by putting the graduated income tax on the table, casting a cold eye on Mr. Bush's capital gains boondoggle and asking the rich to pay a fair share?
If those objectives seem to contradict each other, they don't necessarily. A gasoline-tax rebate could be arranged for low-income people who have to drive to work; other Americans for years have been subsidized in profligate driving habits by the low Federal gasoline tax; and all would benefit from the environmental consequences of reduced auto usage.
Another promising possibility is the investment of a substantial share of new tax revenues in the nation's needy physical infrastructure -bridges, highways, city streets, water and sewage facilities, uninsulated buildings and the like. That would put lots of people to work (perhaps reducing the costs of crime as well as welfare), stimulate the economy and bring in revenues over and above those from whatever new tax might be passed. The last effect would be delayed but worth waiting for.
Finally, as Alphonse and Gaston urge each other on, it's well for the rest of us to remember who created the deficit bogeyman - Ronald Reagan, that's who, with the tax cut of 1981 followed by the military buildup he never really paid for.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
The Window Washers

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
At a party in Prague, the new dean of the journalism school at Charles University presents his calling card and leans forward to translate the two words under his name.
''Window washer,'' he says. ''Shop windows. That is how I made my living, eight years.'' 
Dr. Cestimir Suchy smiles as he explains that he used to be foreign editor of Radio Prague, but that after he declined orders to call the Soviet invasion of 1968 an act of brotherly support he was fired. The Communist Government then allowed him to earn his living cleaning windows.
Dr. Suchy seems quite jovial about it - how it was healthy to work outdoors, how he met the best people that way. Foreigners standing around chuckle.
But the next day, toward the end of another gathering, he talks of the cruel years of isolation from the world he loved and was trained for, the theft of those years from his brain and his life, and there is no smiling in his voice.
Everybody loves Prague in these days of its new freedom. But sometimes when I was there recently I felt that foreigners were loving a dream Prague where everybody told witty stories, where a gentle playwright-President soared in the skies of international stardom as a delighted world watched, where a velvet revolution cost so little and gained so much, where you could get a full meal for one American dollar.
It crossed my mind that not enough people were waiting until the party thinned out so the harshness of the past and the problems of the future could emerge and the lines of worry be seen, just as real as the warmth and the wit.
In the United States, Czechoslovakia suffers from its own wonderful publicity - the exhilaration that President Vaclav Havel aroused in Congress, the crowd of celebrities that turned out for him in New York, the stories about golden Prague becoming the absolutely essential trip for everybody in the know.
Czechoslovakia is like a small restaurant that suddenly gets a three-star review. The next day it is swamped with reservations, customers wait hours on line, the staff is edgy and in the kitchen the chef says he just cannot cook any faster.
Exhaustion is on Prague's face. The people in the Havel Government work without rest to create a new government, a new political system, a new constitution, a new economic order out of the chaos of Communism.
Every minister is surrounded by the apparatchiks of the Communist days. The weeding out is deliberately slow.
''We have had enough purges in this country,'' says Jan Urban, the head of Civic Forum, the revolutionary political movement, a plain-speaking man. ''How do you judge who is tainted? Nearly all members of the society cooperated with dictatorships, one way or another.''
In the Presidential castle, Mr. Havel is cooking fast.
Already he has carried out the first job he set for himself - restoring Czechoslovakia and Europe to each other, bringing his country out vividly as an individual nation after 40 lost years in the gray world of Soviet captivity.
But some people around him say he is not going fast enough, particularly on economics. They want him to act on the most important issue facing the country - moving the country toward free enterprise, away from the Communism that wrecked its once-solid bourgeois base.
Move slowly, say others, including his conservative opponents; the peo-ple will not put up with interim unemployment, rising prices, the loss of the hospital-ward economic security of Communism.
So far Mr. Havel has not committed himself. He seems to be waiting for the June elections. A new parliament will be chosen and will name him President again, a new mandate.
But delay will make the economic decisions even harder. How will staggering, obsolete Government plants be sold? Where will the money come from to buy them, money needed for new investments?
Every day it gets more difficult to put off housecleaning in Government ministries and to quiet the public desire to settle scores with the old secret police, who have been told to stay at home, just waiting by the telephone.
All these problems were created by the Soviet-run Communist regime, not by the revolution. That will be important to remember in the days ahead when the exhaustion lines on the city's face get deeper.
Prague is still golden. But it is not simply a show-business hit. It is a real place with real problems that needs real friends, not just those who will clap, hug and leave.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Plan: Protect Jobs, Raise Taxes

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 9

 BODY:
New York's state government, which is struggling to close a $4 billion budget gap, employs more workers in relation to its population than any of the other nine largest states. But this year, as in most years, the budget will almost certainly not be balanced by laying off employees.
Thousands of jobs may be eliminated through attrition, and the payroll may be trimmed further with a new early-retirement plan. But the forces of policy and politics insure that relatively few of the state's 264,000 workers will be dismissed. 
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo proposed 396 layoffs in his executive budget last January, and 605 more pink slips were included in March on a list of budget cuts announced by the Governor and legislative leaders. But many of those jobs have been restored during prolonged budget negotiations.
 
Taxes Instead of Cuts
Critics of the budget process said the state's reluctance to pare its work force reflected the desire of the Governor and the Legislature to close the budget gap primarily with tax increases and one-time revenue measures rather than with deep cuts in spending.
''I'm concerned about whether we've seen enough of the solution on the spending side,'' said Cynthia Green, a senior analyst with the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group. ''And reducing the size of the state's work force politically seems one of the most difficult issues for the state to deal with.''
Opponents of layoffs say dismissing workers does more harm than good because it traumatizes them and their families and demoralizes other employees. They add that large numbers of highly paid bureaucrats must be laid off to save significant amounts of money.
 
Payroll Called Bloated
But some fiscal conservatives - like Edwin S. Rubenstein, an economist who recently analyzed the state budget for the Manhattan Institute, a research group - believe the state payroll is bloated. They argue that laying off workers saves money faster than reducing the payroll through attrition.
Mr. Rubenstein pointed to 1988 Census Bureau statistics showing that New York had 158 full-time state employees for every 10,000 residents, compared with 107 in California, 124 in Texas, 114 in Florida and 104 in Pennsylvania.
Elected officials never like to lay off workers, but they find the task particularly difficult in election years. This year the state's well-financed public employee unions exploited election-year fears with a crafty strategy that used both back-door diplomacy and high-publicity politics.
Although the long-overdue state budget is not complete, the campaign to hold down layoffs seems to have worked. Mr. Cuomo warned this week that there might still be some dismissals, but aides believe there will be only a few hundred.
''The layoffs are always infinitesimal compared to the threats,'' said Ross D. Hanna, director of contract administration for the Civil Service Employees Association, which represents more than 100,000 workers. ''We start off with thousands every year, and by the time it's played out it's 20 or 30.''
 
Barking Worse Than Bite
In Mr. Cuomo's eight years as Governor, during which the number of state employees has grown by 12 percent, the state's barking about layoffs has regularly been worse than its bite.
In 1983, Mr. Cuomo's first year, the Governor's budget threatened 8,400 jobs, but only 547 workers were eventually laid off, according to his budget office. Union officials believe many of those workers were eventually hired for other state jobs.
In subsequent years major layoffs took place only when the Federal Government made significant cuts in Labor Department funds or when the state closed mental-health and mental-retardation centers.
This year the state will forgo major layoffs by imposing hefty tax increases and by offering an early-retirement plan that was agreed to last weekend by budget negotiators. Mr. Cuomo expects 2,500 workers to take advantage of the plan, resulting in savings of $40 million to $60 million.
By giving the executive branch discretion over which workers are eligible, Mr. Cuomo hopes to avoid the fiasco of 1983, when a completely voluntary early-retirement plan drew 8,000 takers. Some departments were devastated by the loss, and more than half of the empty positions had to be refilled. The early-retirement incentives cost the state $145 million.
 
Effective Union Campaigns
Many legislators credit lobbying by the Civil Service Employees Association and a $200,000 publicity campaign by the Public Employees Federation with helping to kill most of this year's potential layoffs. Both unions catch the attention of legislators with well-financed political-action committees and with a statewide membership brimming with eager campaign workers.
Officials of the Civil Service Employees Association said they planned to spend about $500,000 on legislative and statewide races this year, and the Public Employees Federation contributed almost $150,000 to incumbent legislators and their campaign committees between January 1989 and March 1990.
The president of the Civil Service group, Joseph E. McDermott, was among those lobbying for early retirement as an alternative to layoffs.
The public employees' group focused on restoring the jobs of 262 outpatient mental-health workers and used the connection between mental illness and homelessness to stimulate public dissent. Among other tactics, the union erected a symbolic shantytown in Albany and distributed leaflets to New York City commuters who have daily contact with the homeless.
 
Personal Touch Exploited
''We tried to make this issue as personal as possible,'' said Ronald S. Kermani, the union's director of public relations. ''It's how it affects you and your family, your community, your train station, your subway stop.''
The Public Employees Federation, led by a former blacksmith and prison teacher, Rand Condell, also placed hard-hitting advertisements in several newspapers. One, which showed a copy of a dismissal letter sent to a mental-health worker, was headlined, ''For All You Do, This Slip's for You.'' Another blamed Richard Surles, the Mental Health Commissioner, for ''creating thousands of personal tragedies across the state.''
The ads infuriated Mr. Surles, who maintained he could compensate for the job losses by changing staffing patterns without reducing services.
''I think the P.R. campaign was anything but accurate, was totally sensational and verged on hysterical,'' he said. ''It also was very effective.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P.'s New Hope to Unseat Bradley

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 9

 BODY:
One of the least desired pursuits in the Garden State is running against Senator Bill Bradley, the Democrat who many voters hope will be the first New Jerseyan in the White House since Woodrow Wilson. Enter Christine Todd Whitman.
Ms. Whitman, the Republican expected to win her party's nomination next month to oppose Mr. Bradley, says that enthusiasm for the Senator may be tempered once voters take a close look at Mr. Bradley's 12 years in Congress. She says voters may begin to question why the Senator plans to spend $9 million to oppose a candidate who so far has been able to raise only $100,000. 
Ms. Whitman, a former president of the State Board of Public Utilities and a member of one of New Jersey's most prominent Republican families, has called on Mr. Bradley to agree to a spending limit for the Senate race. Mr. Bradley has endorsed legislation that would set such limits, but he refuses to apply a limit to his own campaign.
 
Promises Issues Campaign
''It's the question of leadership,'' Ms. Whitman said. ''Where has he been on the issues that are crucial to New Jersey? He's in such an ideal position to show you can live within campaign spending constraints.''
To Ms. Whitman, the Senate campaign will offer voters a chance to hear what she expects to be a discussion of issues involving the budget, children, criminal justice, education and the environment.
Both she and Mr. Bradley have promised to avoid the kind of personal attacks that became dominant features of the 1988 Senate race and the 1989 governor's race here.
But Republicans say the real object of Ms. Whitman's campaign - which party workers describe as a long shot at best -is to dim the aura around one of the Democrats' national stars. Mr. Bradley, a former forward for the New York Knicks, won re-election to the Senate in 1984 with 65 percent of the vote. He was an architect of the 1986 Federal tax legislation and is regarded as an expert on third world debt and the Soviet Union.
He has raised $9.5 million for the campaign so far, much of it in California, where Michael Eisner, the chairman and chief executive officer of Walt Disney Productions, has helped tap Hollywood coffers. Mr. Bradley's name is usually among those at the top of the list of future Democratic candidates for President, though he has said that if he is re-elected he will serve another six years in the Senate.
Ms. Whitman was recruited to run shortly after the Republican Party suffered the lopsided loss of the governorship and the State Assembly last fall. Even before then, Gov. Thomas H. Kean had said that Republicans could not beat Mr. Bradley.
But in an interview this week, Ms. Whitman said she believed that weaknesses in Mr. Bradley's record would show he is not the advocate for New Jersey that the state needs.
 
Challenges Senator's Record
In particular, she will raise questions about crime and suggest alternatives to incarceration to relieve overcrowding in the Federal and state prison systems. She said she would also challenge Mr. Bradley's environmental record and question whether he has been addressing ''family issues,'' like health care for aging parents.
She supports a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, greater Federal involvement in the acquisition of open space and parkland, increased financing for programs to help care for the elderly and legislation giving employees the right to take leaves for family emergencies.
Ms. Whitman has already attracted publicity by calling on Mr. Bradley to limit his spending in the race to $3 million. Including an expected $600,000 contribution from the national party, Ms. Whitman said she expects at most to raise $1.5 million for the campaign.
The 43-year-old candidate says she has a paid campaign staff of six and hopes to wage her effort primarily with campaign volunteers across the state rather than with television.
 
'Just Plain Silly'
''You can't have a President who constantly tests the wind before he takes a stand on an issue,'' she said. ''I don't think he is as good as the aura that has built up around him.''
A spokesman for Mr. Bradley, Bob McHugh, described Ms. Whitman's criticisms of the Senator as ''just plain silly,'' saying he was as active on issues of local concern as he was on national issues and foreign affairs.
Ms. Whitman, a former Somerset County Freeholder, is the daughter of Webster Todd, a former state Republican chairman, and Eleanor Todd, a major fund-raiser for President Bush.
She is a graduate of Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., where she received a bachelor's degree in government. In 1970 Ms. Whitman was an assistant to the director of the Federal Office of Economic Opportunity. She is now a member of the executive committee of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency.
She and her husband, John Whitman, live in Far Hills with their son, daughter, two dogs, two horses and two ferrets.

HEADLINE: Board Proposes Rent Increases At Lower Level

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
New York City's Rent Guidelines Board last night proposed increases of 3 percent and 5 percent on one- and two-year lease renewals for rent-stabilized apartments.
The proposed increases, which are about half the size of those proposed and approved last year, prompted a group of angry landlords to walk out of the board's meeting in Stuyvesant High School on the Lower East Side.
They are the first increases proposed by the nine-member board since Mayor David N. Dinkins appointed six members to the panel. Five members voted for the increases; two, representing landlords, were opposed, and two abstained. The two abstaining were public representatives, Victor Marrero, who was appointed by Mr. Dinkins, and Agustin Rivera, appointed by former Mayor Edward I. Koch. 
Last May, the board proposed increases of 6.5 percent and 9.5 percent for one- and two-year leases and in July approved increases of 5.5 percent and 9 percent.
 
June 25 Vote
Two public hearings will be held on the proposed increases, on June 20 and 21, with the board's final vote scheduled for June 25.
The increases that are finally approved will affect lease renewals on renewals signed from Oct. 1, 1990, to Sept. 30, 1991, which will include about 600,000 of the city's 940,000 rent-stabilized apartments.
The board also proposed a 5 percent increase in the rent for all vacant apartments where tenants change. Last year's proposal was 10 percent. John J. Gilbert, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents 25,000 owners of rental buildings, said: ''I think what the Rent Guidelines Board has done is simply said to property owners, 'Pick up your belongings and leave New York. This is no place to own private property.' ''
But not all tenants were pleased either. Michael McKee, coordinator of the Tenant and Neighborhood Coalition, consisting of about 120 member organizations statewide, said the proposed guidelines were still too high.
The board bases its determination on an annual survey of landlord operating costs. This year, the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal reported that the mean registered rent for stabilized apartments in the city is $523, which was disputed by landlords and was considerably higher than the rent board estimate of $476.

HEADLINE: Democrats Prepared for 'Good Faith' Talks on Budget

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
Democratic Congressional leaders told President Bush today that they would accept his invitation to begin ''good faith'' budget negotiations, but hours later fierce skirmishing erupted in Congress over who would take the blame if the bargaining led to tax increases.
Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader, struggled to quell open rebellion in his ranks over the tax issue, urging Republican lawmakers at a closed session earlier today to ''hold their fire'' and to stop criticizing Mr. Bush and the leadership for trying to get negotiations under way.
But his admonitions, as well as those from Democratic leaders to their own rank and file, were not enough to cool tempers on the House floor. Representative Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey, accused Mr. Bush of ''intellectual dishonesty.'' 
In the Senate, despite pleas from Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, that his Republican colleagues refrain from ''positioning themselves to oppose anything that might not suit their fancy,'' 19 conservatives made public a letter to Mr. Bush urging that he maintain his no-new-taxes pledge and push ahead with his proposal to cut the capital gains tax rate.
Democratic leaders, speaking to reporters after an hourlong meeting with Mr. Bush at the White House, where the talks will begin Tuesday, acknowledged they had no assurance that Republicans would not attack them for raising taxes and brushed aside questions about whether they had even sought such a nonaggression pact.
''I think the understanding of everybody present is that we should have a good-faith negotiation here without political posturing,'' said the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington.
The scheduling of the budget talks comes amid growing concern that a weaker economy, higher interest rates and ballooning costs for the savings and loan bailout will push the Federal deficit in the 1991 fiscal year to as high as $165 billion. That means Congress and the Administration will have to find from $60 billion to $100 billion in spending cuts or tax increases, or both, to avoid mandatory spending cuts in domestic and military programs to meet the requirements of the budget-balancing law.
At the White House today, Mr. Bush again had no public comments on the budget, but his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, offered the Administration's most candid acknowledgement to date of worries about the economy. ''We are saying that there is an economic problem here that's creating a much larger deficit,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. ''We don't shrink away from that.''
 
Darman Outlook on Economy
Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, tried to put the best face on the Administration's gloomier analysis. ''It's not that the economy itself is weakening,'' he said in a televised interview on the ''MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour.'' ''It's that it's not as strong as it should be.''
Explaining his new forecast of a greatly increased deficit, Mr. Darman said that higher-than-expected interest rates had increased the expected shortfall by $10 billion and that a decline in corporate profits had added $8 billion or $9 billion.
''That's without the rising costs'' of the program to buy assets of failed savings-and-loan institutions, he said.
In the interview, Mr. Darman stuck to the Administration's general refusal to predict the outcome of the budget negotiations, but he said that in principle the White House was opposed to raising the income tax rate.
''Any solution to this problem has to be one which has a chance of increasing economic growth, not decreasing economic growth,'' he said. ''We do not believe that increasing marginal income tax rates is good for economic growth.''
Like some other Republicans, Mr. Darman sought to subtly shift the onus for any proposal onto the Democratic Party, by suggesting the Republicans will not propose taxes but are willing to listen if the Democrats raise the subject.
House Democrats, seeking to pin down the Administration on the economic outlook and the deficit, have asked Mr. Darman to testify next week before the House Budget Committee.
 
Trusting the White House
Today's White House meeting, which included the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, Mr. Dole, Mr. Foley and Mr. Michel, produced a general agreement to work toward a multiyear budget agreement, but no specific agenda or timetable. The Democrats said President Bush had restated his pledge that there would be no preconditions on the talks.
Asked whether he trusted the White House, Mr. Foley replied: ''I trust the White House until I have reason not to, and I have no reason not to.''
Mr. Michel conceded that even with good-faith bargaining among the negotiatiors he would have difficulty keeping all of his own House troops in line.
''You can't silence members from making their own assessment of what they have to say,'' Mr. Michel said. ''We've got to be prepared to discuss these things.''
Senate Democrats were also eager to enter the fray, taking to the floor to criticize the House Republican whip, Newt Gingrich of Georgia for statements on Tuesday that accused Democrats of being ''addicted'' to tax increases. ''That statement is the equivalent of your 30-second attack commercial. Wham out of nowhere, and then it disappears,'' said Senator Daniel P. Monynihan of New York.

HEADLINE: The Tax-Rise Question;
Bush Rationale for Cutting Deficit Queried, But Economists See Need for Budget Deal

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
Congress may be prepared to buy the White House's rationale for putting a tax increase on the negotiating table now. But few independent analysts accept the Administration's peculiar argument that rising unemployment makes the case for a quick budget fix more compelling than it was a few months or a few years ago.
Indeed, by conventional economic logic the timing seems perverse: an increase in taxes or a cut in spending would let air out of an economy that may already be sagging.
Still, most analysts believe that the potential long-term gains from a budget accord are well worth the modest risk of pushing the economy into a recession. ''Whatever the reason the mood has shifted in Washington, I wouldn't say no,'' concludes Francis Bator at Harvard's Kennedy School of Management. 
President Bush has always claimed to be ready to negotiate with Congress on spending cuts. But only this week did he dip a toe in the Rubicon, accepting the possibility that taxes could be part of the deficit reduction deal. Changing economic circumstances, the White House suggested, had voided the President's guarantee against new levies.
Lagging Government receipts combined with larger-than-anticipated costs of the savings and loan bailout, the White House contends, have pushed the 1990 deficit up by as much as $40 billion above official Administration estimates, and sent the projected 1991 deficit into the stratosphere.
 
The Last Straw
The resulting need to finance the Government with borrowed cash, the White House argued, was pushing up interest rates for private borrowers, raising business costs and threatening to choke off investment. Fresh evidence of economic weakness, an increase in unemployment, proved the last straw: An immediate dose of deficit reduction was needed to ward off a recession.
Congressional sources scoff at the idea that Richard G. Darman, the President's budget director, has only recently discovered that the 1990 deficit was far larger than the official Administration projection, or that the 1991 deficit could easily exceed the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction targets by $100 billion. But the likely economic consequence, the notion that fiscal restraint would save the economy from a recession, drew guffaws from economists.
''I nearly blew a gasket when I heard it was time to cut the deficit because the economy was weak,'' said Prof. Robert Solow. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests why.
A big cut in Federal spending or an increase in taxes next year - the consensus speculation is in the neighborhood of $40 billion - would initially reduce demand for goods and services by roughly the same amount. And according to Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution, the ''multiplier effect'' on total income would be 1.5 to 2 times as great, as reduced purchases by those directly affected would lead other individuals and businesses to pull in their horns. That might reduce total demand by nearly 2 percent, wiping out the 2 percent growth in G.N.P. forecast by many private economists.
 
Would Lower Interest Rates
On reason not to be unduly alarmed is that the impact of fiscal restraint would be partly offset by a ''crowding in'' of investment, as the reduced demand by consumers eased the demand for credit, lowering interest rates and making it cheaper for businesses to expand. Indeed, the White House seems to be suggesting that ''crowding in'' would more than offset the impact on consumer spending and actually save the economy from recession.
That is possible - but only barely. The announcement of a budget deal might reduce expectations of future inflation, setting off a sharp drop in long-term interest rates and an immediate investment boom; the direct impact of fiscal restraint might only come later. But Professor Solow is skeptical: ''We have been told that capital spending has held up well in recent years because investors are insensitive to high interest rates. Now we are asked to believe that a reduction in rates would make a big difference.''
A recession need not happen even if fiscal restraint works as conventional wisdom suggests because policy makers would not sit by passively as factories were shuttered. ''The Federal Reserve has made it abundantly clear that it would respond to a swing in the deficit by pushing down interest rates,'' Mr. Aaron said. Along with stimulating business investment, lower rates would tend to reduce the value of the dollar, since foreign investors would no longer be lured to buy dollar-denominated securities bearing high interest rates. A lower dollar, in turn, would help United States exporters, by making American products cheaper in overseas markets.
In any case, most economists seem prepared to take the risk of a downturn because they are so eager to curb the Treasury's voracious appetite for private savings and pare its dependence on foreign capital. ''We passed up seven years of good times to cut the deficit,'' Mr. Solow points out. And he, like many economists, would settle for cutting it at a bad time.

HEADLINE: Politicians Seek Sign from California In Vote on Doubling of Gasoline Tax

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 9

 BODY:
Californians will decide next month whether to double the gasoline tax and lift the lid on state spending to finance transportation improvements, a vote being awaited in Washington as a bellwether of national sentiment about tax increases.
California, after all, is the home of the tax revolt that laid the foundations for the supply-side economics of the Reagan Administration. If citizens here approve a tax increase and simultaneously loosen the taxing and spending handcuffs locked in place by a succession of voter initiatives a decade ago, the conventional wisdom is that Californians will once again be blazing a trail for the rest of the nation.
But political experts here, who are tentatively predicting passage of a pair of related ballot measures, say the lessons of the June 5 election should be read more narrowly than that.
If voters in the nation's most populous state approve the tax increase, which would double the gasoline tax of 9 cents a gallon in the next five years to pay for $18.5 billion in highway and rail projects, they will not be condoning new taxes in general, these experts say. Instead, voters would be telling the government that they are willing to pay more for specific projects that affect them directly, like improving a traffic-choked highway or an earthquake-damaged bridge in their neighborhood, the experts say. 
 
Seeing, Tasting and Smelling
''The general rule is that if there's a clearly identified purpose for which the tax is levied, you have a fighting chance of getting it through,'' said Randy Hamilton, a visiting scholar at the Institute of Government Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. ''Voters have to be able to see, taste and smell it.''
The ballot measures, which have a slight edge in recent polls, reflect a gathering awareness here that booming population growth, with its attendant increase in the number of automobiles, is having a profoundly negative effect on California's vaunted quality of life.
''Freeway gridlock dirties our air,'' said Gov. George Deukmejian in a recent radio address urging passage of the measures. ''It diminishes our quality of life. And it hurts our ability to create good paying jobs for your children because business will be forced to move out of our state.''
Along with the old concerns about congestion and pollution, Californians have a new fear: that earthquakes like the one last October can topple dilapidated bridges and highways that have not been maintained or upgraded because of fiscal constraints.
 
'Example of Urgent Public Need'
''That was a striking example of urgent public need,'' said William Schneider, a political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, who writes frequently about California. ''That was not just a matter of inconvenience, but a matter of tragedy.''
The ballot measures were cobbled together by a rare bipartisan coalition led by Mr. Deukmejian, a Republican, who like President Bush was elected on pledges of no new taxes but is not seeking re-election. The work began in earnest in June 1988 after the narrow defeat of a measure that would have relaxed spending limits that have caused a quiet dimunition of services here in the last decade and another one that would have authorized $1 billion in bonds for highway improvement.
Assemblyman Richard Katz, a Democrat from Los Angeles, said: ''So little had been done for so long that we were hearing it from all sides. The enormity of the problem finally sank in.''
As the months passed, the measures were revised to meet the concerns of many special interest groups. Eventually, more than 200 organizations spanning the political spectrum endorsed the measures, along with all the gubernatorial candidates and most other elected officials.
''I don't ever recall seeing such unity on the part of what I would call the establishment,'' said Mervin Field, director of the California Poll, the state's leading independent opinion-gathering organization. ''That could set a model for the national Administration.''
 
Opposition From One Group
One small opposition group. Citizens Against Unfair Taxation, surfaced this week in Orange County. It counts among its members Arthur Laffer, a supply-side economist who was a member of the Economic Policy Advisory Board under President Ronald Reagan, who says the measures would hurt California in its competition against states with lower taxes. Also affiliated with the group is People's Advocate, an organization founded by the late Paul Gann, one of the authors of the ballot initiatives in 1978 and 1979 that curbed taxing and spending.
One measure on the June 5 ballot, Proposition 111, would raise the gasoline tax, now lower than that in 46 other states, by five cents a gallon on Aug. 1 and a cent a gallon in each of the next four years. Proponents say the increased gasoline tax would cost the average driver $60 a year and raise $13 billion in the next 10 years, with $2 billion more in the same time coming from increased truck fees. The second measure, Proposition 108, which only goes into effect if the first passes, would authorize a total of $3 billion from $1 billion bond issues in 1990, 1992 and 1994 to pay for mass transit rail projects.
The first measure, in addition to raising gasoline taxes, would also modify spending ceilings set by the so-called Gann limit, a 1979 ballot measure less well-known but more far-reaching than the 1978 measure, Proposition 13, which limited real estate taxes. Under the Gann limit, spending is tied to the state's per capita income or the Federal Consumer Price Index, whichever is lower. Under the proposed formula, spending would grow in lockstep with per capita income, which in this prosperous state tends to rise much faster than the price index.
 
Last Increase in 1983
The gasoline tax in California, where the car is king, was last raised in 1983, from 7 cents a gallon to 9 cents. Before that, there was a penny a gallon increase in 1963 and another in 1953. The average gasoline tax across the nation is 16 cents a gallon, making fuel a bargain here for the more than 20 million licensed drivers.
The $5 million advertising campaign for the ballot measures skirts the issues of increased gasoline taxes or new formulas for state spending, focusing instead on voters' immediate concerns about congestion and earthquake safety. Each region of the state has its own television and radio advertisements, talking about a familiar section of gridlocked of highway or a local mass transit need.
This strategy is based on the success here in recent years of local ballot measures that have raised taxes in cities or counties for specific projects, often involving transportation. According to Mr. Field at the California Poll, 70 percent of local tax measures have passed in the last two years, which he says is a sign that Californians have been growing ever more unsatisfied with the consequences of the Gann Limit.
''People recognize that there have to be more revenues to take care of pressing problems,'' said Bill Bradley, the publisher of New West Notes, a state newsletter about politics and economics. ''The caveat is they want to know exactly what the politicians are going to do with the money because they don't trust them.''
In that lies the problem in translating the California vote into a national mandate. While the increased gasoline tax here would pay for particular highway and transit projects, taxes increased by Washington would go toward the reduction of the Federal deficit. And to most people, said Mr. Schneider of the American Enterprise Institute, that is an abstract concept at best and another way to plow more money into ''big government'' at worst.
Mr. Schneider and others said that President Bush and Congress may interpret a passage of the tax increases here to indicate that it is politically safe to raise Federal taxes, even though that could be a misreading of the California message.
But Mr. Schneider and others said that a no vote would be entirely unambiguous to the policy-makers a continent away. ''If these measures fail, given all they have going for them, it will be heard loud and clear,'' Mr. Schneider said. ''That's the signal that will be most potent.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rates Rise In Treasury Auction

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The Treasury sold $10.5 billion worth of new 10-year notes yesterday, but interest rates had to move higher to accomplish the task.
Anxiety about the debt sale, the second leg of the Treasury's quarterly refunding auctions, and a slide in the value of the dollar contributed to the decline in prices and run-up in rates before traders placed bids on the new securities at 1 P.M. yesterday.
The dollar fell sharply yesterday against major currencies, including those of West Germany, Japan and Switzerland, on what traders said was nervousness about the United States economy. [Page D19.] Better Results Than Anticipated Still, credit market participants said the results of the auction were somewhat better than anticipated. 
The new notes were sold at an average yield of 8.88 percent, up sharply from the 8.59 percent average rate at the last 10-year note sale in February. It is the highest rate on a 10-year Treasury note since the 10-year auction of May 10, 1989, when the yield was 9.18 percent.
Analysts were most impressed by the dollar amount of the bids placed at the auction. The amount of noncompetitive bids was the largest for a 10-year security in nearly five years.
More than three times as many bids were placed for the notes as the $10 billion that were sold, equaling the highest ''coverage'' ratio on record for a sale of 10-year notes.
 
Noncompetitive Bids Impressive
Noncompetitive bids were impressive, at $659 million. They are a good measure of demand from individual investors and smaller commercial banks because these investors are willing to buy the securities at the auction's average price. It is the highest total of noncompetitive bids since the 10-year auction in August 1985, when yields were nearly two full percentage points higher.
Demand from individual investors for securities like 10-year notes and 30-year bonds is generally limited because those issues are more speculative investments than short-term notes and bills. Attracted by high yields, the dollar amount of noncompetitive bids at Tuesday's auction of three-year notes was a record $37.3 billion.
Participants were also encouraged by the sale of 10-year notes because demand from Japanese investors for the new notes was not terribly robust.
Traders at the Big Four Japanese firms estimated that they placed a total of $3 billion worth of bids for the notes.
''Bids on the other $7 billion had to come from somewhere,'' a trader at an American securities house said. ''These results signal that domestic interest was greater than we had thought it would be.''
William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, said that ''the results allayed fears in the market.'' He continued, ''It shows that there is good demand for these securities at current yield levels.''
Despite the better-than-expected results, analysts and traders were mixed in their views of what the 10-year sale suggests about today's sale of $10 billion worth of 30-year bonds in the third leg of the refunding.
''This auction went O.K., but I don't know who is going to buy the bond,'' another trader said.
Some traders said they were reluctant to buy the bonds in advance of tomorrow's producer price report.
''If the number is good, all it does is reconfirm the notion that the Fed is not going to tighten monetary policy,'' the trader said. ''If it's bad, the market could go down a lot.''
 
Gain in Producer Prices Expected
MMS International, an economic information and forecasting firm, asked 45 economists across the country late last week for their estimates of the Producer Price Index for April. The median forecast was for an increase of two-tenths of a percentage point. The index declined two-tenths of a percentage point in March.
''But some of those forecasts were looking for another decline,'' David Cohen, an MMS economist, said. ''If we do get a drop, I expect the bond market would be appreciative.''
Mr. Sullivan and others said that the dollar's performance during overnight trading in Tokyo and Europe would be an important determinant of the success of today's bond sale.
''Continued weakness in the dollar could lead to further upward adjustment in yields before the auction,'' Mr. Sullivan said. Further dollar weakness could discourage skittish foreign investors from buying the bond. As a consequence, interest rates might have to move higher to compensate for a weaker currency. 30-Year Bond at 8.84% Late yesterday the 30-year bonds were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.84 percent, up from 8.80 percent late Tuesday.
While most of the activity was focused on the 10-year auction, prices slid in the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds.
In late trading, the 8 1/2 percent benchmark bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 96 6/32, down 14/32, to yield 8.86 percent. That compares with a yield of 8.82 percent late Tuesday.
Among notes, the 8 1/2 percent five-year notes were offered at 98 21/32, down 5/32, to yield 8.82 percent. And the 8 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 9/32, down 2/32, to yield 8.71 percent.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills dipped slightly.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.73 percent, down 4 basis points, or hundredths of a point. And six-month bill rates fell by 3 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.75 percent.
In deference to the big Treasury auction, corporations, states and municipalities moved to the sidelines yesterday and did not offer any new debt issues.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities, traders said that prices of most actively traded issues slipped by about a quarter of a point.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, prices of most issues fell by about one-eighth point, traders said.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: Technology Official Quits At Pentagon

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
The director of the Defense Department program that monitors the advanced technologies of America's foremost economic competitors has resigned, saying he has become frustrated by the Bush Administration's refusal to support plans to assist the nation's high-technology industries.
Michael C. Sekora, a 33-year-old physicist who has directed the program, known as Project Socrates, in the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, said yesterday in an interview that he had submitted his resignation on April 20.
Also on that day, Dr. Craig I. Fields, another leading advocate of assisting high technology, was removed from his position as director of the Defense Advanced Projects Agency.
Mr. Sekora's resignation was independent of Dr. Fields's transfer, but the two men shared professional frustrations. 
Dr. Fields's removal last month has heightened an already-bitter controversy over what the Federal Government's role should be in support of critical high-technology industries. Advocates of a national industrial policy have argued that the Government should step up its efforts to bring the United States back as a major player in the consumer electronics industry and in defending industries like semiconductors and computers that are threatened by foreign competitors.
But Administration officials have argued against any coordinated attempt to spend heavily on particular technologies, saying it is impossible to pick ''winning'' technologies.
Others have suggested that the recent cutbacks are more likely to be related to across-the-board reductions at the Pentagon than to ideological issues. ''A lot of this may have little to do with ideological issues,'' said Gary R. Saxonhouse, professor of economics at the University of Michigan. ''They are cutting everywhere in the Defense Department. They have to make hard choices.''
 
Reasons for Resignation
Mr. Sekora said he resigned because he thought he would be more effective doing similar research working with private corporations outside the Federal Government. He said that his resources had recently been cut at the Pentagon and that Defense Department executives had been stalling on legislation that would have combined his agency with a second group, the Defense Industrial Network, to create a stronger organization to collect information for industrial planning.
''All the initiatives that were started under Reagan are taking hits from the Bush Administration,'' Mr. Sekora said. Project Socrates was created in 1988 and it was intended to build an accurate data base of many of the world's most advanced technologies to help planners assess the status of American high-technology efforts compared with those of foreign competitors.
Mr. Sekora said he had set up a private company, Technology Strategic Planning Inc., and planned to work with corporations to provide assessments of foreign technology.
In setting up Socrates, Mr. Sekora had been successful at gathering experts who could be called on to gauge competitive foreign technologies.
 
'A Network of People'
''What he's put together is a network of people in all of the major labs that we have both corporate and government,'' said Dr. Roy L. Beasley, a Defense Department consultant who is a specialist in military manufacturing technologies. ''They were all willing to work together to determine the status of the United States technology in any area.''
Mr. Sekora said information-gathering operations like Socrates were essential because the United States is no longer the unilateral leader in all advanced technologies.
''Technology is becoming uniformly distributed around the world,'' he said. ''The way Socrates addressed technology was to say that every technology in the world is simulatneously a threat and a resource. The most advanced technology is now found in third-world countries or even small countries in the East bloc.''
The Socrates program in the Defense Intelligence Agency focused on tracking advances in microelectronics, exotic structural materials, superconductors, high-performance computers, high-definition television and a number of classifed technologies, he said.
 
Project's History
Project Socrates was part of a strategy advanced by Robert B. Costello, the former Under Secretary of Defense for acquisition during the Reagan Administration. Mr. Costello, who is now a research fellow at the Hudson Institute in Indianapolis, had established a number of programs to bolster economic competitiveness.
Mr. Costello called the cutbacks unfortunate. ''They're terminating the only data base on industrial policy that the nation has,'' he said. ''I don't see how they can do this. You have to have this kind of information to even know how lay out your research and development money.''
Project Socrates is currently in the midst of a detailed evaluation of technologies that are critical for high-definition television, an advanced version of television that offers far sharper pictures than today's commercial television.

HEADLINE: Labor's Hospital Drive Gets a Lift

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Executives at the nation's hospitals are struggling to overturn new Federal regulations that make it easier for unions to try to organize the three million nonunion workers at community hospitals.
The hospitals say a bigger role for unions would push soaring medical costs even higher at a time when hospitals are under growing pressure from employers and the Government to hold down costs. They fear a reversal of the decline in hospital-union membership that occurred in the 1980's, when the National Labor Relations Board during the Reagan Administration adopted procedures that discouraged union organizing.
But the labor relations board has changed its approach, and it ordered the new rules. It and the American Nurses Association, a professional association of 200,000 registered nurses, are asking a Federal appeals court in Chicago to let the regulations take effect immediately. 
 
Rules Put on Hold
The three-judge court unanimously upheld the regulations last month, but last week it granted a request from the American Hospital Association that the rules be suspended while an appeal is prepared.
Under the rules, registered nurses and seven other types of hospital workers can form bargaining units without receiving case-by-case approval from the labor relations board - a process that could take years. The other employees covered by the rule are physicians, medical technicians including licensed practical nurses, skilled maintenance workers, clerical workers, guards, other professionals and other nonprofessional employees.
Spokesmen for unions that already represent 400,000 of the 3.4 million workers in community hospitals across the country say they plan to organize in hundreds of hospitals under the regulations. While the new rules apply to community hospitals, which are private and can be nonprofit or for-profit, they do not apply to Federal, state and county hospitals and those specializing in psychiatric care or physical rehabilitation.
''Health care is one of our top organizing priorities,'' said David J. Hoffman, a spokesman for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents 200,000 hospital workers, including 35,000 in community hospitals. His union plans to spend more than $1 million this year on recruiting new members in the health-care industry.
Paul Booth, director of field services with the federation, said any raises that unions could negotiate would only be ''a blip'' compared with the $230.1 billion that Americans spent for hospital care in 1989.
But Michael D. Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of American Health Systems, a Washington-based group that represents for-profit hospitals, said: ''I don't think it's a blip under any circumstances. It will put tremendous pressure on costs, which are already pressured by shortages of nurses and other skilled workers.''
 
Further Appeal Is Planned
Fred Entin, a senior vice president of the American Hospital Association, said, ''The costs will ultimately be passed on, and patients will ultimately suffer.'' His trade group of 5,500 hospitals plans to appeal the matter to the Supreme Court.
Dr. Laura Mercker, an association vice president, said that by dividing workers into eight classes, the rules would make it harder to save on costs by training food, housekeeping and transport workers to do each other's jobs. Judge Richard A. Posner, who wrote the appeals court's opinion, rejected these arguments.
Union spokesmen said patients would benefit from union-enforced increases in the number of hospital employees and insistence on better protection against infections that affect hospital workers.
''They haven't paid enough attention to human resources issues,'' said Gerry Shea, health-care director of the Service Employees International Union, which represents 210,000 hospital workers, including 110,000 in the community hospitals.
 
Variation by States
But the regulations may not make much difference to workers in states where legislatures and state health officials closely control hospital budgets through reimbursement rates, said Eli Ginzberg, a labor economist at Columbia University. He said that in states like New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Massachusetts, the unions often have to persuade state officials to raise reimbursement rates before they can negotiate for wage raises with the hospitals.
With the Government holding down spending for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, private health plans sponsored by employers may end up absorbing any increased fees by hospitals. ''They'll just overcharge corporate America to pay for it,'' said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health-care securities analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
Hospitals said spending on payrolls and employee benefits rose 9.4 percent last year, to $105.5 billion, accounting for 54 percent of their overall costs. The Government said hourly wages and salaries in community hospitals rose 7.1 percent last year.
''The court decision and the new rules will create a gold rush of unions to organize hospital workers,'' said James Velghe, president of Management Science Associates, a consulting group based in Kansas City, Mo., that helps hospitals defeat union drives.
 
Nurses in Short Supply
Hiring and retaining registered nurses is a major concern. About 1.1 million nurses, about 50,000 of whom belong to unions, work in community hospitals but there are vacancies for 120,000. Mr. Velghe said some Michigan and Ohio hospitals have nurse vacancy rates of 30 percent. ''The hospitals are more vulnerable to a union organizing drive than ever before,'' he added.
In some cities, hospitals are already wooing nurses with pay that starts at $40,000 a year. Top pay can go as high as $70,000 in some New York, Boston and San Francisco hospitals. The median salary for registered nurses in hospitals was $30,695 in 1989.
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago is offering a $10,000-a-year bonus to nurses who agree to take the night shift.
''Nurses in the San Francisco Bay area are making almost as much as salaried physicians,'' said Jeff Goldsmith, a health-care adviser with Ernst & Young, the accounting and consulting firm.
Other skilled hospital workers are also in short supply and are demanding pay scales to match the gains of the registered nurses, whose hourly wages have risen 43.7 percent, on average, since 1983.
 
A Focus on the South
Although many hospital workers now get higher wages than they could earn for similar work for other employers, their pay tends to be lower in states where unions are not strong. ''It may give the unions a foot in the door in places like the South, where they haven't been able to do much before,'' Mr. Bromberg said.
The hospital unions said that the National Labor Relations Board under President Reagan had imposed lengthy delays on their applications to organize bargaining units, and that hospital managements had told their employees that the delays were evidence that the unions were powerless and not worth joining.
Since 1983 union membership in community hospitals has dropped 11 percent, to 400,000 last year, from 450,000, while total employment in the hospitals rose 9 percent, to 3.6 million, the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
''Unfortunately, the history of representation cases in the health-care industry has been delay compounded by delay,'' said James S. Stephens, a Reagan appointee to the labor relations board who changed its approach after becoming chairman in January 1988.
Under the new regulations, ''the shortened time frame will make it much more difficult for hospitals to win union elections,'' said Mr. Velghe of Management Science Associates.
The hospital association said that dealing with eight groups of unionized employees would raise administrative costs and that strikes could add enormously to expenses. It said the rules were contrary to Federal law and ''would needlessly disrupt the delivery of health care.''
Lawyers on both sides of the dispute noted that the appellate court ruling was written by Judge Posner, also a Reagan appointee, whose decisions have rarely been reversed.

HEADLINE: Argentina to Get Aid and Begin Debt Talks

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
Setting the stage for the next major step in the Bush Administration's push to reduce third world debt, Argentina will get approval of renewed assistance from the International Monetary Fund and begin negotations on debt reduction with its commercial banks by the end of the month, Argentine and I.M.F. officials said here today.
Negotiations on debt reduction are also expected to begin sometime this summer between Brazil and its bankers. This means that Brazil, the third world's largest debtor, with $113 billion in outstanding loans, and Argentina, the third largest, with a total of $62 billion in loans from banks, governments and international financial institutions, will be negotiating at the same time.
The Argentine Government will discuss the resumption of current interest payments on the $40 billion it owes to commercial banks, said Javier Gonzalez Fraga, the vice president of Argentina's central bank and a key member of the Government's economic team. But he said the Government was not likely to make any payment soon on its unpaid interest of more than $6 billion. It suspended interest payments in April 1988. 
''We are in a position to start negotiations with the banks soon and serious negotiations will mean we will have to resume a flow of payments,'' Mr. Gonzalez Fraga said.
But when pressed on the details, he added, ''We will discuss the resumption of a flow of payments; payment of interest, not necessarily arrears.''
''We expect difficult negotiations,'' he said. ''But we also expect from the banks the understanding that Argentina is making all the efforts possible.''
In a speech in Buenos Aires today, Argentina's President, Carlos Saul Menem, said the Government was ready to resume interest payments based on the country's ability to pay. In addition to debt reduction, he said the Government would also like $1.5 billion in new loans from its commercial bankers.
William R. Rhodes, senior executive-international at Citibank, the head of Argentina's bank advisory committee, met with Mr. Gonzalez Fraga on Tuesday and said today he was pleased with the developments. ''I think that the discussions were positive in the sense that they feel that they are that close to an I.M.F. agreement and that they are ready to discuss such important issues as a schedule of interest payments.''
 
Victory for Bush
Agreements with both Brazil and Argentina would be a major victory for the Bush Administration's policy, which placed new emphasis on voluntary debt reduction as a solution to the developing world's $1.3 trillion debt problem. Agreements have already been reached with Mexico, the second-largest third world debtor with $102 billion; Venezuela, Costa Rica, the Philippines, and Morocco.
The approval of renewed aid from the I.M.F. is another of the positive swings in Argentina's up-and-down effort to rebuild its economy and crush hyperinflation. Its current $1.7 billion line of credit from the I.M.F., known as a standby agreement, was first approved last September as Mr. Menem began to put his economic program into effect after his election in July.
But the agreement was suspended after Argentina got just one $240 million installment because the Menem economic program faltered last winter and inflation shot up again at the beginning of the year, reaching rates of 100 percent a month. The approval expected by the end of this month from the I.M.F. will reactivate that standby credit line.
''We need to build up domestic credibility and international credibility and we are fully aware of the low standing Argentina has in both areas due to the permanent incapacity to comply with promises,'' Mr. Gonzalez Fraga said.
 
Rising Fiscal Surplus
He said that the amount of interest that Argentina would be able to pay the commerical banks would depend on the level of the fiscal surplus the Government could build up as its newest economic policy, begun on March 4, takes hold. Figures released by the Government today showed that inflation was cut from around 95.5 percent a month in March to 11.4 percent in April, and that the Government's fiscal surplus was rising.
Mr. Gonzalez Fraga did not say if the Government could resume full interest payments on its $62 billion of debt. But he did indicate that the Government wanted a healthy fiscal surplus, both to fend off another run on the Argentinian austral and to give the Government leverage in its debt negotiation.
''In order to have negotiating power with the banks we need a large position and we are very far from those levels,'' he said.
Both Mr. Gonzalez Fraga and President Menem said that Argentina would ask for substantial debt reduction from the commerical banks. As in the previous agreements with Mexico and Venezuela, such a plan would include reduction in existing pricipal, a cut in current interest rates to a fixed level and some new loans. Argentina is also is interested in buying back some existing debt at a substantial discount.
''The Government's strategy will be to propose wide-reaching negotiations which would imply a substantial reduction of the original debt capital,'' Mr. Menem said in his speech, as reported by the Reuters news service. ''This would be acheived through write-offs, interest reductions and repurchases at market prices,'' Mr. Menem said.

HEADLINE: Behind Thai Boom: The Japanese

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand

 BODY:
Asia is replete with economic miracle stories, so it is little surprise that Thailand has joined the list as having one of the world's fastest-growing economies. As evidence, the number of cars have tripled, choking traffic, and cement is in short supply as prosperous-looking houses and industrial parks rise almost at once.
But Thailand's remarkable boom has a twist that in many ways signals the future of much of Southeast Asia. The money, the technology, the business strategies and now even the emergency shipments of cement all come from Japan. And with a mixture of elation and misgivings, Thais themselves sometimes talk about their country as Japan's newest ''economic colony,'' a country whose prosperity is partly attributable to its role as a relief valve for Japan's skyrocketing land prices and acute labor shortage.
The torrent of Japanese investment so apparent in Thailand is also cascading into Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, where the skills of workers are rising and Japan sees a chance to lock up the booming Southeast Asian market while the United States and Germany are distracted by the rush into Eastern Europe. The question increasingly being asked here, though, is whether it is wise for Southeast Asia to place so much of its economic destiny in Japanese hands. 
''It is not in our interest to be too dependent on the Japanese,'' said Snoh Unakul, chairman of the Thailand Development Research Institute and a former Government official responsible for drawing in foreign investment. ''But we are having a difficult time getting the attention of America and Europe. They are simply not competitive.''
And though there are still conflicts with Japanese investors here, Dr. Snoh notes, corporate Japan is coming in largely on Thailand's terms -a change that has dampened the resentments and tensions that go back to Japan's brutal occupation of Southeast Asia 50 years ago.
''The land and labor problems in Japan have left them with no choice,'' Dr. Snoh said. ''They are forced by circumstances to be more open with technology and shared management responsibility. Now, we feel we are being treated more equally.''
The Thais have also encouraged the transfer of Japanese skills, notably by trying to enforce stringent local-content laws governing the automobile industry.
Japan's influence permeates Thailand in a way it did not even four years ago. The cars and pickup trucks jamming Thailand's city streets and back mountain roads are almost exclusively Toyotas, Nissans, Isuzus and Hondas - all with no emission controls. By 1992, Japanese officials predict, 300,000 Thais, or 15 percent of the country's manufacturing workers, will be employed by Japanese companies. That figure is now a little under 10 percent.
 
Adopting the Japanese Way
Japanese managers experienced in setting up plants in the United States and soothing political squabbles have arrived here, hoping to do in Bangkok what they did in Georgetown, Ky., and Smyrna, Tenn., the American production sites for Toyota and Nissan, respectively.
And like an uncertain student who decides the safest course is to mimic the teacher, Thailand's businesses are already adopting Japanese corporate behavior. At 8:30 one recent morning, employees at a nearby industrial park dominated by Japanese companies performed stretching exercises at their desks, while manufacturing workers outside sang a Japanese company song, translated into Thai. And deals are made by players on new golf courses.
So far, Japan's widening business role in Southeast Asia has had two dramatic effects, business executives and government officials say. The first is a significant erosion of American economic influence in the region, where the United States had been the biggest investor. When talking about money or technology the countries in the region invariably look to Japan.
The trend is clearest in Thailand: Last year Japan provided nearly half of the $8.2 billion foreign investment in Thailand. Taiwan, also stepping up its offshore investments, came in second, though far behind Japan. The United States invested only $1 in Thailand for every $6 that came from Japan.
 
A Shift in Strategy
The second effect, which is more subtle, is a fundamental shift in the way Japan is fitting Southeast Asia into its plans to internationalize its industries and blunt the political backlash from Japan's huge trade surpluses. Japanese companies have long had a significant presence in Southeast Asia, but in the past it was a small market for Japan and a cheap place to make low-cost, low-technology parts. Now the Southeast Asian market itself is exploding, and Japanese companies are carving the region into a loosely coordinated manufacturing bloc.
Under agreements with the major Southeast Asian nations, except Indonesia, companies like Toyota and Mitsubishi Motors plan to make diesel engines and electrical equipment in Thailand, then trade them for transmissions built in the Philippines or steering gears in Malaysia.
The result will be complete cars -most of them for sale in Asia, some for export to the United States and Europe - that never pass through Japan, and so do not add to Japan's trade surpluses.
Mitsubishi Motors is already assembling Japanese-designed cars in Thailand, then shipping them to Canada, where they are sold under an American nameplate - Chrysler. The car is not a Japanese import, but it is hardly entirely Thai, either.
 
'It Is Profitable'
''We are in Southeast Asia because it is profitable, especially now,'' a senior Japanese auto executive said recently. ''But it also solves a lot of political problems, not only in Asia but across the Pacific.''
Still, economists and business executives in Thailand say that in two or three years, Japanese investment may tail off, at least until the country's roads, dilapidated telephone system and work force catch up to the breathless 11 to 13 percent annual growth over the last two years.
''I can't imagine that the Japanese investment can keep increasing this fast,'' said Isao Kubokawa, a former official of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry who now runs the Japan External Trade Organization's office here. ''There are very few Japanese companies that are not already here.''
The reach of Japan's investment can be seen throughout Thailand. Industrial parks are springing up around Bangkok; one recent morning, scores of Thai employees lined up, Japanese-style, at a new Toshiba plant to salute the company's first shipment of color television tubes, bound for other Southeast Asian nations. A few days later the president of Fujitsu Ltd. dedicated a new factory - owned by Fujitsu itself, a departure from the usual Japanese practice of taking on a local joint venture partner - that will produce computer parts.
The influence can even been seen in the smaller towns to the north, near the borders of Myanmar, formerly Burma, and Laos. One recent weekend in the ancient city of Chiang Rai, Buddhist monks lined up in their saffron robes at a temple, while next door at a Mitsubishi Motors dealership farmers inspected a pickup truck.
 
A Strong Auto Market
For years Japanese companies kept small operations here, even after American companies left at the end of the Vietnam War. In Tokyo, though, Thailand was considered something of a poor backwater, a market that would bloom some day in the distant future.
Now, for the Japanese and the few Americans who stayed, that day has arrived. The International Business Machines Corporation says that Thailand is now its fastest-growing Asian market. But American auto makers, who earlier shunned what they deemed a small and difficult market, are missing an explosion in auto sales.
In 1987, sales of cars and pickup trucks - Thailand's favorite mode of transportation - topped 100,000 for the first time. Last year they totaled 208,000, and some say they may approach 300,000 this year. ''I keep wondering where the Americans are,'' said Takashi Murasawa, a senior official of MMC Sittipol Company, the Mitsubishi Motors joint venture here.
The beneficiaries are all of Japan's car makers, who control 92 percent of the market despite stiff local-content laws that have required them to produce half to three-quarters of their components in Thailand.
 
Wages Are Low
But if Thailand thought it was about to learn the high-tech secrets of auto making it was wrong. Factories here look like flashbacks to the 1930's. ''We don't have any robots here,'' said Suparat Sirisuwanangkura, the manager of component engineering, ''because the labor is still very cheap.'' An average auto worker in Thailand earns about $200 a month, about what a skilled Japanese auto worker would make in a day.
A key element in the Japanese auto makers' regional strategy lies in persuading Southeast Asian nations to abandon their hopes of building ''national'' cars, in which every component is produced in their own country.
''The volumes are too low and they are very uneconomical,'' said Ninnart Chaithirapinyo, associate director of Toyota Motor Thailand. So the auto companies have assigned subsidiaries in each country to produce certain key components of each car, and in most cases have persuaded governments to treat those parts as if they were ''domestic content.''
''The idea is to trade parts roughly equally,'' Mr. Ninnart said. ''In practice, though, it is difficult to balance.''
Indonesia has refused to participate, apparently fearing that efforts to build its own cars would be undermined. Malaysia has already mounted its own effort. For five years, the country has been building the Proton Saga, a national car, although two years ago Mitsubishi had to step in to rescue the project.
Whether Japan is really willing to share its high-tech knowledge with countries like Thailand is a matter of considerable debate. The companies all say they share generously, often bringing Thai or Malaysian engineers to Tokyo for training. But employees say that Japan is keeping its most sophisticated manufacturing processes to itself.
''We need to put more emphasis on getting Japan to part with its technology,'' Dr. Snoh said.

HEADLINE: Talking Deals;
The Slowdown In Bank Mergers

BYLINE: By Michael Quint

 BODY:
WHEN the Bank of New York acquired the Irving Bank Corporation in 1988, the combination was hailed as an example of the wave of bank mergers that would create a new generation of larger, more profitable banks.
Bankers and analysts still agree that the benefits of mergers - particularly the opportunity to cut costs - will make some of them attractive. But a sharp drop in bank stock prices and poor earnings resulting from losses on real estate loans have made bankers more prone to look inward.
The change in conditions is dramatic enough that the Bank of New York is balking at acquiring the $3.4 billion-in-assets Northeast Bancorp of Shelton, Conn., as it agreed to do several years ago as soon as Connecticut law allowed. The Bank of New York has set a $12.31-a-share value on Northeast stock, which would result in a $215.4 million takeover, while Northeast values its shares at $33.50 each, for a sales price of $586.2 million. Northeast has filed a lawsuit to force the merger. 
The slowdown in large mergers is closely tied to the steep decline in bank stock prices since last October. ''Sellers are slow to adjust to the drop in bank stock prices, and they are now holding out for the high prices that seemed feasible last year but which are now beyond buyers' reach,'' said Richard J. Barrett, a managing director at Salomon Brothers.
With more than 12,000 banks, merger activity has not stopped cold. According to Bank Mergers and Acquisitions, a newsletter published by SNL Securities of Hoboken, N.J., there were 47 acquisitions of banks or savings and loans announced in the first quarter of this year, with a value of about $1.2 billion. In the fourth quarter of 1989, there were 59 deals valued at $1.8 billion and in the third quarter of 1989 there were 40 deals worth $5.3 billion.
Because most banks pay for most large acquisitions by issuing new stock, a lower stock price means that more new shares must be issued, to the disadvantage of existing shareholders.
''The currency for acquisitions, our stock, is depressed right now,'' said Robert Smith, the acquisition-minded chief executive at the Security Pacific Corporation of Los Angeles.
The mergers offering the greatest benefit for his bank, he said, would be those with companies like First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles, which operates in Security Pacific's home market. But according to an interview in the United States Banker, a trade magazine, Mr. Smith said he would consider a merger with the Chemical Banking Corporation of New York. Chemical would offer geographic diversity and has a large branch system. But it would not give Security Pacific the potential for cost savings as would a merger closer to home.
Chemical, the Chase Manhattan Corporation and the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation have been mentioned as logical merger candidates by many analysts. All have large, profitable branch networks. By cutting expenses, a merger of any two of those banking concerns would result in a company whose profits should be greater than the sum of the profits of the two independent banks. Assuming a 20 percent cut in non-interest expenses for things like duplicated branches and headquarters staff, profits at Chase would rise about $720 million following a merger with another of the large banks. At Chemical, the gain would be $520 million, and at Manufacturers, $400 million.
The need for consolidation is acute, Mr. Barrett of Salomon Brothers and other analysts say. With more than 12,000 banks in the United States, they say, the industry is too fragmented to compete effectively with foreign banks that are expanding their share of the worldwide market and the American market. ''Eventually, American banks have to begin thinking that it might be better to share the costs of new technology and new products rather than butting heads,'' Mr. Barrett said.
Gary W. Parr, an investment banker at Wasserstein, Perella & Company, said, ''The economic benefits of mergers are as great today as any time in the past.'' But the preference for independence is so ingrained among many bankers that ''it may take some outside force to force them to merge,'' he added. The outside force may be regulators or an unwanted offer from another banking company, he said.
Whatever the motives for merger, analysts expect that shareholders of acquired banks will reap a profit. The banks most likely to be taken over are profitable, have management that would not reject merger proposals out of hand, and have a large share of their local market, analysts at Shearson Lehman Brothers say.
These analysts' top 20 takeover candidates include five that are among the 50 largest banking concerns. They are: the UJB Financial Corporation of Princeton, N.J.; the Signet Banking Corporation of Richmond; the Southeast Banking Corporation of Miami; Huntington Bancshares Inc. of Columbus, Ohio, and the Michigan National Corporation of Farmington Hills, Mich.

HEADLINE: U.S. Talks to Banks About Easing Poland's Debt

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 9

 BODY:
The Bush Administration told Congress today that it opposed writing off American Government debt in Eastern Europe, but raised the possibility that commercial banks could forgive a portion of their debts and provide Poland with additional loans through special provisions of the Brady debt reduction plan.
Under the plan disclosed 14 months ago by the Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, incentives offered by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank are meant to entice commercial banks to voluntarily forgive a portion of their debts in countries that pledge ambitious economic reforms. The Administration said Poland now met that requirement.
So far, the formula has been applied to six countries - Mexico, Costa Rica, the Philippines, Ecuador, Venezuela and Morocco. Poland would be the first to benefit in Eastern Europe. 
Of Poland's $38 billion of foreign debt, about 20 percent is held by commercial banks, mostly German. The stake of American banks is relatively small.
David C. Mulford, the Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, told the House Banking Committee's Subcommittee on International Development, Finance, Trade and Monetary Policy today that the Treasury had been in contact with American and foreign banks on Polish debt reduction. It was the first indication of active involvement by the Treasury in the Polish debt situation.
''We have not told the banks what to do,'' Mr. Mulford told the lawmakers. But pointing to Poland's sweeping free market economic reforms, he added, ''We would look to the banks for a voluntary negotiation to address the issue of debt reduction for those banks that want to make that choice.''
Representatives of some commercial banks were cool to the idea. ''The short-term problem is to stabilize the Polish economy,'' said Horst Schulmann, managing director of the Institute of International Finance, which represents 160 commercial banks.
He also said there could be a ''very strong negative impact'' if the United States and other governments sought to ''jawbone'' the banks into a debt-reduction plan for Poland, as occurred late last year with Mexico.
Asked whether his response meant that banks would not engage in negotiations with Poland under the Brady plan, he responded, ''Never say no.''
 
Government Firm on Loans
Bankers also argued that it was unfair to ask for commercial debts to be written off in Eastern Europe when the governments of the industrial countries refused to mark down their own loans. Third world governments owe the United States $63 billion, said Mr. Mulford; Poland's share of that is $3 billion.
Two subcommittee members, John J. LaFalce, Democrat of upstate New York, and Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, urged a special American program to write off Government loans to Eastern Europe. Representative LaFalce proposed that the United States forgive Poland's $3 billion debt and see to it that the money went into the environmental cleanup of Poland.
But Mr. Mulford outlined a series of reasons why the Bush Administration was opposed to such actions. He cited budget implications, ''when we have major budget problems already;'' the drawbacks of favoring one region of the world over another, and technicalities in which a writeoff for one country automatically improves the status of debt held by others.
 
Strong Reaction
Mr. Schulmann reacted strongly to the idea that banks forgive debt while the Government does not. ''Mulford says he can't do it because of $63 billion,'' he said. ''But what the hell does he think he's talking about, commercial banks hold close to $1 trillion of third world debts.''
Poland's Finance Minister, Leszek Balcerowicz, who has been here to attend the spring meetings of the I.M.F. and the World Bank, told reporters Tuesday that a failure to obtain debt relief would jeopardize Poland's program to privatize large sections of its economy, which is 80 percent state-owned. He indicated that Warsaw would seek an 80 percent cut in interest payments.
At present, Poland is making no payments to commercial banks. Earlier this year it won concessions on debt it owes to foreign governments under which it is freed from interest payments until March 1991.

HEADLINE: Campeau Units Get Extension

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, May 9

 BODY:
Federated Department Stores Inc. and the Allied Stores Corporation today obtained a four-month extension in which to file their reorganization plan to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
Lawyers for the retailing units of the Campeau Corporation told United States Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. that they might need even longer than the new deadline of Sept. 12 because the case was so complex. Federated and Allied have more than 200,000 creditors, about 100,000 employees and operate 260 stores. 
Judge Aug also ruled today against B. Bros. Realty Limited Partnership, the investment firm of the Bloomingdale family that owns the land under Bloomingdale's, the flagship store of the Federated chain.
 
Attempt to Evict Store
B. Bros had been trying to evict the Manhattan store, contending in court papers that Federated had violated the store's lease, which runs until 2006, by transferring it to the Bloomingdale's name as part of the bankruptcy proceeding.
B. Bros. had been prevented from acting on the eviction by an April 20 stay, but the firm, which wanted the store vacated by May 17, had moved to have the stay lifted.
But Judge Aug angrily rejected the motion to remove the stay, saying it was ''procedurally inappropriate'' and that the landowner should have proceeded under a different part of the Bankruptcy Code to protect its rights to the store lease.
He said the store was operating normally and paying the rent promptly, and added that he was puzzled why B. Bros. had waited so long to protest the purported breach of the lease since Federated had filed for bankruptcy in January. And he said that he ''saw no economic damage to B. Bros. from the alleged breach.''
The judge ordered B. Bros. to pay Federated's legal fees that arose from the litigation by B. Bros.
John L. Ernst, the general partner of B. Bros., could not be reached for comment yesterday.
Carol Sanger, a Federated spokeswoman, said the defense costs had not been determined. Settlement with I.R.S. Judge Aug also approved a settlement that Federated had negotiated with the Internal Revenue Service in a dispute over taxes on inventory movement and size from 1981 to 1983.
Under the agreement, Federated will receive a $23 million refund from the I.R.S., but will adopt I.R.S. tax computing methods over a 10-year period - starting with the 1983 tax year - that could increase Federated's taxes by $14 million.
Rick Cieri, an attorney for Federated, said the settlement increases the value of Federated for creditors, provides additional money for its operations and saves the cost of litigation.
The judge approved the settlement over the objection of Citibank, which wanted to know whether Federated's parent, Federated Stores Inc., would claim any of the $23 million refund.
Robert Seppelt, vice president of taxes for Federated Department Stores, said the parent company had no claim to the $23 million.

Kodak Tells Holders To Expect Better Year

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., May 9

 BODY:
The Eastman Kodak Company, the world's largest maker of photographic products, said today that it expected an improved financial picture for the year after posting a 62 percent drop in profits last year.
''As 1990 unfolds and our gains from restructuring take hold, we look forward to higher sales, better earnings and improved cash flows, especially in the latter part of the year,'' Kodak's departing chairman, Colby H. Chandler, told shareholders at its annual meeting here.
He reported progress on a reorganization plan for the company. Last year's profits plummeted to $529 million, from $1.4 billion in 1988, with Kodak attributing the setback to restructuring costs, higher interest rates and exchange-rate fluctuations that cut into overseas earnings. 
Mr. Chandler said that Kodak, based in Rochester, cut about 5 percent of its staff and that the employee wage-dividend formula had been tied to company performance.
Kay R. Whitmore, 57 years old, Kodak's president, will add the positions of chairman and chief executive on June 1, succeeding Mr. Chandler, 64. Mr. Chandler has been chairman and chief executive since 1983.
The company said it saw good growth in traditional photography and would exploit its proprietary technology in film and electronic imaging over the next decade.
Kodak said it had no plans to sell its Sterling Drug Inc. unit or any other assets to pay for its litigation with the Polaroid Corporation. Mr. Whitmore told reporters after the meeting that the company could pay for the pending litigation out of its earnings.
''Kodak can handle anything within what the Street talks about,'' Mr. Whitmore said. He was referring to recent Wall Street estimates that the Polaroid instant-photography case regarding patent infringement could cost the company about $1 billion.
A Federal judge is expected to set damages soon against Kodak for infringing Polaroid's patents.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange today, Kodak's shares rose 50 cents each, to $38.125.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money-Fund Yields Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were down for tax-exempts and unchanged for taxables for the week ended yesterday.
Analysts at Donoghue's noted that everything was pointing up for interest rates until last Friday, when the monthly employment figures were released disclosing a smaller than expected increase. The next month's round of economic data may give more clues about the economy. If the numbers show more weakness, the Fed may be persuaded to ease credit and lower short-term rates. 
Donoghue's seven-day compounded average yield for a taxable money market fund is unchanged at 7.96 percent, while the 30-day average yield declined by one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point, to 7.98 percent.
Assets of taxable funds declined by $1.2 billion for the week, to a total of $377 billion, with institutional assets down $300 million, to $79.1 billion, and consumer assets off by $900 million, to $297.9 billion.
The average days to maturity of securities held in managers' portfolios remained unchanged at 45.
Among the general-purpose money market funds with assets of more than $100 million that are surveyed by IBC/Donoghue's, Dreyfus World Wide Dollar Money Market fund, distributed by the Dreyfus Service Corporation in Garden City, L.I., showed the best return for the week, with a yield of 8.91 percent, unchanged from last week. The fund has now posted the best return for the better part of two months.
Yields of tax-exempt funds were down for the week ended yesterday, while assets were up about $180 million, to $75.6 billion. Swings in assets of under $200 million are not considered unusual. The average seven-day compounded yield declined five basis points, to 5.74 percent, and about where it was two weeks ago. For investors in a 28 percent tax bracket the equivalent taxable yield is 7.97 percent, and 8.56 percent for those in a 33 percent bracket.
Donoghue's said the Calvert Tax Free Reserve California portfolio, distributed by the Calvert Group, Washington, had the best yield for the second consecutive week. The return was 6.49 percent, down from 6.67 percent the previous week. The yield is about 75 basis points points better than the seven-day average.
By comparison, The Bank Rate Monitor's national index shows that while bank money market accounts yields are slipping, yields on certificates of deposit are growing more competitive. The average money market account fell one basis point, to 6.23 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off Sharply on Fears Of Softening U.S. Economy

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply yesterday against most major currencies as the foreign exchange market grew increasingly concerned about indications that the United States economy is softening.
Traders and currency analysts said the strength of the West German mark and the Swiss franc accounted for much of the dollar's losses, although the dollar also fell sharply against the Japanese yen.
The dollar traded at 1.4020 Swiss francs late yesterday in New York, down sharply from 1.4310 francs late Tuesday. It fell more than 2 pfennigs against the West German mark and more than a yen against the Japanese currency. 
The Swiss franc is being viewed as a safe haven for investors because many other major currencies appear troubled by domestic concerns, said Brian Guidera, a currency trader for the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
''It's being seen to be the only logical alternative to the uncertainty elsewhere in the world,'' he said. ''As far as high-yielding currencies go, it's seen as stable.''
Traders also said the Swiss franc was lifted by that nation's relatively high interest rates.
 
Employment Report a Factor
The dollar was viewed as the currency of choice until Friday, when Government figures showed employment growth in April was far lower than economists expected, traders said. That report altered the belief that the United States economy was expanding and that higher interest rates would result.
Higher domestic interest rates increase the relative attractiveness of returns on a nation's currency.
The West German mark also showed renewed strength yesterday. The dollar was trading at 1.6365 marks in New York late in the day, down from 1.6575 marks late Tuesday.
William Harrington, an international economist with the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said the mark had benefited from the recent belief that the union of the currencies of West Germany and East Germany would go more smoothly than originally forecast.
In New York, the dollar fell to 156.50 yen in late trading, from 157.63 yen late Tuesday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 157.03 yen, down 1.02 yen from Tuesday's close, and in London, it was quoted lower, at 156.40 yen.
The British pound rose to $1.6785 in London, from $1.6697 late Tuesday. In New York, the pound fetched $1.6785, up from $1.6705 late Tuesday.
Meanwhile, gold prices rose. Bullion for immediate delivery on the New York Commodity Exchange rose $1.90 an ounce, to $371.90. The Republic National Bank in New York also quoted bullion at $371.90 an ounce as of 4 P.M., up $2 from late Tuesday.
Gold traded at $370.75 an ounce in London late yesterday, up from $369.75 late Tuesday. In Zurich, gold traded at $370.75, up from $369 bid late Tuesday. Earlier, gold in Hong Kong dropped $2.49 an ounce to close at $370.93.

Aug. 18, 1988 ''The Congress will push me to raise taxes, and I'll say no, and they'll push, and I'll say no, and they'll push again, and I'll say to them, 'Read my lips: 'No new taxes.'''- George Bush, in his acceptance speecha t the Republican National Convention.
Jan. 19, 1989 ''The President meant no new taxes as it would ordinarily be understood by ordinary Americans. I think the burden of that is the duck test - if it looks like a duck, it's a duck.'' - Richard G. Darman, budget director, telling Congress the Administration would not disguise tax proposals in euphemisms.
Jan. 22, 1989 Asked in a televised interview how long Mr. Bush's no-new-taxes pledge would last, John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, said, ''As long as the climate of this country is appropriate for that commitment to stay in place.''
After Mr. Sununu's comments, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Sununu ''didn't mean to imply any time limit,'' and added, ''The President is opposed tax increases in any year.''
Feb. 8, 1990 Michael Boskin, the President's chief economic adviser, was asked if the tax position applied throughout Mr. Bush's first term. ''The President, to my knowledge, has not said that there is no conceivable possibility over a four-year term. What he has said it is his hope that he will be able to extend this as long as possible, and we certainly hope we'll be able to do it this year.''

HEADLINE: RACE AND JUSTICE: A KILLING IN EAST TEXAS - A SPECIAL REPORT.;
Death as a Ripple in Deep Racial Current

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME with ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HEMPHILL, Tex., May 8

 BODY:
Loyal Garner Jr. had been dead for only an hour when officials began the fight over his body and over who would rule on how he had died.
Officials in this small town where he had been found comatose on a jail cell floor labeled his death an accident and wanted the body returned quickly. But officials 100 miles away in the city of Tyler, where he had been taken for medical treatment and where he died, thought the death was suspicious and refused.
Last week, more than two years after the 34-year-old black truck driver was beaten to death in this hamlet in the East Texas piney woods, a jury in Tyler convicted three white officers of his murder.
The story of the killing of Mr. Garner on Christmas night 1987 is a story of race and of a legal battle between officials in a backwoods town and those in a small city. 
One jury acquitted the officers of civil-rights violations in a hometown trial that saw white residents cheer the verdict as if celebrating a Friday night football victory. Another jury convicted them of murder.
''There was kind of a line drawn in the dust and you had to get on one side of the line or the other,'' said J. T. Roy, an investigator for the Southern Poverty Law Center in Alabama, a civil rights legal organization. ''And Loyal Garner just became a bartering chip, no matter how brutally he was killed. What mattered was the issue of whether the outsiders were going to win.''
Despite the conviction and an agreement by local officials to pay an undisclosed amount to the Garner family in the settlement of a civil lawsuit, the case lives on in appeals and in the resentment of local whites who feel they have been put under a spotlight for the sort of crime that they feel can and does happen elsewhere.
''I guess this is the only town in the country where this happens,'' a local businessman, Robert Gilcrease, said sarcastically. ''Like a car wreck, it happened. It can happen to you, it can happen to us. People here don't understand why it still gets all this attention.''
Set in a lush landscape of thickets and lakes near the Louisiana line in deep East Texas, Hemphill typifies what a University of Texas English professor, Donald Graham, calls ''the unmythic, unglamorous part of the state.''
This is not the expansive Texas of endless spaces and possibilities; it is a world far more like the Deep South than the West. But if its racial history is distinctly Southern, this is the gritty, outer edge of the South without any illusions of antebellum nobility.
For blacks, who make up about 20 percent of Hemphill's 1,350 residents, life had been a long, silent accommodation with economic and political powerlessness - until, that is, Mr. Garner was murdered, and local blacks for the first time turned to protest marches, even founding a local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The Arrest Clamor, Then Clash In a Jail By the standards of the poor timber town of Florien, La., Loyal Garner's $5.50 an hour job with the parish government was a mark of success.
Married with six children, Mr. Garner came from a well-known and respected family in town. He had never been in trouble with the law. He drank a beer or two socially but no one recalls seeing him drunk. His was a regular Sunday presence at the Pilgrim Star Baptist Church.
On Christmas Day 1987, Mr. Garner and two friends set out on the short drive to Newton, Tex., to pick up an automobile that he planned to overhaul. But on the way, Mr. Garner crossed paths with Thomas Ladner, Hemphill's police chief. A lifelong resident and one of the dominant forces in town, the 275-pound Chief Ladner was respected by many people in Sabine County and was feared by many others.
About 8 P.M., shortly after crossing the state line on the bridge that spans the Toledo Bend Reservoir in his black 1975 Ford custom cab pickup, Mr. Garner was stopped by Chief Ladner and Sabine County Sheriff's Deputy James Hyden. Mr. Garner was arrested for drunken driving and his two companions, Alton Maxie and Johnnie Maxie, were charged with public intoxication.
 
Conflicting Alcohol Readings
The Maxie brothers said Mr. Garner had drunk two beers. No alcohol test was given Mr. Garner and laboratory tests after his death gave conflicting readings on whether he had alcohol in his body. All accounts agree on the events immediately after the arrest.
The three men accepted their arrest peacefully and were not handcuffed when they were put in the back of a squad car.
At the Sabine County jail, a one-story structure just off Hemphill's town square, they were put into a detoxification cell. After a while the three began banging on the cell door, demanding to make a telephone call to their families.
Chief Ladner walked back to the cell and loudly asked who was making all the noise. ''I was,'' Mr. Garner answered. Accounts of what happened next are contradictory.
The Maxie brothers and other inmates said Chief Ladner, without provocation, hit Mr. Garner five or six times with a metal slapjack while Deputy Hyden stood in the doorway with his hand on his gun. The inmates said Mr. Garner was then taken to the jail's processing room where the beating continued, with Sheriff's Deputy Billy Ray Horton in attendance.
 
Reports of Earlier Beatings
The officers said Mr. Garner, drunk and abusive, was hit once in self-defense by Chief Ladner and was then injured in a scuffle as officers tried to restrain him. But their story varied over time.
Former inmates of the Sabine County jail have since said that beatings had taken place there from time to time. But when a jail guard came to work the morning after Mr. Garner's arrest to find him comatose on the concrete floor, it was clear this was serious.
Mr. Garner was taken to the nearby Sabine County Hospital and then to Tyler Medical Center, a larger facility 100 miles away, where neurosurgery could be performed. He died the next day.
Because he died in Smith County, where Tyler is the county seat, and not Sabine County, where Hemphill is situated, officials both inside and outside Hemphill had legal standing in the case. And a tug-of-war began.
A Smith County Justice of the Peace, Bill Beaird, says that about an hour after Mr. Garner died, Sabine County Judge Royce Smith, the top elected county official, called him to say that Hemphill officials had already determined the death was an accident and wanted to come and pick up Mr. Garner's body. Judge Smith said Sheriff Blan Greer could vouch for that.
 
Refuses to Release Body
Mr. Beaird, repeating what a nurse had already told Hemphill officials, politely but firmly said he could not release the body, pending an inquiry. He repeated the same message when Mr. Smith called still again.
''Let me put it to you in plain English,'' Mr. Beaird recalls saying. ''That body ain't leaving here until such time as I get through with it to make some kind of determination or have the information available so I can hold an inquest.''
At his office, Mr. Smith declined to comment.
Mr. Beaird's decision meant that eyes outside Hemphill would view the case, and it set in motion a two-track courtroom drama that is at the heart of the legal issues still surrounding the case.
Within days, an autopsy in Tyler cited a massive brain hemorrhage from repeated blows to the head as the cause of death. Before a week had passed both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Rangers had heard the Maxie brothers tell their story of the beatings. Soon the Southern Poverty Law Center, known for vigorous civil rights lawsuits, filed the civil suit on behalf of the Garner family that allowed them to take depositions from local officials.
On Jan. 4, Chief Ladner and the two deputies were indicted in Hemphill by the state on felony charges of violating Mr. Garner's civil rights, and they were suspended from duty. Local officials said at the time that a murder indictment would have required proof of an intent to kill.
In Tyler, District Attorney Jack Skeen was aiming for a murder trial. On March 4, a Smith County grand jury indicted the three Hemphill officers for homicide.
When a trial date in July was set in Tyler, an earlier trial, in May, was scheduled in Hemphill.
Mr. Skeen, the Smith County prosecutor, said, ''It seemed to us at the time that the judge in Hemphill was doing everything he could to have it tried down there first.'' The Town An Ingrown Place Defending Its Own Like the old domino players who meet daily under the cedar tree on the square, Hemphill has been a place where little has changed over the years. With its three-story brick courthouse dominating a placid square ringed by aged brick businesses with metal awnings, Hemphill is small enough that any visitor who is not one of the 1,350 residents in town immediately sticks out.
Longtime residents still resent those they call the ''lake people,'' the retirees and newer residents who live along the rich bass fishing lakes nearby. The lake people grouse about the ''piney woods mentality'' of the oldtimers. But otherwise Hemphill lives by its own slow, amiable rhythms far from airports and Interstate highways.
Suddenly, there were satellite trucks from the big city television stations camped out on the square. Not everyone in town liked all the indicted officers, particularly Chief Ladner. But they liked the outside scrutiny even less, and before long the town was rallying around the officers.
 
Officers Were Local Men
Some saw law enforcement under siege. But it was more personal than that. All three officers were local men who were entrusted with keeping the peace, whether it meant investigating a robbery or making sure high school students stayed in line.
And if there were numerous stories of brutality at the jail, the three were as much a part of the local scene as the domino players. The best liked was probably Mr. Horton, a 60-year-old former cattle rancher who had gone into law enforcement after his wife died of cancer a few years earlier.
In rallying around the officers, many residents felt they were simply doing what people in small towns tend to do: helping out neighbors in trouble. The fact that the dead man was an unknown black jail inmate only heightened their natural instincts.
Even though a special prosecutor had been brought in from outside the county, most local blacks assumed from the start there would not be a conviction in Hemphill. And the beginning of the trial in the sweltering, baby-blue third-floor courtroom did little to change their mind.
Judge O'Neal Bacon of the local State District Court refused to disqualify potential jurors who attended a benefit fish fry for the officers. The judge ended up sitting a jury of 11 whites and one black, a housekeeper who worked for one of the white jurors.
 
It's Us Against Them
They heard the conflicting accounts of the events Christmas night. They heard the results of the Tyler autopsy, and they heard Dr. Grover Winslow, a local physician who attends to the jail and who had posted bond for Mr. Horton, testify that Mr. Garner had alcohol and Valium in his body and could have died of some mixture of the two.
In his closing argument, John Seale, a defense attorney from nearby Jasper, made explicit what had been welling up since the day Garner died.
''So what has this case become?'' he asked. ''It's become an indictment, not against these three men, but against Sabine County and everything that has to do with Sabine County.''
The appeal worked. On July 15, the second day of deliberations, to cheers of delight from the packed courthouse, the jury announced it that it had acquitted all three men.
The murder trial in Tyler was to start in a week, but the very day after the Hemphill verdict, defense attorneys moved for dismissal of the murder charges on the ground of double jeopardy, the legal prohibition against trying a person on the same charge twice.
So far, the legitimacy of having two trials has been upheld, with the case now before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans.
Last month prosecutors in Tyler began presenting their murder case to a jury in Tyler. But while Mr. Seale in Hemphill had insisted that Hemphill was on trial, Mr. Skeen in Tyler tried to convince jurors of the reverse, that they had to prove that Smith County was capable of providing the justice that Hemphill had not.
The jury in Tyler, which during the oil boom grew to a city of 81,000 that now takes its cues from Dallas instead of the small towns of East Texas, was allowed to see the grotesque autopsy photographs of Mr. Garner that the judge in Hemphill had excluded on the grounds that they were inflammatory. And there were two new witnesses.
Dr. Ronald Donaldson, a Tyler neurosurgeon, gave graphic testimony about the severity of Mr. Garner's wounds. Ronnie Felts, a former Hemphill Mayor, became the only Hemphill official to break ranks and testify for the prosecution. He told of Mr. Ladner's conflicting accounts of the incident.
 
Difference Was the Juries
This time the jury found all three defendants guilty.
In the end, Mr. Seale said, ''The difference was two different juries in two different towns.''
Weeping openly in the courtroom, Mr. Skeen demanded life sentences. ''Establish by your verdict the real meaning of Smith County justice. This is Loyal Garner Jr.'s last chance.''
The jury sentenced Mr. Ladner to 28 years in prison, Mr. Hyden to 14 and Mr. Horton to 10. Officials say that primarily because of prison overcrowding, it is likely they will serve only a year for every 10 they were sentenced to if the guilty verdict stands. The Future Separate Ways In Same Rhythm For a brief instant after Mr. Garner's death it seemed like everything in Hemphill was subject to change.
There was an emotional meeting at a black church in which blacks and whites, for the first time in the town's history, came together to share what they had in common and what still divided them. There was the town's first protest march and the formation of its first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
But two and a half years after he died, Mr. Garner's death divides blacks and whites as much as anything ever did. There are widespread doubts by blacks as well as whites as to whether race had anything to do with his murder. But no one doubts that on the stark, small canvas of Hemphill, its aftermath has become another profile in black and white.
 
For Blacks, an Awakening
For blacks, Mr. Garner's death became a galvanizing event, a reminder of how far they still have to go.
''Sometimes,'' said Will Smith, a black and the pastor of the Fairdale Church of Christ, ''it takes death to bring life. If Loyal Garner's death did anything, it brought an awakening to the people of Sabine County. We're awake now. We're no longer asleep.''
There was no such revelation for whites. Some reacted with hostility, like one businessman who confidently said local blacks would not turn out for the protest march after the acquittal in Hemphill because they knew they would never get a job if they did. But for most, the case remains an isolated incident kept inexplicably alive and blown out of proportion by outsiders.
 
For Whites, Depression
Most whites are genuinely horrified and depressed by the depiction of Hemphill as a town where bigotry lives, noting with much truth that because of the compression of small town life, blacks and whites probably interact more in a place like Hemphill than in most large cities.
''We were made out like we were racists, like black and white don't speak to each other or sit next to each other at the drug store,'' said Mary McNaughten Pritchard, one of the jurors in the Hemphill trial. ''People are people. We think nothing of a black girl being given a ride to a district ballgame by a white family. We're just everyday people, there's no black and white about it.''
But sometimes the old antagonisms surface in an entirely unvarnished form.
Robert Gilcrease was lamenting the town's negative image at his business where he sells plastic fishing lures when a customer strode in and began assailing a visiting reporter for the ''lies'' being written about the town.
''You all keep writing about a 'brutal beating,' '' the customer said. ''I'd say it would take more than three licks to the head to make a brutal beating. Far as I'm concerned, it's just another dead nigger.''
He then offered to provide a first-hand lesson in what a ''brutal beating'' would be like before tearing away in his pickup truck.
 
Some Progress for Blacks
There have been scattered but real signs of progress, the appointment of the town's first black councilman, a black dispatcher hired at the jail, a black 1988 valedictorian at the high school, and a few blacks hired at local businesses.
There are still no black faces behind the counters at the businesses along the square, and other than the routine interractions of daily life, blacks and whites generally go their separate ways just as they always did. When Hemphill had its annual Mayfest, with fiddle music and Frito Pie and the crowning of a Mayfest Queen on the square Saturday, it was hard to find a black face.
Sheriff Greer is still in office and in charge of the jail. A new police chief and deputy sheriffs have been hired to replace the three convicted men.
And there is a new move afoot to help the convicted officers with their legal fees.
Mostly, for blacks and whites, there are just the same old slow rhythms of East Texas, the lunch buffet at Twitty's, the grousing between the original people and the lake people, the banter of the old domino players and the noisy slapping of the tiles on the table at the corner of the courthouse square.

HEADLINE: U.S. OFFICIALS URGE BANKERS TO AVOID TIGHTENING CREDIT

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
In an extraordinary meeting, the nation's top banking regulators urged banking industry executives today to continue lending to creditworthy customers.
Though the regulators did not say so explicitly, their remarks were interpreted as a signal to bankers that the Government does not want to see regional pockets of tight credit throughout the economy.
There have been repeated Government warnings this year about the dangers of real estate lending, but as he went into the meeting, L. William Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said: ''We are not saying not to lend. We are saying they should use their good judgment.'' 
 
Opening Doors to Bankers
The regulators - Mr. Seidman, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Robert L. Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency - told the directors of the American Bankers Association that they wanted to open more lines of communication. They said that at both the national and local levels their doors were open to bankers seeking guidance on lending practices.
Concern about tight credit generally focuses on home-equity loans, loans to small businesses and loans to real estate developers.
The meeting with the banking industry's largest trade group was the first time the three officials have jointly met with bankers.
The meeting comes during growing weakness in important real estate markets, like the Northeast. Regulators have been trying to tighten up on real estate lending standards to avoid a repeat of the savings and loan debacle. In recent years the main growth in bank lending has been real estate-related.
 
Worries on the Deficit
The session also comes as the Government struggles with a ballooning budget deficit, in large part because of the high cost of the savings bailout. Government officials fear the deficit will grow even higher if tight credit pushes rates up.
The Federal Reserve could lower rates but that would not necessarily encourage more lending in the face of lending rules that have become tighter.
Regulators are also aware that the assets of the F.D.I.C.'s banking insurance fund are at a historic low, as a percent of insured deposits. Though the rate of bank failures is running behind that of 1989, one or two failures of major banks could cripple the $13.2 billion fund.
Moreover, there are broader economic worries. The Federal Reserve is concerned about possibly reigniting inflation if regulators send a strong signal to the bankers to lend, lend, lend. Thus, the message today to the bankers was understated, and aimed at nudging rather than pushing them into new, but prudent, lending.
The meeting was initiated by Mr. Clarke, who has come under fire this year for his repeated warnings about real estate lending. Bankers say not only that those pronouncements have made them hesitant to lend, but that the statements have encouraged examiners from the Comptroller's office to be overly rigorous in auditing, forcing some banks to report large losses.
''In any economic environment, there are still good loans to be made,'' Mr. Clarke said after the meeting. ''We need to turn down the rhetoric and get back to the business of banking.''
Representatives of the bankers' group, who briefed reporters after the meeting, said the regulators told the gathering that there were no disparities in their examination standards and that they wanted to clear up any misconceptions or misunderstandings between the regulators and the bankers over lending standards.
Among the bankers at the meeting were Thomas Labrecque, president of Chase Manhattan, and Robert Smith, president of Security Pacific.
Banking executives said that while many of their members had complained that regulators had been putting pressure on them to withhold loans, the consensus of the group was that there was not a nationwide credit squeeze.
''The bankers felt that there is no liquidity crisis in the economy, but that there are areas of a slowdown in lending, tied to a slowdown in the local economy, and that is normal,'' said Donald G. Ogilvie, executive vice president of the bankers' group.
 
Complaints Are Common
Mr. Ogilvie said that in the last two months representatives of his assocation from 27 states have been in to the association's headquarters and in every group there have been bankers who complained about regulators forcing tighter lending policies.
''There are real estate problems in lots of parts of the country, not just in the Northeast,'' he said.
Mr. Greenspan said he did not see strong evidence of a credit squeeze, saying, ''The evidence is quite limited.''
Banking officials said Mr. Greenspan told the meeting: ''The nature of banking is risk-taking. And if you have zero loan losses, then you aren't doing your job.''
Some banking executives said the comments by the regulators were a clear signal that they are concerned about tight credit.
''This signals that the credit crunch is biting too deep,'' said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association, another trade group.
 
Tough Examinations
Bankers have complained that examiners who looked at real estate loans a year ago and found no problem are now making banks set aside cash to cover possible losses.
They have told of cases in which examiners insisted that loans that were being repaid on schedule be classified as troubled simply because the banks lacked recent appraisals of the properties serving as collateral for the loans.
Owners of small businesses in particular have complained that they are the ones ultimately harmed. With increasing frequency, they say, banks are withdrawing lines of credit, demanding more collateral and trimming estimates of the value of that collateral.
The regulators do not deny that there is a tightening of credit in important areas of the country. ''Where you have a downturn in the economy, it is inevitable that you are going to have a restriction of credit,'' Mr. Clarke said. But that ''doesn't mean you should freeze up all the lending.''
Some bankers and their representatives said today that in return for more lending activity, they would expect more understanding from the regulators. They say that for them to make more credit available, they cannot be concerned that regulators are going to continue forcing them to take large write-downs on the value of their real estate and small business loans.
Edward L. Yingling, head of the bankers' association's government relations office, said the issue was ''whether the examiners are going to go by the exact numbers, or give a local banker who knows a small-business owner some latitude.''
 
Regional Variations
The lending situation varies greatly from region to region, but is most severe in the Northeast. Large companies, over all, do not seem to be having trouble getting new loans.
Data compiled by the Fed show that lending has grown this year, but at a slower rate than in the past.
Business loans increased $3.1 billion in the first quarter of the year over the 1989 period, slower than the pace that produced almost $18 billion in new loans in 1989.

HEADLINE: Arabs Agree to Hold Talks in Baghdad

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TUNIS, May 10

 BODY:
Arab countries, increasingly alarmed over the influx of Soviet Jews to Israel, agreed today to hold a summit meeting in Baghdad.
The purpose of the meeting is to consider the influx of Soviet Jews and to lend support to Iraq in the face of Western protests to its effort to develop modern weaponry including long-range missiles and chemical weapons.
It is also likely to address continuing Arab divisions, particularly between Iraq and Syria. But Syria said it would not attend the meeting. 
Also on the agenda will be attempts to reconcile Arab states that favor a settlement with Israel, like Egypt and Jordan, against opponents of negotiations with Israel, including Iraq and Algeria.
Arab and Palestinian officials said the meeting was scheduled for May 28 so that it can be held in advance of the summit meeting between President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush set for May 30 in Washington.
Syria opposed Baghdad as the site; and Iran, which has not signed a treaty with Iraq after their long war, expressed misgivings.
Until Wednesday, Arab mediators were suggesting Cairo or Tunis as the site for the gathering, but pressure from major Arab countries led by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan proved decisive in the choice of Baghdad.
Arab diplomats said the reason for favoring Baghdad was the great amount of Arab support for the tough stand adopted by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq in his row with Western countries and Israel. President Hussein is one of the Arab leaders most hostile to Israel.
 
Alarm Over Jewish Influx
The idea of a summit meeting has been discussed over the last few weeks as Arab countries expressed increasing alarm over the influx of Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union who are settling in Israel and declarations by some Israeli leaders that some of those will be settled in Israeli-occupied territories.
Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, has repeatedly called on other Arabs to adopt diplomatic and economic measures aimed at discouraging Western financial and moral support for the movement of Soviet Jews to Israel, which reached 10,000 last month, according to reports from Israel.
Iraq, for its part, has strongly endorsed the idea of a summit meeting in Baghdad to strengthen the notion of Arab solidarity in its confrontation with the West. The United States, Western Europe and Israel have called for an end to Iraq's effort to develop long-range missiles, chemical weapons and other advanced armaments.
 
Iraq Claims Self Defense
President Hussein has repeatedly asserted that Iraq has a right to develop such weapons to defend itself against attacks by Israel.
In 1981, Israeli planes raided and destroyed an Iraqi nuclear reactor facility. Iraq could not then respond to the Israeli attack because it did not possess an advanced air force or long-range missiles.
Syria, which has been feuding with Iraq for years, has already warned that it will not attend any summit meeting that is held in Baghdad. Today, the official Baath Party newspaper said Damascus's ''announced position is still the same.''
Iran, another bitter enemy of Iraq which fought an eight-year-long war with Baghdad, warned Arab nations that a meeting in Baghdad would only strengthen President Hussein's expansionist ambitions.
Arab diplomats speculated that Iran's alarm at the revival of a wave of Arab support for Iraq has led to Teheran's agreement, announced today, to hold a meeting next Wednesday in Dublin with representatives of the European Community.
European and Iranian officials said the talks will touch on the issue of Western hostages held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian militias and further normalizing of economic and diplomatic ties between Iran and Western Europe.
The representatives of Iran and the European Community will also discuss relations soured by Iran's call for the death of the British author Salman Rushdie, the Teheran Radio said today.

While there were no surprises in the Pope's denunciation of contraception and abortion, his remarks had potential political dimensions for Mexicans. Their numbers are growing by about two million a year, straining an already troubled economy. 
The Pope also touched on another essential theme of this trip, relations between the Holy See and the Mexico, which have not had diplomatic ties since the mid-19th century. Antichurch feelings go back many decades to when the Catholic Church was considered an ally of repressive governments. Reflecting the situation is a Constitution from 1917 that includes harshly anticlerical provisions.
One prohibits the church from operating its own schools, and although the ban is honored in the breach these days, the Pope said it was time to get rid of it entirely.
''A person has the right to educate children liberally according to his own religious faith and to create schools to exercise this right,'' he told tens of thousands of worshipers at a service in Chihuahua. ''The laws of the country must recognize this right explicitly.''
The Pope's travels today, the fifth day of his Mexican journey, took him as close as he will get to the United States, with stops in Chihuahua, Mexico's largest state, and Monterrey, an industrial center 100 miles southwest of Laredo, Tex. Tens of thousands of Catholics filled a dusty field here that lay amid jagged red hills, including many transplanted Mexicans who had made the pilgrimage from Texas.
The question of birth control is a touchy one in Mexico, where 40 percent of the population of 86 million are below the age of 15.
The Pope did not directly admonish the Mexican Government for its aggressive efforts at family planning, but he has done so in the past and his criticism this time was implicit.
According to Planned Parenthood, nearly half of married Mexican women use some form of contraception, helping to shrink the population growth rate from 3.5 percent in the mid-1970's to slightly under 2 percent. The Government goal is to bring that down to 1 percent by the end of the 1990's, a challenge made more difficult by the fact that abortion remains illegal.
At the religious service held on a sports field in this cattle and mining center in the north, the Pope strongly repeated the church's stand against any form of birth control.
''If the possibility of conceiving a child is artifically eliminated in the conjugal act, couples shut themselves off from God and oppose his will,'' John Paul said. He continued:
''Society is more sensitive every day to the rights of the child, Nevertheless, the child is still exposed to no small list of maladies,'' including, he said, ''the egoism of a part of society that makes attempts on his life even before birth through the practice of abortion.''

HEADLINE: Court Is Urged To Rehear Case On Ritual Drugs

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
An unusually diverse coalition of religious groups and constitutional scholars asked the Supreme Court today to reconsider a recent decision permitting states to take legal action against people who use illegal drugs as part of religious rituals.
The petition requesting the rehearing told the Justices that ''every religious group in the country will be profoundly disadvantaged'' by the ''far-reaching holding'' issued last month. The request was made on behalf of two members of an American Indian church in which the ceremonial use of the hallucinogenic cactus peyote has been an important sacrament for centuries.
The 5-to-4 opinion in Employment Division v. Smith, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, rejected the Indians' argument that their use of peyote was protected by the First Amendment's guarantee of the free exercise of religion. 
The opinion said the guarantee did not generally exempt a person from complying with a valid law, even if the law conflicted with a religious belief.
 
Often Asked, Rarely Granted
Requests for rehearings are filed frequently by the losing side, but the Supreme Court rarely grants them. Not since the early 1960's have the Justices agreed to reconsider a case.
Oliver S. Thomas, general counsel of the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, one of the groups supporting the effort, said at a news conference today that there was only an outside chance that the Court would grant the request. ''But it's our only shot, so we take it,'' he said.
Mr. Thomas and several other lawyers said the coalition hoped at least to make both the public and the Court aware of the dismay that the opinion had provoked.
Among the 15 other organizations participating were the American Jewish Congress, the National Council of Churches, the National Association of Evangelicals, the American Friends Service Committee and the General Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists. Public interest groups not affiliated with religious denominations also joined the effort, including the American Civil Liberties Union and People for the American Way on the liberal side, and the Rutherford Institute on the conservative side.
 
Diverse Groups All Agree
''I seriously doubt that these groups have ever been in the same room together,'' Mr. Thomas said, adding that they all agreed that the opinion was ''disastrous for the free exercise of religion.''
Among the 55 constitutional scholars who signed the petition were Gerald Gunther of Stanford Law School, Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard Law School, Norman Redlich of New York University Law School, Sanford Levinson and Douglas Laycook of the University of Texas Law School, Kent Greenawalt of Columbia Law School and Michael W. McConnell of the University of Chicago Law School.
The focus of the coalition's concern was not so much the outcome of the case as the Court's analysis. Justice Scalia's opinion rejected the principle, included in several of the Court's earlier decisions on the subject, that a governmental action that places a burden on religious observance is unconstitutional unless it serves a ''compelling state interest.''
Both sides in the case had assumed that the ''compelling state interest'' analysis would govern the outcome. Oregon had denied unemployment benefits to the two plaintiffs because they had been dismissed from their jobs for using peyote. The state argued that its interest in enforcing narcotics laws uniformly was ''compelling.'' The Indians argued that it was not.
 
Matter for Politics, Not Courts
But Justice Scalia said the Court's precedents applying compelling state interest ''have nothing to do with an across-the-board criminal prohibition on a particular form of conduct.'' He said American society would be ''courting anarchy'' if the Court endorsed the approach of granting ''constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind.''
Noting that the Federal Government and many state legislatures had already exempted sacramental peyote from their narcotics laws, Justice Scalia said ''the political process,'' not the courts, should make such choices.
In the petition asking for a rehearing, the coalition warned that such an analysis would permit the Government to ban as non-humane the ritual slaughter required under Jewish law to make meat kosher, the circumcisions practiced by Jews and Moslems, or the use of wine in the Roman Catholic Mass.
The petition, prepared by lawyers for Oregon Legal Services and the American Jewish Congress, told the Court that rehearing was necessary because none of the briefs in the peyote case had even considered the prospect that the compelling state interest test would not be applied.
 
Rehearing Requires a Majority
Under the Court's rules, a majority must agree for a case to be reheard.
Justice Scalia's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens and Anthony M. Kennedy.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor cast a sixth vote in support of the state's position, saying that Oregon had ''a compelling interest in regulating peyote use by its citizens.'' But she refused to join Justice Scalia's opinion, labeling it ''incompatible with our nation's fundamental commitment to individual religious liberty.''
Even if Justice O'Connor supported a rehearing request, however, it would still need the support of at least one of the Justices in the majority.
The Court is likely to act on the request in the next several weeks.
The last case the Court reconsidered was Flora v. U.S., which held that Federal district courts could not hear certain tax refund suits. After the rehearing in 1960, the Court reaffirmed its initial decision, issued in 1958.
But in 1957, a reargument changed the outcome of a case. The Court ruled after rehearing Reid v. Covert that the military does not have court-martial jurisdiction over civilians in peacetime. The initial decision, in 1956, had gone the other way.

Dean Kelley of the National Council of Churches. (Paul Hosefros/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Overboard on Ozone

 BODY:
Every President needs a Darth Vader in the White House to thwart special pleaders and scrutinize even apple-pie issues. President Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, and Budget Director, Richard Darman, have played this role zestfully in curbing what they see as excessive solicitude for the environment. But in their latest foray, an assault on the international effort to protect the ozone layer, they have simply abandoned all sense of proportion and judgment. 
The U.S. persuaded the world to reach agreement on phasing out production of CFC's, a class of industrial chemicals that destroy the life-protecting layer of ozone in the upper atmosphere. Many developing countries that signed the Montreal protocol of 1987 asked for help in converting to the more costly substitutes, and Washington agreed in principle to provide it.
An international group in Geneva has been working out the details, and proposed setting up a fund to which the U.S. would contribute around $20 million a year. The State Department and Environmental Protection Agency urged the Administration to support the proposal. But Mr. Darman and Mr. Sununu have now instructed that it be opposed.
This is not an intelligent decision, for the following reasons: There is only one ozone layer, and there are a lot of people in India and China. It's in America's own interest for these and other developing economies to abandon CFC's as soon as possible. If the price tag is only $20 million, it's a bargain, particularly as the Treasury is reaping windfall profit taxes of $5 billion from the CFC industry as it phases down. The considerable damage already done to the ozone layer has been caused by CFC's manufactured in the United States. It's not too much to ask that Americans help less-developed countries avoid the same error. Every speaker from other countries at the Geneva conference expressed dismay at the U.S. stand. It's glorious to stand alone against the world when one is right, less so to cling to a position that puts the U.S. in the doghouse of world opinion.
Mr. Sununu and Mr. Darman are said to fear that modest help on CFC's now would lead to greater demands later if the world agrees to take action against the gases of global warming. But that's an issue for the future, to be dealt with on its merits. The threat to the ozone layer, and all living things on the planet, is present and real.
A Secretary of the Interior in the Reagan Administration once suggested that the way to solve the ozone problem was to continue producing CFC's but let people buy sunglasses and sunscreen lotion to protect against the bath of ultraviolet rays. Mr. Bush risks gaining a reputation for equal profundity unless he quickly instructs Messrs. Darman and Sununu to quit trifling with serious issues.

HEADLINE: Albania Reforms, Sort Of

 BODY:
A crack is opening in the fastness of Albania, Europe's last bastion of Communist absolutism. New laws will permit Albanians to travel abroad and to worship deities other than Marx, Stalin and Enver Hoxha, Albania's tyrant from 1944 until his death five years ago. The laws were adopted unanimously, as is always the case in the People's Assembly, and just in time to provide copy for visiting Soviet and American journalists. 
These laws may be only window-dressing to impress Western Europe, whose trade Albania covets. But when an oppressed people scents the possibility of change, rusting shackles can swiftly become intolerable. Albanians are aware of the upheaval in Eastern Europe, thanks to the Voice of America, the BBC and broadcasts from Italy, Greece and Yugoslavia. Even the controlled press has recounted the violent demise of Romania's kindred autocracy.
Meanwhile, the arrogance of the Hoxha era has yielded to nervous placatory gestures. President Ramiz Alia has permitted indirect but unmistakable criticism of the security police, the brutal Sigurimi. He met briefly last November with a leader of the Albanian Orthodox Church based in America, the first such contact of its kind. And Mr. Alia also sought out today's unprecedented visit by the U.N. Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar. All this responds to a growing restiveness that in turn owes something to Communism's one real accomplishment - a jump in Albania's literacy rate from 15 percent to 75 percent. Younger Albanians are palpably weary of stale slogans, desolate public squares and an ox-cart economy. They have begun to question why they are forbidden all forms of religious worship, ownership of automobiles and the right to travel. Hence the tentative concessions, the fiddling with penal laws and the overtures to the once-despised West.
Like their comrades elsewhere, Tirana's rulers face an exquisite dilemma. They talk grandly of ''continuation with more realism.'' But each move away from dogma and isolation erodes party authority. And without fundamental reforms Albania, Europe's poorest country, will become poorer still. No walls can prevent Albanians from learning that their statues of Stalin so visible everywhere are planted on sand.

HEADLINE: Computers and Other Targets: II;
A Lesson From Japan: Experiment

 BODY:
Japan may have stumbled in its highly publicized effort to produce a Fifth Generation computer that can talk to people, but its Government-fostered computer industry puts U.S. companies under ever-greater pressure. Japan is now mounting a challenge to U.S. supremacy in a promising technology, massive parallel processing.
It scares Americans when Japan targets American industries; Japan's computer triumphs have brought new pressure for America to target American industries. Does funneling Federal assistance into commercial technology make sense? 
On one side of the debate, experts urge emulating Japanese Government-business cooperation. The other side resists any governmental intervention in commercial markets as a matter of principle. The polarized passions obscure a middle ground, ripe for debate: Government-encouraged experiments, carefully contained.
Japan's patient 35-year program of promoting its computer industry has conjured up frightening images of a shrunken U.S. industry, with thousands of unemployed engineers and technicians. The reality is much less fearful. For one thing, Japanese targeting efforts like the Fifth Generation Project have no special record of success. For another, there is no certainty that Japanese investments in parallel processing will be more fruitful than those of U.S. corporations.
Even if Japan should commercialize parallel processing first, the U.S. would suffer no economic calamity. American industry would purchase Japanese computers and use them to boost productivity. Living standards here will rise, even if more slowly than in Japan. That said, the question remains: Can't the U.S. do even better by subsidizing research and commercial development?
No, many economists would say. Subsidies, especially in the U.S., can do more harm than good. From industrial planning in the 30's to synfuels in the 70's, Congress has often rewarded the politically powerful, not the economically promising. To economists, no industry is inherently better than another. Computer chips may sound magical, exotic. But a country is just as well off importing its D-RAM's and semiconductors and exporting wheat as the other way around. Without government intervention, countries will produce what they do best. The Saudis pump oil, the U.S. grows wheat, and then the two countries trade.
The case for targeting recognizes that technological discovery is far different from oil derricks and wheat fields. Neither Japan nor the U.S. has a natural advantage when it comes to potential breakthroughs like parallel processing. Victory must be won with ambitious research. But individual businesses might be unwilling to do pioneering research on their own, especially when they might earn only a fraction of the ultimate profits.
That argues for a middle course: Use Government funds to stimulate careful experimentation, within strict limits. The Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency has long fostered such experimentation. The Bush Administration's current hostility to Defense's agency is all the more reason to create a civilian body to subsidize research on promising commercial technologies. But three safeguards would be needed to head off a political boondoggle:
Keep It Small: The rich United States can afford mistakes. A program of, say, $4 billion a year would be peanuts in a $6 trillion economy. If the whole $4 billion is wasted, no one will notice. But if the program turns up an occasional winner, the gains could be immense.
Keep It Small: The Government input for any one project should also be limited, with the private corporations coughing up most of the capital. Companies unwilling to risk their own money should not be allowed to risk the taxpayers'.
Keep It Small: Under no circumstance should Congress evade the experimental purposes here by erecting trade barriers to shelter the targeted industry. Foreign competition is consumers' best protection against artificially created cartels.
The key is to experiment.

HEADLINE: Law School Standards: the Old and the New

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The debate about hiring more minority and women faculty members at Harvard Law School (news articles, April 24 and 26) - and my own Columbia - should not be seen as a struggle between excellence and diversity. Instead, the discussion should focus on what excellence should mean within the context of a law school and its development of a faculty, curriculum and student body.
Do the high standards for new faculty at a Harvard or Columbia require a clerkship with a United States Supreme Court justice, a stint at Cravath, Swaine & Moore or an article published in a prestigious law journal? If so, it's no wonder the ''excellent'' law schools complain that so few women and minority candidates meet their standards. Or is there something else to this idea of excellence at an academic legal institution? I suggest that a law school must actively seek diversity and a different concept of high standards if it is to attain or maintain excellence. 
In its own bulletin, Columbia Law School notes that it has a ''special responsibility'' to provide a program that will enable students to ''use their talent and training for the improvement of society and to create for themselves professional careers that will bring them joy and satisfaction.'' And it suggests that law professors have a unique opportunity to ''lead the way to improving the law in service of social needs.''
I am quite unclear about how Columbia's faculty - with only one tenured black professor and one black associate professor - can begin to ''lead the way to improving the law in service of social needs'' for the community surrounding Columbia -Morningside Heights, or Harlem, if you will - or even for the broader community of this country. I am, however, a little more clear about how a faculty that meets the current standards of excellence can serve to ''improve society'' from the perspective of economically comfortable white people.
If the country's law schools see themselves as having a positive role in the discourse of social change or in simply supporting the discussion, they have no choice but to develop a faculty that has voices from many cultures and experiences. A law school committed to excellence in its task of training future lawyers must recognize that its current use of standards only impedes its ability to serve the broad community reached by the law. These schools must bring in more women's voices, more African-American voices, Latino voices and Asian voices - or their rhetoric of excellence speaks only to a culture of comfort and exclusivity.

HEADLINE: Law School Standards: the Old and the New;
'A Superb Scholar'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your April 24 news article about Prof. Derrick Bell's protest over the absence of a black woman on Harvard's law faculty focused on the risk that university hiring decisions made under the pressure of protest might be based on nonmeritocratic criteria. Your subsequent article (April 26) focused on Prof. Regina Austin, a black woman who is a visiting scholar at Harvard Law this year.
We do not intend to comment on the question of university responses to protests or to encourage Harvard Law to hire Professor Austin; but readers should not be left with the impression that the school would depart from its usual standards of quality in considering Professor Austin.
Professor Austin is a superb scholar who writes principally about the law of compensation for injury to persons and property. Her recent scholarship places her in the forefront of an important school of legal thought. It draws from her experience - as a black woman who knows subordination - to illuminate the impact of law on all individuals. 
In considering the role of law in regulating an employer's right to control the workplace and the rights of workers to be free from employer abuse, Professor Austin weighs the impact of the exercise of employer authority on black women - workers who are disproportionately employed as domestics or in other low-wage jobs. She has been equally concerned about the impact of employer harassment on workers generally.
Professor Austin's work is infused with social facts relevant to the legal issues so that the impact of law can be viewed in relation to those facts rather than in a vacuum. Consideration of social, economic or other facts is a well-established tradition in the intellectual history of the law. A student's comment that Professor Austin teaches ''more sociology than law'' must be considered not only in light of beginning law students' lack of sophistication about competing philosophies of law, but also in light of the lingering discomfort of many students about the presence of women and minority members on law school faculties.
Recent studies conclude that university classroom discussion tends to be dominated by students who are members of the groups most privileged by law and society. All too often the views and concerns of women students and students who are members of minority groups are given short shrift or left out of classroom debate entirely. This phenomenon was a subject of consideration at a recent conference sponsored by the Association of American Law Schools and both the Commission on Women in the Profession and the Section on Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar of the American Bar Association.
Comments that Professor Austin failed to call on white male students in a particular class or classes must be evaluated in light of recognized patterns of classroom domination. All professors have a responsibility to equalize and enrich classroom debates by allowing for and facilitating the expression of a diversity of viewpoints. Those who shoulder this responsibility face the difficulties of addressing the conditioned inhibitions of students from subordinated groups and the understandable resentment of those white male students who are discomforted by the loss of privileged status.
The female voice is a relatively new one in law school communities: the voices of women of color are virtually absent from most. In this environment, readers should view with skepticism the suggestion that Professor Austin has engaged in reverse discrimination to over-privilege students from disadvantaged racial and gender groups whose identity she shares.

HEADLINE: Liberian Bloodshed, U.S. Diplomacy

BYLINE: By J. Brian Atwood; J. Brian Atwood is president of the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, which is affiliated with the Democratic Party.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A war is being fought in Liberia, which has close ties with the U.S., and very few in Washington have taken notice.
Active diplomacy is urgently needed, not only to prevent further bloodshed but to preserve prospects for a democratic political solution.
The war has its origins in corruption, human rights abuses and ethnic tensions exacerbated by the Government of the President, Gen. Samuel K. Doe. 
These problems were particularly acute in Nimba County, a large area bordering the Ivory Coast and Guinea. Abuses of the local population by President Doe's military turned the county into fertile ground for an insurgency.
The leader of the insurgents, Charles Taylor, is a former high official in the Doe Government who fled the country after having been accused of embezzlement. His supporters say he is fighting for democracy, but Liberian democrats are skeptical. It is unlikely, they say, that he possesses either the commitment to democracy or the political leadership necessary to bring about a democratic transition on his own.
The best hope for a peaceful reconciliation would be a negotiated settlement and an agreement to hold elections to determine the nation's new leadership. There is little time. Mr. Taylor's forces are closing in on Monrovia, the capital. Only the U.S. has the influence and leverage needed to achieve a cease-fire and begin negotiations.
In the minds of many Liberians U.S. policy has placed us too close to President Doe. This is the case even though the U.S. has cut back economic and military assistance from a high of $80 million in 1985 to about $10 million last year.
This was done in large part at the insistence of Congress, which required the executive branch to certify that Liberia was making ''significant progress'' in political and economic reform. Even the most creative diplomats and lawyers could find no progress.
The leaders of various political parties and civic groups in Liberia are impressive. Many are living in exile but are prepared to return when they can do so safely. They had looked forward to elections scheduled for November 1991 as an opportunity to topple the Government at the polls. But now it doesn't look as though it will survive until then.
The election in 1985 was widely believed to be fraudulent. Large piles of ballots were seen burning and a significant defeat for President Doe turned out to be a narrow victory after a delayed and manipulated vote count.
The U.S. Government contributed to the legitimization of the result when a statement by Secretary of State George Shultz seemed to endorse the process.
In 1985, the international community did not pay much attention to Liberia. Had international observers been present, the outcome might have been different.
The experience of U.N. observers in Namibia and Nicaragua and large numbers of official and unofficial observers monitoring elections around the globe gives Liberia's democrats more confidence that the 1991 election will reflect the will of the Liberian people.
On May 8, a delegation sent by the Liberian Government was in Washington to seek advice in setting up an electoral system that would inspire confidence. The group said President Doe would welcome international observers of the election. The delegation has much to overcome in convincing fellow Liberians of President Doe's sincerity, but they have made an important beginning.
What is now needed is for all the important actors to negotiate a transition to democratic rule via a free and fair election, roundtable-style and with no conditions.
Such an outcome would establish a moral and political basis for ending the civil war and beginning the reconciliation process.

The Big-Gov Right

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Hear that rumbling, grinding, groaning sound? It's the noise of the tectonic plates of the political right, building up ineluctable pressure along the San Darman Fault.
Inflation's rising interest rates, combined with the creeping realization of the cost of the S & L bailout, have made ridiculous recent Bush estimates of the budget deficit.
As a result, the blessed discipline of Gramm-Rudman has imposed a choice on the President and Congress: Accept automatic reductions in spending across the board, make your own cuts or raise taxes.
Raising taxes will cause less voter hollering, incumbents have decided, and so we can expect this package:
The ''bubble'' at the high end of income tax rates will be pricked, raising rates to 33 percent; this will generate enough soak-the-rich satisfaction to permit passage of the capital gains tax cut, a reduction that promises to produce higher revenues the first year. 
But that's only about $7 billion; as much again can be raised from booze (a buck per six-pack of beer, a quarter per bottle of wine), and $5 billion more from a quarter-a-pack whack at cigarettes. Bank depositors should ante up for their costly Federal insurance.
Then comes the big bite: energy taxes. The smart way would be an oil import fee, driving down oil prices and inflation, diminishing OPEC power, pressuring Soviet economic reform and reducing the S & L bailout cost by raising Southwest real estate values.
The easier way is a gasoline tax, warming global hearts by raising the cost of driving and pleasing plutocrats with its regressiveness.
We have just raised $40 billion a year in no-new-taxes. Add a spending cut, mainly from defense, plus a last-minute rejiggering of projections, and presto! Responsibility rampant; le grand compromis historique; coalition government at last.
A motley assortment of irresponsible skinflints, gallus-snapping reactionaries, old neo-cons and new neo-Neanderthals - joined by a few nutty lefties hung up on progressive taxation - will serve as a chorus of muttering naysayers.
Why do I find my views in alignment with the anti-tax demagoguery of these selfish dregs of populist resentment?
A large and growing deficit in prosperous times is a great mistake, leaving no margin of fiscal stimulus in a coming recession. The way to reduce the deficit is to curb the increases in Federal spending, not to raise taxes sure to be used for even more Federal spending.
This position, baldly stated, was not so long ago the will of the people; the taxation barrier was our enforcement weapon. Now a hold-the-line stance against the centralization always in taxation's wake is derided as out of touch, with none so irresponsible to do it reverence.
Wherefore the sudden new consensus of our body politic? Why must the majority accept officialdom's reversion to tax-and-spend medicine -now sugar-coated by the conservative reasoning of fiscal responsibility rather than the liberal rhetoric of human compassion?
Those questions bring us to our groaning tectonic blue-plate special: The conservative majority of the past 20 years is breaking up.
De-cemented by the collapse of Communism; riven by the inclination of Mr. Bush to split the difference with ideological opponents, and strike-slipped by the libertarian-vs.-traditionalist tension of the abortion issue, the serious right wing is shifting its center of gravitas.
The emerging political philosophy is not to be dismissed as moderate Republican me-tooism reborn nor as the easy pragmatism that places process before principle. On the contrary, we may be seeing the unplanned and inarticulate rise of the Big-Government Right.
We thought the Bush philosophy to be: Federal Government has ''a role to play'' in setting education goals, encouraging competitiveness, incentivizing health and child care - but decisions to carry out policy, backed up by decisions to tax and to hold officials accountable, would mostly be local, not national.
But as Mr. Bush's fort - his no-tax pledge - is breached, political control inexorably follows tax revenues toward Washington, where coercion lives under the aliases of ''mandating,'' ''industrial policy'' and ''national standards.''
Maybe a good case can be made for the administrative efficiency of Big-Gov Right. Why are Mr. Bush and his Budget Director reluctant to make it?

HEADLINE: Judge Critical Of Dinkins Over Boycott

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
A Brooklyn judge issued an order yesterday barring demonstrators from picketing within 50 feet of two Korean-American food stores. In doing so, he criticized Mayor David N. Dinkins, expressing regret that the Mayor had not intervened personally to help end the four-month-old boycott that began over a dispute with a black customer.
Mr. Dinkins, under continuing pressure in what some supporters and critics alike say is a test of his powers of conciliation, said he had intervened, by sending top aides to mediate and trying to telephone a lawyer for the protesters.
Moreover, the Mayor said, he would make ''a major, major comment about race relations, tensions in the city and whatnot.'' His aides said later that the Mayor's comments - prompted by the boycott, tension over the Bensonhurst racial murder trial and other disturbing incidents - would come in a speech at 7:30 tonight at City Hall. 
 
Pickets Reject Mediation
''I want to try to put things in perspective,'' Mr. Dinkins said. ''I don't mean to say that I am unconcerned, that things are all rosy in our town. They never have been.''
Justice Gerald S. Held of State Supreme Court made his decision to restrict picketing at the store after two black groups sponsoring the demonstrations rejected his request that city mediators be brought in. The dispute was touched off on Jan. 18 when a black customer complained of being beaten by Korean employees at the Red Apple grocery at 1823 Church Avenue in the Flatbush section.
Demonstrators heeded the judge's order yesterday. Chanting ''Korean merchants must go,'' about three-dozen pickets remained behind police barriers 50 feet from the stores until about 10 P.M. and then left.
In his order, Justice Held praised the city's Human Rights Commission for offering to mediate. But he said he ''regrets the failure of the Mayor of the City of New York to personally intervene and use the prestige of his office and his high standing in the community to convince the parties to bring a suitable end to this dispute.'' Asked for his reaction, Mr. Dinkins said: ''One, I'm pleased that the judge feels that I have a high standing in the community. That's nice. Two, to personally intervene, without knowing what his definition of personal intervention is, let me hasten to say that I have personally intervened.
''I note in that same order,'' Mr. Dinkins added, ''he praises my commissioner, Dennis deLeon,'' chairman of the Human Rights Commission, ''while deploring or condemning or expressing regret - or whatever the appropriate language is - that I have not been there. I wonder who he thinks sent Dennis deLeon.''
The Mayor said, ''If the time comes when it appears that would be helpful, I'm certainly happy to go.'' Mr. Dinkins also took a jab at Justice Held, recalling that the judge once ordered about 400 patients evicted from a Brooklyn nursing home whose owner had been convicted of Medicaid fraud. The eviction order was later overturned.
''He's free to criticize me, of course,'' Mr. Dinkins said. ''Let me say that I did not criticize his judgment with respect to the Cobble Hill situation, when those persons, the seniors, would have been put out had he not been reversed.''
At the same time, Mr. Dinkins said, he was seeking a meeting with Stephen G. James, a lawyer for the protesters. Mr. James met with Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch yesterday but had said that he wanted to talk to the Mayor directly.
Mr. Dinkins also seemed to suggest for the first time that he believed the boycott might be motivated, at least in part, by racial animosity.
 
Race and Economics
''I should say that the persons who oppose the Korean merchants are certainly not monolithic,'' he said. ''There are different agendas. I would suspect that some of it may be racially motivated. Some may be motivated by economic considerations.''
Justice Held's order, which restricts the picketing until he conducts a trial of the dispute, was issued as lawyers for the merchants and the demonstrators continued their legal wrangling.
The judge said in the five-page order that the Police Department is ''authorized and directed by this court to enforce the provisions of this order.''
Mr. James said he would appeal the judge's order as quickly as possible. He said it infringed on First Amendment rights to protest ''systematic disrespect'' that blacks encountered in the two stores. The black boycott seeks to drive the two owners out of the community because of their behavior, he added, but Koreans in general ''are welcome in this area.''
A lawyer for the store owners, Richard A. Izzo, called the judge's decision proper, but said the owners would prefer to have the demonstrators negotiate. He said ''professional instigators'' organized the picketing to ''foment racial strife.''
Justice Held's decision involved a procedural issue of whether legal papers had been properly served on the demonstrators in front of the Red Apple grocery and another store across the street.

HEADLINE: Cost of Budget Delay Is Placed at $18 Million

 BODY:
New York State's delay in adopting a budget will cost New York City taxpayers about $18 million, City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman said yesterday.
''It is a tragic waste of money that did not have to happen if the state had gotten its budget act together,'' she said. 
Because the state has been without a budget since April 1, it has been unable to make scheduled aid payments to the city, causing a cash-flow problem.
Ms. Holtzman offered the $18 million estimate after the city sold $900 million in revenue anticipation notes at an interest rate of 6.34 percent. The notes, which will be due June 29, will cost the city about $7 million in interest.
The city has also had to postpone contributions to employee pension funds. Ms. Holtzman said it is obligated to reimburse the funds for the interest they are losing - about $5.3 million.
The remaining $5.7 million of the $18 million, she said, represents interest lost because the city cannot invest aid payments it has not received.

HEADLINE: 2 MEN ARE INDICTED IN MEXICO DUMPING

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 10

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles today announced indictments of two men on charges of dumping toxic waste in Mexico in the first instance in which the United States has pursued prosecution of an environmental crime across its southern border.
The indictments, a result of a cooperative investigation between Mexico's environmental agency and the United States Justice Department, provided a counterpoint to recent angry exchanges between the two countries over efforts to halt the narcotics trade.
''This type of cooperation is essential in cases such as this one,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement issued here. ''The environment knows no national boundaries.'' 
The two men, Raymond Franco and David Torres, were charged with taking 34 drums of toxic waste across the Mexican border and dumping them in Tijuana, just across the border from San Diego. Prosecutors said the barrels contained several chemicals used as paint thinners and cleaning solvents: toluene, xylene, methyl ethyl ketone, acetone ethyl benzene and 1,1,1,trichloroethane.
The officials said they had not identified any companies in the United States that had delivered toxic wastes to Mr. Franco knowing that it would be disposed of illegally. #32-Year Penalty Possible The men were charged with violations of the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the law regulating the handling and disposal of hazardous waste. If convicted, they could be sentenced to as many as 32 years in prison.
While officials did not offer an estimate of the amount of toxic material that they believe is illegally shipped to Mexico, they said it is large because of the difficulty and the cost of disposing of toxic waste legally in the United States. Companies pay as much as $1,000 a barrel to dispose of toxic wastes legally, said William Carter, the Deputy District Attorney of Los Angeles County. Mr. Carter said companies were generally charged $500 a barrel for illegal disposal of toxic waste.
Law enforcement officials said toxic waste was often shipped as part of loads of legal products, much of it over routes that are for all practical purposes uncontrolled.
''We suspect a large quantity is going through Texas and down into Mexico that way,'' said Ed Gomez, chief of the Southern Division of the California Highway Patrol.
 
Barrels Hidden Under Scrap
Prosecutors said the two men indicted today had worked together to transport the barrels of toxic waste hidden among loads of scrap materials that are legally disposed of across the border.
Ira Reiner, the Los Angeles District Attorney, said Mr. Franco, who was arrested Wednesday in New York City, ran a business called Ray's Industrial Waste in El Toro, south of Los Angeles. He said Mr. Torres, who has not been arrested, had been involved in the transportation of salvage products between the United States and Mexico.
The officials said that Mr. Franco was an American citizen and that Mr. Torres was a Mexican citizen with homes in Mexico and Orange County.
Federal officials in Los Angeles also announced today that they were creating an interagency task force to fight the movement of toxic waste from the United States to Mexico, characterizing the activity as an international crime with high economic incentives, comparable to the trade in narcotics. The agencies involved are the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Transportation Department, the California Highway Patrol and the California Department of Health Services.

New Look at an 'Obscure' Ruling, 20 Years Later

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Few people would recognize a 20-year-old Supreme Court decision called Goldberg v. Kelly, let alone accord it a place in the pantheon of the Court's major rulings.
But the decision has nonetheless touched the lives of millions of people. Written by Justice William J. Brennan Jr., Goldberg v. Kelly held that welfare recipients are constitutionally entitled to a hearing before their benefits can be terminated. The ruling transformed the administration of government benefits programs across the country and gave the concept of constitutional due process a broader interpretation than it had ever received.
Even in its obscurity, Goldberg v. Kelly remains a landmark. That was the message of a 20th-anniversary celebration last week that drew several hundred lawyers and law professors to Brooklyn Law School for a day of reflection on the origins and legacy of the case and, more generally, on the course of constitutional law. 
The program also served as a reminder that it is not only the most famous Supreme Court decisions - the Brown v. Board of Educations and the Roe v. Wades - that make a difference.
 
How the Case Got Its Start
The conference participants came from as far away as California and from as close at hand as the neighborhood legal services offices and local welfare bureaucracy where Goldberg v. Kelly, a New York case, got its start.
No one was sure of the whereabouts of John Kelly, the disabled welfare recipient who became the lead plaintiff after his grant was cut off without notice when he moved out of the welfare hotel to which his caseworker had assigned him.
Jack Goldberg, whom a group of welfare recipients had sued in his capacity as New York City's Social Services Commissioner, died in 1974.
But Cesar A. Perales, Social Services Commissioner of New York State for the last eight years, was there. Twenty years ago he was a legal services lawyer representing welfare recipients. Now he runs a state welfare system that because of Goldberg v. Kelly holds 800 hearings every working day.
 
Welfare Recipients Prevail
Mr. Perales said welfare recipients prevailed in those hearings 80 percent of the time, persuading the hearing officers to overturn caseworkers' decisions that cut off benefits.
In New York State, Mr. Perales said, ''the constitutional concept of due process is made real more than 75,000 times each year.'' He added: ''Perhaps the most dramatic proof of the institutional saturation of Goldberg precepts is that its protections, once considered radical, are now taken for granted.''
Prof. Sylvia A. Law of New York University Law School recalled that as a new lawyer and ardent rock music fan in the summer of 1969, she gave up a chance to attend the Woodstock music festival in upstate New York to work on the welfare plaintiffs' Supreme Court brief.
She has never regretted her choice, Professor Law said. Goldberg v. Kelly has endured, she said, ''because it's for all of us, for anyone who has a driver's license, a taxi medallion, a license to practice law,'' or any other government benefit that now cannot be arbitrarily withdrawn.
Justice Brennan himself regards the 5-to-3 decision as one of his major achievements. In a 1987 speech to the New York City Bar Association, he spoke at length about the decision as one that ''opened a dialogue that continues to this day about the responsibilities of the bureaucratic state to its citizens.''
 
Putting Passion Into the System
In that speech Justice Brennan said that ''if due-process values are to be preserved in the bureaucratic state of the late 20th century, it may be essential that officials possess passion -the passion that puts them in touch with the dreams and disappointments of those with whom they deal.''
He added, ''Goldberg can be seen as injecting passion into a system whose abstract rationality had led it astray.''
While everyone who spoke at the conference agreed that the ruling was important, not all regarded it as correct.
Richard A. Epstein, a law professor from the University of Chicago, said that while the ruling was one of Justice Brennan's ''most powerful and artistic opinions,'' the holding was probably wrong, a misguided effort by the Federal judiciary to ''micromanage'' decisions best left to the political system.
And while the occasion was an anniversary celebration, the tone was more nostalgic and rueful than celebratory. Many participants spoke of Goldberg v. Kelly as a high-water mark not only of their own careers as young lawyers, but also of a bygone era in Supreme Court history.
 
A Summation, Not a Beginning
The decision was handed down on March 23, 1970, nine months after Warren E. Burger had replaced Earl Warren as Chief Justice. But in its spirit and method, Goldberg v. Kelly was the embodiment of the Warren Court, said Prof. Owen M. Fiss of Yale Law School. Chief Justice Burger dissented from the opinion, as did Justices Hugo L. Black and Potter Stewart.
Professor Fiss, a former law clerk to Justice Brennan and a self-described ''refugee from the 60's,'' said the decision came ''at an unusual historic moment, the end of one era and the beginning of another.'' Although many hoped that the ruling would prove to be the opening gun in a wide-ranging ''due-process revolution,'' he said, it proved instead to be ''not a new beginning, but a summation.''
The decision is not in danger of being overturned by the current Supreme Court, but neither is it likely to be cited as the basis for future rulings.
Professor Fiss said: ''Goldberg v. Kelly was handed down as American culture turned inward and we began to lose faith in the very idea of a public morality. We no longer believed that the Constitution or any other public law was an embodiment of a public morality to be known and elaborated through the exercise of reason.''
Prof. Minna J. Kotkin of Brooklyn Law School, who organized the conference, said the decision ''rests on a world view that seems almost quaintly, some might think naively, liberal in focus.'' She read to the audience a passage from Justice Brennan's opinion that was familiar to nearly everyone in the room.
 
'The Blessings of Liberty'
''From its founding, the nation's basic commitment has been to foster the dignity and well-being of all persons within its borders,'' Justice Brennan wrote. ''Public assistance, then, is not mere charity, but a means to 'promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.' '' Justice Brennan's quotation was from the preamble to the Constitution.
''When I read these words,'' Professor Kotkin said, ''I think how far we have come over the last 20 years from that view.''
But if many at the conference appeared resigned to thinking of Goldberg v. Kelly as a cherished period piece, one participant exhorted the audience to use it as the basis for a renewed call to arms.
He was Charles A. Reich, now a visiting law professor at the University of San Francisco who is well known as the author of ''The Greening of America.'' But to the group gathered last week, the 62-year-old professor is best known as the author of ''The New Property,'' an article in the Yale Law Journal in 1964 that outlined some of the basic concepts incorporated by Justice Brennan in his opinion.
 
An Aspect of 'Property'
A central thesis of Professor Reich's article was that welfare benefits are not government gratuities that can be taken away at will, but are an aspect of the ''property'' that the Constitution shields against arbitrary government action. The 14th Amendment provides, ''Nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.''
At the conference, Professor Reich said that just as Goldberg v. Kelly had extended the concept of ''property,'' the Constitution now should be interpreted to give enhanced meanings to ''person'' and ''life.''
''Not for a minute should we concede that existence in a cardboard box on a city sidewalk is 'life' in the constitutional sense,'' he added. ''Not for a moment should we allow that a person without heat or shelter during a freezing winter possesses 'life, liberty and property' in the constitutional sense.''
Professor Reich said the definition of ''person'' should include ''what is organically necessary to life, or inseparably a part of the person.''
 
An 'Affirmative Obligation'
The Constitution was written ''when it was sufficient to be left alone,'' he said. But in a complex modern economy in which ''the world is like an expensive hotel where even the smallest needs cost money,'' being left alone puts many people at risk, he said, adding:
''The negative constitutional guarantee of one era becomes the affirmative obligation of another era, not because the words of the Constitution have changed, but because the Constitution cannot be given its true meaning without affirmative action.''
It was a speech that left the middle-aged law professors cheering, as if they were 20 years younger and heading into another Woodstock summer. And their reaction left little doubt that they would choose to stay home and work on the brief.

This question was on the minds of many of the thousands of collectors, dealers and auctioneers who attended this week's sales of contemporary art - the results of which were disappointing - or who plan to be at the auctions next Tuesday through Saturday of Impressionist and modern art. These major sales have been organized by Christie's, Sotheby's and Habsburg, Feldman, a Geneva-based house.
The bullish expectations for a combined sales total of more than $1 billion for this 13-day series of major auctions was based on the upward spiral of art prices that characterized the 1980's. The combined presale estimate for the May marathon of auctions, which began on Monday and continues through May 19, is $933 million to $1.25 billion. The record total for such a series - $930 million -was reached last November in New York.
This week, the fireworks that have become commonplace in recent seasons were absent from sales of works by Roy Lichtenstein, Willem de Kooning and Francis Bacon. Christie's two-day auction on Monday and Tuesday brought a total of $71.7 million, which was within its expectations of $66.4 million to $94.8 million. Of the 500 offerings, 352 were sold. 
At Sotheby's, 342 works were sold of the 532 presented on Tuesday and Wednesday. That sale totaled $82.2 million, a figure well below the house expectations of $120.6 million to $156.9 million.
The art to be presented next week goes on view this weekend and includes masterpieces by Vincent van Gogh, Pierre Auguste Renoir, Wassily Kandinsky, Amedeo Modigliani, Edouard Manet and Marc Chagall. Both houses are offering properties from major collections assembled by Robert Lehman, a financier who was chairman of the Metropolitan Museum of Art at his death in 1969; John Hay Whitney, financier, publisher, sportsman and ambassador; Siegfried Kramarsky, a German-born New York banker and philanthropist; Lydia Winston Malbin, daughter of the industrial architect Albert Kahn, and Margaret Ryan, the widow of John Barry Ryan Jr., an heir to a New York fortune in tobacco, railroads and banking.
 
Van Gogh and Renoir
The two artworks generating the greatest advance interest carry the highest presale estimates - $40 million to $50 million each. Van Gogh's ''Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' is to be auctioned from the Kramarsky collection in the sale at Christie's at 7 P.M. on Tuesday; Renoir's ''Moulin de la Galette'' from 1876 is being sold by Mr. Whitney's widow, Betsey Cushing Whitney, at Sotheby's on Thursday at 7 P.M. The art historian John Rewald, an adviser to the Whitneys for 40 years and the curator of the collection, describes this cafe scene as ''possibly the finest work Renoir painted.''
A number of dealers interviewed said the finest works in these sales would probably bring the prices expected, or slightly less. Others may not find buyers if the prices are too high or the material not fresh.
Stephen Hahn, a New York dealer, said: ''The extraordinary things will probably sell quite well - but probably not on the upper level of what the auction houses expect.''
Diane Upright, director of the Jan Krugier gallery in Manhattan, said: ''What happened this week is very healthy. Strong prices were paid for strong works of art. But there was also a serious questioning of works of lesser value.''
Julian Agnew, a London dealer, agreed. ''There is going to be a flight to quality,'' he said. ''The things that are new to the market and are thought by the market to be exceptional will continue to do well.''
Mr. Agnew said he expects the buying to be more erratic in these sales because the number of buyers has declined by 20 to 30 percent. ''The gamble element is much more prominent when the market is weaker,'' he said.
 
Inflated Estimates Don't Work
Desmond Corcoran, a London dealer, said he applauded the week's resistance to ever higher prices, and was distressed at the increased number of artworks estimated to sell for $10 million or more. ''When the estimates are a bit too high they don't work,'' he said. ''There are a lot of beautiful pictures in these sales, and most of them are fresh to the market. Then you see on the bottom of the page all these prices that start with 10. I don't know whose fault it is, whether the owners are too greedy or whether they are encouraged by the auction houses.''
Jeffrey Deitch, a Manhattan dealer, said he was delighted with the art sales this week. ''I continue to be completely optimistic,'' he said. ''This whole speculation game had to slow down. It was a cloud hanging over the serious art market. I'm happy that we see a little bit of the speculative froth taken off, so the art market can return to what it was -dominated by informed and passionate buyers.''
Arnold Glimcher of the Pace Gallery on East 57th Street said he was ''anti-auction'' because the houses manipulate the art market. ''How can they manufacture prices for works of art they sell?'' he asked. ''They put estimates on works that are four and five times what they are sold for in galleries. It makes collectors feel they can't buy things except at these prices.''
 
Five From Lehman Collection
The first auction next week at Christie's offers 81 works estimated to sell for $248.5 million to $334.9 million. The sale will offer, in addition to van Gogh's portrait of Dr. Gachet, five works from the Lehman collection - a van Gogh self-portrait and four paintings of women by Modigliani, Toulouse-Lautrec, Renoir, and Kees van Dongen - valued in all at $40 million to $60 million. Mrs. Ryan's ''Bench'' (1881), by Manet, a sun-filled geranium-brightened garden, is estimated at $20 million to $25 million. Christie's will also auction a classic diamond painting from 1925 by Piet Mondrian, a crisp rendering in red, blue, yellow, black and white that is expected to bring $12 million to $16 million.
Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in New York, said he did not know whether the contemporary-art sales reflect problems in the American economy: ''Whether American buyers may be more strapped than foreign buyers, who will be more active in next week's sales.''
When asked whether the reserves on artworks - the prices below which they will not be sold - will be lowered in next week's sales, Mr. Burge said: ''We are trying to in some areas where it might be prudent. We are looking to see whether some things may have been overpriced.''
David J. Nash, who heads fine-art sales at Sotheby's, said that reviewing reserves goes on before every sale, and that this sale is no exception.
 
An Odoriferous Brancusi Egg
The value of the art in the evening sessions of these auctions is wide ranging, and one of the more unusual offerings at Sotheby's on Wednesday at 7 P.M. is a painted egg by Constantin Brancusi, which is estimated to sell for $6,000 to $8,000. According to Sotheby's catalogue, ''The Kiss,'' as the egg is called - its four images painted in silver and black depict the artist's 1908 sculpture of the same name - was completed ''certainly by 1952.'' The egg was presented as a gift to Mrs. Malbin that year by the previous owners. The egg, now cracked and odorous, stands in a small glass cup, covered by a glass dome to contain the smell.
The egg is one of the more humble in the Malbin collection of 93 Futurist and modern works in the sale. At the other end of the price scale in this collection, which is estimated to bring $56.5 million to $74.8 million, is Brancusi's ''Blond Negress,'' a golden-hued bronze from 1928 that is estimated to sell for $8 million to $10 million, and Leger's ''Woman in an Armchair,'' which is expected to sell for $10 million to $12 million.
Sotheby's is to be the setting for the sale of three noted paintings from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum -Kandinsky's ''Fugue,'' from 1914; Modigliani's ''Boy With a Blue Jacket,'' from 1918, and Chagall's ''Anniversaire,'' from 1923. The museum is selling these paintings, valued in all at $22 million to $31 million, to help finance its planned multimillion-dollar purchase of more than 200 Minimalist and other works from the collection of Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo.
Habsburg, Feldman is to auction 78 works on Monday at 7 P.M. at the Regency Hotel, Park Avenue at 61st Street. Among the works by Claude Monet, Renoir, van Dongen and Leger, with a total value of $35.4 million to $47.1 million, is van Dongen's oil on canvas ''The Dancers - Revel and Coco,'' from 1906, which is expected to sell for $2 million to $2.5 million.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Sale's Yields Defy Predictions

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The Treasury wrapped up its quarterly refunding auctions yesterday by selling $10 billion worth of 30-year bonds at yield levels well below what most credit market analysts had thought possible little more than a week ago.
Bids at the auction produced an average yield on the new bonds of 8.84 percent, up from 8.50 percent at the last bond sale on Feb. 8. Yesterday's yield was the highest on a new 30-year bond since the auction of May 11, 1989.
After reviewing the results, dealers said the auction was a success, but not a resounding one. Nevertheless, a week ago traders were expecting that yields of 9 percent or more would be needed to sell the securities. 
 
Effect of Employment Data
That view was abruptly altered by the release on May 4 of April employment data that were much weaker than anticipated. The figures, by indicating a lack of inflationary pressure in the economy, sparked a strong rally in Treasury prices last Friday. That development put market participants in a much more positive frame of mind as the refunding auctions began.
Just under $20 billion worth of bids were placed for the $10 billion in securities that were sold - about an average demand, dealers said. Demand at a bond auction is seen to be strong when the so-called ''coverage'' ratio is greater than 2 to 1.
Dealers said that bidding at the auction was helped by the dollar, which firmed yesterday against most major currencies after sliding sharply on Wednesday. The sudden weakness in the dollar helped drive up yields on the $10 billion worth of 10-year notes sold on Wednesday. [Page D13.] Bidding by the Japanese The dollar rose against the yen yesterday, but that was apparently not a factor for the Japanese, who placed bids on an estimated $2.5 billion worth of bonds, or about 25 percent of the issue. In the past, Japanese bids for more than 30 percent of a new Treasury bond auction were not uncommon.
Even though the base of potential investors is different, yesterday's sale also suffered in comparison with Tuesday's auction of three-year notes and Wednesday's sale of 10-year notes. Bids at those auctions reached record proportions. ''This one was not quite as strong as the other two auctions,'' said James A. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities.
Nevertheless, the issue traded well after the results of the 1 P.M. sale were announced at about 3:45 yesterday afternoon. In late trading, the bond was offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.81 percent.
''There was a lot of speculative interest in the securities, but legitimate investor interest from Asia in this issue was probably the lowest I have seen in the five years I have been here,'' said William M. Brachfeld, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
Since the start of the year, rising interest rates in Japan and Western Europe have acted as a powerful disincentive for big Japanese financial institutions to purchase dollar-denominated fixed-income securities.
 
Benefits for Secondary Market
The positive auction results and the firmer dollar had a salutary effect on prices in the secondary market for Treasury securities.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent bonds due 2020 were offered at a price of 96 15/32, up a quarter point, to yield 8.83 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered in late trading at 100 11/32, up 2/32, to yield 8.67 percent.
The securities that were auctioned earlier in the week also fared well.
In when-issued trading, the 8 5/8 percent three-year notes auctioned on Tuesday were offered at a price to yield 8.72 percent. And the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes sold on Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.81 percent. At the 10-year auction, the securities had an average yield of 8.88 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates eased slightly.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.69 percent, down 4 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by 5 basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.70 percent. And one-year bills were offered at 7.72 percent, down 4 basis points.
 
Producer Price Data Today
Although economists doubt there will be unpleasant surprises, the market's firm tone could be jolted by retail sales and producer price data to be released this morning.
To the market, the April producer price figures are likely to be the day's most important numbers. In advance of the release, most economists were projecting a modest rise of two-tenths of a percentage point for last month's producer prices. A significantly higher number would rekindle fears about inflation.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, dealers said that prices of most issues rose by about one-eighth point on fairly thin trading. Meanwhile, prices in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds posted healthy gains of between three-eighths and one-half point, traders said.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week ended April 30. The report had no impact on credit-market prices.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 30-year Treasury bonds:

HEADLINE: New Arena for Japanese Business: Space

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 10

 BODY:
After years of sitting on the sidelines of the space business, some of Japan's largest industrial and electronics companies are joining forces in the country's first commercial venture to launch private satellites into orbit, Government and industry executives say.
The move will place Japan's newest rocket, the H-II, into direct competition with Europe's Arianespace and commercial services in the United States, China and the Soviet Union.
Aerospace is one of the few high-tech areas where Japan has traditionally lagged behind other nations, and the move to enter the commercial space business seems certain to draw political fire from abroad. Only last month, the United States and Japan ended a trade dispute over the Japanese Government's role in developing communications satellites; the Government is also paying for the development of the H-II.
With the field so crowded, there are strong fears here that Japan may be too late and its rockets too expensive to pose a serious competitive threat - unless the Government or the companies act to reduce vastly the cost of a launching. 
The companies involved are among Japan's biggest and best known. They include NEC, Toshiba, Nissan, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Electric.
The 13-company consortium, which has yet to be formally announced, is led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and as many as 77 companies are eventually expected to share the risk in the effort, a Mitsubishi spokesman said. Mitsubishi is also building the H-II rocket, the first in the 20-year history of Japan's civilian space agency to be developed without a great deal of American technology.
The H-II is still under development, and the first launching is not scheduled until early 1993 - a year later than planned because of unexpected troubles with the rocket's liquid fuel engine. But the consortium appears to be positioning itself to begin launching services as soon as the rocket is successfully tested by the National Space Development Agency of Japan, which is known here as Nasda and plays a role similar to that of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the United States.
The Japanese space agency has welcomed the move as a way of decreasing the cost of the H-II by increasing the number of rockets that will be ordered from Mitsubishi.
 
Concerned About Demand
''It is certainly not too early to think about providing our rockets to international markets,'' Masato Yamano, the president of Nasda, said in an interview at his office here on Wednesday. But he cautioned, ''There are many nations already providing this kind of service, and I don't know if there is enough demand.''
Mr. Yamano estimated that it would cost more than $100 million to build and launch an H-II, making it significantly more expensive than the competition. But if the cost can be lowered, the most obvious potential users are some of Japan's own satellite and communications companies, which until now have been using France's Ariane service.
The new rocket initiative may have been bolstered earlier this year when an Ariane rocket exploded over the Atlantic just after launching, destroying two Japanese communications satellites.
''The hope is that in the future Japanese companies will choose to launch their satellites here,'' a Mitsubishi spokesman said this week.
The private space launching business blossomed after the loss of the space shuttle Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986. With the shuttle program grounded, there were fears that scores of payloads, mostly communications satellites, would have no way into orbit.
But several countries moved quickly. While other nations prepared to turn their rockets into commercial space vehicles, however, Japan held back, in part because its current H-I rocket is not powerful enough to carry large satellites.
 
'We Sat on Our Hands'
''It was very frustrating,'' a Japanese space scientist here said recently. ''Even China was launching satellites, while we sat on our hands.'' He was referring to China's successful launching last month of an American satellite, after President Bush decided to make an exception to current sanctions against that country.
Though most of Japan's past rockets have been the space equivalents of compact cars, the H-II will be the first to move up to mid-size. It is capable of launching a two-ton satellite into stationary orbit, or a 10-ton satellite into low earth orbit. But That is significantly smaller than the payload capacity of the Titan III or the Titan IV, two of the most powerful American rockets.
Under Japan's plan, the new company - to be formed in July - will buy the H-II from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the prime contractor. Initially, the company will sell those rockets to the space agency for the Government's own launchings. Using the company as a middle man, the Government can order several rockets at once, which in turn should reduce the cost of producing them. But the company will also begin offering the same rocket technology to private clients. Still, it is not clear how the Japanese consortium will be able to offer a competitive launching service without absorbing huge losses or receiving significant Government subsidies.
So far, no such subsidies appear to be in the offing. ''Direct subsidies would be very, very difficult under the current political situtation,'' said Maskazu Yoshida, the deputy director of the space division of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
Other countries subsidize their rocket programs. Indeed, many of the rockets themselves, including those used in the United States, were originally developed by the military. But because of a ban on producing offensive weapons imposed after World War II, Japan's military has no rockets, so the cost of development has been borne by the civilian space agency.
 
U.S. Complaints
But the United States is particularly sensitive to Government subsidies in Japan. It was just such a subsidy that led the United States to complain that Japan was giving an unfair advantage to its satellite industry, financing research and development for satellites that would ultimately be used for commercial purposes. In the meantime, the United States said, the Japanese Government was refusing to purchase American-made satellites, even though several of them have been sold to private industry in Japan.
Japan denied the charge and said its satellite program, called CS-4, was chiefly for research purposes. But last month, in the rush to settle the ''301'' trade issues, named for the section of the trade act that could bring sanctions on a nation deemed to be an unfair trader, Japan backed down.
Japanese newspapers have speculated in recent days that the satellite agreement may have sped plans to commercialize the H-II. The prospect that fewer Japanese-made satellites might be launched by the Government or private industry, the Nihon Keizei Shimbun suggested recently, made it more imperative to find outside users for the H-II.
The H-II is a two-stage, liquid-fueled rocket with two solid-rocket boosters strapped on to provide extra power to lift it out of the atmosphere. The rocket is 161 feet long, or slightly longer than one of the giant solid-fuel booster rockets used on the American space shuttle, and 13 feet in diameter.
The project to develop the rocket was proceeding smoothly until last year, when one of the liquid-fuel engines blew up. The problem was traced to design flaws. A more recent test of the repaired rocket was successful, but the project was set back by a year.
''We think we are now back on track,'' said Mr. Yamano of Nasda.

Pressures Mount For a Budget Deal

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
POWERFUL forces have been pushing the President and the Democratic leadership of Congress toward a deal to cut the widening budget deficit, even if that involves an increase in taxes. The deficit could soar to well over $200 billion in the fiscal year 1991 as a result of lower revenues, higher interest payments and a bigger bill for bailing out savings and loan institutions than the Administration expected.
Thus, the most powerful force for a deal is coming from the worsening deficit and its threat to the national economy and business interests.
The Business Roundtable, a forum of top executives of major corporations, addressed a letter a month ago to key members of Congress declaring: ''In the brief period of the past decade, we have amassed trillions of dollars of debt; we have regressed from being the largest creditor nation in the world to the biggest debtor; we have witnessed the Federal deficit absorb over half our net private savings; we have become increasingly dependent upon foreign capital, inexorably ceding our influence over both our domestic and international policies. And we have embarked upon a course which cannot be sustained without high cost - economic, social and human.'' The Roundtable urged ''all responsible political leaders to seize this opportunity to forge a consensus for comprehensive deficit reduction.'' 
President Bush has been trying to respond to such pleas. Weeks ago, he sent budget director Richard G. Darman forth, like a dove of peace, to persuade the leaders of both parties in Congress to meet with him to work out a budget consensus.
The Democrats were willing to talk, provided they would not be branded with the blame of trying to force a tax increase on the President. And Mr. Bush seemed ready to yield on taxes, provided the Democrats did not attack him for abandoning his election promise not to raise taxes.
But this ''no fault'' deal seems to be falling apart. Conservative Republicans are more ferocious than the Democrats in going after the President should he drop his ''read my lips, no new taxes'' promise. And some liberals are willing to let the Republicans stew in their own juice, as the budget deficit soars.
Indeed, the main threat to President Bush's hopes for being a two-term President may not be higher taxes but the soaring deficit, rising interest rates and a steep recession that would come before the 1992 election.
But would a deal to shrink the budget deficit by the $100 billion or more now required by Gramm-Rudman for the coming fiscal year not itself endanger the economic expansion? Keynesian analysis suggests that with the economy already weak, so big a cut would cause a recession.
But Mr. Bush's conservative economic advisers believe it is possible to keep the economy growing without inflation by measures to increase saving and investment: that is, by cutting the budget deficit, reducing taxes on business and capital and easing monetary policy.
Cutting the deficit, according to this analysis, would bring down interest rates and give a thrust to business investment. At the same time, it would help reduce the value of the dollar in the foreign exchanges, spurring American exports.
Although Mr. Bush's advisers believe that the best way to cut the deficit would be simply to reduce public spending, they recognize that the cuts would be huge and could be a political liability. And they are also willing, for the sake of deficit cutting, to make a deal with the Democrats even if that involves some tax increases.
Cutting the deficit is also important to enable the Federal Reserve to get out of its box. The Fed can hardly ease money lest it aggravate inflation, and it is afraid to tighten money lest it worsen the danger of recession. But, as Harold van Buren Cleveland observes in a study, ''Recasting Europe's Economies:'' ''With public deficits reduced, there is room for a more accommodating monetary policy to help channel the savings released by the public sector into private investment.''
Mr. Bush's right wing has thus far rejected any deal involving tax increases; yet a deal may still lie ahead. It is still too soon to know what that deal would look like. Agreement can probably be reached on increases in excise taxes, but almost certainly not on personal income taxes across the board. A national sales tax or value-added tax can almost certainly not be negotiated at this time because the preparatory work for it has not yet been done.
Mr. Bush may be able to get the cut in the capital gains tax he seeks, but only in exchange for eliminating the ''bubble'' in the personal income tax schedule by raising the top rate to 33 percent from 28 percent for taxpayers earning more than $200,000 a year. On the spending side, the contending parties appear close enough to make a deal on military cuts for fiscal 1991. On Capitol Hill there is talk of a pending deal to take Social Security off budget, though that would necessitate modifying Gramm-Rudman targets and extending the time period for achieving budget balance.
For any of this to happen, the political crossfire in Washington will have to be halted. But it is proving as difficult to get a budgetary truce in Washington as a lasting military truce in Beirut.

HEADLINE: Hills Defends White House Move on Japan Trade

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
The United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, told Congress today that despite recent moves by the Japanese to open their markets, the animosity toward Japan in this country had become ''a tidal wave and you have to run very fast to be in front of it.''
Her testimony before the House Energy Committee's Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer Protection and Competitiveness tested the temper of Congress this election year on the exemption of Japan from the ''Super 301'' sanctions of the 1988 trade law and on protectionism in general.
This was the trade chief's first appearance before Congress since the Bush Administration decided on April 27 to drop Japan from a list of countries subject to reprisal tariffs because of their unfair trade practices.
 
Possible Election Issue
If the economy should fall into a recession, then recriminations against the Administration over softness toward Japan could become a major election issue, Democratic and Republican pollsters agree. 
Subcommittee members, facing re-election battles in what could be a deteriorating economic climate, challenged the decision and Mrs. Hills's explanation behind it - that Japan was making a ''remarkable transformation'' in ''abandoning support for protectionism.''
Representative Don Ritter of Pennsylvania, the subcommittee's senior Republican, said the United States was getting ''crumbs off a big cracker.''
The subcommittee's chairman, Doug Walgren, a Pennsylvania Democrat, accused the Administration of ''failing to implement the law the way Congress intended.''
Representative Howard C. Nielson, Republican of Utah, alluded to the ''belief of many members of Congress'' that Japan was not cited because President Bush did not want to undermine the newly re-elected Japanese Prime Minister, Toshiki Kaifu. After meeting with Mr. Bush in March, Mr. Kaifu had pledged to make trade liberalization the highest priority of his cabinet.
 
Japan's Reputation
In her testimony, Mrs. Hills noted that there was pent-up American hostility toward Japan because its markets had been closed for so long. ''Japan is going to suffer for a while for its reputation, even when it begins to open up,'' she said.
Mrs. Hills said that because of this animosity, the Japanese needed to ''try to move much more rapidly.''
In defending the President's trade decision, Mrs. Hills mentioned the increased concern of Japanese consumers about high prices; the series of recent agreements with the Japanese that would open their markets in telecommunications, supercomputers, satellites and wood products, and the sweeping changes that were promised in Japanese economic society under the so-called Structural Impediments Initiative undertaken by the two governments last year.
She also noted that American exports to Japan rose twice as fast last year as those to the rest of the world and they exceeded the total exports to West Germany, France and Italy.
 
'Farther and Faster'
''Japan has moved farther and faster on outstanding trade issues that any of our trading partners this year,'' she told the subcommittee.
Noting that foreign partners consider it ''offensive'' to be cited by the United States as unfair traders, Mrs. Hills said Japan's support was needed to achieve a successful conclusion in the Uruguay Round of global trade liberalization talks.
More than 105 countries are participating in the four-year-old effort to strengthen the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world's free-trade charter. An agreement is being sought to widen markets in agriculture and services and to improve protection for patents, copyrights and other so-called intellectual property.
Mr. Walgren, the subcommittee chairman, called on the Administration to join in efforts to extend the Super 301 provision of the 1988 legislation, which expires this year. But Mrs. Hills showed little sympathy for the idea because it limited the Administration's discretion.
Besides citing countries for unfair trade practices, the law requires the Administration to establish trade objectives and creates rigorous deadlines for these objectives to be met.

HEADLINE: Foreign Landowners

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
Foreigners continue to own just under 1 percent of the nation's agricultural land, a level that has varied little over the years, the Agriculture Department said today. The department's Economic Research Service made its 1989 end of the year review of reports under a 1978 law requiring foreigners to register American agricultural land holdings. As of Dec. 31, 1989, about 12.9 million acres of agricultural land were owned by foreigners, an increase of 263,273 acres from a year earlier. Of the land owned by foreign interests, 46 percent was forest land, 18 percent cropland, 31 percent pasture and other agricultural land, and 5 percent agricultural land not under cultivation.

HEADLINE: Consumer Credit Rises

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
Americans took out $2.6 billion more in consumer credit than they paid off in March, as borrowing to buy automobiles rebounded from February, the Government said today.
But with the dampening of economic growth this year, consumers have been borrowing less since January. The first quarter had an annualized growth rate of 2.7 percent, which compares with 7.6 percent for all of 1988 and 8.5 percent for 1987. 
The Federal Reserve said consumer credit in March increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.4 percent, up from a scant one-tenth of 1 percent rise in February. The February figure represented a sharp revision from the 5.7 percent rate estimated earlier and made the month the weakest in a year.
Credit grew at a 3.7 percent annual rate in January, rather than the earlier estimate of 6.4 percent, the Fed said.
 
Less Appetite Seen for Borrowing
Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Washington consulting firm Futures Group, said the economy had been expanding for so long, seven and a half years, that consumers had less appetite for expensive items purchased with loans.
''I think there also has been an erosion of consumer confidence,'' she said. ''People are worried.''
She continued, ''They read in the paper that the unemployment rate went up or that interest rates are going up.''
Automobile loans in March advanced $1.8 billion, a 7.5 percent annual rate, after falling at a 5.2 percent rate in February and advancing at only a 1.7 percent rate in January.
 
Rise in Credit Card Debt
Credit card debt rose by $2 billion, or a 12.1 percent annual rate, in March, up from a 4.7 percent rate a month earlier.
Loans by banks, savings and loans and credit unions that were not secured by real estate were down $1.2 billion, a 7.2 percent rate, after climbing at a 3 percent rate in February.
Borrowing for mobile homes rose $17 million, a scant nine-tenths of 1 percent annual rate, after rising at a 1.7 percent rate in Fenruary.
The various changes left total consumer debt at the end of March at $721.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Dow Is Up Only 5.63 Despite Rate Outlook

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks barely advanced yesterday, even after results of the Treasury's $10 billion bond sale showed that interest rates could be on the way down.
When final returns came in a quarter-hour before the 4 P.M. closing, the average yield on the bellwether 30-year issue stood at 8.84 percent, a level viewed as favorable for stocks.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange swelled to 158.5 million shares - the first time trading had been that strong since early April. But the Dow Jones industrial average rose only 5.63 points, to 2,738.51. Advances outnumbered declines by 847 to 601. 
 
'Speculators Weren't That Quick'
''Maybe speculators weren't that quick on the trigger,'' said Robert H. Stovall, president of Twenty-First Advisers Inc., ''but it's still positive.''
He maintained that with the interest rate under 9 percent, ''We could see very favorable price and volume action'' today.
He noted, too, that buying was strong in such industry leaders as A.T.&T., I.B.M., General Motors, NCR and AMR.
A.T.&T. rose 3/4, to 41 1/4, on 1.4 million shares. I.B.M. added 1 1/8, to 112 3/8, on 1.8 million. G.M. tacked on 3/8, to 46 3/4, on 1.3 million shares. NCR rose 1/4, to 68 1/8, on 292,500. AMR rose 3/8, to 63 3/8, on 438,700 shares.
Among other blue chips, Eastman Kodak, the third-most-active Big Board stock, rose a point, to 39 1/8, on 2.1 million shares. Commenting on Wall Street estimates that Polaroid's patent-infringement suit could cost $1 billion, Kay Whitmore, Kodak's incoming chief executive, said at the annual meeting Wednesday that the company ''can handle anything within what the Street talks about.'' He said there were no present plans to sell assets to meet the cost.
 
Stirring Talk by G.E. Chairman
John Welch, the chairman of General Electric, gave a stirring speech to analysts on Wednesday, and G.E. rose 1/2, to 67 1/4, on 2.6 million shares.
Westinghouse Electric fell 2, to 72, after reaching a new 52-week low of 71 1/4, on 1.1 million shares. Paul E. Lego, president of Westinghouse and soon to become chairman, met with analysts in Palm Beach, Fla., last Tuesday, but some analysts seemed disappointed.
''People went away concerned with the new leadership of the company in a very difficult competitive environment,'' said Robert W. McCoy Jr., electrical equipment analyst for UBS Securities Inc. He said that despite rumors that Westinghouse might be interested in buying Sundstrand, an aerospace parts company, no mention was made of the situation. Sundstrand, which reached a high of 75 1/2, closed unchanged at 74 1/4.
 
Commodity Research Index Dips
In another sign that stocks may soon rise, the Commodity Research Bureau index - which reached a new 1990 high of 247.79 on Wednesday -fell 0.17 point, to 247.62.
Stuart Shinbein, senior technical editor of the research bureau, said that he was advising commodity traders that ''we've now approached a point where profit taking outweighs staying with bullish positions.''
''If the index goes down,'' he said, ''that's a plus for bond prices,'' which in turn would be a plus for stocks because stock and bond prices generally rise and fall together.
In other strong moves, ITT rose 2, to 54 3/4, in heavy trading after the conglomerate told analysts that it might sell part of its 37 percent stake in Alcatel, the European telecommunications company, to Compagnie Generale d'Electricite of France. The ITT stake could be worth as much as $3 billion, analysts said.
 
Gains for Drug Stocks
Bristol-Myers Squibb, which rose 1/2 Wednesday, touching a new 52-week high then, rose another 7/8, to 59 3/8, on 1.7 million shares and reached a new 52-week high of 59 5/8.
Drug stocks, buoyed by the market rise, advanced briskly. American Home Products rose 3/4, to 50 7/8. American Cyanamid rose 5/8, to 53 3/4, after its Lederle Labs said it had won marketing rights to a new hypertension agent developed by the Elan Corporation. C. R. Bard rose 3/8, to 17 3/8; Johnson & Johnson 3/8, to 58 3/4; Eli Lilly 5/8, to 69 5/8; Medtronic 1 1/8, to 71, and Millipore 1 1/8, to 31 7/8.
Columbia Gas System, thought to be a target of the Coastal Corporation, fell 2, to 45 5/8, after Oscar Wyatt, Coastal's chairman, told stockholders at the annual meeting that it had ''no plans'' to add to its shares.
In the averages, the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.96, to 343.82; the Nasdaq composite 1.86, to 433.20, and the Amex market value 0.39, to 348.92. Bard, C. R. Lilly, Eli

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Firmer Against Yen; Swiss Franc Continues Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar gained ground against the yen and the British pound yesterday, but it fell to two-year lows against the Swiss franc and West German mark.
The dollar had fallen sharply on Wednesday against all four currencies.
Investors continued yesterday to flock to the Swiss franc, sending the dollar to levels not seen since April 1988. In New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.3915 Swiss francs, down from 1.4020. 
''It's the Swiss leading the way here and it has been for the last 48 hours,'' said Andrew Elliott, a foreign-exchange dealer at the Chase Manhattan Bank in London.
The Swiss currency moved higher in overseas trading, and dealers struggled to assess whether talk that $2 billion had been sold to buy Swiss francs was more than a rumor.
''It may have happened,'' said Bob Morrissey, a senior trader with the Bank of Boston. The franc has been rising, the traders said, because of high Swiss interest rates, strong Asian demand and the increasing view of the franc as a ''safe haven'' currency.
The dollar finished mixed in Europe and initially rose when trading shifted to the United States. But the American currency fell back when the traders, ''who retain an overwhelmingly bearish outlook, sold into the dollar's strength,'' said Marc Chandler, an analyst with MMS International Inc. in Chicago.
The traders are also nervously awaiting the Government's release today of the Producer Price Index and retail sales figures, both for April, which are expected to point to an economic slowdown.
If that is the case, Mr. Chandler predicted that there would be ''further dollar declines because there is no reasonable expectation'' that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates.
Higher interest rates stem the inflation, but also enhance the dollar's attractiveness by making American fixed-income securities more valuable for investors.
The belief that the economy is slowing also worked to push the dollar down against the West German mark to levels not seen since January 1988. It fell in New York to 1.6325 West German marks, down from 1.6365.
Against the Japanese currency, the dollar rose, ending the trading day in New York at 156.73 yen, up from 156.50 yen on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those on Wednesday, included: 5.5115 French francs, up from 5.5100; 1,202.75 Italian lire, down from 1,203.25, and 1.1703 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1660.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold prices fell after rising overseas.

HEADLINE: India Rejects U.S. Talks

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 10

 BODY:
India today rejected talks with the United States over removing India from the American list of countries singled out for unfair trading practices.
India is not going to be ''intimidated or policed'' by anybody on the issue of a country's sovereignty and economic independence,'' the Commerce Minister, Arun Nehru, told Parliament. 
It was the first time that Indian officials have openly rejected negotiations with the United States over the trade issue.
On April 27, President Bush cited India under a 1988 law that provides for economic sanctions if protective trade barriers are not eliminated. Mr. Bush removed Japan and Brazil from the list, leaving India the only country on it.
India has refused to modify its restrictive trade policies, which are intended to protect domestic industries by limiting foreign investment and imposing high import duties.
Under the 1988 law, Washington could levy tariffs of up to 100 percent on goods imported from a nation judged an unfair trader.

HEADLINE: U.S. Chip Index Is Unchanged

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 9

 BODY:
Sales of computer chips to the United States market declined in April, but the semiconductor industry's leading indicator remained constant, an industry group said today.
 
The Semiconductor Industry
Association, based in Cupertino, Calif., reported a book-to-bill ratio of 1.09 for the three-month period that ended in April, the same as in March and up from a revised figure of 1.08 in February. 
The ratio compares orders with shipments and is considered a leading indicator of the industry's performance. A ratio of 1.09 indicates that for every $100 worth of product shipped, $109 was ordered, indicating that demand has continued to rise.
At $1.28 billion, three-month orders for April were up 1 percent from $1.27 billion for the period ending in March and down 2.7 percent from the figure posted a year ago, which was $1.31 billion.
Three-month average shipments for April totaled $1.17 billion, up slightly from March's $1.16 billion. At $1.11 billion, United States market shipments for April were 14.2 percent lower than March's $1.30 billion.

HEADLINE: PRODUCER PRICES FALL 0.3% IN SIGN INFLATION IS EASING

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The wintertime jump in the nation's inflation rate appears to be wearing off, and inflation seems to be settling back to the moderate level that has prevailed over the last two years, a Government report indicated yesterday.
The Labor Department said its index of prices covering a wide range of products ready for sale to retailers fell by three-tenths of 1 percent in April, mostly because of sharp drops in food and energy prices. But excluding these volatile categories, the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods rose a mild two-tenths of 1 percent, continuing a trend that began in February.
Two other reports reinforced the perception that inflation was coming down - employment numbers released last week showed a rise in the unemployment rate, to 5.4 percent from 5.2 percent, and the Commerce Department reported yesterday that retail sales fell by six-tenths of 1 percent in April. 
 
'On Just the Right Track'
''What a difference a week makes,'' said David Jones, senior vice president of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a Wall Street bond house. ''Before the unemployment numbers, the fear was that the economy was too strong, inflation too high and the Fed might raise interest rates. But now it appears the economy is on just the right track.''
The stock and bond markets appeared to agree, shaking off fears of inflation or recession. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 63.07 points yesterday, to a near-record 2,801.58, and prices of Treasury securities surged, bringing interest rates down. The rate on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 8.66 percent, from 8.83 percent the day before. [Pages 31 and 34.] Rightly or wrongly, the markets concluded that the Federal Reserve Board was not likely to raise or lower interest rates, which is the Federal Reserve's way of fighting inflation and recession, respectively. The reasoning of the markets is that the latest data portray an economy neither strong enough to push inflation higher than its average level for the last two years, nor so weak that it is likely to fall below that level.
''We are heading back to a normal inflation rate,'' said Donald Ratajczak, an inflation forecaster at Georgia State University - normal being annual rates since 1987 of 3 percent to 4 percent for the Producer Price Index and 4 percent to 5 percent for the Consumer Price Index. The winter spurt drove the producer index's average above 5 percent in the first quarter and the consumer index above 8 percent.
The producer index, a harbinger of inflation at the consumer level, had risen sharply from October through January but has fallen since then. April's drop was the biggest, prompting many economists to predict that the consumer index for April, due out Wednesday, would also begin to ease, after having risen sharply in the first quarter.
But now the special factors that made prices jump early are disappearing. A freeze in December pushed up energy prices in January, but they have been falling since February. Farmers in Florida replanted their fields in January, after the frost, and today they are flooding markets with vegetables, making prices plunge, the Labor Department said. Tomatoes, for example, fell by 73.3 percent in price from March to April.
And apparel prices, which rose sharply with the introduction of spring fashions early in the year, are no longer going up, mostly because consumers are overly cautious, surveys show.
 
Very Sharp Reversal
The April decline in the producer index came after a drop of two-tenths of 1 percent in March and no movement at all in February. The three-month trend is a very sharp reversal of the 1.8 percent increase in January and the rise of six-tenths of 1 percent in December.
But more important, the so-called core producer price index, one that measures prices of finished goods excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, has risen by steadily smaller amounts since February - four-tenths of 1 percent that month, three-tenths in March and the two-tenths in April. That brought the rise over the last 12 months down to 3.5 percent from 4.4 percent in March and 5.1 percent in February.
There were some price increases in April, of course. Prices rose for some foods, among them beef, fish, eggs, coffee and pasta. Pharmaceuticals, tobacco, toys, soaps and detergents also became more costly.
Although auto prices fell by nine-tenths of 1 percent, gasoline prices went up by 2.2 percent, to $1.03 a gallon at self-service stations and $1.20 at full-service stations, reflecting a predictable springtime rise in highway travel.
But over all, energy prices dropped 1.7 percent after declining in the two previous months, largely because of a 5.5 percent decline in natural gas costs.
The prices of machinery and other new factory equipment also rose.
 
Two Reasons Cited
Nigel Gault, senior economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, an economic consulting service, cited two reasons for the higher cost of capital equipment: stepped-up manufacturing to fill export orders and a push to automate, thus cutting labor costs. Rising wages have helped sustain average inflation rates above 3 percent for the producer index and above 4 percent for the consumer index, many economists say.
Another index, one measuring producer prices at the intermediate level, rose a modest one-tenth of 1 percent. A jump in the cost of construction materials more than offset declining prices for steel, industrial chemicals, paperboard, some fabrics, aircraft engines and parts.
But the index for crude prices, measuring goods at the very first stage of production, was inflationary. Although this index fell over all in April by three-tenths of 1 percent, because of sharp drops in crude oil and raw-food prices, the index without food and energy rose by 2.2 percent after having risen by 2 percent in March. From November through February, it had fallen.
Robert Giordano, co-director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said the rise might be a result of growing demand from manufacturers as they rebuilt inventories of some metals, among them copper and aluminum. The upward trend at the crude level would have to continue for several more months before it became an inflationary factor, he added.

HEADLINE: Bush, Trying to Quell Tax Debate, Insists Budget Talks Will Be Open

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINGSVILLE, Tex., May 11

 BODY:
Trying to quell the storm caused by the remarks of his chief of staff, President Bush insisted today that he was willing to discuss everything, including taxes, in the upcoming budget negotiations.
''There's no conditions, and that's the way it is,'' he said aboard Air Force One at the beginning of a trip to give a commencement address at Texas A&I University here in South Texas before going on to speak in South Carolina and Virginia. ''That's the way it's going to be, and that's the way it must be.''
In his first public remarks on the debate that has raged in Washington this week over the widening deficit, Mr. Bush said he would ignore the tension over the budget meeting next week and follow some advice from his mother. 
''Tomorrow there'll be another tidal wave, so keep your snorkel above the water level and do what you think is right,'' the President said. ''That's exactly what my Mom told me when I was about 6. Do your best. Do your best. I'm trying hard. Stay calm.''
 
A Signal of Reassurance
Mr. Bush tried to send a signal of reassurance to Democrats and Republicans who were upset over the remarks of his chief of staff, John H. Sununu, indicating that the White House was not interested in discussing new taxes with Congress.
Mr. Sununu was quoted in The Washington Post on Thursday as saying that the President's promise to discuss the budget with no preconditions about taxes simply meant that Democrats were free to propose taxes and the White House had the ''prerogative to say no, and I emphasize the 'no.' ''
Mr. Sununu, thinly disguised in The Post's account as ''a senior White House official,'' made his comments on the way home from Costa Rica, where he was attending the inauguration of its President, Rafael A. Calderon Jr. Mr. Sununu was clearly trying to appease a number of Republican members of Congress who were outraged by Mr. Bush's seeming willingness to bend on his campaign pledge of ''no new taxes,'' and some nervous Republican senators who wrote the President to suggest that an election year might not be the best time to back away from his promise.
 
Democratic Fears Exacerbated
But Mr. Sununu's comments backfired because they exacerbated Democratic fears that the White House was trying to draw them into a trap set up to blame them for a tax increase.
''We view this incident as an extremely serious one because it could, if repeated, threaten the success of these talks,'' the House Speaker, Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said Thursday.
A similar view was expressed by Representative Leon E. Panetta, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Budget Committee. ''We just can't continue to have this kind of sniping and political warfare going on at the same time we're trying to deal with a serious problem,'' he said.
Asked today if Mr. Sununu was in trouble for his remarks, the President replied: ''That's silly. So stupid.''
 
'Steady as She Goes'
''None of these Congressmen are in trouble either,'' he added, referring to the lawmakers in both parties who criticized plans for the budget talks. ''I'm approaching it very openly, and I recognize the controversy swirling around from one statement or another. But look, stay on track, steady as she goes. And be open, deal frankly with people and deal in the way I've said.''
The President, who strives for collegiality and consensus in governing, was clearly annoyed at the barbs flying back and forth between the White House and Capitol Hill. But, in an effort to calm the debate, he advised everyone to speak openly.
''Say what you think, Democrats, Republicans, back-benchers, columnists,'' he said. ''But I think the President has a certain responsibility to stay cool. Make clear to people that he's dealing in good faith and do my best.''
As far as possible tax increases, Mr. Bush said, ''I'm not going to show you my hand, and I haven't seen a lot of hands laid down on the Hill.''
 
Response From Bentsen
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, who was traveling on the plane with the President, indirectly criticized Mr. Sununu in referring to the budget meeting. ''I think it's back on track - as long as we keep these fellows in line who are trying to redefine it,'' Mr. Bentsen said.
Asked by reporters if he still believed the President was sincere in proposing the meeting, Senator Bentsen replied, ''I give him the benefit of the doubt.''
If Bush advisers were worried about the President's looking insincere, they were just as worried about his looking sincere - in putting taxes on the table - and would thus be accused of waffling.
Watching a clip of the television entertainer David Letterman making a joke Wednesday night about the President's new stance, ''Read my lips: I lied,'' a senior adviser cringed and murmured, ''That's harsh.''
In the days since Mr. Bush met with Congressional leaders from both parties at the White House last Sunday, his budget director, Richard G. Darman, and his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, have said gloomier-than-predicted economic forecasts were forcing the Administration to reconsider all possibilities for cutting the deficit.
''We're not dealing in a crisis mentality,'' Mr. Bush said when asked about the deficit. ''But we've got a major deficit problem. We've got a law that says where it has to be.''

HEADLINE: A President Strong on Civil Rights

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Dream, Yes, but Restore Rights'' (editorial, April 10) was an unjust criticism of President Bush's civil rights policy.
The President has a record of strong support for civil rights dating back over 40 years. From 1948, when he headed a drive for the United Negro College Fund at Yale, to his current support of several key pieces of civil rights legislation, President Bush has been a leading figure in the quest for racial equality. 
In just 15 months of the Bush Administration, there have been several outstanding legislative achievements. Last November, the President signed Public Order 101-180 (ii), extending the tenure of the Civil Rights Commission. He was also a strong supporter of the Hate Crimes Act, which was signed into law this week.
The President is also determined to help eliminate bias and bigotry by removing barriers to opportunity; he has asked Congress to increase funding for several important programs. The requested budgets for Head Start and aid for Historically Black Colleges and Universities have increased $500 million and $60 million, respectively. The President's new HOPE initiative, a program aimed at giving all people basic shelter and affordable housing, is budgeted at $4 billion over three years.
The President has also met with civil rights leaders on a number of occasions to discuss issues of critical concern to us all; from the drug plague that is poisoning our youth to the economic empowerment and development of minorities.
In other areas concerning civil rights, the President is an ardent supporter of the Americans with Disabilities Act, potentially the most sweeping anti-discrimination legislation in 24 years. He has also condemned, on numerous occasions, attacks on the civil rights of AIDS patients. Your criticism of the President's commitment to civil rights is unfounded. For more than 40 years, he has been an influential leader in the struggle to bring civil rights to all Ameri-cans.

HEADLINE: Albany: Better, but Still Ducking

 BODY:
Budget-making this season in Albany continues to give New Yorkers a most discomfiting insight into the failings of their political leaders. With the budget already more than a month late, the state's top elected officials are still ducking the chance to do things right.
The latest offense came on the heels of a welcome show of common sense. Responding to strong business pressure, Gov. Mario Cuomo and legislative leaders agreed to drop a destructive plan to impose sales taxes on the healthiest segment of the state's troubled economy - services like advertising, public relations and management consulting. But after retreating from that folly, they embraced a new hodgepodge of taxes. 
The new package is an improvement over the discarded plan. But it isn't nearly as prudent or fair as broad-based taxes, like a surcharge on the personal income tax or an increase in the gasoline tax. The proposal includes a higher highway-use tax for large trucks, a 5 percent tax on car rentals, an increase in hotel and motel taxes and an increase in taxes paid by importers or processors of petroleum products - a small gas tax in disguise. To his credit, Assembly Speaker Mel Miller did propose a surcharge on the personal income tax. But he faced formidable opposition from Ralph Marino, the Senate majority leader. Mr. Marino has consistently thwarted budget negotiations this year, long refusing to face the reality of the state's growing budget deficit. He insisted that unspecified budget cuts would do the job, but still pressed for unreasonable increases in school aid. At least the Governor has acknowledged the reality of a budget deficit that, since January, has grown by an estimated $2 billion to a projected $4 billion. But he hasn't exercised forceful leadership.
One result is a budget that doesn't deal equitably with the effects of an economic slump that's hitting the whole Northeast. Another result is needless expense. Local governments have to borrow to make up for unavailable state aid; such borrowing costs millions in interest.
That could have been avoided had someone shown gumption in Albany. But leveling with the public and imposing unpopular taxes takes political courage - a commodity in short supply in this state election year.

HEADLINE: Oregon's Brave Medical Experiment

 BODY:
Last week the state of Oregon announced that it would curtail many medical services for the poor -but the move does not demonstrate hardheartedness so much as hardheaded compassion. In a brave experiment, the state hopes to make basic medical services more widely available with intelligent rationing of health care.
America's biggest health problem is the cost of treatment, now nearly $540 billion a year and an astonishing 11.1 percent of the gross national product. That impinges on publicly funded health insurance programs, especially Medicaid, which pays bills for the poor. While Washington sets broad guidelines and shares the cost, states have great discretion over eligibility and coverage. 
At present, Oregon residents with incomes at 58 percent of the poverty level qualify for Medicaid. (Nationally the level is less than 50 percent, and in some states as low as 17 percent.) Oregon would raise that level to 100 percent, thus making health coverage available to many more families. But it can do so, the state says, only by setting priorities.
Thus state officials have prepared a list of 1,600 medical procedures, balancing costs against how many people they would benefit. Other factors -how much a person would gain from major surgery, for instance, and the preferences of Oregonians -were also considered. Ailments and injuries above a line to be drawn by the State Legislature will continue to be covered by Medicaid. Those below will not be. All Medicaid coverage for the aged, disabled and the blind, no matter what the procedure, will continue as it has.
Before the state can go ahead with changes in its Medicaid coverage, however, it must get a waiver from the Federal Government. Oregon's Congressional delegation plans to introduce legislation in the Senate and House of Representatives soon. Controversy is certain.
Representative Henry Waxman, chairman of the House subcommittee governing Medicaid, warns against ''fool[ing] ourselves into thinking there's a lot of fat to be cut from coverage of the most vulnerable people.'' And states that devote little of their budgets to Medicaid might find the Oregon plan a handy way to cut coverage of diseases that are both expensive to treat and lacking a constituency - AIDS being an obvious example.
An argument could also be made that the Oregon initiative amounts to no more than a Band-Aid for the serious ailments of America's health care system. Some are sure to argue that discussion of rationing in Oregon can only distract from the larger debate over national health insurance.
Nonetheless, Oregon deserves credit for confronting the urgent issue: how to reconcile increasingly expensive medicine with finite funds and a seeming infinity of ills.

HEADLINE: Interior Secretary Questions Law on Endangered Species

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. says Congress should consider modifying the Endangered Species Act so that protection of animals and plants is balanced against benefits to society from certain kinds of development.
Mr. Lujan's spokesman, Steven Goldstein, said the Secretary thinks Congress should determine whether the law is being used for its intended purpose, protecting wildlife, or as a tool against development. ''It is the Secretary's opinion that the Endangered Species Act should be used as a shield but not as a sword,'' Mr. Goldstein said.
Mr. Lujan's assessment was originally made in an interview on Thursday with The Denver Post. Mr. Lujan was attending a conference today at Mesa Verde National Park, near Durango, Colo., and not available for interviews to elaborate on his proposal, Mr. Goldstein said. 
Environmentalists immediately criticized the remarks, saying that the Secretary was supposed to be the primary protector of wildlife.
 
Lack of Commitment Charged
''The Secretary of the Interior seems to be equating the Environmental Species Act, one of the most critical laws on the books, with the law that says you shouldn't remove the tags from your mattress,'' said Peter Dykstra, a spokesman for Greenpeace. ''The fact that the act is unambiguous is the very reason for its success.''
The National Wildlife Federation and others said Mr. Lujan's remarks demonstrated that the Bush Administration was not showing leadership on the environment and lacked commitment to endangered wildlife.
In the interview with The Denver Post, Mr. Lujan said he had been frustrated by the use of the law to stop beneficial development projects.
He was quoted as saying that a subspecies of red squirrel was holding up construction of a $200 million telescope on Mount Graham in Arizona and that 16 squawfish had stopped a needed water project in the Southwest.
 
Misuse of Federal Act Cited
''There are people who make it their life's work protecting endangered species and their motives are laudable and sincere,'' said Mr. Goldstein. ''But there are others who occasionally use the Endangered Species Act to stop economic progress or development because they oppose a particular project, and that's what Mr. Lujan's upset about.''
The spokesman said it would be inaccurate to say that Mr. Lujan wants to weaken the law, just because he wants to make it more flexible. For example, Mr. Goldstein said, if an endangered species exists in more than one region, do all habitats need equal protection? Or if there are numerous subspecies of an endangered animal, does each need to be preserved where it is found, or could some be moved?
In The Denver Post interview, Mr. Lujan cited the Mount Graham red squirrel as an example of a subspecies that was blocking construction of an astronomical observatory. He was quoted as saying: ''Do we have to save every subspecies? The red squirrel is the best example. Nobody's told me the difference between a red squirrel, a black one or a brown one.''
The Secretary was quoted as saying that he was required to enforce the law and would do so, but that the law was ''too tough'' and should be changed.
 
Reminded of Watt, She Says
Jay D. Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation, said: ''We are incensed that the very Cabinet official whose job it is to be the country's front-line protector of endangered wildlife would make such outrageous statements.
Mr. Hair said fewer than 100 of the Mount Graham red squirrels remain today and Mr. Lujan's comments about them were ''insensitive at best.''
Faith Campbell, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Mr. Lujan's suggestions evoked those of former Interior Secretary James G. Watt.
''Congress and the American public rejected Mr. Watt's efforts to weaken the Endangered Species Act and we expect them to reject Secretary Lujan's proposals as well,'' she said.
Sydney J. Butler of the Wilderness Society said: ''Species and subspecies are being eliminated at a faster rate now than at any time since the disappearance of the dinosaurs. Mr. Lujan has an immense responsibility to save endangered wildlife, and he, more than anyone, should understand the requirements of the law.''

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
Dubcek in Washington: Slovak With a Message

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
Alexander Dubcek, the father of the Prague Spring, came to Washington today, not as the leader of a free Czechoslovakia, as he had thought likely for a fleeting moment last fall, but to remind Americans that Slovaks as well as Czechs carried out the revolution of 1989.
After a meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, Mr. Dubcek went on to a lunch with members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he appealed for most-favored-nation trade status for Czechoslovakia, which would give his country rights on a par with those of America's best customers. He said Czechoslovakia had fulfilled all economic and political conditions for that.
He also said he expected all Soviet troops to leave his country no later than the end of next year. 
Now the leader of the National Assembly, Mr. Dubcek, gray-haired and slightly tentative in his movements at the age of 68, retains his distinctive aquiline profile after more than two decades in exile. His manner is wary, and an aide said, ''His life has made him a little nervous about reporters.''
 
'Unaffiliated Politically'
He describes himself as ''unaffiliated'' politically, though still a Communist, but he wore today on the lapel of his black three-piece suit the red-white-and-blue V symbol of Public Against Violence, the Slovak equivalent of Prague's Civic Forum.
Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, the panel's Democratic chairman, was perhaps the ideal host for the lunch; as a young Foreign Service officer, he opened the United States Consulate in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, in 1948, so he knows all about the tensions between the Czechs and the Slovaks, which flared recently in a protracted quarrel about whether there should be a hyphen in the nation's name.
Mr. Dubcek made no mention of Slovak nationalism, though his aides emphasized it. Nor, for that matter, did he ask for American aid; he had said in Canada earlier this week that joint business ventures were more desirable, because ''loans would just have to be paid for by our children and grandchildren.'' And he said nothing about his personal situation or emotions.
Recounting his country's attempt to break the Stalinist vise in 1968, an attempt he led and Soviet tanks crushed, Mr. Dubcek said: ''We made an attempt 21 years ago to break the Stalinist system in Czechoslovakia. We didn't fail, but we had limits forced on us. We were broken by military force.''
 
An Electrifying Moment
''But it is impossible for violence to win forever,'' he told the senators. ''It may win for a certain time but not forever. Change might have come sooner, but nevertheless it came.''
For an electrifying moment, as that change swept the streets of the old Czech capital last year, it seemed it might put Mr. Dubcek back into power. On the evening of Nov. 24, while he stood on a balcony above Wenceslas Square, more than 200,000 people shouted ''We want Dubcek!'' But the students and intellectuals who made the revolution prefered Vaclav Havel, the playwright who is now the Czech President.
Mr. Dubcek was eventually installed by Mr. Havel in the Government's No. 3 position, partly as a link to the failed earlier revolution, partly as a concession to Slovak feelings. But the older man's role is definitely a subordinate one, and his reception in Washington made that quite plain.
He is to see Vice President Dan Quayle, but not President Bush. He is to be given an honorary degree at American University on Sunday, and an award at the International Human Rights Law Group's dinner on Tuesday, but there will be no dramatic speech on Capitol Hill.

HEADLINE: Nairobi Journal;
An Envoy Who Starts Fires to Get Things Started

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, May 11

 BODY:
Smith Hempstone, the American Ambassador to this East African nation, was not bashful about coveting the job. He recounts approaching George Bush before he won the Presidential election and saying quite bluntly, ''When you are President I would like to be your Ambassador to Kenya.''
A former executive editor of The Washington Times and a columnist with a definite conservative point of view, Mr. Hempstone had the correct political qualifications, and, as it turned out, appropriate, although dated, knowledge.
For eight years in the 1950's and early 60's he traveled through Africa, including a period as a correspondent for The Chicago Daily News in Kenya, when he wrote about its transition from colony to independent nation. 
In the six months since his return, this time as a diplomat, Mr. Hempstone has broken the traditional diplomatic mold. Gray-haired and 60 years old, he greets weekend visitors on the back porch of his residence in plaid shirt and khaki shorts.
 
Hot Political Debate
He was quick to tell the Kenyan Government that if American business investment was going to return, something had to be done about the pervasive corruption, a subject more delicate in Kenya than human rights. Then last week, he stepped into a heated domestic political debate.
To a speech that an aide had written about the economy, Mr. Hempstone added a sentence: that in handing out economic assistance, Washington would give preference to those nations that ''nourish democratic institutions, defend human rights and practice multiparty politics.''
Almost any mention of multiparty politics in this one-party state draws furious responses from the leaders of the ruling party, the Kenya Africa National Union, including its head, President Daniel arap Moi.
Mr. Hempstone made it clear that he was reflecting official Washington's point of view and not his own. But Mr. Moi took offense and effectively told him not to meddle.
The controversy grew and threatened a project dear to Mr. Hempstone, an American-Kenyan trade show. It was the first in Kenya's 27 years of independence, and President Moi was to open it. After Mr. Hempstone's multiparty comments, the President threatened to back out, and the Ambassador had to engage in some backstage diplomacy.
Mr. Moi not only appeared, but in a carefully crafted speech on Wednesday he avoided the shrill language that had marked his attacks on the multiparty proponents. He encouraged the debate and said Kenya was not wedded to the past, a greater concession to the possibility of change than had come from any senior Government official.
A senior staff aide at the American Embassy said, ''For the first time the Government is on the defensive.'' A Kenyan Government official said that many Kenyans, yearning for a substantive rather than a name-calling debate on how Kenya should mold its political system in the wake of democratization in Eastern Europe, were grateful to Mr. Hempstone. ''He is our friend,'' the offical said.
While Washington had been clear about the need for political change in Africa, Mr. Hempstone is the only American Ambassador on the continent to have publicly raised the matter. ''It's ironic,'' he said, explaining that he is probably the most conservative American envoy in Africa.
 
Reshaping of Politics
Mr. Hempstone said he was not sure whether Western models of democracy were appropriate. It is probable, he said, that new political parties will form along tribal lines, a common fear expressed by African opponents of the idea. Further, Africa did not have the same historical background as the developed world.
At a Washington meeting last month of American Ambassadors in Africa, Mr. Hempstone was cast as the devil's advocate on a panel arguing the merits of multiparty systems. ''I said that multiparty systems will not necessarily lead to Jeffersonian democracy and one-party systems do not necessarily lead to represssion or lack of political freedom. I found myself defending Kenya -which I do.''
Nevertheless, he has chosen to raise the issue. He says he is only doing it because he wants Kenya to get the best from the United States, and he fears Congress will cut aid if there are not political reforms.
Not one for protocol, Mr. Hempstone turned up for a visit recently to a family-plannning project in rural Kenya wearing shorts, shirt and tennis shoes.
And he drew even more attention when he visited a prominent Kenyan politician, Shariff Nassir, in the coastal city of Mombasa. Mr. Nassir gave the Ambassador the usual arguments for a one-party state. Rather than remain diplomatically silent, Mr. Hempstone forcefully articulated the American policy.
The influential Weekly Review, a news magazine, observed that Mr. Hempstone's rebuttal to the powerful Mr. Nassir was ''a fleeting breach of protocol.''
Mr. Hempstone was not troubled by the magazine's criticism. ''I'm not a diplomat,'' he said with a chuckle.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER'S WORLD;
Businesses Offering Variant on H.M.O.'s

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Already beset by a confusing system of health care, consumers are now being offered yet another medical plan - a re-invented health maintenance organization.
In the past three years several of the country's biggest employers, among them the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, Allied-Signal Inc. and Southwestern Bell, have been working with insurers to create networks of physicians and hospitals for their employees to use.
The reason is simple: tighter control over the services that doctors perform for employees and their families means lower costs for the companies. But some medical experts fear that the new programs represent a further emergence of cost as the chief criterion for determining employee health care. 
 
Networks in Varied Forms
 As with H.M.O.'s, the new networks, which are being organized for the employers by insurance companies, come in varied forms. Some use established H.M.O. clinics and doctors, while others rely on networks of physicians who act as ''gatekeepers,'' consulting with insurers before undertaking medical procedures or recommending specialists. Some programs reward doctors financially for limiting services and costs.
These new networks, which are being called preferred-provider organizations, managed-care programs or hybrid H.M.O.'s, will let employers track both spending and treatments much more closely.
For consumers, the plans may be a mixed blessing. On the positive side, they provide more flexibility than H.M.O.'s because employees can use doctors who do not belong to the network and still have the program pay part of the cost. But because companies will rate the programs partly on the basis of cost, health experts worry that care quality may suffer.
''It scares me,'' said Dr. David Brook, the deputy director of the health services program for the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif. ''We are unleashing very powerful financial incentives without any standards.''
Any shift in employee health plans is likely to have broad impact. Of Americans under the age of 65 who have health coverage, 3 of 4 receive it through an employer, according to the Health Insurance Industry of America, a trade group.
''There is tremendous interest by companies in these kinds of programs,'' said David Polk, an assistant vice president for marketing in the employee benefits division of the Aetna Life and Casualty Company in Hartford. Aetna is one of the insurance companies organizing the networks; others are Cigna and Prudential Insurance.
The trend toward hybrid programs comes amid slowing consumer interest in traditional H.M.O.'s. Between June 1988 and July 1989 new enrollments in traditional H.M.O.'s rose by only 3.6 percent, the smallest annual gain since 1976, when such statistics were first collected, according to Interstudy, a health care research company in Minneapolis. There are about 32.5 million H.M.O. members nationwide, about 25 percent of them in California, Interstudy reported.
Some consumers, younger workers or those with several children, are pleased with H.M.O.'s, which offer benefits like preventive medical care. Sarah Marmor Labarthe, a 24-year-old paralegal who lives in New York City, said her H.M.O. ''reminds me of the type of clinic that I used to go to at college.''
But the medical care of these younger and generally healthy workers may cost less than the flat enrollment fee, making the H.M.O. program a poor investment for the employer. Older workers, whose medical costs run high enough that they more than offset such fees, have tended to be unwilling to give up their own doctors or the notion that they should be able to choose the doctors they want.
Two years ago Allied-Signal Inc. decided to eliminate both H.M.O.'s and traditional insurance coverage wherever possible, and offered its 85,000 employees a natiowide network of doctors and hospitals assembled for the company by the Cigna Corporation, said Michael Ascolese, a spokesman for Allied-Signal, which has its headquarters in Morristown, N.J.
A top official at a union representing Allied-Signal workers said the decision to accept the company's plan was simple. ''They said that if we wanted to, we could go out and buy our own insurance, but they were not going to supply another plan,'' said James McHale, president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union local that represents workers at an Allied-Signal chemical plant in Philadelphia. About 45,000 Allied-Signal workers are already taking part in the new network, Mr. Ascolese said.
Under the Allied plan, employees pay $10 for each visit to a doctor in the system. Should they choose to go outside it, they pay a deductible and part of the bill, though an employee's out-of-pocket medical expenses are capped at about $1,000 a year. Mr. McHale said most employees in Philadelphia seem pleased with the plan, although some concerns remain about acute care.
''If I had a heart attack and needed a bypass operation,'' Mr. McHale said, ''I'd throw the $400 deductible up to get the doctor I want.''
Even as companies adopt the new programs, major questions about them remain. Health care officials acknowledge, for example, that there is little information showing that the hybrid H.M.O.'s will provide savings. And they may not be protected by the same government regulations as H.M.O.'s, officials said.
''The public probably thinks that regulators are checking up on the adequacy of these networks and the credentials of providers, but they are not,'' said Joyce Gallimore, director of the Bureau of Alternative Delivery Systems for the New York State Department of Health. So far, only the systems that use existing H.M.O. networks will be subject to equal scrutiny, Ms. Gallimore said.
 
Reviewing the Doctors
 Mr. Polk, the Aetna official, said companies police physicians in their networks by checking credentials and conducting consumer satisfaction surveys. ''We know the aberrant physicians,'' he said.
A.T.&T. is now surveying employees in an effort to assemble a network that includes many doctors that they now use, according to Laura Unger, president of Local 1150 of the Communication Workers of America in New York City.
While the union supports the effort, some employees are skeptical. ''Who is going to be checking these doctors out?'' asked Ronald A. Tyree, an A.T.&T. communications technician.
Dr. Brook of the Rand Corporation and other health experts also wonder how companies will make decisions about competing systems.
''They have close to zero information to work with,'' he said. ''I suspect such decisions will be made capriciously and financially.''

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Show Plunge of 0.6% for April

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
Retail sales, held back by another big drop in auto demand, fell by six-tenths of 1 percent in April, the biggest setback in six months, the Commerce Department reported today.
The department said that sales fell to a seasonally adjusted $148.64 billion last month after a decline of two-tenths of 1 percent in March and no change in February.
Disappointed private economists, who had been hoping for a small rebound in activity, warned that the lackluster sales would be likely to translate into slower economic growth in the months ahead as businesses faced growing inventories of unsold products. 
 
Recovery in Eighth Year
 Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity, has been the driving force during much of the recovery, now in its eighth year, a record for peacetime.
''We have now had three months in a row of weak retail sales,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Company. ''The consumer is fading from the scene.''
Sandra Shaber, senior economist at the Futures Group, said that at this stage of the recovery there was little pent-up demand left. ''The most disturbing trend here is the weakness in department store sales,'' she added. ''That's a pretty good indicator of the overall mood'' of consumers.
Analysts said that unless consumer spending weakened further, the country should still be able to avoid a recession, although the predicted overall growth, as measured by the gross national product, would expand at a sluggish pace of 2 percent this year.
 
Largest Drop Since October
 The April decline was the largest monthly drop since a 1.4 percent plunge in October. The March and April declines marked the first time in almost three years that retail sales had posted consecutive monthly declines.
The biggest drag on activity came from auto sales, which dropped by 2.7 percent. It marked the sixth time in the last seven months that car sales had fallen. Analysts said that was particularly worrisome because it was coming at a time when auto companies were offering heavy incentives to reduce inventories.
''The consumer has clearly backed off,'' said David Wyss, an economist at DRI/McGraw Hill, a consulting company in Lexington, Mass. ''The incentives are costing car companies a lot of money and sales are still weak.''
 
Weakness in Other Areas
 Even without the big drop in car sales, spending in other retail areas was weak. Sales at general department stores were off by seven-tenths of 1 percent in April after an even bigger 1.2 percent drop in March. The late Easter had been expected to help sales in early April.
Sales at hardware and building supply stores dropped by 2.6 percent in April after a decrease of eight-tenths of 1 percent the previous month.
Sales at gasoline stations fell by 1 percent. Restaurant sales were off by two-tenths of 1 percent while sales at speciality clothing stores were down by 1.9 percent.
In the only major areas showing gains, sales at furniture and home furnishing stores edged up by four-tenths of 1 percent while sales at drugstores posted a 1.2 percent increases.

HEADLINE: Candy Plant Plea Denied

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
A United States Government panel today turned down a request by the Swiss candy maker Jacobs Suchard Ltd. to establish a special foreign trade zone for its Chicago plant so that the plant could save money by importing sugar at world prices.
The Foreign Trade Zone Board denied the request by Suchard for its subsidiary E. J. Brach & Sons on the ground that such a move would disrupt United States sugar-pricing policy, a spokesman for the panel said. American sugar prices are kept at levels well above the world market through a quota system.
Suchard has threatened to move the plant out of the United States if the special status is denied. ''Naturally we're disappointed in the decision,'' said Terri Kaminski, a spokeswoman for Brach's. ''At this time, we haven't determined what our next steps will be regarding the plant.''
The decision followed the issuing of an opinion by the Agriculture Department that granting special status to the plant would ''result in adverse consequences to domestic sugar prices,'' a Commerce Department spokesman said.
Brach officials have said the company could save $20 million annually if the status were granted and the plant could import lower-cost sugar.

Stroh Is Interested In Acquiring Heileman

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 11

 BODY:
The Stroh Brewery Company said today that it was interested in acquiring the G. Heileman Brewing Company, a unit of Bond Corporation Holdings, the beleaguered company of the Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond.
''The Stroh Brewery Company would certainly like to be the acquirer of Heileman,'' said George Kuehn, Stroh's senior vice president and general counsel. ''We think it would be a good fit.''
A combination of Stroh and Heileman, which makes Colt 45 Malt Liquor, would create the nation's third-largest brewing company.
Mr. Kuehn refused to say whether Stroh had been in direct talks with Heileman, Bond or bankers for the companies. A Heileman spokesman said the company was skeptical of Stroh's ability to make a bid and accused Stroh of weak management, an uncertain direction and an eroding distributor network.
G. Heileman, based in La Crosse, Wis., was acquired by Bond in 1987 for $1.3 billion. In addition to Colt 45 Malt Liquor, Heileman makes Old Style beer, J. Schmidt, Iron City and other beers.
The Bond business empire has been on the brink of financial collapse since the beginning of the year, fighting off creditors in several court actions as it struggles with debts estimated to exceed $5 billion.
Bond Corporation Holdings is one of Australia's largest companies. In November it reported a loss for the iscal year of $733 million. The company is Australia's second-biggest beer maker, and it also has interests in mining, real estate and communications.
Stroh, a privately held company based in Detroit, makes Stroh's, Old Milwaukee, Schlitz, Schaeffer and other beers.
The Anheuser-Busch Companies and the Philip Morris Companies' Miller Brewing unit are the first and second largest brewers, respectively.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
The 'Kiddie Tax' And Summer Jobs

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
With summer approaching, many students would like to find summer jobs. Some parents, on the other hand, being vaguely aware of the ''kiddie tax,'' are concerned about the effect that might have on the family's finances.
Not to worry, financial experts say. A summer job can bring many benefits, and the kiddie tax applies only to unearned income. Dividends and interest above $1,000 earned on assets held in the name of children under age 14 are taxed at the parents' marginal rate, generally 28 or 33 percent. 
Income earned by children of any age is taxed at their own rate - generally the lowest rate, 15 percent - as is unearned income for children 14 and older. This means that young people can earn some of the money they need for personal expenses or a college education and pay little or no taxes; nor are their earnings likely to have any substantial effect on their parents' taxes.
It also means that it can be advantageous for parents who own a business or have a professional practice to employ their children. The children can learn about the business, and the money they earn is shifted into their lower tax bracket.
''Of course, you can't let them go to the beach and pay them,'' said Herbert Paul, senior tax partner of Mahoney Cohen Paul & Company, an accounting firm in New York. ''But if they come into your office or factory, you can pay them a reasonable rate of compensation.''
For a responsible youngster, that need not be the very lowest wage , he continued. But it does have to be reasonable for the job performed. There are many things a student can do competently - fill in for the switchboard operator, receptionist or porter; for a secretary or bookkeeper if the young worker has office skills, or do manual labor.
Tamara G. Telesko, a vice president of the Chase Manhattan Bank's private banking division, said she had received many questions from clients about children working. ''It makes sense for them to earn money on their own,'' she said. ''It encourages the work ethic, and it gives them a feel for whether that is the kind of job they would like.''
Many young people have idealistic visions of what jobs are like, she added, and summer work can help them focus more realistically on what they want to prepare for in college.
Ms. Telesko noted that like any single taxpayer, a student was entitled to a standard deduction of $3,250, so that much could be earned before any tax was due. If the child takes his or her own personal exemption, $2,050 for 1990, even more can be sheltered from taxes, but the parents could not then take a dependency exemption for the child, even if they provided more than half the child's support. Since that exemption is phased out for upper-income taxpayers, shifting income by employing the child can be particularly advantageous for them.
Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., pointed out that Social Security taxes could also be an important consideration. For low-income people, that tax bite is far more onerous than income taxes - both employee and employer must pay 7.65 percent on the first $51,300 earned this year.
But sole proprietorships and husband-wife partnerships get a break when employing their children. Social Security taxes do not have to be withheld if the children are under age 18, according to the I.R.S. Code section 3121(b)(3)(A). Before 1988, this break applied to children under age 21 and to spouses, he noted, but that is no longer the case.
With the cost of college today - around $6,000 a year for state schools and more than $13,000 for private institutions - it is important for both children and their families to put aside as much as possible, Ms. Telesko said, without undue anxiety about the kiddie tax.
The kiddie tax results from the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Under it, the first $500 of a child's unearned income is tax-free and the next $500 is taxable at the child's rate. For most children, in the 15 percent bracket, only $75 in taxes would be due on the first $1,000 of dividends and interest. Since $1,000 is the earnings on $12,500 invested at 8 percent, transferring that much money to a child, can bring a big tax saving to a family. Parents in the 28 percent bracket would owe $280 in taxes on that amount of earnings; those in the 33 percent bracket would owe $333.
Series EE savings bonds can be excellent vehicles for college savings. Investors can elect to receive the interest after the child is age 14 so that it is taxed at the child's rate. And taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $60,000 or less who buy Series EE bonds issued after 1989 and redeem them to pay for their own higher-education expenses or those of a dependent will owe no tax on the interest. The exclusion is phased out for those with incomes of $60,000 to $90,000.

HEADLINE: Dow Gains Points; Volume Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Falling interest rates and growing signs that inflationary pressures are on the way down helped lift stock prices sharply yesterday in the heaviest trading in five months.
The Dow Jones industrial average -buoyed by solid advances in blue chips like Coca-Cola, Boeing, Du Pont, I.B.M. and Woolworth - advanced an impressive 63.07 points, or 2.3 percent, to 2,801.58.
The Dow now stands only 8.57 points, or three-tenths of 1 percent, away from the record of 2,810.15 set on the first trading day of 1990. The key market barometer also advanced a solid 91.22 points for the week. 
 
Broader Indexes Not Near Record
 Analysts cautioned, however, that the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index remained 2.2 percent below its all-time high, set in October, while the Nasdaq composite index, which measures the smaller stocks, stood 9.8 percent below the high it set in October.
But in a move that - if it continues - could mean a much brighter stock market on the way and much bigger commission checks on Wall Street, volume on the New York Stock Exchange soared to more than 234 million shares, the highest since it topped 240 million in December. Moreover, 1,282 stocks advanced while only 339 declined.
''Money's coming into the market,'' said Peter G. Grennan, senior vice president of Shearson Lehman Hutton. ''You don't want to be left on the sidelines on this one.''
''Interest rates look like they're going lower,'' he said, ''and the economy is growing moderately. These are two very, very bullish ingredients for higher stock prices.''
 
'Investors Are Less Worried'
 Maury Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber, said stock prices were strong ''because interest rates are down, commodity prices are down, producer prices are down and so are retail sales.'' He continued, ''So stock and bond prices went up because investors are less worried about inflation.''
In a cautious forecast tied to bonds, which generally determine what happens to stocks, he said, ''Chances are that in the near term, the bond market can do better because of continued good news on inflation.'' Less inflation, he explained, takes the pressure off interest rates so that ''bonds become less competitive with stocks.''
Barely 10 days ago, Wall Street investors worried that with interest rates rising well beyond 9 percent and Japanese interest in the United States bond market supposedly falling away, the American stock and bond markets might have to batten down for a long time. But in a move that apparently took much of Wall Street by surprise, Japanese buying, while somewhat weaker, has not fallen away. As a result, interest rates have not had to be pushed to the sky to attract investors.
Last week the bellwether 30-year Treasury bonds yielded 9.02 percent, enough to lure investors away from stocks. By Thursday, in the Treasury's $10 billion sale of 30-year bonds, the yield had slid to 8.84 percent, but not yet enough to lift the Dow more than 5.63 points. But by yesterday, old 30-year Treasury bonds yielded 8.66 percent and the new ones just sold yielded 8.63 percent, enough to convince investors that interest rates were indeed dropping rapidly.
Expectations of still further declines in interest rates, in turn, toppled the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen and, for a while, against most European currencies. The prospect of a cheaper dollar helped raise stock prices for dollar-sensitive stocks because cheap dollars mean that American products become less expensive abroad. Stocks also advanced for American companies producing overseas, because when they convert foreign currency back into dollars, their profits will be higher.
International Flavors, for example, which produces heavily outside the United States, rose 2, to 63 1/2; Upjohn, benefiting from heavy foreign production and wild takeover rumors, rose 1 1/8, to 38 7/8. Caterpillar rose 2 1/2, to 66 1/4. Procter & Gamble was up 1 3/4, to 75 3/8. Colgate-Palmolive gained 1 1/8, to 61 3/8.
Pepsico rose 2 1/4, to 69 5/8, and Coca-Cola 3 1/4, to 83 1/4, both in heavy trading. Both also hit new 52-week highs yesterday, Pepsi at its closing price and Coke at 83 1/2.
Boeing, a big exporter of aircraft, advanced 2 5/8, to 78, after hitting a 52-week high of 78 1/8. Almost 1.5 million shares changed hands, too few to make the Big Board list of the 10-most-active stocks.
 
Drug Companies Strong
As major exporters or big foreign producers, drug companies and other health-care companies were particularly strong yesterday. Pfizer rose 3 3/8, to 60 5/8; Warner Lambert 2 1/4, to 111 1/2; Bausch & Lomb 2 3/8, to 63, and Eli Lilly 2 1/8, to 71 3/4.
The strong rise may not have caught money managers entirely by surprise. Analysts said that asset allocators, a group of professionals who advise investors where to put their money, were telling people to take money out of bonds and to put it into stocks.
Robert Moseson, president of Performance Analytics, a Chicago retirement fund consultant, said that 10 days ago he had advised his 250 clients with $35 billion in the market to put 80 percent of their money into stocks and the rest into short-term cash equivalents. Just a month earlier, he said, he was advising them to keep 25 percent in the stock market and the rest in cash equivalents.
Among the averages, the S.&P. 500 rose 8.18, to 352.00; the Nasdaq composite 4.90, to 438.10, and the Amex market-value 3.58, to 352.50.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Sharp Drop Against Yen

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen yesterday, reflecting some improved confidence in Japan and the follow-through of the dollar's steep decline against the West German mark and other European currencies earlier in the week.
The decline against the yen began in Tokyo, where the dollar tumbled by 2.60 yen. Trading volume was at twice its average levels, and the Nikkei 225 index on the Tokyo stock market rallied by 531.88 points, to 31,512.14.
The dollar then continued to fall in Europe and in New York, spurred in part by the unexpected decline of three-tenths of 1 percent in the Producer Price Index in April. 
 
Rally Against Other Currencies
 By the end of trading, the dollar rallied, in part on profit taking, against the mark and most other European currencies and ended above Thursday's levels. Against the mark, the dollar rose to 1.6380, from 1.6290 on Thursday, when it was at its lowest level in two years.
But against the yen, the dollar finished at 152.70, just above its low for the day, 152.63 yen, and down sharply from 156.60 on Thursday. Despite the fall, the dollar is still far stronger against the yen than other currencies. This is just the lowest level for the dollar against the yen since mid-March.
Traders were hard pressed to explain the dollar's surprising four-yen drop in one day because there was little news to force the move.
But the overall climate for the dollar has changed significantly since the Government released a weaker-than-expected employment report for April last Friday. And it is possible that it just took longer to bring down the dollar against the yen because of the yen's weakness against all major currencies this year. The weakness reflects uncertainties about the health of Japanese markets and the direction of Tokyo's economic policy.
The American employment report showed a much weaker economy than expected. Consequently, traders have shifted to a view that the Federal Reserve is likely to hold interest rates where they are or even lower them.
Before that report, the forecast had been for higher rates, which would help support the dollar by attracting foreign investment for dollar-denominated securities.
 
German Move Expected
 ''The scales have been tipped with the expectation now that the Fed is not tightening and with the expectation that the West Germans will still be tightening in the future,'' said Nicholas Sargen, director of international bond research at Salomon Brothers in New York.
The drop of the Produer Price Index and the decline of six-tenths of 1 percent in retail sales for April, which were also reported yesterday, added fuel to the argument that interest rates would not rise. The price report showed lower inflation than expected, which could ease the concern of the Federal Reserve. It has concentrated its interest rate policy on fighting inflation. The slowing growth reflected in the retail sales report could also strength the argument of some, including Bush Administration economists, that interest rates should be lowered.
The dollar also weakened when some of the uncertainties around the monetary union of the two Germanys were cleared up. The Swiss franc rose sharply, backed with high interest rates and by rumors that Japanese holders of Swiss bonds had to buy billions of francs to pay off the bonds. It also drew many foreign investors, who saw it as even a safer bet than the mark.
Traders said the rise of the yen against the dollar yesterday was also helped by the charts that many traders use to help them predict the course of currencies. On these charts, the dollar fell through several key points against the yen, which just added to the selling pressure on the dollar.

Jawboning the Bankers

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
Despite a clear signal to the banking community that regulators did not want the industry to close its lending spigot, bankers are likely to remain cautious and require proof of a more accommodating regulatory environment before they make large amounts of extra credit available.
Bankers and industry analysts said today that they hoped the message delivered on Thursday by the Government's three top regulators would filter down to Government examination staffs. They said examiners had come down hard on bank lending practices in recent months, prompting some industry executives to accuse the regulators of arbitrarily imposing new, tougher standards and risking a credit squeeze.
This attitude is likely to mean no quick end to a tightening of credit that has not occurred on a nationwide basis but is happening in some regions, like New England. Instead, the bankers are taking a wait-and-see attitude. 
''This will take a little time,'' said William H. Brandon Jr., president of the First National Bank of Phillips County in Helena, Ark. ''I don't think you can do in one meeting too much more than start a process.''
Some bankers said they would wait until their annual audit to see if the regulatory environment had changed before they would feel safe to lend more freely. Others said they would be able to pick up early signals from the industry's grapevine, from discussions with other bankers and from their experiences with examiners.
But in general they welcomed the encouragement to continue lending.
''The motive is a very positive one,'' said John R. Reed, chairman of Citicorp, who said that during the last week he had visited three dozen of the bank's largest real estate customers in California and Texas, and concluded that there was undoubtedly a slowdown in lending for large office buildings and housing. Those markets are ''relatively weak and will be for a while,'' he said.
The meeting Thursday put the directors of the American Bankers Association together with Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Robert L. Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency. The session underscored the basic and somewhat divergent concerns of the regulators.
 
Comptroller Under Fire
 For Mr. Clarke, the meeting was intended as a show of unanimity among the three regulatory agencies. He and his staff of examiners have come under intense criticism in recent months, first for being overly lax in their supervision of lending practices in New England, and then, after the troubles of the Bank of New England, for clamping down so hard that even viable small businesses in New England have not been able to get loans.
Bankers say that once the problems with real estate lending in New England became evident, Mr. Clarke sent in examiners from Texas, who had just handled the failures of many of that state's biggest banks. Some bankers still refer to the Texas examiners as the Comptroller's storm troopers.
It is true that the evidence of examiners being tough is for the most part anecdotal and many banks say they welcome tough scrutiny of their books and lending practices. But officials of the bankers' group say that in just the last two months, representatives from 27 state associations have come to the group's Washington headquarters complaining that overly tough examiners are forcing banks to restrict credit.
The regulators themselves acknowledge that their examiners are being tougher, but they argue that in economically weak areas that is appropriate and to be expected.
 
Offering Reassurances
 Still, the criticism of Mr. Clarke -specifically that he was pursuing more restrictive policies than the Federal Reserve or the F.D.I.C. -prompted him to initiate the meeting, Government officials say. The idea was that the three regulators could tell bankers that there is fundamentally no difference in the way their agencies are examining banks.
The Fed's concerns, however, went beyond just the problem of tighter credit in some parts of the country. The central bank wanted to avoid any possibility that the growing publicity about a cutback on lending could develop into a full-blown credit squeeze and bring economic growth to a standstill.
While the Fed could itself lower interest rates in an effort to generate more lending activity by banks that would have been considered a much too drastic step at this point and would have far-reaching implications on other sectors of the economy. Fed officials say that raising and lowering interest rates is too blunt an instrument for solving problems in just one or a few economic sectors.
Thus, Mr. Greenspan engaged in his own form of understated jawboning, telling banks it was permissible for them to take risks, which is the essence of banking.
''The meeting was more than a banking-regulation issue to the Fed,'' said Edward L. Yingling, head of government relations at the bankers' group. ''I would read the meeting as saying not necessarily that they believe there is a credit crunch now; they would not tell you that even if they did believe it. But there must be some concern that down the line you could have a problem. And there has to be a concern about the current atmosphere that has been created.''
 
Some Benefits Seen
 Mr. Seidman said today in a telephone interview that he felt the meeting was beneficial, especially since the bankers seemed to agree that there was no widespread shortage of credit. And he predicted that the meeting could produce more lending.
''I would think it would push them a little in that direction, although most bankers will be making those decisions based on their own best judgment, and that is the way we like to have them do it,'' he said.
Still, banking experts predict it will be a while before small businesses, which have been hurt the most by tighter credit, will be getting a warm reception again from their local bankers.
''Bankers are not going to start backing off very quickly and not until they have a clear sense of what the examiners are going to do with their institutions,'' said Bert Ely, a financial consultant in Alexandria, Va. ''I think it is months before any overzealousness by examiners is going to work itself out of the system.''

HEADLINE: 'This City Is Sick of Violence': Dinkins's Address

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a transcript of Mayor David N. Dinkins's address, ''An Affirmation of Tolerance and Respect,'' at City Hall last night, as recorded by The New York Times:
 
 Thank you all. Thank you. First of all, let me thank you all for coming this evening on such short notice. I thank also the city's broadcast organizations for their ready acceptance of my request for this time to communicate with you. And to those who were unable to attend due to religious observances, I trust that my message will reach them through other means. For I know that all who share this city and who love this city are deeply committed to the cause for which we gather tonight.
Last year I spoke to you about a campaign to bring us together. It was a cause that touched a yearning deep inside each of us, to come together in an affirmation of respect - respect for ourselves, for each other and for this city that we call home. 
My friends, that campaign did not end last year. It was only just begun. Together we've tasted a tiny piece of the sweet substance called hope. Yet again and again we're confronted by the bitterness of hate.
So we're gathered tonight here at the seat of government, to reaffirm our commitment, to renew our mission, and to reassess and reassert a simple truth: All of us want to live our lives in peace and dignity - free to walk any street and shop in any store, at any time, in any neighborhood, without fear of force or violence.
 
'Never Lead by Dividing'
As I've said to you before, I am the Mayor of all of the people of New York. And my administration will never lead by dividing, by setting some of us against the rest of us, or by favoring one group over others.
At the same time, and in the same spirit, we will never allow any group or any person to turn to violence or the threat of violence, to intimidate others, no matter how legitimate their anger or frustration may be.
The most basic purpose of government is to protect public safety, to enforce the law amidst the chaos and confusion of urban life. That is a mission I am prepared to meet - and I will do whatever is necessary and whatever is right to maintain the public order and public safety.
Ours is a rule of law. And tonight as I speak, two groups of 12 people sit in Brooklyn deliberating upon whether the law should punish two young men for the killing of Yusuf Hawkins.
I cannot affect their decision; it must be made on the basis of the evidence presented in court and none other. And that process, the jury process, is still the fairest and best method of judging our fellow citizens that anyone has ever come up with in the history of humanity, regardless of the verdict in any particular case.
 
Bensonhurst 'A Painful Passage'
This trial has been a painful passage for our city. And there will be more. But one thing is for sure: No verdict can undo the damage that has been done on that devastating night last August. The hate that was unleashed upon Yusuf Hawkins can never be called back. The pain that ripped through his body, his family and the city can never be fully healed, and his sacrifice must never be forgotten.
The senseless death of Yusuf Hawkins was a hateful crime, and anger must not lead us to hate. This was a crime committed by individuals. All of Bensonhurst did not commit this crime; rather, a few people committed this crime in Bensonhurst. We must absolutely, categorically reject the despicable notion of group guilt. We abhor those who preach it, and we must be mindful that predictions of violence and anger tend to be self-fulfilling.
We must be on guard against such impulses and we must isolate them and condemn them.
 
'We Must Repress Our Rage'
When a lawyer, defending an accused person - no matter how unpopular - is assaulted on the courthouse steps, all of us have been assaulted, because our system of justice is the best guardian of civilized society.
Hopefully, those individuals responsible for the death of Yusuf Hawkins will feel the strong arm of the law. But whatever the outcome, as we have so many times over so many years, we must repress our - our rage, channel our energies and come together to make this tragedy transforming.
I've already seen far too much pain and far too much hate in my lifetime. This city is sick of violence. And we're aching, and we must heal the pain.
Most in this town don't have it easy. People work hard and scrape by. We love our families and we try to build a life of comfort and happiness. Housing costs too much. The environment seems unsafe. The daily pounding of the prospect of crime takes its insidious toll.
And we all know that despite all we're doing a lot of things aren't getting better. Crack and AIDS are tearing away at the very fabric of our city. The economy of the region and the nation is likely to get worse before it gets better.
 
Abandoned by Washington
And we have simply been abandoned by the national Government in Washington. That you ought to applaud. [Applause.] They have abandoned us, you know. Hopefully they will come back and reclaim us. Three hundred twenty-five to $500 billion to bail out savings and loans, and no money for housing and AIDS and drug wars and the like.
As such frustrations build and pressures mount, people are more likely to lash out. In tough times child abuse increases, alcohol abuse rises and the bonds of civility and decency fray.
Unfortunately some small-minded people prey upon these pressures, spreading a message not of unity but of division, and fixing the blame not on the social and economic challenges we share, but on those who are alien or different.
I challenge all of the people of the city to reject these calls to bigotry, because if the bigots succeed in spreading their poison, it's nobody's fault but our own.
Right now, each of you must look into your own hearts, in your own families. Look honestly at yourselves and your own communities and ask whether you can be swayed by prejudice and what you're doing about it. And no matter how much government can do, government cannot substitute for the content of our character.
Let us not permit the prejudice of a few in Flatbush, in Bensonhurst or anywhere else, to silence the good will of the rest of us.
 
'It's an Old Story'
It's an old story, a cycle of immigration and discrimination that's as old as this city itself.
In the mid-19th century, gangs of native New Yorkers attacked Irish immigrants right here at Broadway and Park Row.
Irish-Americans lashed out at African-Americans in the bloody draft riots of 1863, leaving many lynched at the same time as our nation fought to free them from slavery.
In the 1870's, the Chrystie Street Gang rampaged against Italians and Jews.
During the Depression, Jews were assaulted for advocating that this country intervene in Europe to fight the facists and save the Jews.
Historians tell us that no group of European Americans has been as battered and as bruised as Italians. And African-Americans have never been free of the fear of attack.
 
'Our Greatest Strength'
Our diversity is our greatest strength, but again today it threatens to become our greatest weakness. New times bring new Americans who become new targets. And recently, too much venom has been injected into the lives of some of our newest Americans: Asian-Americans, especially Korean-Americans.
This prejudice is by no means limited to one community or one conflict. Remember, not too many - not too many years ago, some members of a community were up in arms, defiantly protesting a Korean grocery in their neighborhood - on Park Avenue.
Some Korean-Americans new to the ways of their new world may mistakenly offend others or overreact to what they perceive as provocation, and my Commissioners of Human Rights and Consumer Affairs will be holding workshops for all retailers to learn about consumer rights.
But that's not at the heart of this recent wave of anti-Asian sentiment.
Vincent Chin, in Detroit, was a young Chinese-American who lived. And some beat him because - beat him to death, I might add - because they thought he was Japanese, because they felt their jobs were threatened by Japanese competition.
They weren't after Vincent Chin per se. They would have come after any Asian just as Yusuf Hawkins could have been any African-American who happened down the street that night.
I oppose all bigotry against anyone, anywhere. I abhor it. I denounce it and I'll do anything - anything right - I'll do anything right and anything effective to prevent it.
Yet sometimes, denunciation and confrontation are simply not solutions - they may make us feel better, or some other folks feel better - just to make a bad situation worse.
 
'There From the Beginning'
I have clearly stated my views about the conflict between African-Americans and Korean-American store owners on Church Avenue in Flatbush. I oppose any boycott based on race. I've instructed officials of my government to intervene and to facilitate settlement of this dispute. We've been there from the beginning, and this situation will be resolved. . . .
 
* * *
 But whatever happened in that incident did not warrant the sort of ongoing intimidation boycotts can be. Boycotts can be an appropriate and effective response. But this one is not, and the vast majority of the people in the community know it. They know it and they believe that it ought not go on. We cannot tolerate any boycott based on race.
And so tonight I say publicly what my representatives have said privately to all parties in this dispute: that I am personally prepared to mediate, to resolve this in a constructive, peaceful way.
I call upon all involved to set aside their intransigence, to come and to sit down to settle this, and to settle it now. My personal commitment is absolute. I will bear any burden, walk any mile, and I am confident that we will be able to settle the situation through mediation and conciliation.
But please understand, this is bigger than just one boycott in Brooklyn. We must recognize that individual incidents are not isolated, but interconnected - that we must work constantly to strengthen the fabric of our diverse people and solidify the bonds of our mosaic.
And we must recognize as well that the solution is not only rhetorical, not only a function of moral guidance but a fundamental rule of government -fundamental role of government. We must perform not just in the face of crisis and conflict but every day. . . .
 
* * *
 'Media, Too, Must Join In'
 The media, too, must join in. [Heavy applause.] Very good, terrific, terrific. I could not be more delighted with that response.
I mean the media's got to join in in many ways, among them with public service announcements and programming that fights bigotry by teaching tolerance. . . .
 
* * *
 The future of this city belongs to the children of this city - all of the children of this city. And whether they or their families come from Korea or Cambodia, from Haiti, Honduras or the Soviet Union, New York is again, as it always has been, a city of immigrants.
They - they come in droves, from Ireland and India, from Jamaica and Japan, from Ecuador and El Salvador, and up from the red clay hills of Georgia, the Mississippi Delta and the streets of Memphis and Mobile. We came to escape czars and dictators, hunger and deprivation. Our people - all of our people - share a common ancestry of oppression and a common aspiration to leave that history behind and to embrace the full promise of America.
The children of the oppressed must now turn to each other as allies and neighbors instead of turning on each other as enemies.
 
Life in a Little Boy's Eyes
Tonight - tonight one of those children, a boy whose family fled from Papa Doc's Haiti, lies in a bed at New York Hospital. He's a cute little kid, a tough little rascal named David Opont. And like the city in which he lives, young David is suffering. He's scarred, and he struggles to overcome the damage that anger has inflicted upon him.
When I visited him, I saw life in his eyes. Despite all he's seen, David's eyes are wide open, looking not behind him in fright, but ahead in the fond hope that he will heal and move on.
Let us tonight resolve to make his story our story. For Little David Opont, we can emerge from the flames of anger to face a future of health and happiness.
So let's emerge from our pain not bitter but proud; let us walk together towards the future, following our hopes and not our fears.
And David, when you get up out of your bed and you're back home with your family, we want you to live in a city at peace with itself. We're going to quit tearing ourselves apart and begin the long, hard work of sewing our city back together.
If you can struggle and survive, David, so can we. Your wounds will heal and so will ours. David, we're going to do it for you, buddy, and for all like you, because you are our future.
Thank you all. God bless you. And keep the faith.

HEADLINE: U.S. SHOWS DOUBTS ABOUT GORBACHEV AND FUTURE PACTS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
More than at any time since President Bush took office, a deep sense of uncertainty has settled over the Administration about President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's prospects for success and his ability to conclude the broad range of Soviet-American arms-control agreements sought by Washington.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d leaves for Moscow on Monday for a final round of negotiations with Soviet leaders that should determine whether the May 30 summit meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev will be a boon or a bust for Soviet-American relations.
Mr. Bush announced a new effort to help Eastern Europe today, saying he would try to export his ''thousand points of light'' through a new Citizens Democracy Corps to strengthen the emerging democracies. [Page 10.] Prepared for the Worst Administration officials still hope that major progress in arms control is possible, but they are prepared to come home empty-handed. 
A number of factors have left Administration officials wondering how much power or inclination Mr. Gorbachev has to conclude the far-reaching nuclear, conventional and chemical disarmament agreements that Washington hoped would be largely completed by the time of the summit meeting. Those factors include recent shifts in his relationship with his military establishment, the turmoil in the Baltic republics, the weakening of the Soviet economy and the possibility of a split at a scheduled July congress of the Soviet Communist Party.
Bush Administration officials are already trying to diminish expectations, apparently seeking to cushion the negative publicity if this week's trip goes badly, and to make any breakthroughs appear that much more dramatic.
 
U.S. Setting a Later Scenario
''It is not the end of the world if you don't conclude these agreements now,'' a top Administration policy maker said. ''If we don't do it at this summit, we will have plenty of other things to discuss. If these arms control agreements make sense for both sides, they will emerge at some point.''
Nevertheless, American officials are complaining about Mr. Gorbachev's ''foot dragging'' and asking themselves whether he will sign treaties that would force him to scrap 50 percent of his long-range nuclear weapons and 40,000 of his tanks, and reduce his chemical arsenal from 50,000 tons of poison gas to 500 tons.
''We have no real idea just how much pressure he is under,'' a senior Administration official said.
''For all of the glasnost and democratization and perestroika, we know as little today about high politics in the Soviet Union as we did in the Brezhnev regime. It is as opaque to us now as it was 10 years ago in terms of who is doing what to whom, who is cutting what deals, where the pressure is, the interpersonal dynamics of the top dozen leaders.''
The Bush foreign policy team began to have serious doubts about Mr. Gorbachev's intentions and room for maneuver after April's meeting in Washington. The Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, sought to reopen a number of key arms control issues that the American side thought had been resolved during Mr. Baker's previous visit to Moscow in February, and to introduce new issues that had not even been on the table before.
During the April meeting, State Department officials said, Mr. Shevardnadze clearly took a back seat to Soviet military officials in his delegation when arms control was discussed, and since then Mr. Gorbachev seems to have gone out of his way to behave in a conciliatory manner toward the army.
 
Promotion of General
He even promoted the Defense Minister, Gen. Dimitri T. Yazov, to the honorific rank of marshal after declaring four years ago that no one else would ever be elevated to such status.
Speaking of where the Soviets were in February on many of the important arms control issues and where they are today, a senior Administration official said: ''The Soviets are going to have to march back a long way, and we are going to have to spend a lot of time on these issues. I think that this trip will be an important bellwether of the extent of the constraints on Gorbachev.''
Administration officials say that the American intelligence agencies and Government experts on the Soviet Union have at least four different explanations of Mr. Gorbachev's recent behavior, and they hope that this trip will help them determine which is correct.
The first explanation, a senior official said, ''is that the military complained that they were being excluded from the arms control negotiations and that the civilians had made a bad deal.''
''So Gorbachev said to them, 'You think you are so smart, you run the deal,' '' he said.
The army negotiators, however, were unable to get the American side to accept their demands. Since then, Mr. Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze have been quietly exchanging proposals through diplomatic channels and during one brief encounter last week in Bonn on how to overcome the main arms control disputes still outstanding.
 
Problems That Remain
Administration officials are eager to see whether Mr. Shevardnadze will have regained his lead position when they resume the formal talks in Moscow next week.
These remaining disputes are over how to limit air and sea-launched nuclear cruise missiles and long-range bombers covered by the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty; how to limit conventional fighter-bombers covered by the pending conventional arms reduction treaty in Vienna, and whether the United and States and the Soviet Union should be allowed to keep small stockpiles of chemical weapons even after the signing of an international treaty banning poison gas.
The second explanation of Soviet conduct, the senior official said, is that Mr. Gorbachev ''sees the nationalities problem exploding and the very real possibility of significant domestic unrest - strikes and so forth in the next few months. He sees just how much he is going to need the army. So he promotes Yazov to a marshal, makes several nice speeches about the military.''
By this analysis, the official added, Mr. Gorbachev has concluded that with the increasing prospect of domestic turmoil, ''it is more important to know that when he beckons the army will come than it is to ice a deal with George Bush.''
 
The Disruption Theory
A third explanation, the official said, is that the Soviet governing system is in such a state of flux - with the Communist Party weakening and new, but still undefined, power centers emerging - that all forms of authority other than Mr. Gorbachev himself have been frayed. In this analysis, Mr. Gorbachev is being inundated with thousands of small decisions every day, and may simply have not had the time or energy to focus on the arms control agenda, and will now.
A fourth explanation, another official said, is that ''everyone is over-psychoanalyzing Gorbachev and building far more complex theories about what is going on than is reality.''
The reality, he added, is that ''this is the end game in the arms control negotiations and there is always tense jockeying over the final compromises. The military has always had a strong influence in Soviet arms control policy. That is nothing new.'' As a Soviet affairs expert at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stephen M. Meyer, argued in a recent article, ''We have become too used to an overly compliant Gorbachev regime, one that seemed prepared to fulfill our every wish.
 
The Wily Gorbachev Theory
''When at last we are confronted with Soviet policies we do not like, we hunt for dark forces that are gaining sway over the the forces of good. But we are only fooling ourselves. Mikhail Gorbachev is going to pursue policies that he believes to be in the best interests of his country - not ours.''
Proponents of this last theory say that Mr. Gorbachev may be trying to exploit Western concerns over his political health precisely to squeeze more out of Washington at the negotiating table.

HEADLINE: News Analysis;
Dinkins, the Volume Up In a Speech on Race, the Mayor Responds To Complaint That He Hadn't Said Enough

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
New Yorkers long used to a vocal white mayor some had blamed for racial tensions were suddenly grappling last week with a quiet new black mayor some blamed for not doing more to ease the turmoil.
Faced with a spate of disparate racially charged incidents, Mayor David N. Dinkins was also confronting a test of the very image that helped elect him as New York's first black mayor - that of a healer who could hold together the fractious city he calls a gorgeous mosaic. He set the challenge the day after a black teen-ager was shot to death in predominantly white Bensonhurst last August, saying, ''The tone and climate of this city does get set at City Hall.''
Now, with two juries weighing the Bensonhurst case and blacks boycotting two Korean-American groceries in Flatbush, Mr. Dinkins has been hearing conflicting advice as well as criticism. Former Mayor Edward I. Koch, the Brooklyn judge presiding over the grocery dispute and a range of others have questioned the tone Mr. Dinkins had set, saying he should have been more vocally and visibly involved. 
Implicit in much of the criticism was a suggestion that because of his reputation and his being black, Mr. Dinkins should have particular power to resolve disputes like the one between a manager and a black customer that led to the boycott of the groceries.
 
Confrontation vs. Concilitation
''I think it is true that some feel that any involvement that has as one of its components African-Americans, that I'm supposed to have some especial ability to sway,'' he said at one point last week. ''In this particular circumstance involving these particular people, my judgment at the moment is it would not assist'' to go to the store and cross the picket line.
''Some people think that confrontation is superior to conciliation,'' he said Thursday. ''I disagree.''
But also implicit in the criticism was an impatience with the Mayor, a sense that he may have swung so far toward conciliation as to have created the impression of inaction. ''Everybody for a long time would have been accustomed to precisely what Ed Koch said he would do,'' said Simon P. Gourdine, general counsel for the National Basketball Association's Players Association. ''That simply would have told people where Mayor Koch stood on the issue and that that's the choice he had made.
 
'A Different Style'
''We now have a different mayor with a different style,'' Mr. Gourdine said. ''People have elected this mayor saying we want the volume to be turned down, and so he's been turning the volume down and working behind the scenes, and now people are saying: 'Say something to us.' ''
He added: ''I think Mayor Dinkins has every desire and the will to conduct the healing process. But for anybody to think it can be done overnight, those people are naive.''
Responding to the clamor that he had turned the volume too low, the Mayor turned it up Friday night, making a televised appeal for racial unity and public order that was carried live from the City Council chamber on almost every commercial station in town.
''We gather tonight,'' he said, ''here at the seat of government, to reaffirm our commitment, to renew our mission and to reassert a simple truth: All of us want to live out lives in peace and dignity, free to walk any street and shop in any store, at any time, in any neighborhood, without fear of force or violence.''
Mr. Dinkins said unequivocally that he was prepared to mediate the boycott personally and urged the parties ''to settle this, and to settle it now.''
Still, one of the Mayor's senior aides said after the speech: ''What comes next is what matters, and there's an issue at hand. We'll see if he can settle it.''
 
Praise From Koch
How best to do that remains uncertain. In the speech, Mr. Dinkins said he would press for a series of measures to stiffen penalities for hate crimes, foster tolerance, teach merchants about consumers' rights and help small businesses.
Mr. Koch praised the speech and said Mr. Dinkins ''has a more indirect style more acceptable to some people than mine, and I hope in this case it has greater success than a more direct one that some of us were urging.''
Mr. Koch's praise was all the more noteworthy since he and Mr. Dinkins had spent the week sparring over style.
 
'Anger Out There'
One of Mr. Dinkins's senior aides said of the Mayor on Friday: ''I think he thought that because he came in with a different tone, there'd be a lessening of anger. But there's a lot of anger out there.''
The adviser said one big problem was that quiet negotiations on the boycott led by Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch took too long. In a slow news week, amid the May television ratings sweeps, public attention to the dispute increased, newspapers editorialized about it and it became even more difficult to resolve.
The Mayor and his advisers also took pains to say that the ''particular people'' in the Flatbush case are not monolithic. The protesters come from two main groups, but even a lawyer who represents them in court says he cannot speak for them all. Moreover, Mr. Dinkins has been careful to suggest that both sides probably deserve some blame in what he sees as an understandable clash of cultures, races, economic power and expectations.
The dispute is particularly delicate for Mr. Dinkins because one of the boycott's original leaders is Robert C. (Sonny) Carson, a self-professed ''anti-white'' community organizer who once worked on Mr. Dinkins's mayoral campaign.
 
Carson Disavowed
Mr. Dinkins later disavowed Mr. Carson, who was convicted in 1974 of kidnapping a man he accused of stealing money and artifacts from a small Brooklyn museum. But his involvement and remarks haunted Mr. Dinkins's efforts. Some critics have suggested that Mr. Dinkins could end the boycott if he simply condemned Mr. Carson, and have implied that he has not done so out of fear of him.
The Mayor's aides say the reality is much more subtle, and involves Mr. Dinkins's instinctive reluctance to tell any people anywhere, especially the disparate groups of black citizens with whom he has built a delicate alliance in Brooklyn, whom their leaders should be.
Mr. Dinkins is quick to remind people that he has condemned blacks with whom he has differed in the past, principally the Rev. Louis Farrakhan. Several times last week the Mayor dismissed as irresponsible comments by the Rev. Al Sharpton suggesting that racial violence could follow anything less than a murder conviction of the Bensonhurst defendants.
Archibald R. Murray, executive director of the Legal Aid Society, said Mr. Dinkins had ''promised to bring the different elements of the city together, and I think he has been doing that by establishing a kind of atmosphere of caring.''
''But I think the public always wants more, no matter how much you give,'' Mr. Murray added. ''New Yorkers are just simply extraordinarily demanding people.''

HEADLINE: 60 New Members Elected to Academy of Sciences

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
The National Academy of Sciences, the 127-year-old private organization that advises the Government on science and technology, has elected 60 new members.
The election brings the Academy's membership to 1,601 scientists and engineers. Fifteen nonvoting foreign associates were also elected; their number is now 272.
Election to the Academy is considered one of the highest honors that can be accorded an American scientist or engineer. The society said the new members were elected ''in recognition of their distinguished and continuing achievements in original research.'' 
The Academy was chartered by Congress in 1863, in an act of incorporation signed by Abraham Lincoln.

HEADLINE: VIRGINIA GOVERNOR SEEKS DIVESTITURE

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORFOLK, Va., May 12

 BODY:
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder today ordered all Virginia state agencies and institutions to divest themselves of business investments in companies that are not ''substantively free'' of economic activity in South Africa.
State officials estimate that such holdings amount to more than $750 million. Much of the money was invested by the agency that pays pensions to retired state employees. 
Mr. Wilder said people should support the efforts of South African blacks to end apartheid with the same vigor and enthusiasm that they support freedom in China and Eastern Europe.
''If we are to participate in the extension to all peoples of the freedoms and liberties which we hold dear, we must take concrete actions which reflect our support,'' said Mr. Wilder, the first black ever elected governor of a state, in a commencement address at Norfolk State University, a predominantly black institution. ''The freedom sought in South Africa is no different from the freedom sought in East Germany, in Poland and in Lithuania.''
 
Similar Steps Elsewhere
About half the states, including a number in the South, have taken steps to divest themselves of South African economic interests in the past 10 years. Hundreds of cities, counties and colleges have also divested such assets. The aim is to put economic pressure on South Africa to disassemble its apartheid system of racial separation.
Proponents of divestiture say the economic pressure is beginning to show results. They cite South Africa's recent easing of some racial strictures and the release of Nelson Mandela from prison. They also point to the Pretoria Government's opening of talks with Mr. Mandela, the dominant figure in the struggle against apartheid, and other black leaders, with the goal of sharing power with blacks.
With the divestment order today, the Governor did more than take a human rights step of considerable significance in the state that was once the centerpiece of the old Confederacy.
The move was also expected to help Mr. Wilder fend off critics who charge that the middle-of-the-road economic and social stand that helped him win the governorship are beginning to have a harmful effect on the needy, particularly blacks.
 
Criticism From Jackson
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the two-time Democratic Presidential aspirant who has verbally sparred with Mr. Wilder in recent months, has suggested that what Mr. Wilder calls ''mainstream politics'' might well leave the poor and needy in a economic and social ''backwater,'' or even a ''cesspool.'' Some supporters see the clashes between the two men as a reflection of their rivalry to be regarded as the leading black politician in the country.
Mr. Wilder did not directly address those critics today in his commencement address. But he has insisted that ''mainstream politics are both economically sound and socially responsible.''
The Governor said in an interview shortly before he spoke that his order would undoubtedly bring him new criticism from many conservatives. ''But my order is the right thing to do, the moral thing to do,'' the Governor said.

HEADLINE: Two Oregons Collide in Race For Governor

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., May 10

 BODY:
Ever since Neil Goldschmidt, long considered one of the leading Democratic lights of the West, made a surprise announcement that he would not seek a second term as Governor of Oregon, the list of candidates to succeed him has been as varied as this state's scenery.
But the talk of the governor's race has been about something that will not appear on the primary ballot on Tuesday: the northern spotted owl, a small nocturnal bird whose existence experts say is threatened by logging, the state's leading industry.
Last month, a panel of Federal scientists recommended curtailing logging on Federal lands by about 30 percent to protect the owl. The move could cripple some of Oregon's struggling mill towns and put thousands of loggers out of work. 
But in an indication of just how much this growing state has changed in recent years, the proposal to protect the owl was hailed by the state's leading newspapers and is supported by at least half the people of Oregon, some polls show.
 
How to Reconcile Two Oregons
Trying to reconcile the two Oregons - one dependent on the traditional industry of cutting old trees, the other involving an environmentally concerned, mostly urban population - is the toughest task facing the next governor.
The leading contenders are Barbara Roberts, a Democrat who is Secretary of State and who is running unopposed in the primary, and David Frohnmayer, the State Attorney General, who is well ahead of six little-known rivals in the Republican primary.
The 49-year-old Mr. Goldschmidt has been a dominant force in Oregon politics for 20 years; he was Mayor of Portland at the age of 33 and Secretary of Transportation under President Jimmy Carter at 39. Even his closest advisers had expected him to seek re-election, and the state was shocked when he announced in February that he would not seek a second term, explaining that his marriage was breaking up and that he wanted to devote time to his personal life.
During Mr. Goldschmidt's time in office, Oregon has emerged from a long recession associated with the timber industry and has further developed other segments of its economy through international trade, tourism, agriculture and hundreds of new businesses, most of them high-tech. The state has also become a haven for people who have fled the urban woes of California for the Northwest.
 
Significant Changes
Oregon, Washington and Idaho were among the nation's top five states in job growth over the last two years. As the population has increased to slightly less than 3 million from 2.6 million in the past five years, the political makeup has also changed.
''Californians aren't moving here because they want to cut down trees,'' said Paddy McGuire, executive director of the state's Democratic Party. ''They're moving here because they want to live by them.''
The 49-year-old Mr. Frohnmayer, whose brother John is chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, had announced plans to run for governor before Mr. Goldschmidt bowed out.
A Harvard graduate, Rhodes scholar at Oxford and former law professor at the University of Oregon, Mr. Frohnmayer calls himself ''a Republican moderate who defies ideological labels.'' A father of five he has attracted criticism from the right wing of his party in Oregon by supporting abortion rights.
He says the spotted owl recommendation, if carried out, would be ''catastrophic'' for Oregon. When he proposed further study of the issue, Ms. Roberts responded, ''The patient is bleeding to death and Dave wants to get a second opinion.''
 
'Restore One Oregon'
Although one-sixth of Mr. Frohnmayer's recent campaign contributions came from the timber industry, he says he wants to be a bridge between environmentalists and loggers. In recent polls, he leads all other candidates by about 12 points.
''I want to restore one Oregon,'' he said.
Ms. Roberts, who is 53, is a fourth-generation Oregonian, known as an energetic and feisty campaigner. Mr. Frohnmayer plans to spend about $3 million on the race and may have twice as much money as Ms. Roberts, but she says her energy will carry her to the Governor's mansion.
She has accused Mr. Frohnmayer of pandering to fears about losing logging jobs. Referring to a recent loggers' rally in Portland, where spotted owls were hanged in effigy and fights broke out between timber workers and environmentalists, Ms. Roberts said: ''How is Dave Frohnmayer supposed to be a bridge when he took part in the biggest environmental-bashing rally I've seen in years? They worked those poor timber workers into a froth.''
She said the solution to the timber crunch was to get the mill towns to do more, like making furniture and finished wood products with the state's timber.
''I'm not talking about putting timber workers on welfare, but we have to face reality,'' she said. ''This is the fastest-growing region in the country.

HEADLINE: China Waits Anxiously for Ruling On Its Trade Status With the U.S.

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 11

 BODY:
A highly charged issue is looming in relations between the United States and China, and it has Chinese officials and intellectuals concerned over their future, their standard of living and their contacts with the West.
The issue is most-favored-nation trading status, and the concern is over whether the United States will renew favorable treatment on tariffs to China. By June 3, President Bush will make a recommendation to Congress for a vote, and Chinese officials and business executives are worried that Mr. Bush might not recommend renewal or that Congress would block it.
As a clear gesture of conciliation toward the United States, China announced Thursday that it had released 211 political prisoners, and had earlier lifted martial law in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, but diplomats reacted cautiously. They said it was not clear whether one or two actions would be enough to ease American indignation at political repression in China. 
 
Benefits of Trade Status
China, which exported about $12 billion worth of goods to the United States last year, has benefited enormously in the last decade from most-favored-nation status, which gives Chinese exports the same relatively low tariffs of 10 percent to 25 percent that the United States imposes on goods from most other countries. If the status were revoked, China would have to pay up to 90 percent duty on some items, mostly apparel, toys and electronics.
''If most favored nation is not renewed in June, and if Congress approves, then it could hurt both countries,'' Wei Mingyi, president of China International Trust and Investment Corporation, said in a recent interview. ''Trade between the two countries could be set back by 20 to 30 years.''
The issue comes a year and a half after China began an austerity plan that has left the economy virtually stagnant, with zero industrial growth in the first quarter this year compared to the same period last year. Inflation is down and growth rose slightly in April, but some Chinese and Western economists say it will be a tough task to stimulate the economy significantly again without bringing back inflation, which reached double digits in 1989.
 
Threat to China's Exports
From China's point of view, the threat to its exports could not come at a worse time. Revocation of most-favored-nation status could cut China's exports to the United States by about 50 percent in the first year, and more in the following years. This would mean a decline in China's exports of about $6 billion in the first year alone, amounting to about 11 percent of its total exports last year of $52.5 billion.
Trade between China and the United States has soared in recent years, and last year it rose by 43 percent over 1988 to $17.8 billion. But trade frictions between the two countries could rise regardless of whether most-favored-nation status is revoked, because of China's mounting trade surplus with the United States. In the first two months of this year, its trade surplus with the United States was $1.3 billion, or 79.2 percent higher than the surplus for the same period last year, according to statistics from the United States Department of Commerce.
At that rate, American economists estimate, China's trade surplus with the United States could reach $11 billion this year, possibly making it the country with the second highest trade surplus with the United States, after Japan.
A small minority of Chinese intellectuals interviewed say they are so disillusioned with the Government that they support revocation of most-favored-nation status, but the great majority appear to favor continuation of the trade benefits.
 
'Torn Over the Issue'
''We feel torn over the issue,'' a Chinese researcher said. ''On the one hand, we want the United States to punish the Chinese Government for what it did. But on the other hand, we know that such a punishment would affect our own personal lives, and frankly, we don't like the thought of having to endure the suffering.''
Most intellectuals say the Chinese Government would retaliate, probably at first by raising tariffs or restricting American imports, such as wheat and technology and equipment. But their anxieties go far beyond the impact on trade between the two countries. They say the Chinese Government would close its doors at least slightly to the world, restricting travel to America, cutting cultural exchanges and access to a wide range of Western things from books to fashions to ideas.
It is uncertain how the revocation of most-favored-nation status would affect Chinese politics. On the one hand, it would hurt the economy and perhaps increase the pressure within the leadership for the removal of Prime Minister Li Peng, who is in charge of the economy.
On the other hand, many Chinese say that the most likely outcome is that the hard-liners would seize the occasion to begin a campaign for self-reliance instead of openness, and encourage a new wave of anti-Americanism.
''It will deal a blow to the reformers,'' said a Chinese businessman. ''It will foster an anti-Western attitude.''

HEADLINE: Silver-Lined Defeats Worry Thatcher's Party

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 12

 BODY:
For Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, even bad news brings some respite these days.
Retail prices rose 9.4 percent over the 12 months that ended April 10, the Central Statistical Office reported on Friday. It was the highest rate of increase since the year that ended in May 1982. But since the figure was lower than the 10 percent forecast the previous day by the Bank of England, stock market prices rose on Friday, and the Government maintained that its anti-inflation policies were working. 
The Government has found other silver linings. Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party won only 27.9 percent of the vote in the nationwide elections for local councils on May 3. But it took majorities in several important London districts, which encouraged the Prime Minister to believe that her Government had finally turned the corner.
But victories like these have not ended an incipient revolt by Conservative members of the House of Commons against her leadership of the party, several members of Parliament said in interviews this week.
Backbench Conservative members of Parliament like Tony Marlow, who describes himself as a Thatcherite, and Barry Porter, also previously regarded as a loyalist, have been saying that it is time for her to make way for someone more popular.
''The Iron Lady might be susceptible to metal fatigue,'' Mr. Marlow wrote in The Independent newspaper recently. This week he said he saw no reason to reconsider his words after the mixed results in the local elections.
''Someone more popular'' is generally taken to mean Michael Heseltine, the former Defense Secretary who resigned from Mrs. Thatcher's Cabinet in 1986 after she refused to accept his advice to keep a British helicopter company in European hands rather than let an American company buy it. But as long as Mrs. Thatcher has shown a determination to brook no challenge to her leadership, Mr. Heseltine has not issued one.
Some people thought he had done so in an article on Thursday in the Times of London. In the column, Mr. Heseltine spelled out ways that the Government could modify one of Mrs. Thatcher's most unpopular measures, the per capita community charge on local government services known as the poll tax. The tax, which is set at the same rate for dukes and dustmen by local government councils, was generally viewed as the cause of the Government's poor showing in the recent vote.
Mr. Heseltine said he accepted the idea that everybody should pay a fair share of the costs of paving the streets and collecting the garbage, but argued that the tax should be modified so that the rich paid more than the poor.
Pressed on Thursday night on a television broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Heseltine backed off from an open challenge. ''I think Mrs. Thatcher will lead the party into the next election,'' he said. ''I think the Conservatives will win it. That is my position.''
That view is held more firmly at 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's office. One official there said that public opinion polls, which had shown the opposition Labor Party leading by more than 20 percent in recent months, had begun to register a shift in support to the Conservatives in April.
People close to Mrs. Thatcher said that she dismissed the opposition from Mr. Marlow and Mr. Porter as insignificant. A former minister suggested that her view was incorrect and that an open move to challenge her could be expected this summer, or by the autumn at the latest.
Mrs. Thatcher does not have to call an election until mid-1992, and her close aides say that she will wait for inflation and 15 percent interest rates to decline before she puts her fate to the country. Others speculate that her husband, Denis, now 75 years old, might prevail on her to bow out.
Both Conservative and Labor members of Parliament agree that public anger over the poll tax is fiercer than any discontent they have seen since Mrs. Thatcher first took office in 1979.
''The pressure to do something about it will continue,'' one Conservative legislator said. ''I've got to worry about keeping my own seat in the next election, not just getting her re-elected.''

HEADLINE: U.S. and Mexico Take Aim at Drug Chemicals

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 12

 BODY:
Spurred by a new American law aimed at crippling the ability of drug cartels to manufacture narcotics, the United States and Mexico are stepping up efforts to prevent thousands of tons of American-made chemicals needed to produce cocaine, heroin and other illegal drugs from flowing into Mexico.
In recent years, Mexico has emerged as a major transit point for the chemicals used by Colombian and other South American drug traffickers to transform coca paste into cocaine. The result is a flourishing chemical black market, in which the Colombian cartels, using dummy companies and multiple suppliers here, pay up to 10 times normal prices for crucial products like acetone and toluene. 
A Central Intelligence Agency study showed in 1988 that Mexico's imports of such ''precursor'' and ''essential'' chemicals increased 1,160 percent from 1983 to 1986 while Mexico's economy grew by 2.5 percent. The 1986 total, the report said, was 31,439 metric tons, compared with 7,924 tons for Colombia and 7,240 tons for Brazil, whose industrial base is twice Mexico's. A metric ton is 2,204.62 pounds.
The rise in Mexico's imports of these chemicals, which are normally used to make explosives, foam mattresses and cosmetics, coincides with strict controls on ether and acetone shipments imposed by Colombia and neighboring countries beginning in 1982 and with increased vigilance in the United States. Mexico has become the destination for about 30 percent of all exports of chemicals from the United States, including some 20 chemicals whose sale abroad is now regulated by a new law.
Under the law, formally known as the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988, American chemical companies must notify the United States Drug Enforcement Administration of regular foreign customers who purchase ''threshold'' amounts of the chemicals. If the D.E.A. determines there is reason to believe that the foreign company is diverting the chemicals to drug producers, it can order shipments suspended immediately.
The legislation went into effect on Nov. 1, 1989, and has been accompanied here by a parallel Mexican Government effort. Javier Coello Trejo, Mexico's Deputy Attorney General for the Investigation and Combat of Narcotics Trafficking, said agreement was reached at a meeting last year that the United States and Mexico needed to do more to halt the flow of chemicals and that the new law would provide a convenient mechanism.
''The manufacturers of these precursor chemicals are basically in Germany and the United States,'' Mr. Coello Trejo said in a recent interview. ''What we have to do is have a greater exchange of information and deeper investigation, without touching the legitimate companies.''
Mr. Coello Trejo said the focus of the effort here, with eventual D.E.A. participation, would be private companies.
Gene R. Haislip, head of the D.E.A.'s Office of Diversion in Washington, said in a telephone interview: ''There needs to be a more thorough liaison with the companies in Mexico who import or produce these chemicals. And by liaison I don't mean having a chat; I mean getting their lists of customers and investigating them.''
Officials of both countries said the chemical control effort has not been affected by tensions over the killing in Mexico in 1985 of a D.E.A. agent, Enrique Camarena.

HEADLINE: ART VIEW;
The Modern Charts Its Course Step by Step

BYLINE: by John Russell

 BODY:
For quite some time now, a nine-word-question - ''What will become of the Museum of Modern Art?'' - has been rumbling around the art world like a freight train overheard in the dark. Ever since the great first generation of the museum's founders, supporters, curators and miscellaneous adherents began to thin out, that question has been asked.
Since the arrival in the late summer of 1988 of Kirk Varnedoe as the museum's director of painting and sculpture in succession to William S. Rubin, it is on him, above all, that speculation has been fixed. Who he is, what he stands for, what he is likely to do - all have been put into question.
It is, of course, perfectly true that he, if anyone, now has the power to reorient the museum in whatever directions seem to him best. Any indication of what he has in mind is therefore of very great interest. 
If he has not been in a hurry to make his intentions known, it is doubtless in part because the monumental exhibition called ''Picasso and Braque: Pioneering Cubism'' for which Mr. Rubin was responsible was until lately on view at the museum. That exhibition cast a very long shadow - a revised version of it can be seen, by the way, at the Kunstmuseum in Basel, Switzerland, through the middle of June - and it could be seen as the apotheosis of the High Modernism with which the museum is associated. (By High Modernism, I mean an art of supremely high quality that existed in its own right, in purely esthetic terms, and was neither the adjunct nor the derivative of any ideology, whether political or religious.) It is conceivable that someone else could have originated that exhibition in some other place, but we are at liberty to doubt it. The alliance of Mr. Rubin's lifelong ruminations, intellectual stringency and powers of persuasion with the museum's strategic advantages would be very difficult to duplicate. The closure of that exhibition marked the end of an era that did honor to the notion of the American museum as a center of pure scholarship and inspired reinterpretation.
The survey of European art from 1907 till 1940 in the painting and sculpture galleries on the second floor of the museum has been the sanctuary and prime exemplar of that same High Modernism ever since the museum was reopened in 1985. In that context, Matisse, Picasso and Miro are the museum's longtime favorites. Others much to the fore include Mondrian and De Chirico, Leger and Brancusi, Braque and Malevich, Duchamp and Klee and the young Dali.
Order and reason, limpidity and proportion are paramount. Heroes are present. Villains are not. If any of the artists in question ever had a dry or a dull period, they have them offstage. This is a stage on which no one goofs. Visitors leave convinced that this was a period in which all went well. They also leave convinced that within the walls of the Museum of Modern Art all can be seen to have gone well.
This corresponds to the stately, Eurocentric world view with which the museum opened its door in 1929. It was with Cezanne, Gauguin, Seurat and van Gogh that it greeted its first visitors, and it is with those same four painters that it greets them today. From them, all else is believed to have followed. In that matter, it has always been taken for granted in the Museum of Modern Art that the museum got its priorities right from the start and has no reason to change them.
In recent years, the tenets, and even the very existence, of High Modernism have been under attack. High art has come to be regarded by many students and scholars as something that inevitably and ineluctably has social, historical, political or spiritual origins. Not to realize that Monet's paintings of poplars and grain stacks were prompted by the state of the French economy and that Mondrian had throughout his life a theosophical orientation was thought, in their view, to have missed out on something of fundamental importance.
Given the climate of the times, and given the fact that a new man - any new man - could turn out to be an enemy within the gates of the museum, anxiety might have been widespread. Even the title of Mr. Varnedoe's first major exhibition, ''High and Low: Modern Art and Popular Culture,'' which will open Oct. 7 at the museum, reads as a challenge to those who feel that high art should be spared any such contamination. But it is Mr. Varnedoe's special gift that, although he can look at 20th-century art of all kinds and all periods in a new way, he does not feel obliged at the same time to trash the old ways.
There is among the new acquisitions at the museum which Mr. Varnedoe views with special enthusiasm a recent and very large painting of two shoes by Elizabeth Murray called ''Dis Pair.'' The shoes are those of a very young person, but the monumentality of their treatment lifts the image clear of the nursery, These are heroic shoes, with elements almost of fortress and turret. They are also shoes that double, almost, as human beings who seem to stalk one another, not quite embracing but quite possibly with that in mind.
Between heroism and domesticity, the scales are nicely balanced. Between abstraction and a distilled and heightened figuration, the dialogue is one between equals. To lead a double life of that sort was for many years to be excluded from the modernist canon. But Elizabeth Murray is one of the artists who have proved that that particular taboo has had its day. That Mr. Varnedoe should stand behind this painting has a topical importance - as do, for that matter, any number of the recent drawings acquisitions that can be seen in the drawings galleries. John Elderfield, who is in charge of drawings at the museum, is himself no mean champion of High Modernism, but his current show of ''Drawings From the 80's'' is completely ecumenical in tone.
In any case, we shall by the end of this year have a much clearer idea of what Mr. Varnedoe may have in mind for the Museum of Modern Art with ''High and Low: Modern Art and Popular Culture.'' Meanwhile, we can walk into the bookstores almost any day now and come out with his new book, which is called ''A Fine Disregard: What Makes Modern Art Modern'' and is published by Harry N. Abrams.
It is not for me to pre-empt either the content or the impact of ''A Fine Disregard.'' But the title happens to be fundamental to his spring-heeled, inquisitive and trenchant views on modern art. The specific ''fine disregard'' of which he writes was not demonstrated by this artist or that, but by a young Englishman called William Webb Ellis.
On the playing fields of Rugby School, in the year 1823, William Webb Ellis was playing what is called in England association football, or soccer. Fired by what the stone plaque at the school calls ''a fine disregard'' for the rules of the game as they then existed, he decided that there were better things to do with the ball than kick it around. Forthwith, he picked it up in his arms and ran with it. From this glad aberrancy was born the game of ''rugger,'' which in its pure form flourishes in England to this day.
Mr. Varnedoe tells this story with evident enjoyment, and he writes as someone who has actually made a pilgrimage to the primal scene. Not only that, but the first two illustrations in his book are, first, of the field in question and, second, of the plaque that commemorates Ellis's inspired departure from the rules.
It could be no more than a fragment of autobiography. But it is Mr. Varnedoe's contention that the makers of modern art were men and women who, in effect, picked up the ball and ran with it, while all around them were still stuck with kicking it. The book begins with William Webb Ellis, and it also ends with him. Of the makers of the art we call ''modern,'' Mr. Varnedoe says that ''they echo what Ellis demonstrated in 1823: that if you want to do something really important, the answer is not over the horizon. It is often right under your nose, lying right at your feet. And what the modern tradition says is that you do not get anywhere by kicking that around. You pick it up and run with it.''
As he sees it, there was in the great achievements of modern art an element not of literally high-flown ambition but of ''transforming the world by using what lay at hand.'' Kirk Varnedoe beyond a doubt will bring the Museum of Modern Art into a new climate of interpretation that will have been nurtured in part by himself. But this is not to say that existing sources of wonder will be rejected.
It has long been known, for instance, that at the time when they were working very closely together Picasso and Braque used to call one another Wilbur and Orville, after the brothers Wright whose inventions were all the rage at the time. This has often and rightly been linked to the use in a Picasso of 1912 of the slogan, ''Our Future Is in the Air.''
But Mr. Varnedoe suggests that ''what they found thrilling about the Wright brothers had nothing to do with the view their airplane offered from overhead. The truly astonishing thing was that two mechanics from Dayton, Ohio, had solved a problem that had beaten Leonardo da Vinci. A challenge that had fascinated man since before mythology had been licked by two tinkerers who put their machine together using bicycle parts.'' What Picasso and Braque were doing in 1912 was, of course, precisely the same. When they made great art, it was with the leavings of the cafe table and yesterday's newsprint. The fact that Kirk Varnedoe can take the parallel between Picasso and Braque and Orville and Wilbur and make something new of it shows that he too can pick up the ball and run with it. The spirit of 1823 on the playing fields of Rugby School is still in being. Long may it live!

HEADLINE: Buying the Right to Pollute

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Barry Commoner is right (''Free Markets Can't Control Pollution,'' April 15). You cannot reduce pollution by selling the right to pollute. But he is only half right. The free-market solution doesn't involve selling pollution permits, rather it lets polluters buy off-site pollution reduction. It allows those polluters who can cut back most cheaply to do so first and most. This allows those polluters whose task is most expensive to buy pollution reduction from the low-cost pollution reducer. That will save jobs, keep costs down, raise capital for further pollution reduction and avoid the kind of coercion contrary to the spirit of our democracy.
Mr. Commoner is clear and forthright about the costs of continued pollution, which are unbearably high. But he fails to consider the gargantuan cost of totally retooling every aspect of American life. It's a big expensive job that has to be done. Lets do it in a way that is least destructive to our way of life. Lets try to cut back on pollution at as low a social and economic cost as practical. We can leave the wastefully expensive ''solutions'' to the Pentagon.

A Bad Week for the Dollar

 BODY:
It was a bad week for the dollar. First, on Wednesday, it dropped sharply against the West German mark, the Swiss franc and other European currencies. Then on Friday, the other shoe fell, as the dollar plummeted against the Japanese yen. The dollar has been weak against the mark and most Europen currencies all year but strong against the yen. The move last week was triggered by a change in sentiment about interest rates in the United States. Until last week, the odds favored an increase in rates. Now the betting is for no change or maybe even a decrease. Friday's inflation report, showing a decline of three-tenths of 1 percent in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, just reinforced the belief that interest rates might actually decline.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Wall Street Is Celebrating Despite Tax Talk

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Nobody ever went broke underestimating the fiscal irresponsibility of American politicians.
That sentiment, with apologies to H. L. Mencken, summarized a prevalent Wall Street reaction to last week's new round of tax talk in Washington. With signs of economic weakness becoming more apparent, the betting among many traders is that the Government and the Federal Reserve are more likely to find ways to stimulate the economy than to restrain it by raising taxes or interest rates. 
The result was an old-fashioned buying stampede on Friday, after the Government put out the latest economic statistics, saying that retail sales were weak, especially for the durable goods where purchases can be deferred, and inflation was tame.
The Dow Jones industrial average, having risen steadily for a couple of weeks, shot up 63.07 points, to 2,801.58 that day, on the highest volume of 1990. That is less than nine points from the Dow's record high, set on Jan. 2, and is the best daily gain in a year. Smaller stocks rose less sharply, and are nowhere near their highs, but they rallied nonetheless.
The bond market led the way up for stocks, with the new 30-year Treasury bond yielding just 8.63 percent, down from the 8.84 percent it fetched at the auction just the day before, as the Treasury's quarterly refunding ended on a positive note.
Just how long this buoyant spirit will last may be another question. Only two weeks ago, bond rates were above 9 percent, stock prices were weak and most market seers thought those trends would continue. Now the opposite convictions prevail.
Proof that George Bush is serious about raising taxes could change that rosy outlook, which is why some traders took comfort from White House leaks that the whole effort was a move to trap the Democrats, followed by statements from Democrats that they were not wed to the idea of higher taxes.
While fiscal responsibility is always praised on Wall Street, raising taxes now would be likely to further slow the economy.Bond traders might like that, but it could instill recession fears in the stock market, fears that might not be offset even if there were the accompanying good news of a cut in capital gains taxes.
Economic weakness would, in another era, have been a reason to cut taxes. But having run huge deficits in good times, the Government now faces rapidly escalating deficits as the slow economy depresses tax revenues. The legacy of the Reagan era may be a Government that found it necessary to borrow and spend when the economy could have gotten along without the stimulus, only to cut back when business activity needs a boost.
But even without a tax increase, the dollar could prove to be the wild card that deflates market sentiment. Almost overlooked in the celebration Friday was the fact that the dollar was falling nearly as rapidly as stock and bond prices were rising. A Treasury bond now is worth fewer Japanese yen or Swiss francs than before the rally began May 4.

Leave the Stock Index Futures Alone

BYLINE: By WILLIAM P. ALBRECHT; William P. Albrecht is a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

 BODY:
In New York and Washington these days, there is a lot of grumbling about stock index futures. These are contracts to buy or sell the value of a stock index, like the Standard & Poor's 500, on a future date at a price established when the contract is entered into.
One argument in particular that has captured attention is that, at 10 percent, margins on these indexes are too low, causing turmoil in our markets. This argument is not new. After the stock market crash in October 1987, there was a great clamor to raise margins on stock index futures. Then, as the issues were analyzed, and as the market calmed down, pressure diminished. Now, the proposal has resurfaced The ostensible reason for raising margins keeps shifting. The proponents of higher margins started with concern over financial integrity, then shifted to volatility, and are now pushing the rather slippery notion of the need for harmonization. None of these arguments hold water. 
* Financial integrity. The purpose of margins on futures contracts is to protect the financial integrity of the market by insuring that both parties to a contract fulfill their obligations. This system works very well and no investor lost money due to default in the futures market in either October 1987 or October 1989.
* Volatility. To reduce volatility, we must reduce speculation in index futures by raising margins, proponents say. While this line of reasoning may sound plausible, neither economic theory nor the extensive statistical analysis conducted to date provide any support for the idea that index futures increase price volatility in the underlying cash market. In fact, they overwhelmingly indicate exactly the opposite: On Oct. 19, 1987, for example, the largest price declines occurred when index arbitrage volumes were at their lowest.
* Forced selling to meet margin calls. Even if stock index futures do not usually increase volatility, the proponents of higher margins claim they do in times of market stress. But if this were true, wouldn't we see a net close-out of futures positions on high-volatility days? In fact, on both Oct. 19, 1987, and Oct. 13, 1989, just the opposite was true - on balance, people were moving into stock index futures.
* Harmonization. Reason has taken its toll among some, and many proponents of higher margins no longer rely upon the volatility rationales. Instead, they push for higher margins in order to ''harmonize'' them, claiming that the link between the stock market and the stock index futures market requires that there be a link between margins on stocks and margins on index futures. Margins do not have to be the same, the argument runs, but they should be harmonized; strangely enough, this always means that stock index futures margins should be higher.
These critics argue that the difference between stock margins of 50 percent and those of stock index futures margins is inequitable. It is important to note, however, that the stock margins actually required of professionals are only about 20 to 25 percent. Thus, a more accurate comparison of margins is 25 percent to 10 percent. Wholly different margining systems have evolved in the futures and securities markets. The futures system provides for daily settlement of positions and continuous adjustment of margin levels to take into account market volatility. The system for margining stock transactions permits up to five days for settlement, and margin levels are not adjusted to account for market volatility. The fact that no one is suggesting that the futures margining systems be harmonized in these other respects suggests that something may be right with the existing system.
There really is no proven case for raising margins. Much of the support for this proposal comes from those in the securities industry who believe their financial woes would be cured by imposing higher costs on their competitors in the futures industry. Even if they are right about the cause of their problems (and I do not think they are), the solution is surely not to raise margins. All this will do is shift futures business overseas.

HEADLINE: Rouse's New Strategy: Mixed Use and 'Remerchandising'

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, Md.

 BODY:
Most of the time, Mathias J. DeVito is an even-tempered man. But lately, there is a surefire formula for getting a rise out of him: Repeat some of the things analysts are saying about the Rouse Company, the real estate development firm he has headed since 1979.
Suggest that Rouse, with a breakup value at least $10 a share higher than the $24-or-so price its stock is stuck at, is prime takeover material. Or that its new mixed-use project - hotels, office buildings and shopping centers in Phoenix - is a sure loser. Or that it does not know how to operate outside a narrow Northeast corridor.
To Mr. DeVito, a tanned, well-groomed man who looks far younger than his almost-60 years, all those speculations can be summed up in one word: ''Nonsense!'' To hear him tell it, Rouse is a national company whose skills extend readily into mixed-use projects and the only people thinking takeover are hopeful arbitragers. 
Still, there is one Wall Street concern that he cannot dismiss: The days of rampant growth for Rouse's specialty - regional malls and urban centers like Boston's Faneuil Hall - are over. ''It would be hard to find a major market that doesn't have sufficient retail space by now,'' Mr. DeVito conceded. So for the last three years Mr. DeVito has been rethinking Rouse's 50-year strategy of constantly building new malls. Now, he says, Rouse's growth will come from ''managing and remerchandising things that have already been built - by us or someone else.''
Indeed, Rouse already has begun sprucing up many of its older centers and fine-tuning their tenant mix to make sure they aren't trying to sell merchandise at upper-class prices in neighborhoods that have gone downhill. Rouse has a contract to manage Underground Atlanta, a festival center that, despite a past history of losses, is now thriving. And Rouse has acquired a portfolio of more than $1 billion in new properties, most of it through joint-venture agreements with the Cigna Corporation and the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association.
With the T.I.A.A., Rouse spent $500 million to acquire McCormick & Company's real estate subsidiary, which owns 90 office buildings and more than 500 acres of land. Rouse and the T.I.A.A. have also bought about a dozen shopping centers. Rouse and Cigna, meanwhile, have spent $250 million to buy three large centers, and have another $250 million earmarked to buy more.
In keeping with Rouse tradition, Rouse's partners are putting up most of the money. One reason: Rouse has always found heavy debt to be anathema. Part of it is just a management bent to shy away from overfinancing. But part of it also is fear of raising shareholder's ire.
''Any developer should think twice before taking on a lot of debt, but when you're a public company it is even more important to manage conservatively,'' said David L. Tripp, Rouse's director of investor relations.
That constraint has pluses as well as minuses, Mr. DeVito said. ''The public format forces us to marry risk-taking with strong financial controls,'' he said. ''And that protects us from the vices, the excesses of entrepreneurship.''
Marketplace realities may be enough to curb Melvin Simon & Associates, Ernest W. Hahn Inc., and many of Rouse's privately held competitors. ''Cost of funds is up, consumer spending is down, land is more expensive, so returns are going to be lower than they were five years ago,'' said Kevin E. Benson, chief executive officer of the Trizec Corporation, the huge Toronto real estate company that owns Ernest Hahn and a good chunk of Rouse.
Thus, analysts suspect most of Rouse's competitors will follow Rouse's example. ''The whole real estate business is evolving out of development and into acquisition, management and finance, and my sense is that Rouse is further along the curve than the rest,'' said Robert A. Frank, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons who recommends Rouse stock as a long-term buy.
For Rouse, more than for any of its competitors, shifting gears from building to managing requires a wrenching cultural change.
James W. Rouse founded the company in 1939, primarily to do mortgage banking. He took it public in 1957 in order to raise money to build shopping centers.
From the first, Mr. Rouse, an idealist cum businessman, wanted to help revitalize old cities. The way to do it, he felt, was to create large, clean shopping and entertainment centers that would lure people back to downtown areas. City officials loved the idea - and proved it with funding and tax abatements.
Rouse's first such festival center - or ''urban marketplace,'' Mr. DeVito's preferred term - was Faneuil Hall in Boston. It opened to applause in 1976, and was followed in 1980 by Baltimore's Harborplace. Rouse has 14 such centers now, the latest being Pioneer Place in Portland, Ore., as well as 54 large malls and seven smaller ones.
All of Rouse's projects are known for art shows, promotions and other local activities that bring people in to browse, perchance to buy. Although restaurants and clothing chains are the bread and butter of the shopping centers, Rouse goes after local merchants, too. A few years ago it put movable carts in some centers for local entrepreneurs to sell their wares. If their merchandise didn't sell, not much was lost; if it did, the seller usually opened a full store in the mall.
Rouse's retail tenants are a loyal lot. The Limited, for one, has more than 200 stores at Rouse centers. ''Rouse knows how to turnJU their centers into hubs of community activity and they are excellent marketers,'' said George R. Sappenfield, The Limited's director of real estate.
The chief executive of another large retailing chain, who requested anonymity, said: ''Too many developers worry exclusively about the financial stability of tenants, so you wind up with boring centers full of shoe stores. Rouse brings in offbeat tenants, and that makes their centers more interesting.''
Still, no one is certain that just because Rouse is good at running Eastern mega-malls, it will be successful at the projects it is trying now. ''What does Rouse know about mixed-use offices?'' Mr. Frank asks.
Burland B. East 3d, an analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc., has similar concerns. ''Till now, 90 percent of their business has been in the East,'' he said. ''Now they're in Phoenix, in Seattle. Take a fish out of its pond, you lose something.'' Indeed, there is good reason to believe that Rouse's old formulas may no longer work. Mr. Rouse, who left his company in 1979 to form a non-profit development concern, has been trying to draw stores and visitors to a new center in downtown Toledo. Neither group is particularly interested.
Some real estate experts say what ails Mr. Rouse in Toledo will ail Rouse Company centers in Phoenix and in New York. ''In Phoenix, like Toledo, the downtown isn't viewed negatively - it is just irrelevant,'' said David J. Habert, senior associate for the Project for Public Spaces Inc., which does research into the use of public spaces. ''And introducing yet another shopping experience in Manhattan is redundant,'' he said.
It is exactly this kind of pessimism that gets Mr. DeVito's dander up. He points to the Gallery, Rouse's wildly successful mixed-use building near Harborplace, which houses offices, a hotel, and an array of stores. ''How can anyone suggest we don't know how to run anything but malls?'' he asks.
He notes that Manhattan's South Street Seaport is in the red only because of huge cost overruns and delays when it was built, and that sales per square foot are brisk. He concedes that Rouse lost a major tenant for its Phoenix center when Merabank Savings and Loan, which was to occupy 42 percent of one of the office buildings, pulled out of the deal, but the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Merabank's parent, has taken the space.
Even the lackluster performance of Rouse's stock is due to perceptions beyond Rouse's control. The real estate bloodbath that has swept the country has been far worse in residential and office space than in retailing space. Still, ''every major bank with real estate exposure is taking nine figure writedowns in the past 12 months, with the result that trying to sell real estate stocks is like trying to sell cancer,'' said Mr. East.
Maybe so, but Rouse has one thing that could make shareholders take notice: Columbia, Md., a thriving city of some 73,000 people that Mr. Rouse conceived and built. His idea was that a new city, comprised of a series of small villages not centered around one big downtown, could avoid the problems that older cities have.
Columbia has done that, and admirably so. In fact, for the last few years, many of the profits that Rouse has shown have been from selling land in Columbia. Now Mr. DeVito has made Columbia the one exception to his manage-don't-build strategy. Rouse has all but stopped selling land in Columbia, and is instead hoping to develop it itself. ''Columbia is one of the few places left that is under-retailed,'' said Danice S. Taylor, a Rouse sales representative.
Stopping the land sales hit earnings badly. Although Rouse's 1989 revenues were $495 million, up from $461 million in 1988, net earnings were only $9.7 million, down from $20 million the year before.
Rouse insists that earnings from its operating retail properties, measured before depreciation and deferred taxes, are a better indication of its financial health. And indeed, those earnings have been growing at a compound rate of more than 17 percent for the last 10 years. Last year, they topped $60 million, up from $51 million in 1988.
With a few exceptions like New Orleans, where a stagnating economy has killed retail sales, Rouse's centers continue to do well. ''Gas lines, credit crunches - I haven't seen the economic scenario yet that has given them a punch in the nose,'' Mr. DeVito said. Robert C. Adler, an analyst with Goldman Sachs who recommends that his clients buy Rouse stock, offers a simple reason: ''A well-situated regional mall just cannot be duplicated,'' he said.
Whether Rouse's past successes can be, though, remains to be seen.
 
 
 
A RUN AT ROUSE SEEMS UNLIKELY
The kind of depressed earnings and share prices hitting Rouse right now should be strong attractants for takeover sharks. After all, Rouse's stock is selling at a good $10 a share below the company's breakup value, and Rouse has no poison pill.
But no one is expecting an imminent run at Rouse. The reason: The majority of Rouse's stock is in friendly hands.
Management and directors own about 15 percent of the company, with Rouse Chairman Mathias J. DeVito himself holding about 700,000 shares. The Trizec Corporation, the huge Canadian real estate developer, owns about 25 percent. Trizec must give Rouse six months' notice if it wants to increase its stake above 27.5 percent; Rouse, in turn, must give six months notice if it wants to put in a poison pill. Neither Mr. Mathias nor Kevin E. Benson, Trizec's chief executive, plan to change the status quo any time soon.
Another 20 percent of Rouse is owned by about a dozen large institutions, who fully understand the breakup value of the land and shopping centers that Rouse owns, and would be unlikely to tender their stock for anything below that value. ''Even if this company were put into play, it wouldn't wind up being a bargain for anyone,'' Mr. DeVito said.

Partying, the Fed's Way
 
Federal Reserve Board chairmen have never tired of repeating William McChesney Martin's definition of their role: ''To take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going.'' Now comes the current chairman, Alan Greenspan, to urge bankers to keep partying even without the punch bowl. He joined other top regulators on Thursday in asking bank executives to continue lending to sound customers, rather than strangle the economy with tight credit. ''The nature of banking is risk-taking,'' Mr. Greenspan reportedly said. ''And if you have zero loan losses, then you aren't doing your job.'' The bankers responded with complaints about the regulators' previous party-pooping: warnings about imprudent real estate loans; tougher restrictions on small-business loans; Federal auditors swarming over the bankers' books, forcing them to take losses. Neal Soss, chief economist at First Boston, says the Fed would rather have banks provide more credit than risk easing its own interest rates. ''A little bit of action on all the levers,'' he said, ''is probably better than relying too much on any one of them.'' 
 
 
Whichaway Was That?
 
Like an unruly hospital patient who sticks his thermometer into ice water one day, hot coffee the next, the economy has been sending conflicting signals. On Friday, it was reported that inflation and economic growth had cooled. Producer prices for April were off three-tenths of 1 percent; retail sales off six-tenths of 1 percent. A couple of weeks ago, the economy and prices appeared to be near boiling. ''We seem to be doing a complete about-face,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds. The worried relatives in this case are the traders who propelled rates on Treasury bonds past 9 percent early this month. Rejoicing at Friday's news, they sent rates down to about 8.66 percent as the stock market soared 63.07 points.
 
 
Tax, Here Comes Thy Sting
 
In the movies as in politics, the unpalatable or unwholesome seeks refuge in euphemism. Everyone knows what adult entertainment is, and soon everyone will know the meaning of budget talks to proceed, in the President's words, with ''no conditions.'' Conditions and preconditions ruling out tax increases dropped faster than Washington's cherry blossoms amid estimates last week of a 1991 budget deficit as high as $165 billion.
 
 
Uncle Sam's Sale Days
 
Anyone trying to sell a Houston house, a Miami hotel or a Denver condominium had better do it fast lest the Government dump similar properties next door. The Resolution Trust Corporation decided last week to allow markdowns on its $16 billion-plus inventory of real estate from troubled savings and loans. The sales have been going slowly, with delays costing taxpayers $250 million a month.
 
 
Rate Break for the Treasury
 
No credit-market calamities in the Treasury's quarterly auctions. The Government sold $31 billion in notes and bonds at rates higher than in February, but lower than market watchers had feared.
 
 
 
ECONOMY
 
 
Just Wait for Icahn's Act II USX X stays intact; Carl C. Icahn stays in touch. Mr. Icahn conceded last week that the company's stockholders had voted down his plan to get rid of the steel business but stay in the energy business. Mr. Icahn, the company's largest shareholder, said his scheme would make USX stock soar; the company's partisans said it would merely help a corporate raider cash in his stake at a huge profit. Bryan Jacoboski, an analyst at PaineWebber, says that USX might eventually compromise by selling some of the steel operation to the public without spinning it off entirely. One way or another, he said, the company will still have to reckon with Mr. Icahn. ''He's not going to disappear,'' Mr. Jacoboski said. ''There will definitely be another act.''
 
 
The Dime Has a New Chief
 
Remarkable how little attention Richard D. Parsons got last Monday for becoming the first black chief executive of a financial institution as large as the Dime Savings Bank of New York. But Mr. Parsons, 42, is just as happy: ''I don't like to blow that horn,'' he said. He would sooner speak of having been counsel to Nelson A. Rockefeller as both Governor of New York and Vice President, or his former partnership in a law firm that served the Dime, or his plans for expanding the Dime's size without expanding its risks. With $11.7 billion in assets, the Dime, is regarded as one of the healthiest savings and loans in the Northeast. It avoided lending to construction projects and leveraged buyouts, but some mortgage loans have soured. Look for the Dime to pursue more consumer business and more acquisitions.
 
 
The Mass Market Work Station
 
The work station - the heavy-duty desktop computer favored by scientists and engineers - is elbowing its way into the personal computer market. Price is key; Wall Street analysts said that Sun Microsystems Inc. plans to introduce a powerful model this week that will sell for $5,000, about the cost of some high-end personal computers but faster, with whiz-bang graphics. They expect the work station to be a hit with major corporations, whose quantity discounts will pull the price down to about $3,000. Mark D. Stahlman, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons, says that the company has attracted orders to install several extensive work station networks. He predicts that Sun will provide hardware for companies that might otherwise have bought personal computers. ''They are in a unique position to win large commercial bids,'' he said. Rivals - including Hewlett-Packard's Apollo division, which sells a less powerful work station for under $4,000 - say they are ready to match whatever Sun offers.
 
 
In Brief
 
Cats can be environmentally correct, too. Alpo Petfoods Inc. said last week that its cat food will contain only tuna caught with nets that don't snare dolphins as well.
 
*
 
The natin's largest coal company is the subject of a bidding war. Amax Inc. bid $1.25 billion for the Peabody Coal Company on Friday. Hanson P.L.C. of Britain, which owns 45 percent of Peabody, offered $725.6 million for the rest.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Ponying Up for the I.M.F.
 
The International Monetary Fund's agreement last week to add $60 billion to its loan pool looks as much like the start of a debate as the end. United States reluctance in three years of negotiations helped delay an agreement on higher fund contributions initially scheduled for completion in 1988. Several I.M.F. members say the new money will be inadequate to save third world nations from their staggering debts or convert Eastern Europe into a modern market economy. ''They've already been too niggardly in the amounts they've made available.'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics. The United States has agreed to consider increases in financing in 1993. If the talks take as long as the last round, they might best begin tomorrow.
 
 
Super-Concorde, Super Price
 
British Aerospace and the French Aerospatiale had hoped to sell 300 Concordes. They sold 13. On Wednesday, they came out with plans to build a plane that could fly twice as far with twice the passengers, and cost more than four times as much to develop. The original Concorde has fallen victim to the unforeseen. Much higher fuel prices made its flights economical only for European and Wall Street royalty; a short range kept it from linking Asia with other continents, and its noise kept it from flying from coast to coast in the United States. As for the super-Concorde, it would take super-long to develop - five years for research, eight for production and at least two for testing. Who can say that a $9 billion to $14 billion bet on what the world will be like in the year 2005 will turn out any better than the $2 billion bet on the situation in the 1970's?
 
 
Forget German Inflation, O.K.?
 
West German officials declared last week that fretting about any inflation resulting from reunification is verboten. Fie on the bond traders who have beaten down West German debt on fears of inflation. Even Karl Otto Pohl, president of the nation's central bank, has joined the pacification and soothing squad. A few months ago, he was positively alarmist, saying that rapid currency union with East Germany was sure to unleash new, inflationary demand for West German goods. Politicians rushed along the reunification process anyway. Last week, Mr. Pohl assured International Monetary Fund representatives that a common currency ''will not lead to unreasonable inflation pressures.'' Some economists are revising their views likewise, after discovering that the East Germans might have too little money to make any blessed difference.
 
 
Wyoming in New York
 
From Bauhaus to our house to the Ginza: Tom Wolfe, the writer, turned up in a panel discussion last week to compare New York, whose business culture he has written about exhaustively, with Tokyo, which he has just visited. He found Tokyo far more crowded but far cleaner. ''New York looks like Wyoming compared to Tokyo, and yet there is no litter,'' he said. ''I went to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and there was the same frenzy, but there was no paper on the floor. There were people who catch it before it hits the floor.'' But Kazuki Kasuya, a leading Japanese magazine editor, said his nation was eagerly absorbing New York's influence the way it once adopted Buddhism from China. ''New York has become the city of admiration,'' he said, where young Japanese dream of going ''to be recognized as world-class artists or businessmen.''

To the plaudits of securities analysts in New York last November, he declared that G.E. would purchase up to $10 billion worth of its own stock over the next five years, the single largest gesture of its kind in history. Buying the stock, Mr. Welch said, was a better way to generate value for shareholders than taking a ''wild swing'' on an acquisition or investing in new technology.
Wall Street apparently agrees. Mr. Welch has since been hailed as a tough-minded, results-oriented manager, and G.E. shares have climbed by more than 23 percent, to about $68, compared with the 3 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's 500. A company's stock price usually rises after a buyback because, with fewer shares in circulation, its earnings-per-share ratio is likely to improve. 
But many economists, scholars, executives and other experts on American industrial policy say that financial engineering of this sort is often indicative of short-term thinking and a lack of confidence. They say it is sapping the nation's global competitiveness.
Rather than buying stock, they say, chief executives like Mr. Welch should be investing in new products and processes to keep home-grown inventions from being wrested away by more efficient producers abroad. And they should be plowing money into leading-edge technologies and into basic research to develop products not even imagined today.
Otherwise, companies in Europe and Asia will surpass the United States, as they have done in consumer electronics, machine tools and semiconductors. And that could endanger America's wealth. ''If we are not willing to get to a long-term orientation, we are going to lose one strategic industry after another, and that has implications for our standard of living,'' said Representative Mel Levine, a Democrat from California.
Corporate America's preoccupation with quarterly results emerged as a serious irritation in the 1980's. But some experts believe the 90's may provide an opportunity for change. Hostile takeovers and ''junk bond'' financing, which drove companies to keep their stock prices aloft to avoid being a target of predators, have fallen out of favor. And institutional investors, politicians, economists and the industries themselves are stepping forward with their pet incentives for change.
But the remedies will need to be potent. Industrial America, some experts believe, has lost its vision and nerve. ''Deep down, there is a defeatist attitude in this country about manufacturing,'' said Andrew Grove, the president of Intel Inc., a world leader in computer chip manufacturing. ''Part of the justification process for investments includes figuring out how to compete with the Japanese. There have been few success stories.''
Perhaps nothing is more symptomatic of this malaise than the growing popularity of stock repurchases. ''The attitude is to throw up their hands,'' said Michael Borrus, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley. ''They figure, 'If I cannot compete, at least I can boost my stock price.' ''
But the buybacks, critics warn, hurt all companies by shrinking the pool of available capital. Shareholders who sell their stock after a buyback-induced price rise reinvest only about a third of the proceeds, estimated Fred Branfman, director of Rebuild America, a lobbying organization in Washington that advocates increased industrial investment.
''It is now clear that a lot is lost to consumption - to swimming pools and things like that,'' said Lester Thurow, dean of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachussets Institute of Technology.
What also disturbs some economists is that the practice is no longer just a novelty among the dozen or so companies the nation depends on to lead innovation. Among them are G.E., International Business Machines, the Ford Motor Company and General Motors - companies that by virtue of their size and brainpower are best equipped to do battle in the global war zone.
 
A Balancing Act
 To be sure, the leaders of these companies believe they are doing what is best for their businesses and shareholders - balancing short-term financial considerations against longer-term goals. Most say they are adequately financing research and development and spending enough on new plants and equipment.
It is difficult to compare investment levels from company to company. One may spend less than another on research, but may use those dollars more efficiently. And critics empathize with chief executives' philosophical balancing act.
But they wonder if the money companies are devoting to buybacks wouldn't be more wisely spent strengthening their businesses. When they examine particular buybacks, critics often speak of missed opportunities.
* G.E. might have pursued consumer electronics like television and other high-risk markets rather than withdrawing to concentrate on areas where competition is more limited.
* Instead of sinking more than $10 billion into a series of stock purchases, I.B.M. might have lunged more aggressively into the critical supercomputer segment or pursued the laptop computer market.
* To help shore up its shrinking market share, G.M. could have used the $2 billion it has spent on stock since 1987 to build cars with more distinctive designs.
* The Chrysler Corporation, which has spent $1.4 billion on stock since 1984, could have developed its own subcompact cars rather than buying them from Japan.
* Instead of spending what could approach $1 billion on stock, Honeywell Inc. might have stuck it out in the computer market and in semiconductor manufacturing.
* Apple Computer, which said in March that it would add five million shares to its repurchase program, lacks innovative new products.
Like G.E., these companies contend that the stock repurchases were the best available use for surplus cash. Each said their objective was to increase shareholder value by acting as a steady buyer for their shares.
Mr. Welch declined to be interviewed for this article. But discussing G.E.'s vitality, Joyce Hergenhan, vice president for public relations, asserted that the company has remained at the forefront of businesses in which it has chosen to compete. ''We are world leaders in medical imaging,'' she said. ''We are world leaders in gas turbines. We are world leaders in plastics. Do we have to be in Walkmen and panty hose as well?''
Clearly, companies have also been spooked by the corporate raiders. Chief executives have been forced to make shareholder returns their top priority over the last decade or risk an uninvited takeover. And for the United States, a company like G.E. is worth more whole than broken into pieces, sold to raise cash by a raider.
Indeed, stock buybacks and other defensive acts are ''an unfortunate corollary of the takeovers and mergers and financial manipulations of the last few years,'' said Ira Magaziner, a management consultant who counts G.E. among his clients.
Several academic researchers say that German and Japanese companies still eagerly invest in new technologies because they are managed by executives who are technically oriented rather than by financial engineers like those who came to power in America in the 80's. ''If you look around the world, the companies that innovate are run by people who are technically competent and who are excited by technology,'' said Richard Rumelt, an associate professor of business policy at the University of California at Los Angeles. ''Look at the early days in Silicon Valley. The people there measured themselves by their technology. When industry passes into the hands of people who are more interested in money than in innovation, it loses something important.''
Some say that to save money, some cost-conscious chief executives have encouraged their research departments to focus on projects most likely to pay off. It's just starting to affect research spending. According to the National Science Foundation, investment in research and development declined by nine-tenths of 1 percent last year, the first drop since 1975.
 
Bottom-line Orientation
 Jack Welch was educated as a scientist but made a name at G.E. for his relentless pursuit of the bottom line. Unlike many companies that have bought back stock, G.E.'s operating performance has been exemplary, with earnings increases in every quarter of the 80's.
Since he took over as chief executive in 1981, Mr. Welch has shed businesses that were not either dominant commercially, funded by the Pentagon or immune from international competition, like its NBC television network. Indeed, in announcing the buyback, Mr. Welch said G.E. is more interested in adding ''niches'' to existing enterprises, like jet engines, electric power turbines and medical electronic equipment, than in exploring new frontiers.
He said niches would give G.E. ''high barriers to entry'' by competitors, thereby enhancing profitability. ''No one will change the aircraft business overnight,'' he said. ''It is not like television or appliances. The environment won't spring any surprises on us.''
To build a fortress G.E., Mr. Welch sold all mass-market manufacturing lines, except large appliances and light bulbs. Gone are the small appliance and television units, fields dominated by the Japanese and Europeans, where G.E. said it had no hope of becoming No. 1 or No. 2, Mr. Welch's goal for all divisions.
But some say that criterion is misguided. Michael Porter, a Harvard Business School professor who specializes in the nature of competition, says market share is not a measure of a company's profitability. ''Look at B.M.W. and Mercedes-Benz,'' he said. ''They are not No. 1 or No. 2 by any measure, but they are among the most profitable in the industry.''
Others view G.E.'s exit from consumer electronics as a grave defeat for the United States. ''Consumer electronics is the driver at the cutting edge of technology,'' said Representative Don Ritter, a Republican from Pennsylvania.
Consumer electronics, after all, is considered an ideal market to hone design and manufacturing techniques. ''Strong competition in this industry provides a major impetus for the development of new design and manufacturing technologies,'' said Susan Walsh Sanderson, a professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., in a recent study on the outlook for manufacturing in this country. ''The same design and manufacturing techniques provide the basis for many other product lines, including computers, instrumentation and defense electronics.''
But the cutthroat competition in consumer electronics seems to petrify G.E. Discussing the pricing of its CAT scanners and other medical-imaging devices, Bobby J. Bowen, an executive of the company's medical systems groups, said recently, ''Thank God they are not consumer electronics, but low- and medium-end products come close to it.''
 
Distinguished Past
 G.E. has a reputation for technological success. At its laboratories in Schenectady, N.Y., Charles Steinmetz once explored the basic character of electricity and Irving Langmuir made discoveries in surface chemistry that won a Nobel Prize.
But the company's research is now directed toward its existing lines of business, and critics fear the strategy limits the possibilities of a major breakthrough. ''When it limits itself, when companies in Europe and Japan are not bound by the same limits, that has national implications,'' Mr. Magaziner said.
G.E. responds by noting that last year its researchers were granted 275 patents, more than any other year in its history. It says research and development spending in key technology businesses has increased 78 percent since 1984.
Of course, no one company can excel in all fields. And even its critics concede that G.E. is a world leader in such areas as aircraft jet engines and medical-imaging equipment.
Nevertheless, the company has walked away from some technologies being pursued feverishly in Europe and Japan. As the largest American manufacturer of locomotives, G.E. has evaluated the magnetic levitation technology for railroads, but decided not to proceed with the research, according to Walter L. Robb, senior vice president for corporate research and development. And the company dropped out of robotics research when the market softened.
''A new appliance for our major appliance division is more important than a new game,'' Mr. Robb said.
Equally troubling to economists is G.E.'s level of investment in research. Not counting the money from the Federal Government for research, G.E. spent only $1.3 billion, or about 2.4 percent of its revenues, on those efforts last year. That is well below the 3.2 percent national average for all companies in 1988, the latest year for which the National Science Foundation has figures.
According to Ms. Hergenhan, G.E.'s spending is below the industry average because large parts of the company, including its financing and broadcasting operations, do not conduct laboratory research. Taken as a percent of only its product sales, G.E.'s average, without Government contracts, is 3.3 percent.
G.E., however, spends less than many hard-charging Japanese companies. The Honda Motor Company, for instance, budgets 5 percent of anticipated sales each year, regardless of its profit level. The NEC Corporation, which is working on telephones that will do instantaneous language translation, sinks 7 percent of annual sales into the laboratory.
''It would be interesting to compare Jack Welch with Akio Morita,'' the chairman of the Sony Corporation, said Robert B. Cohen, an economist associated with the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. ''Morita is investing in the next generation of video chips, memories and the miniaturization of devices. If the Japanese have a breakthrough in something like magnetic levitation trains, we will be left in the dust.''
 
A MASS-MARKET SUCCESS
Motorola Inc. has taken its licks at the hands of the Japanese. But it has succeeded in mass markets from which other American companies have retreated by using imaginative research, rapid product introductions, a devotion to quality and the latest manufacturing methods.
Competition from Japanese companies drove Motorola out of the television and radio businesses. But the company has found new niche markets, like mobile communications, cellular telephones and pagers and specialized microchips, in which to compete. Its lightweight pagers are best sellers in Japan, outdoing such Japanese giants as NEC, Matsushita and Casio. Its pocket-size Microtac cellular telephone is lighter and smaller than anything else on the market, sending competitors abroad scrambling to match it.
This spring, Motorola, which spent about 8 percent of its sales on research last year, is scheduled to introduce a new wristwatch-style pager that will time-stamp incoming messages and store as many as eight of them. It is expected to be more convenient than anything offered by the Japanese.
''We have learned there are answers'' to manufacturing problems that have caused others to shift production overseas or abandon business segments, said Robert W. Galvin, Motorola's long-time chief executive. ''The technology of operations and manufacturing has revolutionized itself in America over the last 10 years.''
Motorola's attention to quality, in fact, won it the Federal Government's Baldridge Award for outstanding quality in 1988. To improve the components it buys, the company now insists that suppliers apply for the prize.
 
PUSHING FOR R.&D.
What would persuade companies to spend more on innovation and less on stock buybacks? One inducement may already be in place. Chief executives should be less inhibited about their spending now that corporate raiders appear to be weakening. But some say their fears would be allayed further if antitrust laws were tightened to restrict takeovers.
Others believe that loosening those laws to permit joint manufacturing consortiums would spark innovation by reducing costs.
Tax reform has always been a popular solution among industries. Some executives say companies that devote resources to technologies of national importance could be given credits.
A few blame Federal tax policy for encouraging a short-term orientation. ''Taxes are very important to a company like I.B.M. or G.E.,'' said George N. Hatsopoulos, a one-time M.I.T. professor who built the Thermo Electron Corporation into a $500-million-a-year company by emphasizing research. ''If their price/earnings ratio is low, they become interested in leveraging their company and buying back stock to raise it. Since interest on borrowed money is deductible, it does not cost very much. And you get an immediate return.''
Investments that yield increased dividends and capital gains are more expensive and time-consuming. ''Look at Eastern Europe,'' he said. ''Breaking in there may take 5 to 10 years and impact earnings now. The Japanese routinely do this; American companies cannot. That is why we are losing the war in international competition.''

HEADLINE: Market Sees That Junk Bonds Are, Well, Junk;
Venture Capital

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The Perils of Bashing Junk Bonds'' (editorial, May 1), you once again misjudge the situation. While Michael Milken may well be a ''financial genius,'' the fact remains that junk bonds are not the only source of capital for emerging companies.
The United States, Britain, Europe and Japan have huge venture capital pools available to emerging companies, and in some cases to start-ups. Traditionally the capital infusion takes the form of equity participation, although it may be structured as debt with warrants, or convertible (bond) debt. In addition you say that emerging companies should not look to banks, insurance companies, pension funds or Wall Street for capital. This is just incorrect and misleading. Almost all pension funds, insurance companies and banks have venture capital arms that are active in arranging capital for emerging companies and in some cases start-ups. As for Wall Street, the new-issue markets have traditionally been the source of new capital; most of this takes the form of equity, which it should, although the market has recently been in the doldrums. 
The one factor that makes junk bonds such a ''killer'' weapon is that interest is deductible to the issuer, thus making all citizens a party to the big gamble when companies choose to issue junk bonds for takeover operations. Why not advocate that companies be allowed to pay dividends before taxes? Then you would really see some capital formation.
I think you misunderstand the whole junk bond circus. While there may be a place for junk bond financing, as you argue, it is for economic reasons different from what you apparently believe. The destruction of the credit worthiness of dozens of large and small corporations by the issuing of ''junk'' to finance leveraged buyouts is a disgrace that should not be allowed to happen again.

HEADLINE: Market Sees That Junk Bonds Are, Well, Junk

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The Perils of Bashing Junk Bonds'' (editorial, May 1), you suggest that we not allow the conviction of Michael Milken to blind us to the good that junk bonds have done to promote economic growth. But however one comes out on that debate, we should at least start from an accurate factual base; the editorial ignored many facts and bent others.
In my view, the junk bond market is now comatose not because of the disappearance of Mr. Milken but rather because the marketplace has finally recognized that junk bonds are, well, junk. Contrary to the thrust of the editorial, junk bonds began innocently enough, but by the mid- 1980's were being used largely to finance takeovers in one way or another. Second, the quality of the bonds deteriorated sharply. By 1985 it was simply not the same reasonably good junk that had been sold, in much smaller quantities, at the beginning of the decade. 
There should be no disagreement about these facts. Drexel Burnham Lambert's own 1989 report on the high-yield market shows that only 17 percent of the dollar value of the junk bonds floated in 1988 were for internal growth or general refinancing. Seventy-one percent were either to finance or refinance acquisitions or leveraged buyouts. Of the remaining 12 percent, which were for recapitalizations, a substantial portion were probably takeover related.
Barrie A. Wigmore, a limited partner at Goldman Sachs, did a widely credited study of all registered junk bond offerings from 1980 to 1988. According to Mr. Wigmore, while only 11 percent of the dollar value of the offerings in 1980 were ''merger related,'' more than 75 percent were merger related in every year beginnng in 1985. Moreover, while the companies issuing these junk bonds were earning their interest charges almost twice over in the first three years of the decade, companies issuing new junk bonds in the years 1986-88 were, on average, earning less than 75 cents on the dollar of their interest charges. They were under water from day one. Worse yet, Mr. Wigmore found that the average volume of junk bonds in these later years was 25 times greater than it was in the year 1980, when the junk was still pretty good.
One thing further: MCI was not an upstart when it first turned to Drexel for financing. MCI s s using a spspected ovestment banking firm and would have continued to do so if Drexel had never appeared on the scene. The notion that emerging businesses can find financing only by issuing zero-coupon bonds and other paraphernalia is simply not correct. Let's have a vigorous debate, but let's also get the facts straight.

HEADLINE: Rewards of Public Service Are Growing

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN

DATELINE: GRANTS, N.M.

 BODY:
TO some, it seemed like business as usual: the nation's largest owner and operator of private prisons purchased 40 acres from a group of local officials, including a State Senator who was instrumental in persuading the Legislature to approve a contract with the company to build and operate a women's prison on the site.
The politicians purchased the land for $95 an acre in 1964 and sold it to the Corrections Corporation of America for $3,500 an acre in 1988. One local real estate agent said that land here sold for $250 to $1,500 an acre, while a local legislator not connected with the deal said that there had not been enough sales recently to put a value on the acreage.
Business people who deal with local government have long done favors, including financial ones, for local officials whose decisions can make or cost them millions. Nine decades have passed since George Washington Plunkitt, the turn-of-the century Tammany boss, coined the phrase ''honest graft,'' the legal use of one's contacts and influence for personal enrichment. His maxim: ''I seen my opportunities and I took 'em.'' 
 
Local Business
But while Plunkitt's smoke-filled rooms have gone the way of horse-drawn carriages and gas lamps, experts say that ''honest graft'' continues to thrive.
''Even though the focus on ethics and conflicts of interest and influence peddling is on Washington, the reality is that it is mainly in local communities where economics and politics come together so clearly,'' said Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution. ''That's been true for a very long time in a range of enterprises.''
For example, an expert on cable television franchises, who asked not to be identified, recalled, ''During the great cable franchising period, between 1976 and 1984, when more than 500 franchises were granted, if you wanted your application to be seriously considered you would be expected to give an equity share to the right people, coinciding very precisely with the principal contending political factions.''
Law firms often serve as a conduit to political power. Since the election in 1980 of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, his brother Armand's law firm has grown from a modest-sized practice to one of the largest and most influential on Long Island. The lawyer has used the Senator's staff to obtain information for a client about a $100 million Navy contract and has used the Senator's office to ask the Department of Housing and Urban Development to approve $5.9 million in grants for an upstate project represented by his brother's law firm. There have been no allegations that the transactions involved any illegality.
In some places, the trend toward privatization, and contracts with private companies that provide public services from waste removal to incarceration, means more opportunities for local officials.
The Corrections Corporation of America provides a case in point. The company owns or operates 17 prisons, jails and detention centers housing 5,000 Federal, state and local prisoners. It has given an array of benefits to local officials, and contracted with the companies of local officials for landscaping, extermination and moving services.
Peggy Wilson, the company's vice president for communication, confirmed all of those transactions, but said: ''Each of those instances has its own circumstances. None of it has to do with vote-buying.''
Although nobody claims that the dealings are illegal, critics contend that they end up compromising local officials' independent judgment. ''C.C.A. has a pattern of co-opting public officials who are responsible for deciding whether to privatize or not, and with whom,'' said Gordon Bonnyman, a staff attorney with Legal Services of Middle Tennessee who has opposed the company several times.
The company counters that local public officials and leading business people are often the same people. ''The politically active people in a community are the ones in business,'' said Nick Franklin, C.C.A.'s lobbyist and chief representative in New Mexico and a former Democratic state chairman.
The land purchased here was one of five sites considered by the company. The land was purchased from a group of local officials, including State Senator Joseph A. Fidel, a Democrat, who took an important role in persuading the Legislature to approve the prison contract.
''C.C.A. chose our site because of the availability of power, water, sewers and natural gas,'' said Mr. Fidel. ''This had nothing to do with my support for the prison. I wanted to bring jobs to this area.''
Stuart Butler, director of domestic and economic policy studies at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, acknowledged the temptations that privatization posed. ''That's just the way the world is, the way local government often works,'' Mr. Butler said.
The ''petty corruption'' in contracting ''is a symptom not of privatization but of local government,'' he said. ''The solution is not to end privatization but to have closer scrutiny of the bidding process. Everything should be more open.''

Catching Up With Change In Eastern Europe: First Steps and Second Thoughts

 BODY:
THE transformation of Eastern Europe is moving off the streets and into the political chambers, but the speed of change is still dizzying. As the emerging democracies seek their own identities, they are also trying to determine their places in a Europe whose Western powers are already faced with the challenges of creating a new community by 1992. Here, compiled from reports by New York Times correspondents, is a country-by-country update on the evolution.
 
Albania
This small Balkan country, probably the poorest in Europe, appears to be on the brink of emerging from a rigid Communist system in power for 45 years. In the past week, Albanian officials have announced that they will ease restrictions on foreign travel and allow some religious observances. 
The change is being carried out by President Ramiz Alia, a Communist who has decided that Albania cannot isolate itself any more. But in Albania, where Stalin is still revered and the highly educated leadership stands in stark contrast to workers who farm with hoe and shovel, there are still powerful obstacles to liberalization.
 
Bulgaria
Outside the Soviet Union and Albania, Bulgaria is the only country where a Communist Party - now renamed Socialist - is still in charge. In elections in June, the party faces its first real electoral battle in more than 40 years, squaring off against a coalition of 16 parties.
The former Communist Party has undertaken a series of reforms since the ouster last November of the longtime party boss, Todor Zhivkov, and the new leadership is allowing democratic rights to seep in.
Opposition parties claim their election message is blocked from reaching those areas outside Sofia where many conservative voters say they do not really see the need for more than one party. The opposition hopes revelations about postwar Communist atrocities will shock voters out of their complacency.
 
Germany
The drive to German reunification has settled into two overlapping tracks. Domestically, with local elections past, the overriding issue is monetary union, now scheduled for July. But East Germans are worried about the effect on their property values and pensions, and are concerned about unemployment once their dilapidated industries are cast into capitalist competition.
Externally, the opening ''two plus four'' meeting among the Germanys and the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France demonstrated that the talks to determine the shape of unification will be more like ''one plus five.'' The one will be the Soviet Union, looking for a continued role in Europe.
Despite all the barriers to unification, there is a growing sense that there is no alternative, and the sooner the better. Officials in Bonn are talking of all-German elections next year, or even this year.
 
Hungary
Having crossed the hurdle into democracy, Hungary now must make its economy conform to the laws of the market without creating turmoil. The Hungarian Democratic Forum, a center-right party that won last month's elections, has promised a controlled dismantling of the bloated state-owned sector. The new Prime Minister, Jozsef Antall, has pledged that his Government will speak out on behalf of Hungarians everywhere, making some of Hungary's neighbors nervous, but the Forum insists it is concerned only for the cultural and minority rights of Hungarians in Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.
In the first days of the newly elected parliament, the main opposition party called for Hungary's withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, but the Forum says it is not the time for abrupt changes in relations with the Soviet Union.
 
Poland
In Poland, the excitement of the revolution has been replaced by the more mundane details of making it work. Politically the most advanced of the emerging democracies, Poland is the first to see results from a free-market economy. Overtures to the West have been met with pledges of investment, prices are down and stores actually have goods on the shelves, but the push to close inefficient factories has led to unemployment and crime is up. The question of where Germany unification will leave Polish borders still causes uneasiness, despite assurances that nothing will change.
The ambitious program to create democracies at the local level culminates in elections later this month. But Solidarity is splitting into rival factions, and Lech Walesa, who may or may not be running for President, says the revolution is stagnating.
In neighboring Czechoslovakia, where national elections are coming up next month, the anger that was absent at the beginning of the revolution is showing up now as ethnic strife and petty squabbling that threatens the alliance that brought President Vaclav Havel to power.
 
Romania
Romania is having the rockiest transition to democracy. With one week left before the May 20 elections, some have doubts that this Balkan country of 23 million people will make it. Much of the political debate has taken place on the street, particularly in Bucharest, where crowds form at the first sound of a rhythmic chant. Violence has crept to the surface in the increasingly bitter confrontation between the ruling National Salvation Front and the two main opposition parties. The front's leader, Ion Iliescu, is the favorite to be elected president, but it may have to form a coalition government.
All the parties favor a gradual transition to a market economy, phasing out the giant factories that had been favored by the late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Romania has no debt at all, a distinction earned by depriving its citizens over many years but a factor in its favor as it searches for foreign investment.
 
Soviet Union
Mikhail S. Gorbachev hoped to set the pace for democratization in Europe, but instead he has fallen behind. The impression, probably stronger in the West than in Moscow, is that the nation is heading for a fall. Even with rank-and-file defections and local elections shrinking the Communist Party, the party still has considerable power, including an enduring patronage network comprising the only experienced managers in the country. Mr. Gorbachev has been building his own presidential power base, but at least for now, he needs the party to run things.
It is now sinking in that the Baltics, where Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are insisting on sovereignty, are a harbinger of the every-man-for-himself attitude that is likely to touch not only republics but also regions of coal miners and oil workers. The continuing collapse of the economy is an argument for a market economy, but that means unemployment and rising prices. Reformists gaining power in the cities see these places as potential laboratories for radical democracy, but for Mr. Gorbachev they are also a glaring reminder that he and his party do not have such a popular mandate.
As Mr. Gorbachev heads to the summit meeting with President Bush later this month, he has the United States on his side, even if those Soviet citizens who are increasingly disenchanted with his leadership are not.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Write Off Castro? The Odds Change

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
AS Communist dictatorships tottered and fell in Eastern Europe last year, a natural question was whether the 31-year-old Cuban regime of Fidel Castro would soon be next.
In a climate of heightened expectations, Florida's Governor created a commission to study the impact of the democratization of Cuba on his state. An influential Cuban-American lobby began planning a new constitution for the country, while supporters of much-disputed American television broadcasts to the island began to argue that uncensored news and images of life in the United States could tip the balance against Mr. Castro.
While these efforts are continuing, a more sober assessment of Cuba's future has emerged in recent weeks. The Soviet Union has made it clear that it has no plans to end or greatly disrupt its heavily subsidized trade with Cuba, and Mr. Castro has taken crafty propaganda advantage of the broadcasting scheme, exploiting the theme of United States interference in Cuban affairs. 
''I do not share the view here in Miami that this is something imminent, that Castro will soon be gone,'' said Lisandro Perez, chairman of the Cuban Studies Committee at Florida International University in Miami. ''He has got his basic apparatus in place, and I don't see the possibility of some sort of popular uprising.''
Many experts note that while May Day has never been a more somber occasion for Communists in Eastern Europe, in Havana as many as 800,000 people marched past Mr. Castro's reviewing stand in the Plaza of the Revolution, many of them shouting ''Viva Fidel!''
Translating such shows into deeply felt and sincere popular support is difficult in a tightly controlled society like Cuba, but students of the country believe that despite growing economic problems, the 63-year-old President's popularity remains high.
''People are talking about their frustrations: 'We have to work harder and the buses do not come and the lights go out at least once a week' - a lot of that kind of thing,'' said Wayne Smith, who heads the Cuban Studies program at Johns Hopkins University.
''But Castro reminds me a lot of Ronald Reagan,'' Mr. Smith said in an interview after he returned from a recent trip to Cuba. ''The same polls that would indicate that the American people had serious doubts about matters of policy would give Reagan a high personal approval rating. A lot of Cubans think the country's economic problems are not Castro's fault.''
 
Successes at Home
Many experts point to Cuba's recent successes in biotechnology, including the marketing of a hepatitis vaccine, and rapidly increasing trade with Latin America as signs that, with continued Soviet support, the Cuban economy could be resuscitated.
Indeed, many university students interviewed recently in Cuba blamed the political upheavals of Eastern Europe, more than their leader, for the country's growing shortages of food and other basic items.
Even many of those frustrated by the repetitiveness of the government's pronouncements and the restrictions on individual freedoms seemed prepared to wait out Mr. Castro's tenure, however long, before demanding radical change.
''He can't be any different than he is, and that is sort of sad, but he is our leader and we have reason to be proud of him,'' one student said. ''But after Fidel none of those around him have earned our respect. They will all have to go.'' On this point, however, there is much room for disagreement.
''I think that if Castro were to disappear suddenly, that is to say die naturally, there would be a great flowering of political debate,'' said Gillian Gunn, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. ''I don't think we would see the revolution self-destruct. There would be a great effort toward a show of national unity to discourage the U.S. from trying anything.''
''Then there would be a very profound and deep debate about some of the basic assumptions underlying the governmental system,'' she said. ''Maybe the whole society will decide it doesn't like socialism and wants to be like, say, Costa Rica. I personally don't think it will go that way - it would be more on the order of real disgust over the way the Cuban press is not a press, or questioning of the electoral system.''
Many experts say it would be a mistake to assume that hordes of Cubans are eagerly waiting to be liberated by returning exiles from the United States, where more than 1 million Cuban-Americans live.
 
Blacks Have Advanced
Carlos Moore, a Cuban-born sociologist, said that under Mr. Castro Cuba's blacks have materially benefited and slowly climbed the social ladder. At the same time, the country as a whole has become blacker because of the overwhelmingly white waves of emigration to the United States.
Blacks in particular, he said, would rally around Mr. Castro, or a successor regime, if it appeared that the financially powerful, predominantly white Cubans of Miami were a serious threat to their social position.
Mr. Perez of Florida International University said, ''Regrettably, the Cuban-American exile community sounds to many Cubans as if they represent the old order. A lot of people in Cuba benefited from the redistribution of the 1960's and 1970's and I don't believe they are going to welcome anything that reminds them of the past.''

HEADLINE: Decoding Bush's Signal On Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN his first 15 months in the White House, amassing his 70 percent popularity rating, President Bush never once suggested that prospects for the economy were anything but rosy, never mentioned that the budget deficit was a problem that would prove painful to solve and never even hinted that his campaign pledge of ''no new taxes'' was other than the guiding beacon of his Administration.
All that changed last Sunday night, when the President invited Congressional leaders to the living quarters at the White House and said he wanted to enter budget negotiations with ''no preconditions.'' The news that Mr. Bush was prepared at least to discuss higher taxes turned Washington politics, which had been unusually placid this year, into a caldron.
No one was sure what the President's intentions were. Many Republican legislators and candidates for election in November accused Mr. Bush of ceding the one issue, taxes, that separated them from Democrats. Some Democrats worried aloud that their leaders were walking into an ambush in which they would propose higher taxes and Mr. Bush would reject them out of hand. 
White House aides spoke with many voices, further muddying the situation. John H. Sununu, the chief of staff, told reporters that if the Democrats wanted to propose higher taxes, that was fine, but the President would veto them. Marlin Fitzwater, the press secretary, said the Sununu comment was ''crazy.'' But then Vice President Dan Quayle said, ''Sununu was just reflecting what the President's instincts are, what his stated policies are.''
Mr. Bush himself said nothing on the subject in public until Friday, when he insisted, ''There are no conditions, and that's the way it is.''
Did that mean that he is prepared to accept a tax increase in the negotiations that begin Tuesday? ''I'm not going to show you my hand,'' he said.
Mr. Bush called for the negotiations, his aides said, because his top economic advisers had finally conceded that only with serious belt-tightening could fiscal chaos be avoided. In January, the President sent Congress a budget with wildly optimistic assumptions about economic growth and interest rates. If those estimates had proved accurate, only $36 billion in spending cuts or revenue increases would have been required to bring the deficit to $64 billion in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, as required by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget balancing law. That might have been done without tax increases or reductions in spending for popular programs. But the President's initial budget offering was like a player heaving a mid-court basketball shot just before the buzzer. If the shot goes in, it wins the game. If it misses, the player is none the worse for trying.
Not surpirsingly, tax receipts have been lower than the Administration anticipated and interest rates on Government bonds have been higher, so the initial Bush budget proposal quickly became obsolete.
By last month, Richard G. Darman, Mr. Bush's budget director, was saying that at least $45 billion and possibly $60 billion in deficit-reduction measures would be needed to meet the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings target. Last week, he said the figure could go as high as $100 billion if annual outlays and income from the savings and loan bailout were counted. If the target is missed, across-the-board spending cuts will go into effect automatically in almost every Government program except for Social Security payments and welfare benefits. If it is missed by $60 billion, the result will be cuts as deep as 20 percent in some programs beginning in October.
''That means a breakdown in Government,'' an Administration official said. ''It means no inspectors to check the baggage at Kennedy Airport. It means no F.B.I. agents to investigate cases. It would be intolerable.'' The law forced small, hardly felt cuts this year, but nothing of the size that is now possible.
Mr. Bush needed negotiations for three other reasons. First, the savings and loan bailout, which could eventually cost tens and maybe hundreds of billions of dollars, was not contemplated when the budget balancing law was enacted, and the bailout process does not lend itself to the law's accounting procedures. Here's why: When the Government spends money to liquidate failed thrift institutions and pay off the depositors, that increases outlays. When it sells the assets of the seized institution, the proceeds are counted as income. But the liquidations and the sale of assets do not necessarily come in the same fiscal year, so some years the deficit might appear artificially high or low. Both the White House and Congress want to remove those transactions from the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings calculations, but to do so would require a change in the law.
The second factor involves the view of many in both parties that Social Security should also be removed from the budget law's calculations. But because Social Security receipts are so much higher now than expenditures, the deficit reduction required would have to be much higher if the retirement program were excluded. Thus the target would have to be adjusted, which would require rewriting the law.
The third factor is the military budget. The improved relations with the Soviet Union and developments in arms control negotiations have led even the highest military officials to acknowledge that Pentagon spending can be lower in the next fiscal year than the Administration anticipated in January. The House and Senate are prepared to vote sharp cutbacks, but the President does not want to give Congress complete control over the Pentagon budget.
From Mr. Bush's perspective, all this meant that negotiations with Congress were essential. But Democrats, who control Congress and are gun-shy from years of attacks on the tax issue, and were unwilling to come near the negotiating table as long as the President was publicly inflexible about taxes. So he said he would listen to talk about new taxes, although he never said he would accept them.
The prevailing view of Administration and Congressional budget experts is that about $25 billion in taxes, user fees and other revenue measures will probably be needed to close the budget gap. Mr. Bush would like to delay offering his plan for raising the money as long as possible. But the Democratic lawmakers, determined to have the President make the first move on taxes, will try to force Mr. Bush's hand. Like a poker player nervous about his opponent's propensity to bluff, Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, chairman of the Budget Committee, said the first question he would ask the President is, ''What's your proposal?''
Mr. Bush's proposal surely will not include a rise in income tax rates. If he offers any higher taxes at all, he will probably stick to new levies on alcohol, tobacco and, possibly, oil imports and gasoline. But if he remains determined to have a cut in the capital gains tax rate, he may have no choice but to accept a higher income tax rate for the group that would be the chief beneficiary of the capital gains tax cut - those who earn more than about $200,000 a year and who, because of a quirk in the tax code, now pay a lower rate on money they earn in excess of around $200,000 than do taxpayers with less income.
But all that is speculation, and the outcome of the negotiations may be months away. Both sides say they would have to agree on what deficit target they were shooting at and on what to do about the savings and loan and Social Security questions before addressing the substantitive issues of taxes and spending.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, offered this cautious note when asked whether Republicans could blame Democrats for any tax increase: ''It's premature to speculate on what might be in the agreement, and then to speculate on top of that speculation as to what someone might say about that speculative agreement.''

HEADLINE: A Rough-Hewn Maine Seaport

BYLINE: By JANE HOLTZ KAY; Jane Holtz Kay, author of ''Preserving New England'' (Pantheon), writes the Design Notebook column for The Times.

 BODY:
Portlanders have a homing instinct. Stay at a bed-and-breakfast and your host regales you with the tale of the descendant who came back to see how time had transformed the old family place into the Pomegranate Inn. Stand at the top of the plunging staircase at the Morse-Libby House, known today as Victoria Mansion, and its director recalls the Libby granddaughter's return to tell how ''Grandpa Libby'' struck fear in the hearts of youngsters who might venture down its historic slide. Tall tales and small: they underscore the intimacy of this urban landscape where history is biography.
Portland is at once historic and quixotic, banal and boutique-y. It is tinged by worldy Boston but tangibly Down East. Above all, though, the coastal city of southern Maine is that much-abused adjective: real. Its sense of place is as diverse as the assorted folk and assorted architecture at home in the four-season city. People who summer in the untamed state return to settle in its urban nexus. So do strangers and neighbors. Portland's settlers have always had this geographic and personal plurality. ''Many emigres (largely from Massachusetts) turned their attention to the place, which afterwards was known as the beautiful town by the sea,'' a city history recorded the settlement after the Revolution. 
Beautiful sea, briny sea, but most of all, working sea define the gritty 362-year-old city. The rough-hewn quality of the seaport - visible from the blue cranes of the Bath Iron Works on the eastern end of the waterfront to the scrap metal loading dock on the west - accounts for the city's honesty. ''Keep the Port in Portland,'' declares the slogan to keep the working waterfront. No candle-and-curio seaport, Portland retains, indeed flaunts, its salty origins as a functional, profitable part of daily life.
A balance between poverty and prosperity has insured the survival of the city's richly heterogeneous architecture. Surveying Congress Street, the long spine of the city, you are as likely to see a superscale cutout of a rose on the 1962 facade of Bernie's Fashions at No. 492 as the aged Flemish bricks of the 1785 Wadsworth Longfellow House at No. 487; the stern concrete of the 1979 Portland Library at No. 455 not far from the roseate commercial buildings of the late 1880's restored to gentrified perfection. You can find a Woolworth's or a shoe repair shop along with I. M. Pei's trendy Portland Museum of Art.
To those on a summer stopover, Portland is the Old Port Exchange. Tourists meander in the circle, or square, of the Old Port. From the rumpled waterfront of Commercial Street where the ferryboats plume out to Casco Bay's islands, visitors head inland, shopping along the axis of Exchange Street, the parallel Market and Temple Streets, and the cobbled side streets.
Since 1965, with the fixing up of the Thomas Clapp building on the corner of Exchange and Federal Streets, the Old Port has had its streetscape mended gradually, building by building. ''A collective process of the work of many individuals,'' Earle G. Shettleworth Jr., director of the Maine Historical Preservation Commission, described the restoration of the former commercial district. The ''for lease'' signs papering some windows record the stalled revival and economic downturn of New England, but Portland's architecture is delightful and its shops sprightly. The route along Exchange Street to City Hall offers a splendid walk and vista - past craft and cable-knit sweater shops, between the twin open spaces of Tommy's Park, with its mural and a parking lot (soon also to be a park), to the crest where John Carrere's and Thomas Hastings' formidable gray City Hall of 1909 looks down on this array of 19th-century architecture.
No New England city of Portland's size (65,000) boasts the range and quality of landmarks, and no New England city of any size, short of Boston, offers its ''kinetic textbook of architecture,'' in the words of the Maine author and attorney Philip Isaacson. The visitor can follow the four walking tours described in booklets issued by Greater Portland Landmarks, a private group. The organization's helpful maps will take you beyond the Old Port to Congress and State Streets and the Western Promenade; from old clapboard dwellings to ponderous Victorian mansions, from elegant churches to handsome business blocks.
Whether vernacular (the three-decker house, New England's blue-collar delight); high style (the Gothic J. J. Brown House at 387 Spring Street in the Western Promenade, moved from downtown for a Holiday Inn); madeover 19th-century wharf buildings (like the Thomas Block on Commercial Street), or postmodern (the Museum of Art, sloping to the context of the Greek Revival House behind) - whatever the moment in time, architectural buffs will find a sample of styles. And of time, places, and condition of the buildings, for good and ill: the blank windows of a former laundromat overlook the bronze sculpture of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow at the intersection of State and Congress Streets; the phantom letters of ''Salvation Army Industries'' still etched on a brick building look out over the refurbished Armory in the Old Port.
The most striking of Portland's historic houses, and a prime contender for New England's must-see mansion, is the Victoria Mansion on Danforth Street, built for Ruggles Sylvester Morse (1816-93). A Maine native, he returned to bring the public flamboyance of his New Orleans hotels to this private dwelling. His amazing Italianate brownstone house was in the vanguard in its day (1859) and remains so. Twin sinks in the master bedroom and an Oriental smoking room nearby are novelties; the striking staircase, painted murals, carved marble fireplaces, decorative details and spacious and opulent formal chambers are testimony to the longstanding esthetic of the client and his New Haven architect, Henry Austin.
The hero of Portland architecture is John Calvin Stevens. The buildings of his 60-year career from 1880 on dot the city and his handsome Shingle Style homes reflect the shipping and lumbering fortunes of their original owners. These grand residences can be traced on Bowdoin Street in the Western Promenade section, which still provides the close-to-city living that draws a new generation of the affluent. The city's broader architecture can be explored with the solid book, ''Portland'' (published by Greater Portland Landmarks; $19.90 at local bookstores), or just pick favorites while wandering the streets. For robust splendor, I'd choose the granite Custom House on Commercial Street; for a fantasia of ecclesiastical forms, the vivid St. Lawrence Congregational Church on Congress Street; for charm the clutch of Queen Anne brick houses tucked into the grassy slope of Western Promenade.
The clearest way to get your overall bearings is the classic way: by land and sea. And the best vantage point is the Munjoy Hill Observatory, 221 feet above the shore in a lively ethnic neighborhood on the Eastern Promenade. The visitor to the crowded waterfront misses one of the most entrancing aspects of Portland: a peninsula three miles long virtually swallowed by the sea. To survey the stunning topography of this complex and curving little city, drive to Munjoy Hill's observatory up Congress Street on the Eastern Promenade. When the flags are flying, the doughty wooden survivor of 1807 is open and offers a spectacular view as far as the White Mountains. Climb the breath-stealing staircase of this structure, tilting under the weight of its 183 years. Peer 360 degrees around at the wraparound waters of Portland harbor and the Back Cove, and you understand why water ruled this city for three centuries.
The view from the crest of the Observatory also lets you grasp the other memorable element of Portland's topography: its sandwiching between two greenswards, the Eastern and Western Promenades. A century ago the Olmsted brothers, landscape architects, took these promenades and the three other existing parks of the peninsula - Deering Oaks, the dilapidated Back Cove and the tiny Lincoln Park - and linked the chain into a plan. Like the Boston ''Emerald Necklace'' park system devised by the Olmsted firm, Portland's plan provided a place for play and turned the noxious waters of the Back Cove into Baxter Boulevard. Sometimes shabby and sometimes not quite realized, these oases remain, ready to respond to new environmental concerns, and like the city at large protected by a preservation ordinance that takes effect in August.
Stand on the green slopes of the Promenades, your back to the historic houses of the shore, your eyes to the sea. Visit the smaller parks, where yesterday and today coexist. And once again you have the sense of connections that still endure, the linkages in place in place and time that enrich Portland's historic - and genuine - urbanity.

HEADLINE: Four Inns at twohundredsomething;
New Hampshire: John Hancock never slept at this inn

BYLINE: By MARIALISA CALTA

 BODY:
The town of Hancock, nestled in the Monadnock region of southwestern New Hampshire - a part of the state that tourism boosters like to call the Currier & Ives corner - boasts 47 buildings on the National Register of Historic Places. One of them, the 10-room John Hancock Inn, is said to be the oldest continuously operating inn in the state.
A three-story clapboard building with white columns and narrow porch, the inn has been taking in guests since 1789, when it opened on a coach route connecting Boston and Montreal. The many additions reflect the changing architectural fashions of its tenure. The original building, for example, was designed in the Federal-Greek Revival style, while the mansard roof, added in 1875, is an example of French Second Empire. The portico is Colonial Revival. The inn never actually was host to John Hancock, the flamboyant signer of the Declaration of Independence for whom the town was named in 1779. He owned much of the land in this agrarian community, but never visited the town. But in its earlier years the inn was the setting for many gala parties, according to Gloria J. Neary, collection custodian for the Hancock Historical Society. According to Mrs. Neary, at least one elderly resident recalls horse-drawn sleighs parked end-to-end on Main Street as people gathered for a wintertime dance. The original ballroom, in which music was amplified by blown-glass sounding bottles concealed in the ceiling, has been divided into two bedrooms, and a second ballroom, converted into an apartment, serves as the private living quarters for the innkeepers, Pat and Glynn Wells, who purchased the inn in 1973, and their two children. 
The inn, situated on two acres of grounds, has entered the 90's as an unpretentious establishment, simply furnished with a mixture of early American and country Victorian antiques and reproductions. The bedrooms feature painted wood floors scattered with hooked and braided rugs, and comfortable beds, some with canopies, covered with jacquard spreads. Our double-bedded room was quiet, despite the inn's location by the side of the village's main road. The shallow, nonworking fireplaces and the old-fashioned wash basins found in several rooms lend a period atmosphere, but the heating is central and the bathrooms modern, with efficient plumbing. Each room has a private bath. The public rooms are air-conditioned in the summer. There is a television in a third-floor sitting area, and bookcases in the hall are stacked with books and board games.
One bedroom, appropriately known as the mural room, showcases a country scene painted in the early 1800's by Rufus Porter, an itinerant artist, and restored some 65 years ago. Fragments of a Porter mural can be found in the closet of another bedroom, and a chambermaid's closet contains stenciling done by Moses Eaton, a local artist of the same period. Eaton's designs have been reproduced in one of the inn's three dining rooms.
The inn's kitchen offers undistinguished food at moderate prices. Dinner offerings, billed on the menu as New England fare, include chicken turnovers, duck with black currant sauce, baked scrod, fettuccine primavera and sirloin with peppercorn sauce. The duck was fatty and bland, the sirloin acceptable. Pecan pie was good. There is a short wine list with several California selections. A dinner for two, including appetizers, entree, wine and desert, costs about $60. Breakfast for two runs about $12, though on our visit the French toast was limp and the sausage greasy. The service, on a recent visit, was friendly but not intrusive, and guests felt at ease lingering over their coffee and dessert long after other diners had left. The main dining room had nondescript decor and was badly lighted. Lunch is also served in the breakfast room and in the bar, a den-like room with large, working fireplace and tables made out of old wooden bellows.
For the gastronomically ambitious, Twelve Pine, a takeout shop at 1 Summer Street in nearby Peterboro, serves multi-ethnic dishes; a picnic lunch for two is $12.
The town of Hancock itself, with its many examples of 18th- and 19th-century architecture, demands leisurely examination. The bell of the Federal-style Congregational Church, manufactured by Paul Revere's sons, tolls hourly; ''a comforting sound,'' said Mrs. Neary, ''once you get used to it.'' The white clapboard schoolhouse still holds grades 1 through 4, and a former tavern houses the Hancock Historical Society, with its collection of early American tools and furniture. The collection is open on Wednesday and Saturday in July and August, but otherwise can be seen by appointment. The cemetery contains the 1826 grave of Jack Ware, a freed slave who told of being stolen from his African homeland by ''a white man in a fine buggy'' who carried him off ''like a hawk would a hen.''
The town's economy was revitalized in 1878 with the coming of the railroad, and by the early 1900's Hancock had become a popular summer retreat for Bostonians. Hancock has a classic town common, a library, a small market and two antique shops - one specializing in antique lighting and the other in crafts, furniture and the work of local artists.
Other area attractions include Norway Pond, a short walk from the inn, the nearby Harris Center for Conservation Education and the many seasonal activities such as foliage tours, swimming, hiking, canoeing and skiing. Cultural activities include theater and concerts in nearby communities. The region is also home to a burgeoning number of restaurants featuring French, Asian, new American and other cuisines.

HEADLINE: Beaufort, a Town That Rose Again

BYLINE: By CECILY MCMILLAN; Cecily McMillan owns a house on St. Helena Island, near Beaufort, S.C.

 BODY:
In March 1936 the photographer Walker Evans, who was documenting poverty in the South, found himself in Beaufort, S.C., facing an undeniably beautiful 18th-century frame house. The delicate carving around the door frame, the detailed corner moldings and elaborate cornices recalled an era of high style and craftsmanship.
But this day, its columned, two-story portico was worn bare of paint and patched with handmade signs advertising the businesses inside.
There was an art school, a fish market, a fruit and vegetable stand and a stenographer. Some faded lettering suggested former tenants. A sign declared, ''General Lafayette spoke from this porch 1824'' (actually, he spoke in 1825). Below it hung a bundle of spotted bananas. 
The picture Evans took in Beaufort that day, which is in the Library of Congress collections, showed a little town making do in a setting where the once-bright life of the Old South seemed all but snuffed out. Beaufort's past, tattered though it appeared, looked more substantial than its future.
Today the biggest sign on that house proclaims its name - the John Mark Verdier House - and its listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The paint doesn't dare peel. The commercial life has spread up and down Bay Street and along a half-dozen lateral streets. Colorful awnings shade the sidewalk, and wooden barrels planted with pansies, ivy and impatiens stand along the curbs.
Prosperity has come to Beaufort and has liberated it from just making do. Gone is the store that sold cigarettes for a nickel apiece; unheard of the old way of repainting the house - one side every couple of years. The ingenious economies of the cash-poor town have all but disappeared. They are not to be found in the groomed yards of the historic district, in the glossy bed-and-breakfast lodgings, in the modish boutiques or restaurants on the river.
But if prosperity has forced these habits out of service it has also memorialized them. Today Beaufort's ''poor but proud'' years, which lasted here and all over the South from Reconstruction to the end of World War II, have a place in its history, just as the antebellum years have theirs. Poverty, it turns out, was just another phase in the history of this small town.
Beaufort has been a small town for a long time. Spanish explorers came to the area 100 years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock. French, Scottish and English settlers followed, and by the time of the Revolution, Beaufort was a center of the scattered plantation world where slaves harvested rice, indigo and corn. By century's end, the newly invented cotton gin, the successful cultivation of long-staple cotton on the sea islands, and a growing slave population, contrived to launch Beaufort into its heyday - a 60-year spree of building, buying, expanding and high living that ran until about lunchtime on Nov. 7, 1861, when Union soldiers demolished the Confederate port defenses.
It is the legacy of these years, the architectural accomplishments they produced and the disastrous decline they precipitated, that impresses every visitor to Beaufort. As in Charleston, the buildings, the old houses and churches stand as they did, now restored, lived in, once again playing a central role in community life. And as common as morning dew is the small-town Southerner's pride in and preoccupation with history, with explaining Southern ways. In Beaufort, there's a story for every piazza - and probably someone nearby to tell it. The past not only informs the present, it seems to populate it.
If you want a thoughtful introduction to Beaufort's history, or to examine the roots of its style, the Historic Beaufort Foundation operates two house museums: the John Mark Verdier House (801 Bay Street) and the George Parsons Elliott House (1001 Bay Street). The Verdier House - the house Walker Evans photographed - was fully restored in 1976, to represent the apogee of Beaufort style. The Elliott House (circa 1844) is partially restored. The Arsenal Museum (713 Craven Street) housed in the pre-Civil War Gothic-style military building, offers an informal, eclectic view of life in old Beaufort by means of household objects, clothing, documents, natural history specimens and prehistoric Indian artifacts.
Downtown Beaufort is snugly clustered along the river, now a section of the Intracoastal Waterway, and it appears from a distance much as it did when plantation bateaux, cotton barges and steam-driven packets berthed at its wharves. A few miles distant the river enters Port Royal Sound, considered by navigators since the days of Christopher Columbus to be one of the most accommodating harbors on the southern coast. From the Bay Street bluff to the Atlantic Ocean lie hundreds of acres of unpolluted marsh and tidal estuaries, habitats for dozens of species of birds, fish and shellfish.
This proximity to the water, or as they say in Beaufort, to the ''weather,'' gave rise to a predominant style of architecture that had its roots in the plantation houses of Barbados. Many houses are set high on foundations made of brick or tabby, a mixture of sand, oyster shells and lime prepared by slaves. Some of these raised basements are arcaded, like the upstairs piazzas, to capture the prevailing southwest breeze. The effect is like a kite held aloft, suspended above the ever-present ballast of humid Lowcountry air.
The densest concentration of Federal, Georgian and Greek Revival period houses is to be found on The Point, Beaufort's old neighborhood to the east of Carteret Street. Here stand about five dozen historic houses of exceptional architectural quality, most of them built with cotton profits, many of them accompanied by elaborately landscaped, if not formal, gardens.
Bay Street, laid out in the early years of the 18th century, runs west along the river. Its houses, including an unusual one (1211 Bay Street), which combines the native skill of tabby building with a graceful, restrained Palladian portico, form an elegant front line behind which fall narrow streets lined with lovely smaller houses and churches. The graceful interior columns of St. Helena's Episcopal Church suggest the relative simplicity of Colonial-era architecture in a town where embellishment is more common. Its shady, walled cemetery, abundantly landscaped with indigenous plants and full of mockingbirds, is a good place to rest.
An impressionistic history lesson can be obtained by making all of downtown Beaufort your classroom. Maps are available for free at the Chamber of Commerce (1006 Bay Street), where children and adults may rent bicycles ($4 an hour, $15 a day) or pick up a recorded cassette tour ($6). Horse-drawn carriage tours start here on the hour seven times a day from 10 to 4 ($7 for adults, $4 for children).
At a time when the sheer scale of city life produces fatigue, Beaufort's small size is a relief. A visitor can fold into its routine and take up casual citizenship without doing much more than exploring the downtown historic district, resting on a porch swing, casting a shrimp net, hunting for fossilized shark's teeth, or eating outdoors as the sun sets. Subtle pleasures can be found in simply observing the comings and goings of small town life. Visitors to Beaufort this summer may even see Barbra Streisand or Nick Nolte, who will be there filming ''The Prince of Tides,'' a movie based on the best-selling novel by the Beaufort native Pat Conroy.
Local people usually spend their free time on the water. Hunting Island State Park, with three miles of beach and a 115-year-old lighthouse with stairs to the top, is about 30 minutes away by car. Families of deer forage in full view in its maritime forest and clapper rails, herons and raccoons feed all day in the marsh. More than 125 bird species have been sighted here. In nearby Port Royal, a brand-new town boardwalk spans the marsh at the confluence of the Beaufort River and Battery Creek. Shark's teeth lie scattered, half-buried on the sandy shore. From a high platform aerie huge container ships can be seen coming and going at the commercial port.
The tides still influence life in Beaufort, though few livelihoods depend on them anymore. Get to know them and you will come to recognize the change of smell in the air, the shifting of the breeze, the movement of shore birds and the best hours for fishing. Times of highs and lows for a week, measured at several locations, are listed daily in The Beaufort Gazette, which appears in curbside newspaper boxes at about 2 P.M.
To talk over fishing strategies and to purchase basic tackle, step into Fordham Hardware (701 Bay Street). A bell jingles as you enter. The worn-smooth stone floor, the display windows and shelves stuffed and strung with merchandise, the bins of seed and nails, and the sweet, musty smell endow Fordham's with the authenticity of outdoor labor that slick gardening catalogues crave.
Three-quarters of the way back, by the counter, are dip nets, cotton line and weights for catching fish and crabs. A good setup costs about $6. Monofilament shrimp nets, four-and-a-half-feet in diameter, a good size for beginners, cost $36. Beaufort Hardware (723 Bay Street), run, like Fordham's, by a local family for a couple of generations, sells fishing gear at comparable prices. Nonfishermen might enjoy a radio-controlled wooden sailboat or airplane. The recommended bait for crab is chicken necks, the older and more pungent the better; shrimp you encircle by stealth.
If you are traveling with children, at least one of them will encrust a sneaker with sandy, souffle-like ''pluff'' mud from the creek. Lipsitz department store (825 Bay Street), another small-town emporium whose type has all but disappeared, can help. Members of the Lipsitz family will sell your family footwear, jeans and sweats while a chatty pet mynah bird diverts the younger set.
Across Bay Street is the Waterfront Park, whose playground, landscaped green and harbor promenade are well-suited for games of catch or tag, or just walking. Cruise ships dock on scheduled stops, shrimp trawlers and sailboats tie up periodically and tugboats accompanying loaded barges follow a slow, steady course. Near the playground is an informative photo display depicting rural folk art and traditions.
Hours of the day elicit their own pictures in Beaufort. In the early morning, they are noiseless and unpeopled. One might frame the massive stone pillars, mottled with age, at 411 Craven Street; another, the broad arc of oak branches on a tree in the yard of 1 Laurens Street, the house featured in ''The Big Chill'' and ''The Great Santini.'' At first dark of a spring evening, lamplight makes eyes of windows in houses on King Street. The fading light of sunset on the Bay Street bluff silhouettes the painted balustrades, railings and shutters of the houses facing south. When you return to your lodgings or walk to dinner, you will carry with you the scent of Confederate jasmine, still lingering in the warm air.
The world of sea island plantations whose slaves helped create Beaufort's antebellum wealth, and the vast geography of water in which Beaufort is just a dot, can best be seen a short distance from town in the direction of the beaches or Port Royal.
In the 1890's the historian Henry Adams would board a little steamer packet to ride to a house on the beach where, with a party of Washington friends, he would roast oysters, paint in watercolor and catch crabs. Today Highway 21 will carry you to Hunting Island State Park. If beachcombing and sunbathing aren't enough, the lighthouse can be climbed or bikes ridden on roads that weave through the maritime forest. At high tide the beach disappears due to severe erosion. Or walk the length of Paradise Pier - 1120 feet - which reaches into Fripp inlet at the south end of the island.
Or your way you may want to stop for lunch at the Shrimp Shack, a small, rustic restaurant on the side of the road, across from the owner's excellent dockside fish market. Or if the tide is low and coming in, cast a net from Cowan Creek bridge, or in the big bend at Village Creek, two popular fishing spots. Or visit Penn Center on St. Helena Island.
Penn was established in 1862 as a school for the newly-freed slaves by two female abolitionists and has remained a proud center of community life ever since. The York W. Bailey Museum (open Monday to Friday, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.) displays artifacts from Penn's educational mission, past and present, and objects confirming the close ties between African and slave life, which has produced a culture called Gullah. Community singing sessions, open to the public, feature a program of spirituals and readings. They take place at 7:30 P.M. every third Sunday from September to May.
The crescent beach off Sixth Street in Port Royal, locally referred to as The Sands, and its adjacent marsh boardwalk, are about seven miles from Beaufort. The boardwalk and 45-foot-high viewing tower offer a panoramic view of the harbor, of Parris Island, the Marine Corps Recruit Training Depot, and of freighters like the Repap, which carries raw materials for glossy paper coating to Canada, and returns with the paper.
As Beaufort has become more prosperous it seems able, for the first time, to praise its small town roots as much as its Old South status. The Lowcountry Ledger, a new, thoughtful and determinedly local weekly newspaper, runs a column called ''Old Times Are Not Forgotten.'' It is a compilation of old newspaper items that chronicle church picnics, socials, the pranks of local boys and 100-year-old business gossip. It is a charming celebration of small town life. It never mentions the Old Families or the Old South.
The editor says it is the most popular feature in the paper.

Where to Stay
 Beaufort's recent prosperity has brought a variety of lodgings to the area.
 The proprietors of the Rhett House Inn (1009 Craven Street; 524-9030) who used to be in the New York fashion business, have converted an antebellum house a block back from the river into an eight-room bed and breakfast with a look that wears well in the hot weather. There's lots of natural light, antique furniture, pretty patterned fabrics and a library table piled with glossy magazines. Double rooms start at $80, including breakfast; $15 extra for a third person in the room. No children under 5.
The Trescot Inn (500 Washington Street; 522-8552) has six rooms priced from $65 for double occupancy, including breakfast. Its second-story veranda, which is nearly 50 feet long and 12 feet wide, overlooks drifts of azaleas, cedar trees and vine-covered fences in the Point neighborhood. No children under 12.
There are three bedrooms in the Old Point Inn (212 New Street; 524-3177) with Victorian touches such as lace curtains and gingham-style wallpaper that correspond with the turn-of-the-century date of the house. From the upstairs porch you can see the boat traffic and the twinkling lights of Ladies Island. Rates, including breakfast, start at $55 for a double room.
The Best Western Sea Island Inn (1015 Bay Street; 524-4121) has a convenient downtown location, attractively decorated rooms and a pool. Through the high season to Oct. 31, rates start at $58 for a double room. The Cafe is open for Continental breakfast every and lunch every day except Sunday.
 
Places to Eat
 Nearly every menu in Beaufort includes locally caught seafood. Following are some of the more popular places: The Gadsby Tavern (525-1800) and Plum's (525-1946) open out onto the Waterfront Park and are loose, informal places, especially at lunch. Gadsby's often features live acoustic music Friday and Saturday night. Lunch prices are about $4 to $6 for entrees or a good soup-and-salad combination. At Plum's there are hefty sandwiches (from about $2.50 to $5) and homemade ice cream starting at $1.30.
For dinner, The Steamer on Highway 21 on Ladies Island (524-1755) is the most popular place in town, with consistently good seafood dishes and oysters by the bucket. It's noisy and service can be slow. Entrees from about $10, depending on the specials.
Wilkop's Whitehall Inn (524-0382) also just off Highway 21 on Ladies Island and The Anchorage at 1103 Bay Street (524-9392) are more formal. The Anchorage has rooms of dark paneling, Wilkop's is set in a lovely live oak grove facing the river. Menus emphasize local seafood, especially shrimp and crab, and there are full wine lists. Dinner for two runs about $40 to $50, including wine. The Shrimp Shack (838-2962) on St. Helena Island or the Dockside (524-7433) in Port Royal offer abundant platters of seafood, slaw and hush puppies. The Dockside is right on the water and offers one of the prettiest sunset views around. Entrees are from $8.50; from about $5 at the Shrimp Shack.

HEADLINE: Stone Symbols Of Shaker Permanence

BYLINE: By SUSAN ALLPORT; Susan Allport's book ''Sermons in Stone: The Stone Walls of New England and New York,'' will be published by W. W. Norton & Company in October.

 BODY:
As I approached the Shaker village in Canterbury, N.H., from the south, I became aware of its stone walls at the same moment I spotted the white clapboard buildings. They vie for your attention: the simple buildings surrounded by shade trees and perched on top of a high hill, and the lichen-encrusted, gray-green walls built with stones the size of which I had never seen before in a wall. Some of the stones extend well over a yard in every dimension; they weigh more than 4,000 pounds each. The walls, I discovered, have been impressing visitors for almost 200 years.
''The Shaker land is easily known by its superior cultivation, and by its substantial stone wall fences,'' John Finch, the English economist reported after visiting Canterbury in the 19th century. Earlier, in 1799, when Timothy Dwight, Yale University's peripatetic president, passed through the village, he wrote that, ''everything about them was clean and tidy . . . Even their stables, the fences which surround their fields, and the road which passes through their village are all uncommonly neat.''
The Shakers, a religious, celibate sect who got their name from the frenzied dancing that accompanied their worship, built walls wherever they had land to fence and stone to fence it with, but those at the Canterbury village are particularly remarkable because of the quantity of stone the wall builders there had to work with. 
Canterbury, north of Concord, has some of the rockiest land in all of New England. It was once the home of 300 Shakers, who lived, worked and worshiped in its 100 buildings and farmed 6,000 acres. Today it is still a living Shaker community, but only 22 buildings, 600 acres and two Shaker sisters still remain. The fields lie fallow and the village functions primarily as a museum where visitors can take a 90-minute guided tour of some of the buildings and industries, then wander through the grounds and watch skilled artisans re-create many 19th-century Shaker crafts.
Afterward they can lunch (or dine later on by candlelight) in the old Shaker Creamery on such traditional Shaker fare as squash biscuits with blackberry honey butter and roast loin of pork with forest mushroom gravy. Such an excursion could easily occupy most of a day.
Shakers are best known today for their inventions and their sparse but graceful furniture, yet their walls speak every bit as eloquently as these other objects of Shaker beliefs and practices. Though built of the same glacial debris as most of New England's walls, the walls at Canterbury bear about as much resemblance to the garden-variety, hastily constructed field wall that one sees everywhere in this stony part of the world as a well-built boat resembles a leaky dinghy. With their enormous stones and careful construction, these walls will not need repairing every spring when winter frosts have finished heaving the earth about. No, these are walls that time will not move, let alone frost. Embedded in them, it seems, are the basic tenets of the Shakers, the idea that labor was consecrated and that every object should be made as if the maker would die tomorrow but the object must last a thousand years.
Much of the history of the Shaker movement can also be read in these walls. When Ann Lee, founder of the sect, led her small group to the New World in 1774, she sought to bring Heaven to earth by creating a perfect and orderly society founded on good tillage. At first, the Shakers could afford to buy only rocky, unproductive land such as that in Canterbury, but in a matter of years, they turned this unpromising terrain into well-ordered fields bordered by substantial walls.
Shakers succeeded where many other self-subsistence farmers failed because of their fervency (farming, to them, was a way of delivering the earth from evil; every stone taken out of the ground and placed in a wall was a step in that direction) and the advantages of their communal husbandry: the fact that they farmed with a large labor pool. The benefits of this labor force can be seen particularly well in the area of fencing. Whereas an individual farmer began fencing his land first with logs, then stumps, then rail fences, only getting around to building stone walls after decades or generations of farming, at Canterbury, the Shakers had the manpower to fence early and almost exclusively in stone.
The wall that lines Shaker Road to the south of the village, the one with the exceptionally large stones, dates to 1793, just a year after the Shaker community at Canterbury was founded. By the 1850's, the community's entire 6,000 acres had been cleared, divided and fenced in stone.
According to ''The People Called Shakers,'' by Edward Deming Andrews (Oxford University Press), a Philadelphia visitor, W. S. Warder, once asked the community, ''How do you and your neighbors manage about fencing?'' He was told that ''little difficulty was encountered. We make ours good, and they generally follow the example; if they do not quite do their part, we do a little more than ours, and in time they come tolerably near to what they ought to be.''
Strolling through the village, visitors can sense the same pride in superior craftsmanship - especially in the stonework. Here, the granite that the glaciers left behind was used to make not only walls but also to shape numerous other objects that in less stony areas or in the hands of a less industrious people might have been made out of wood. Among the handsome frame buildings are finely chiseled gateposts, door frames, stoops and steps, sluiceways and walkways, which, had they been made of wood, would have rotted long ago.
As it is, they stand today as symbols of the permanence that the Shakers sought, a permanence that eluded them as the sect, once the largest American utopian society, went into decline after the Civil War.
Well-built as these walls and stone objects are, for me, one of their most unusual features lies not in their construction but in the fact that a great deal is known about when they were built and by whom. This feature alone distinguishes them from most of the stonework in New England, an area where walls were so commonplace and so little remarked upon that they are now the anonymous epics of earlier times. I have been frustrated by the lack of written material, and so I was delighted to discover at Canterbury journals and a tradition of oral history rich with the lives of wall builders. There is a pleasant paradox here. Believing that individuals should devote their lives to the good of the community, Shakers rarely signed anything they made. Yet because they so appreciated good craftsmanship, their journals are filled with accounts of talented workers and the objects they created.
In the journal of the Shaker leader Henry Blinn, for instance, is the story behind a plot of land known as Ezekiel's meadow, named for brother Ezekiel Stevens who died in 1836 after singlehandedly clearing and fencing this especially difficult piece of land, the exact location of which is not known today. Stevens was known to say that ''it is better to wear out than to rust out,'' but he worked so hard that the Shakers' worldly neighbors circulated the story that he had been forced to clear the land as a penance for sins he had committed.
In the same journal is the story of a wall builder who died as the result of a blow from his own stone hammer. In 1836, brother Elijah Fletcher hit his knee with his heavy hammer and had to be confined to the house for nine months. Finally his leg was amputated. ''He was conscious during the operation & bore it like a hero,'' Blinn notes, but he died three weeks later.
Blinn writes, too, about the hand-chiseled, stone watering trough that stands empty today at the foot of the hill below the village and was much admired by Nathaniel Hawthorne in his story ''Canterbury Pilgrims.'' In this story, two young Shakers who are running away from the celibate sect to marry stop at the trough to drink and there meet a band of world-weary travelers. Hawthorne describes the trough as ''the work of neat hands and considerate art''; Blinn tells us that the hands were those of the Shaker brother Micajah Tucker who placed the trough at the foot of the hill in 1831.
Tucker was certainly the most notable of all the community's masons. According to Blinn, he chiseled out most of the slabs that form the granite walkways in the village (walkways that have been keeping Shaker shoes dry and mud-free since they were laid in the 1830's; ''1835'' is inscribed in one of the stones on the southernmost pathway). Tucker also made most of the gateposts and many of Canterbury's remarkable stone stoops - four or five steps chiseled out of a single granite boulder.
The stoops leading up to the chapel and on the south side of the carriage house were made by Tucker, while that in front of the family dwelling was the work of the unfortunate Elijah Fletcher.
Micajah Tucker is also a good example of the tradition of oral history at Canterbury. Although he died in 1848, his work is remembered and praised by Shakers today. Eldress Bertha Lindsay, one of the two Shakers still living at the village and the last remaining Shaker Elder or Eldress anywhere, has been blind for 30 years, but she can still list and describe Tucker's accomplishments. Moreover, she says she can distinguish the objects this mason made by their exceptionally smooth surface. ''Fletcher's steps are nice, she notes, ''but they're a little rougher.''
Bertha, who came to the Shakers as an orphan in 1905, was also able to solve for me the mystery of another wall on the property. This is the one that lines Shaker Road as it runs north from the village to the Shaker cemetery, a wall that is puzzling because it lacks the enduring quality of Tucker's work or the walls leading up to the village.
The wall is in good condition, but it is made not of enormous granite blocks but, rather, of much smaller stones - one-man stones, a mason might call them because they are light enough for one man to lift. When I first saw the wall, I assumed it had been built with rocks picked out of fields cultivated in potatoes or some other root crop, an operation that involves clearing the fields of even small stones. But my rationale was wrong. The wall was built by a one-armed man in the 1800's, said Bertha. ''The stones are small because he couldn't handle bigger ones,'' she explained, adding an understatement that sums up much of the legacy of the Shakers and the reason so many of us are drawn today to the objects they made: ''He must have been very dedicated to what he was doing.''

HEADLINE: A Negative Vote On Affirmative Action

BYLINE: By Shelby Steele: Shelby Steele is an English professor at San Jose State University in California. A collection of his essays, ''The Content of Our Character,'' will be published in August.

 BODY:
IN A FEW SHORT YEARS, WHEN MY TWO children will be applying to college, the affirmative-action policies by which most universities offer black students some form of preferential treatment will present me with a dilemma. I am a middle-class black, a college professor, far from wealthy, but also well removed from the kind of deprivation that would qualify my children for the label ''disadvantaged.'' Both of them have endured racial insensitivity from whites. They have been called names, have suffered slights and have experienced first hand the peculiar malevolence that racism brings out of people. Yet they have never experienced racial discrimination, have never been stopped by their race on any path they have chosen to follow. Still, their society now tells them that if they will only designate themselves as black on their college applications, they will probably do better in the college lottery than if they conceal this fact. I think there is something of a Faustian bargain in this. 
Of course many blacks and a considerable number of whites would say that I was sanctimoniously making affirmative action into a test of character. They would say that this small preference is the meagerest recompense for centuries of unrelieved oppression. And to these arguments other very obvious facts must be added. In America, many marginally competent or flatly incompetent whites are hired every day -some because their white skin suits the conscious or unconscious racial preference of their employers. The white children of alumni are often grandfathered into elite universities in what can only be seen as a residual benefit of historic white privilege. Worse, white incompetence is always an individual matter, but for blacks it is often confirmation of ugly stereotypes. Given that unfairness cuts both ways, doesn't it only balance the scales of history, doesn't this repay, in a small way, the systematic denial under which my children's grandfather lived out his days?
In theory, affirmative action certainly has all the moral symmetry that fairness requires. It is reformist and corrective, even repentent and redemptive. And I would never sneer at these good intentions. Born in the late 1940's in Chicago, I started my education (a charitable term, in this case) in a segregated school, and suffered all the indignities that come to blacks in a segregated society. My father, born in the South, made it only to the third grade before the white man's fields took permanent priority over his formal education. And though he educated himself into an advanced reader with an almost professorial authority, he could only drive a truck for a living, and never earned more than $90 a week in his entire life. So yes, it is crucial to my sense of citizenship, to my ability to identify with the spirit and the interests of America, to know that this country, however imperfectly, recognizes its past sins and wishes to correct them.
Yet good intentions can blind us to the effects they generate when implemented. In our society affirmative action is, among other things, a testament to white good will and to black power, and in the midst of these heavy investments its effects can be hard to see. But after 20 years of implementation I think that affirmative action has shown itself to be more bad than good and that blacks - whom I will focus on in this essay - now stand to lose more from it than they gain.
In talking with affirmative-action administrators and with blacks and whites in general, I found that supporters of affirmative action focus on its good intentions and detractors emphasize its negative effects. It was virtually impossible to find people outside either camp. The closest I came was a white male manager at a large computer company who said, ''I think it amounts to reverse discrimination, but I'll put up with a little of that for a little more diversity.'' But this only makes him a half-hearted supporter of affirmative action. I think many people who don't really like affirmative action support it to one degree or another anyway.
I believe they do this because of what happened to white and black Americans in the crucible of the 1960's, when whites were confronted with their racial guilt and blacks tasted their first real power. In that stormy time white absolution and black power coalesced into virtual mandates for society. Affirmative action became a meeting ground for those mandates in the law. At first, this meant insuring equal opportunity. The 1964 civil-rights bill was passed on the understanding that equal opportunity would not mean racial preference. But in the late 60's and early 70's, affirmative action underwent a remarkable escalation of its mission from simple anti-discrimination enforcement to social engineering by means of quotas, goals, timetables, set-asides and other forms of preferential treatment.
Legally, this was achieved through a series of executive orders and Equal Employment Opportunity Comission guidelines that allowed racial imbalances in the workplace to stand as proof of racial discrimination. Once it could be assumed that discrimination explained racial imbalances, it became easy to justify group remedies to presumed discrimination rather than the normal case-by-case redress.
Even though blacks had made great advances during the 60's without quotas, the white mandate to achieve a new racial innocence and the black mandate to gain power, which came to a head in the very late 60's, could no longer be satisfied by anything less than racial preferences. I don't think these mandates, in themselves, were wrong, because whites clearly needed to do better by blacks and blacks needed more real power in society. But as they came together in affirmative action, their effect was to distort our understanding of racial discrimination. By making black the color of preference, these mandates have reburdened society with the very marriage of color and preference (in reverse) that we set out to eradicate.
When affirmative action grew into social engineering, diversity became a golden word. Diversity is a term that applies democratic principles to races and cultures rather than to citizens, despite the fact that there is nothing to indicate that real diversity is the same thing as proportionate representation. Too often the result of this, on campuses for example, has been a democracy of colors rather than of people, an artificial diversity that gives the appearance of an educational parity between black and white students that has not yet been achieved in reality. Here again, racial preferences allow society to leapfrog over the difficult problem of developing blacks to parity with whites and into a cosmetic diversity that covers the blemish of disparity - a full six years after admission, only 26 to 28 percent of blacks graduate from college.
Racial representation is not the same thing as racial development. Representation can be manufactured; development is always hard earned. But it is the music of innocence and power that we hear in affirmative action that causes us to cling to it and to its distracting emphasis on representation. The fact is that after 20 years of racial preferences the gap between median incomes of black and white families is greater than it was in the 1970's. None of this is to say that blacks don't need policies that insure our right to equal opportunity, but what we need more of is the development that will let us take advantage of society's efforts to include us.
I think one of the most troubling effects of racial preferences for blacks is a kind of demoralization. Under affirmative action, the quality that earns us preferential treatment is an implied inferiority. However this inferiority is explained - and it is easily enough explained by the myriad deprivations that grew out of our oppression - it is still inferiority. There are explanations and then there is the fact. And the fact must be borne by the individual as a condition apart from the explanation, apart even from the fact that others like himself also bear this condition. In integrated situations in which blacks must compete with whites who may be better prepared, these explanations may quickly wear thin and expose the individual to racial as well as personal self-doubt. (Of course whites also feel doubt, but only personally, not racially.) What this means in practical terms is that when blacks deliver themselves into integrated situations they encounter a nasty little reflex in whites, a mindless, atavistic reflex that responds to the color black with negative sterotypes, such as intellectual ineptness. I think this reflex embarrasses most whites today and thus it is usually quickly repressed. On an equally atavistic level, the black will be aware of the reflex his color triggers and will feel a stab of horror at seeing himself reflected in this way. He, too, will do a quick repression, but a lifetime of such stabbings is what constitutes his inner realm of racial doubt. Even when the black sees no implication of inferiority in racial preferences, he knows that whites do, so that - consciously or unconsciously - the result is virtually the same. The effect of preferential treatment - the lowering of normal standards to increase black representation - puts blacks at war with an expanded realm of debilitating doubt, so that the doubt itself becomes an unrecognized preoccupation that undermines their ability to perform, especially in integrated situations.
I believe another liability of affirmative action comes from the fact that it indirectly encourages blacks to exploit their own past victimization. Like implied inferiority, victimization is what justifies preference, so that to receive the benefits of preferential treatment one must, to some extent, become invested in the view of one's self as a victim. In this way, affirmative action nurtures a victim-focused identity in blacks and sends us the message that there is more power in our past suffering than in our present achievements.
When power itself grows out of suffering, blacks are encouraged to expand the boundaries of what qualifies as racial oppression, a situation that can lead us to paint our victimization in vivid colors even as we receive the benefits of preference. The same corporations and institutions that give us preference are also seen as our oppressors. At Stanford University, minority-group students - who receive at least the same financial aid as whites with the same need - recently took over the president's office demanding, among other things, more financial aid.
But I think one of the worst prices that blacks pay for preference (Continued on Page 73) has to do with an illusion. I saw this illusion at work recently in the mother of a middle-class black student who was going off to his first semester of college: ''They owe us this, so don't think for a minute that you don't belong there.'' This is the logic by which many blacks, and some whites, justify affirmative action - it is something ''owed,'' a form of reparation. But this logic overlooks a much harder and less digestible reality, that it is impossible to repay blacks living today for the historic suffering of the race. If all blacks were given a million dollars tomorrow it would not amount to a dime on the dollar for three centuries of oppression, nor would it dissolve the residues of that oppression that we still carry today. The concept of historic reparation grows out of man's need to impose on the world a degree of justice that simply does not exist. Suffering can be endured and overcome, it cannot be repaid. To think otherwise is to prolong the suffering.
Several blacks I spoke with said they were still in favor of affirmative action because of the ''subtle'' discrimination blacks were subject to once they were on the job. One photojournalist said, ''They have ways of ignoring you.'' A black female television producer said: ''You can't file a lawsuit when your boss doesn't invite you to the insider meetings without ruining your career. So we still need affirmative action.'' Others mentioned the infamous ''glass ceiling'' through which blacks can see the top positions of authority but never reach them. But I don't think racial preferences are a protection against this subtle discrimination; I think they contribute to it.
In any workplace, racial preferences will always create two-tiered populations composed of preferreds and unpreferred. In the case of blacks and whites, for instance, racial preferences imply that whites are superior just as they imply that blacks are inferior. They not only reinforce America's oldest racial myth but, for blacks, they have the effect of stigmatizing the already stigmatized.
I think that much of the ''subtle'' discrimination that blacks talk about is often (not always) discrimination against the stigma of questionable competence that affirmative action marks blacks with. In this sense, preferences make scapegoats of the very people they seek to help. And it may be that at a certain level employers impose a glass ceiling, but this may not be against the race so much as against the race's reputation for having advanced by color as much as by competence. This ceiling is the point at which corporations shift the emphasis from color to competency and stop playing the affirmative-action game. Here preference backfires for blacks and becomes a taint that holds them back. Of course one could argue that this taint, which is after all in the minds of whites, becomes nothing more than an excuse to discriminate against blacks. And certainly the result is the same in either case - blacks don't get past the glass ceiling. But this argument does not get around the fact that racial preferences now taint this color with a new theme of suspicion that makes blacks even more vulnerable to discrimination. In this crucial yet gray area of perceived competence, preferences make whites look better than they are and blacks worse, while doing nothing whatever to stop the very real discrimination that blacks may encounter. I don't wish to justify the glass ceiling here, but only suggest the very subtle ways that affirmative action revives rather than extinguishes the old rationalizations for racial discrimination.
I believe affirmative action is problematic in our society because we have demanded that it create parity between the races rather than insure equal opportunity. Preferential treatment does not teach skills, or educate, or instill motivation. It only passes out entitlement by color, a situation that in my profession has created an unrealistically high demand for black professors. The social engineer's assumption is that this high demand will inspire more blacks to earn Ph.D's and join the profession. In fact, the number of blacks earning Ph.D's has declined in recent years. Ph.D's must be developed from preschool on. They require family and community support. They must acquire an entire system of values that enables them to work hard while delaying gratification.
It now seems clear that the Supreme Court, in a series of recent decisions, is moving away from racial preferences. It has disallowed preferences except in instances of ''identified discrimination,'' eroded the precedent that statistical racial imbalances are prima facie evidence of discrimination, and, in effect, granted white males the right to challenge consent degrees that use preference to achieve racial balances in the workplace. Referring to this and other Supreme Court decisions, one civil-rights leader said, ''Night has fallen . . . as far as civil rights are concerned.'' But I am not so sure. The effect of these decisions is to protect the constitutional rights of everyone, rather than to take rights away from blacks. Night has fallen on racial preferences, not on the fundamental rights of black Americans. The reason for this shift, I believe, is that the white mandate for absolution from past racial sins has weakened considerably in the 1980's. Whites are now less willing to endure unfairness to themselves in order to grant special entitlements to blacks, even when those entitlements are justified in the name of past suffering. Yet the black mandate for more power in society has remained unchanged. And I think part of the anxiety many blacks feel over these decisions has to do with the loss of black power that they may signal.
But the power we've lost by these decisions is really only the power that grows out of our victimization. This is not a very substantial or reliable power, and it is important that we know this so we can focus more exclusively on the kind of development that will bring enduring power. There is talk now that Congress may pass new legislation to compensate for these new limits on affirmative action. If this happens, I hope the focus will be on development and anti-discrimination, rather than entitlement, on achieving racial parity rather than jerry-building racial diversity.
But if not preferences, what? The impulse to discriminate is subtle and cannot be ferreted out unless its many guises are made clear to people. I think we need social policies that are committed to two goals: the educational and economic development of disadvantaged people regardless of race and the eradication from our society - through close monitoring and severe sanctions - of racial, ethnic or gender discrimination. Preferences will not get us to either of these goals, because they tend to benefit those who are not disadvantaged - middle-class white women and middle-class blacks - and attack one form of discrimination with another. Preferences are inexpensive and carry the glamour of good intentions - change the numbers and the good deed is done. To be against them is to be unkind. But I think the unkindest cut is to bestow on children like my own an undeserved advantage while neglecting the development of those disadvantaged children in the poorer sections of my city who will most likely never be in a position to benefit from a preference. Give my children fairness; give disadvantaged children a better shot at development - better elementary and secondary schools, job training, safer neighborhoods, better financial assistance for college and so on. A smaller percentage of black high school graduates go to college today than 15 years ago; more black males are in prison, jail or in some other way under the control of the criminal-justice system than in college. This despite racial preferences.
The mandates of black power and white absolution out of which preferences emerged were not wrong in themselves. What was wrong was that both races focused more on the goals of those mandates than on the means to the goals. Blacks can have no real power without taking responsibility for their own educational and economic development. Whites can have no racial innocence without earning it by eradicating discrimination and helping the disadvantaged to develop. Because we ignored the means, the goals have not been reached and the real work remains to be done.

HEADLINE: DESIGN;
Spain: Spires in the Sky

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

 BODY:
SCAFFOLDING HAS BECOME an integral part of Spain's urban landscape. So have construction crews, churning up clouds of dust and dirt. On almost every major street in cities like Madrid and Barcelona, buildings shrouded in green plastic resemble giant packages waiting to be unwrapped.
Most of the unveilings won't take place for another two years, however, as Spain races to rebuild its cities by 1992. This deadline is spoken about patriotically, and with an almost progandalike defiance by everyone from Government officals and architects to shopkeepers and hotel managers. In many offices, calendars posted in the halls even have a countdown to January 1992 printed in the lower right-hand corner. 
And with good reason. That is the year when the European community becomes a region of unrestricted trade. And Spain, which joined the community in 1986, is working overtime to bring itself up to the level of its economic colleagues. It is also the year when Barcelona will be the host of the Olympic Games and when the World's Fair will be held in Seville. Underlying these scheduled events, however, is a far bigger scheme. During the 36-year reign of Francisco Franco, who died in 1975, Spain was perceived as a backward country. But now, with its stable democracy, the country is booming economically. Not only has the Spanish Government launched ambitious plans to rebuild its cities and infrastructure - highways, railroads and ports - but foreign investment has poured into Spain from Western Europe, the United States and Japan at the rate of more than $10 billion per year. Tourism is up, as well.
But just how good is it for a country to be building so much so fast? ''The wheels are turning too quickly,'' says Estanislao Perez-Pita y Junquera, a Madrid-based architecture company whose office is bursting with commissions, including the renovation of a large public library, an archeology museum and the Spanish Embassy in Vienna. ''We don't have time to think what we're doing. It's overwhelming. Spain is trying to catch up with the rest of Europe after being in the dumps for 50 years. And we're trying hard. But there's little thinking behind all these efforts. That's my biggest concern.'' According to Salvador Gayarre, the architect who designed the controversial new I.B.M. building in Madrid and who is currently working on an extension to Madrid's Senate building: ''We're not trying to compete with New York or Paris. It's more basic than that. There's a general consciousness to improve our quality of life.''
In the process, however, quality may suffer. ''There are weaknesses connected with such fast growth,'' concedes Tomas Llorens, the director of the Reina Sofia Art Center in Madrid, the national museum of contemporary art housed in an 18th-century hospital that is also undergoing major renovations. ''The quality of building is not always what it should be. And the artistic side of architecture can get lost.''
Interestingly, however, top architects from all over the world have accepted large commissions in Spain, particularly in Madrid and Barcelona. In Barcelona alone, the list reads like a ''Who's Who in Architecture.'' For example, Arata Isozaki has come from Japan to design a new sports arena, while the Milan-based Gae Aulenti is transforming the interior of the National Palace into a museum of Catalan art. The New York architect Peter Eisenman is designing a hotel on the outskirts of Barcelona, and Norman Foster of London is building a Tower of Communications. ''There's a spirit and an energy that's contagious,'' says Richard Meier, the New York architect who has designed the new 130,000-square-foot Museum of Contemporary Art in Barcelona. ''The acceration of efforts has been good. Like any major endeavor, there will be mistakes, but the overall scheme is staggering.''
Gentrification differs from place to place. In Barcelona, the Olympics is simply an excuse to revitalize the entire city, opening it up to the sea in an effort to make it the Mediterranean capital. As a city, Barcelona has a history of radical transformations. This is the third in less than a century, the last occurring in 1929 for the International Exposition. The city also has a long and honorable heritage as a design capital - home to the architect Antonio Gaudi and to Mies Van Der Rohe's Pavillion. Currently, Josef Acebillo, the head of city planning, is continuing to make Barcelona an international design mecca. In addition to the Olympic facilities, the city is building museums as well as hotels, which will be greatly needed to house the muitudes expected to come to the Olympics. And throughout the city, more than 200 parks, plazas and streets are being rehabilitated or designed from scratch, complete with more than 50 sculptures by such celebrated artists as Ellsworth Kelly, Roy Lichtenstein, Richard Serra, Eduardo Chillida, Beverly Pepper and Xavier Corbero.
''Barcelona, like London, is a domestic city, and we're trying not to change that feeling,'' Acebillo says. ''We want to purposely juxtapose the old architecture with the new.''
Indeed, the mix of buildings is particularly interesting, as foreign architects are adapting their designs to fit in. While Richard Meier's museum will have a white porcelain and enamel facade - the pristine modern esthetic that is Meier's signature no matter where he builds - he says his design is ''right for its place.'' The architect is having the white porcelain and metal enamel panels made in Spain. Inside, Meier has made adjustments he felt were necessary given the good European craftsmanship available. He chose plaster walls because Spain is well-known for its good plasterers. Were the building in the United States, Sheetrock would have been his preference. The building will also have a concrete rather than a steel frame.
This International-Style building is not far from the Olympics stadium designed by a group of Spanish and Italian architects, including Federico Correa, Alfonso Mila and Vittorio Gregotti. Situated on a plateau of Montjuich Mountain, the facade could not be more different from Meiers's museum. The architects renovated the original neo-classical exterior and entrance gate of the 1929 stadium. Inside, however, there is a totally modern facility that seats 60,000 people and has tall, tubular lights and a custom-designed glass booth for the King, Juan Carlos.
In Madrid, this same international melding of styles is apparent. But the two cities differ drastically in their approaches. Barcelona, being smaller, is far more homogenous in its planning efforts. Its residents also have a very proud, nationalistic spirit that pervades all their designs. Madrid, on the other hand, is a more cosmopolitan and sophisticated city, and its architects are more individualistic. Moreover, the city's transformation is due as much to the the influx of major corporations now investing in Spain as it is to public projects. I.B.M., for example, commissioned the Madrid-based architect Salvador Gayarre to design a large office building. ''It's the most technologically advanced building in Spain,'' says Gayarre. ''Everything is computer controlled.'' The design, a post-modern facade of brick and granite, boasts a peaked glass dome. It is composed of two strips of offices built around an interior courtyard connected by two bridges. Another addition to the Madrid landscape has been designed by John Burgee Architects from New York for Prima, a group of Kuwati investors. It features a pair of glass-and-aluminum towers 27 floors high. This is an unusually large project, about 1 million square feet.
Madrid's new public commissions are large, too. Near the Prado, for example, the Madrid architect Rafael Moneo is renovating an early 19th-century building to house the Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza art collection. ''We're providing a new look and structure,'' says Moneo, ''but still keeping the old features.'' Moneo is also working on the renovation of the railway station in Madrid as well as a new airport for Seville.
Another public building much in the Spanish news is a large round structure that, at first glance, resembles a prison with its rows of tiny windows. This is only the outer layer of a large and dramatic public housing project designed by Francisco Saenz de Oiza, at 71 still one of Spain's most popular and innovative architects. Housing has become a large problem as Madrid has experienced a 200 percent population boom over the last five years. About his design, Oiza says, ''Architects are all Don Quixotes; they're looking to building the impossible dream.''
Just how successful their dreams are, however, is a matter of debate. ''We're all living for 1992, and that's an unnatural situation,'' Oiza adds. ''What's good is the way it's awakening our cities architecturally.'' Oriol Bohigas, the former head of city planning for Barcelona, is in favor of such fast change. ''A quick transformation is better,'' he says. ''One of the problems with American cities is that they are forever in a state of flux.'' But building so much at the same time means that everything will age simultaneosly. Of the few projects finished in Barcelona, for example, there is already graffiti on the walls of some of the public parks, and cracks are appearing in the concrete. Will these cities be able to maintain the projects they have so lovingly built? ''An even bigger question is what will happen in January of 1993,'' says Estanislao Perez-Pita y Junquera, the Madrid architecture company. ''There's such a big push for '92 that no one is thinking about the recession that will inevitably occur in the future.''

HEADLINE: FASHION;
Spain: Hot to Be the New Spot

BYLINE: By Ruth La Ferla

DATELINE: Spain

 BODY:
Show time is 10 minutes away and workmen are still swarming the stage of the Palacio de Congresos, Madrid's official fashion theater. The name of Manuel Pina, one of the city's premier designers, appears on a wall at the rear. There, to the staccato of hammering, Pina's logo is being wreathed in a tangle of roses and barbed wire. A kinky touch, the wreath is an apt metaphor for the rigor and the romance of Spanish design. But its last-minute placement is also indicative of the sketchy, sometimes improvisational nature of Spain's attempt to become the latest hot spot on the international fashion circuit.
Americans trickling into Spain in pursuit of fashion novelty were greeted by mild confusion. At the Salon Cibeles, Madrid's semiannual fashion fair, show invitations were unnacountably scarce. Programs were haphazardly circulated. And visitors were left to fend for themselves in a last-mintue scramble for seats that afforded a passable view of the runway. 
Still, no one seemed to mind. Hopes ran high that the expansive cultural climate and buoyant economy of post-Franco Spain would give rise to a fashion renaissance as well, andto a degree, those hopes were justified. Madrid and Barcelona, Spain's dueling fashion centers, are host to a band of designers whose talents have only begun to surface. Some, like Pedro del Hiero or Francis Montesinos, have sold their fashions domestically for more than a decade. Others, like Roser Marce, Adolfo Dominguez or Antonio Miro, have successfully marketed their work abroad. Nearly all expect that with the Seville World's Fair and the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, events expected to draw a large influx of foreign visitors, their names will become, if not exactly household words, at least as familiar as that of Sybilla Sorondo, Spain's most famous fashion defector.
Sybilla's emergence - she has been heralded as the first fresh wind to blow out of Spain since Cristobal Balenciaga - and her subsequent departure for Milan, hint simultaneously at Spain's creative riches and the problems confronting designers there. The strength of Spanish fashion is its abundant variety. An expanding constellation of new names and ideas has lured a number of investors to embark on joint ventures with the Spaniards to produce collections for export. These days, the Japanese are the most avid consumers of Spanish style, while American appetites have scarcely been whetted. But that may soon change. This month, the Chicago Apparel Center showcased Spanish fashion in a runway show for consumers. And next fall, Bloomingdale's will begin a storewide Spanish promotion. Representatives of Neomode, the development arm of the GFT Apparel Corporation, which distributes and manufactures a number of European and American labels, recently scoured Madrid and Barcelona for marketable new names.
The choice of Spain was obvious, says Neomode's director, Pablo de Echevarria-Navarro. ''In relatively virgin territory there is much greater design diversity.'' Indeed, the country that has produced Manuel Pina, an exponent of fetishist fashions, from black leather bustiers to spike-heeled, thigh-high boots, has also spawned Jesus del Pozo, whose fragile creations will be distributed by Neomode in the United States.
Slight and taut-faced, with a nervous vein pulsing in his temple, del Pozo says he seldom travels, sees no fashion shows, reads few foreign magazines and works with the solitary dedication of a friar. Yet his collection, wrought with rich fabrics like organza, velvet and marbleized gazar, balances voluminous shapes with lean ones in a manner uncannily reminiscent of Italy's Romeo Gigli.
Gigli disciples abound in Spain, prompting the frequent charge that nothing original arises there. ''Romeo Gigli, Giorgio Armani and Sybilla are the inspiration of so many Spanish designers, and the Spaniards don't even knock them off well,'' carped one recent visitor, a New York department-store executive.Nor is Gene Pressman of Barneys New Yorkimpressed with Spanish design. ''A lot of it has been done before.'' he says.
Deja vu notwithstanding, Spain has produced a flurry of divergent fashion directions. Avant-gardistslike Jordi Cuesta, Angel Schlesser or Devota y Lomba show collectionsreplete with long, slender, high-waisted dresses, voluminous smocks poised over reedy skirts and tent-shaped jackets with dramatically swollen collars. Some of these looks are as regal as Renaissance portraits; others are demure, and still others, with their sullen colors and leaden proportions, are simply dour. Spain is, after all, the land of nuns and black-clad widows. But, as Francis Montesinos well knows, it is also the land of gypsies, toreadors and flamenco. The Valencian-born designer for Montesinos-Alama revels in such images, plundering them for his shows. His line, influenced by regional costume as well as cultural kitsch, is rife with gypsy-fringed shawls, kerchiefs, corset-laced tops and bouffant gingham skirts. Similarly, Jose Victor Rodriguez Caro and Jose Luis Medina del Corral (Victorio & Lucchino) have turned for inspiration to their native Seville. Their ethnically flavored, form-fitting tops and flounced lace skirts were great hits with American buyers.
Style took a baroque turn in the hands of Manuel Pina, who festooned his evening dresses with spiraling mohair, and Joaquim Verdu, a Barcelona-based devotee of so-called futurist fashion. At the Gaudi Mujer, Barcelona's fashion fair, Verdu's models, strapping girls with broad shoulders, assaulted the runway wearing jackets with enormous scrolled lapels. Others seemed to vanish into high satin collars that recalled Flash Gordon's villainous Emperor Ming.
The fantastical bent of Verdu's designs are sure to be lost on most Spanish career women. Enamored of foreign labels, they have yet to discover the talent on their own shores.
Those who have, tend to favor classicists like Roberto Verinno, whose trim riding jackets, shearling coats, jodhpurs and creamy cabled sweaters could give Calvin Klein a run for his money. Nacho Ruiz also courts an affluent working woman. Like many of his fellow Catalans, Ruiz exhibits in Madrid in the hope of attracting an international following. Such defections have only fueled the already intense rivarly between Madrid and Barcelona, as each city vies to become Spain's style capital. So far, it is Madrid that has profited most from the Spanish Government's efforts to promote its designers abroad - part of a sweeping move to encourage exports. Spain underwrites the Salon Cibeles's runway presentations at a cost of about $300,000, compared with $30,000 provided by the Catalan government to produce the Gaudi's shows.
Madrilenos tend to dismiss the Gaudi as a ''local fair,'' but the Catalans are by no means vanquished. Catalonia produces about 60 percent of the nation's textiles and is an important apparel-manufacturing center. In order to modernize its factories, making them more responsive to market demands, the Government is channeling funds into the apparel industry. It is only a matter of time, believes Anna Birules Bertran, director of promotion for the Catalan Department of Industry and Energy, before Barcelona becomes a fashion capital on a par with Milan. ''You must remember,'' says Birules, ''that it was Lombardy's industry that made Milan what it is.'' Yet Spain has an image problem, a legacy of the Franco era. Still perceived as the product of a third-world country, to some minds Spanish fashion remains syonymous with poor fabrics, spotty deliveries and shoddy workmanship. Carol Rollo of Riding High was one of the first New York merchants to carry Sybilla. In those days, before Gibo, Jean-Paul Gaultier's manufacturer, produced Sybilla's designs, Rollo says, ''We had to straighten every hem and run up every seam.''. ''But,'' she adds a little wistfully, ''at least it was affordable.''
Nowadays, at retail prices ranging from about $250 to well over $2,000, Spanish fashions are no bargain. And American retailers are understandably skeptical about Spain's prospects here. Skeptical but hopeful. One has, after all, to start somewhere. Kalman Ruttenstein, senior vice president for fashion direction at Bloomingdale's, remembers his first visit to Giorgio Armani's Milan studio in the early 1970's. ''Armani,'' he recalls, ''was making jackets at the time that had no bottoms to go with them. But it didn't matter. They had a great look.'' Ruttenstein is not suggesting that Spain has produced an Armani - yet. Or that Madrid is about to nudge Milan out of fashion's spotlight. The future, however, is rich in possibilities. ''Show me a city that can develop three strong talents,'' Ruttenstein says, ''and people will go there in hordes.''

HEADLINE: Minor Differences Mean a Lot

BYLINE: By MICHAEL IGNATIEFF; Michael Ignatieff is a Canadian historian living in England.

 BODY:

CONTINENTAL DIVIDE
The Values and Institutions of the United States and Canada.
By Seymour Martin Lipset.
337 pp. New York: Routledge. $29.95.
Viewed from the United States, the differences between Americans and Canadians may seem very minor. Viewed from Canada, they form the crux of an identity. To paraphrase Freud, Canadian identity is a national form of the narcissism of minor difference. 
Lament for the imminent disappearance of cultural and political distinctiveness has been a standard refrain among Canadian nationalists since the 1960's. In the 1989 national election, which turned on the issue of free trade with the United States, many Canadian intellectuals argued as if the test of patriotism were how soon a person thought the free trade deal would destroy Canada as a country. Yet Canadians did vote in favor of the party supporting the free trade treaty, indicating that ordinary Canadians were more confident about their country's future than the doom-saying intellectuals.
Given that Canadians disagree violently about their future viability as a people, Seymour Martin Lipset's ''Continental Divide,'' a patient and careful study of the differences between the cultures of the two countries, is bound to trigger debate in Canada. Whether it will do the same south of the border is another matter. Americans have never been exactly riveted by Canadians, and they may have to be convinced that they have anything to learn by looking northward. Yet this is the core of the book: it is addressed as much to Americans as to Canadians, and its message is that at a time when Americans are uncertain about their role in a changing world, their future as an economic power, even their ethnic and racial identity, they might regain a clearer sense of themselves if they took a long hard look in the Canadian mirror.
The first thing they will see is that, unlike Canadians, they have a mission. Indeed, with the collapse of the Communist quest to revolutionize the world, America remains the only nation on earth - with the possible exceptions, ironically, of Iran and Libya - that holds on to a messianic self-image. Mr. Lipset quotes the great American historian Richard Hofstadter's remark: ''It has been our fate as a nation not to have ideologies but to be one.'' There is no Canadian ideology. From the American point of view, this deprives Canadian history of the drama and tragedy of a destiny. From the Canadian point of view, the absence of a national mission is a blessing. It makes possible an ironic and self-deprecating detachment, coupled with a certain ability to see the world as it is.
A sense of destiny gives Americans a confidence, an ebullience, a willingness to take risks that Canadians can only envy. Yet having a mission can be a form of blindness. As Mr. Lipset writes, ''Americans, more than other western peoples, tend to view international politics in nonnegotiable moralistic and ideological terms.'' Thus while many Americans seem disposed to see the triumph of democracy in Eastern Europe as a victory for their system, Canadians are more likely to observe that for many Eastern Europeans the model to emulate is actually something like their own largely social democratic polity. America is far from being the beacon the whole world wants to be led by.
Mr. Lipset's close comparison brings out just how exceptional the United States is. No society is so religious as America, or so quick to politicize moral issues. No society spends more on law and order or gets so little of either for its money. It is the Canadian pattern - a secular culture, hierarchical, law-abiding and deferential - that is more typical of Western societies. Again, Canada conforms to the European norm in the place its political culture accords to trade unionism and to socialist or social democratic third parties. In America, trade union allegiance is declining and third parties get nowhere.
In the Canadian mirror, America's image of itself as the most democratic country on earth becomes unfocused. True, Americans elect judges, district attorneys and a host of other public servants who in Canada and Europe are appointed bureaucrats. Ordinary citizens have much greater power in the United States to initiate legislation through referendums than in other countries. Yet if America affords more opportunities to be a good citizen, participation rates are lower in elections in the United States than they are in those of Europe and Canada. And because of the absence of third parties in America, the range of political alternatives to choose from may be narrower than many realize.
Yet Mr. Lipset's mirror is not meant only to show Americans in a negative light. Canadians will not find the comparisons of their country with the United States very flattering either: less expenditure on research and education than in America, less private philanthropy, a much more cautious attitude toward economic innovation and risk taking. Much of this is standard fare in the litany of Canadian self-deprecation, but Canadians may be surprised to learn that despite their cherished image of themselves as being less dogmatic about government intervention in the economy than the Americans, in fact, American regulatory agencies are much more aggressive and effective in controlling business than Canadian ones are.
''Continental Divide'' is welcome because in its quiet, carefully documented way it chips away at self-flattering illusions on both sides of the border. And instead of simply documenting differences between the two countries, Mr. Lipset, an American political scientist and sociologist at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, traces those differences back to the beginning. Americans remain children of the successful Revolution of 1776, Canadians of the failed counterrevolution of 1783 (when, the author notes, elites ''attempted to create a conservative, monarchical, and ecclesiastical society'') and the trek northward of those colonists loyal to England. ''America,'' Mr. Lipset writes, ''reflects the influence of its classically liberal, Whig, individualistic, antistatist, populist, ideological origins. Canada, at least from a comparative North American perspective, can still be seen as Tory-mercantilist, group-oriented, statist, deferential to authority - a 'socialist monarchy.' '' There is a lesson in this for those pessimists who think that cultural differences will be obliterated in the global village. For more than a century, America and Canada have proved just how enduring the narcissism of minor difference can be.

HEADLINE: First Step, Reinstatement Cave Spurned

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
There has been a fair amount of talk recently about Pete Rose and the Hall of Fame. My own opinion is that all the talk is very much premature.
There is one simple statement of fact: the man is banned from baseball. How can you justify giving baseball's highest honor to a man who can't even put his foot in the clubhouse in Cincinnati, in Shea Stadium, and indeed not even any clubhouse in any major or minor league city all across the nation? He must first go through proper channels and get himself reinstated by the commissioner. 
It may come soon or it may never come. That decision is up to the commissioner. Then, and only then, should the pros and cons be debated as to Pete Rose's entry into baseball's highest honor, the Hall of Fame.
 
DON SCHMIDT
Plainfield, N.J.
To the Sports Editor:
I was disappointed to read Nelson Bryant's ''Filming a Big Game Hunt'' (The Times, April 15), promoting some movie about African hunting. Frankly, I didn't think he would still glorify this kind of slaughter, even if it does stir up nostalgic memories of the panda-shooting Roosevelts.
In my opinion, hunters are even more despicable than poachers because of their respective motives. One resorts to killing as a (wretched) way to produce revenue. The other seeks to transform a beautiful animal into a lifeless bloody pulp strictly for entertainment. That's the bottom line.
Today, anyone can go into an African game park and ride within a few yards of these same wild animals. The cape buffaloes just stand there, and the lions don't even look at you.
It's a shame that certain countries like Botswana continue to allow hunting because these economically depressed nations cannot bring themselves to turn down the revenue that some rich zealots are willing to pay for their grisly sport.
The real heroes of the African bush are individuals like Jane Goodall, John Goddard, George Schaller or the late Dr. Bernhard Grzimek and Diane Fossey: people who have devoted their lives to saving the animals of Africa, not killing them.
Regarding Bryant's intimation about man's still-lingering primordial instincts from the cave, I would suggest that this is 1990. It's time to come out of the cave.

HEADLINE: Give It a Rest

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
The $25,000 fine levied by the N.B.A. commissioner, David Stern, against the Los Angeles Lakers for resting their starters against the Portland Trail Blazers is one of the most crass examples of bureaucratic dictating evidenced in sports.
Yes, N.B.A. basketball is a business, a successful business, because of its inherently competitive, fast-paced action with the most gifted athletes of any sport. Unfortunately for the athletes, the demands of the 100-plus games (with playoffs) result in career-ending injuries and premature physical damage. Resting important players before the championship series is prudent, logical coaching.
The playoffs represent the N.B.A.'s highest television ratings, thus the highest potential revenue. It makes economic sense to keep N.B.A. stars healthy and rested to achieve maximum performance and insure audience satisfaction.
Stern's Roman-gladiator approach is nearsighted and an insult to intelligent fans. The best long-term success of the league lies in healthy, long-term playing careers of the players.
This type of policy will undo a lot of hard work and sacrifice. I urge Stern to discontinue this policy, and others that aren't in the players' best interests.

HEADLINE: Real Estate Slump Yields Fewer Agents

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT'S housing slump is depressing not only prices but also the number of agents selling real estate these days.
The number of licensed agents swelled to 39,000 in the boom years of the 1980's. But the Connecticut Real Estate Commission, which mailed 35,000 forms for agents to renew their licenses last year, said only 22,500 had done so by Monday. Old licenses expired April 30. 
''It's a sign of the marketplace. The market has slowed down considerably,'' said Commission Director Larry Hannafin, who also attributed the drop in renewals to a tripling of license fees last year.
 
Thinking Twice
Officials said there are still plenty of agents to help people buy and sell homes. But part-time agents who entered the business during the boom years may be thinking twice, now that the economy has slumped and licenses are more expensive.
''A lot of those people who entered the market when it was hot probably found they couldn't survive, or didn't choose to survive, when things got back to normal,'' said Jeanette Newton, executive officer of the 330-member North Central Connecticut Board of Realtors in Enfield. She said membership has dropped about 5 percent since last year. Connecticut's housing market took off in the 1980's, as people put their paychecks into housing and developers tried to cash in on the region's booming economy. The number of new units authorized grew from 10,855 in 1981 to a high of 30,163 in 1986, while the price of a new home grew from $79,920 in 1980 to $206,813 in 1988, according to figures from the state Department of Housing.
 
'Feeding Frenzy'
''The activity we saw, it was like a feeding frenzy with fish in '86,'' said Bett McCarthy, executive director of the Greenwich Board of Realtors ''That's not the norm.''
But the market has slowed in the last two years, due partly to a glut in housing and partly to higher prices that have discouraged people from buying.
''If they bought their houses in '85 or '86, they haven't seen that much of an appreciation, so they're going to wait for the next appreciation to come and then they're going to sell,'' Ms. McCarthy said.
 
6 Percent Drop
Just as the booming market led to an increase in real estate agents, the slumping market is making some leave. The Connecticut Board of Realtors said membership has slipped about 6 percent, from 17,600 last year to 16,500 today.
Some agents were also dismayed when brokers' fees were increased last year from $100 to $308. Fees for salespeople, who are brokers' apprentices, increased from $75 to $233.
''I think that was just kind of a double whammy for those who had been holding licenses and were in it to make an occasional deal,'' Ms. Newton said.
 
Agent Education
Mr. Hannafin said some agents were also discouraged by a requirement that in even years like 1990, they prove they have improved their real estate knowledge by either taking a test or spending 12 hours in the classroom.
But full-time professionals are staying in the business because they know the ups and downs of real estate and will weather the current storm, said Frank Green, president of the Stamford Board of Realtors.
''Because of the entire economy, people are probably taking a wait-and-look-and-see attitude,'' he said. ''But we in the industry realize now is the time to buy real estate, and I think that's one reason why you don't see a lot of the realtors dropping out of the market.''
Not all areas have seen a drop in agents. The decline appears less severe in Fairfield County, where housing is so expensive that agents can still make a living even when they sell fewer houses.
The number of agents in Hartford has also remained steady at 3,000, said Pat Branciforte, director of member services for the Greater Hartford Association of Realtors.
Agents say business is picking up; spring is traditionally the busiest season for real estate because the weather is better and the school year is about to end.

HEADLINE: The Casinos' Search For Older Workers

 BODY:
It was with amusement that I read the comments by Patrick Killian, director of casino economics for the Casino Association, in the article ''Casinos Seek Answers to Scarcity of Employees'' (March 25). Mr. Killian was bemoaning the difficulty of getting people to work in Atlantic City's casinos - particularly older people.
As Mr. Killian stated it, ''Hey, we need help; we've helped you, now you help us.'' It must be wonderful to be so inwardly focused that you are blind to the world around you. 
I would like to bring Mr. Killian into the real world with the following points:
The senior citizens owe the casinos nothing. The casinos exist to make a profit for the casino owners, and they pay taxes to the state and Atlantic City for the privilege of operating a gambling concession.
If senior citizens are feeling altruistic, I would think they would get a lot more satisfaction out of volunteering for day care centers, hospitals and crisis centers rather than a casino, where they can watch dissolute wretches throwing their money away. Ugh!
Mr. Killian may be director of casino economics, but he knows nothing about people economics. Let me give him a short course in Eco 101. If a retired person on Social Security who is under the age of 65 takes a job, he must give up 50 cents of every dollar earned over $6,840. That means that all earnings over $6,840 are taxed at a 50 percent rate.
In addition, he must pay Social Security tax at about 7.65 percent, state tax at 2.5 percent and, if he has a decent pension and investments, Federal tax at 28 percent. If you add it all up, it comes to an effective tax rate of 88 percent, leaving our poor pensioner with 12 cents on each dollar earned over $6,840 and sore feet.
Now for the economics lesson. If people are taxed at a rate of 88 percent, they will do one of three things: (a) hide the income, (b) spend more time looking for tax shelters than generating income or (c) not bother to work.
Since (a) and (b) are not available to these senior citizens at the casino (no off-the-books payments here), the only alternative is (c). So why work? If Mr. Killian is serious about getting senior citizens to work at the casinos, I suggest he stop cursing the darkness and get busy lighting some candles. For example:
* Start a bus service, so the senior citizens do not have to drive at night and do not have to spend money on automobile upkeep and maintenance. At the same time, he will be doing something good for the environment.
* Lobby Congress to eliminate the ludicrous and outdated 50 percent penalty on Social Security payments due on earnings over $6,840.
* Provide decent working conditions, and treat people with respect and dignity so they will look forward to coming to work.
Anyway, I thought Mr. Killian was even funnier than the Sunday comics in my local newspaper.

HEADLINE: River Pact Urged for 154-Mile Greenway

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

 BODY:
RIVERFRONT communities along the Hudson must cooperate to protect a region so threatened by unplanned development and loss of open space that it could become ''the largest suburb ever built in New York State,'' a state commission reported last week.
But with proper local planning, the authors of the report say, municipalities in the Hudson River Valley, could provide appropriate economic development and protect open land while creating a l54-mile-long ''greenway,'' a network of preserves and parks with open corridors linking the two and stretching from New York City to Albany.
The time has come for the Hudson River Valley ''to think regionally and to act regionally,'' the draft report by the Hudson River Valley Greenway Council said, to preserve a ''sense of place'' in a region where only 4 percent of the 3.9 million acres are protected, where remaining farmland is expected to disappear within 35 years and where one-third of the 42 townships along the river have no public access to it.
 
Council Formed in 1988
The report of the council - appointed by the Governor in 1988 and consisting of 19 members, including state commissioners, heads of ecological organizations and political leaders - outlines a series of steps that communities in the 12 affected counties, including Westchester, must take to preserve the area's cultural identity and natural resources. 
Chief among those steps is the creation of a Hudson River compact to be established among the 82 municipalities bordering the river. Participants in the compact would draw up a series of local plans outlining their own Greenway priorities and guidelines and then work together to address issues of regional planning, public access, economic development including agriculture, natural-resource protection and education. The compact would be enacted by the State Legislature if approved by a referendum of Hudson River Valley communities.
The draft study, compiled after a series of public hearings held regionwide, is now being circulated among municipal and county leaders.
It will be the subject of a second round of hearings, after which the final report will be submitted to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in November.
 
Intelligent Development Is Sought
''We are trying to make local governments aware of how important their riverfront properties are to the whole state,'' George E. Pataki, an Assemblyman from Peekskill and member of the Greenway Council, said last week. ''The idea is not to discourage development but to encourage development that is intelligently planned. We are not saying 'don't develop housing in the Hudson Valley,' but we are saying the housing built on the river should be limited.''
The specific trail that would constitute the Greenway is an attempt to embrace open-space planning, Mr. Pataki said, adding: ''If the trail is surrounded by high-rises and massive development, it will lose much of its impact. What we are trying to do is to preserve the beauty of the natural habitat up and down the river.''
The compact would provide a way for counties facing each other across the river, as for example Westchester and Rockland Counties do, to discuss the mutual impact of their respective development plans and for a newly constituted Greenway Council composed of local and state government officials and representatives of economic development and environmental groups to develop a regional planning strategy.
Although the draft study has not been widely circulated, some government leaders, like the County Planning Commissioner, Peter Q. Eschweiler, are familiar with and critical of a greenway concept that duplicates a planning process already in place. ''They appear to be ignorant of the work already done,'' Mr. Eschweiler said, adding that planning leaders from adjacent counties have met regularly for years.
Greenway planners, Mr. Eschweiler said, ''want other communities to be more like Westchester.'' He said the county already owned a significant amount of parkland that providedpublic access to the Hudson River and had a greenway trail in the Old Croton Aqueduct. ''What better trailway could there be?'' he asked. Working more closely with Putnam County, which borders Westchester, is more important than forming a compact with Rockland County, which he described as being ''three miles away.''
County Legislator Timothy S. Carey said that more regional planning was needed but that he doubted whether communities could count on the uncertain financial resources of the state to help them do it. In the town of Cortlandt, which is in his district, Mr. Carey said, the hamlet of Verplanck is on a river peninsula with no public way to the water.
 
The Role of Communities
It is risky to depend on financing from the state, which Mr. Carey said ''has been retrenching and promising to help, then reneging.'' He added that ''the idea of a compact of the communities is a great idea, but state funding to help them is a big question in my mind.''
Communities would be asked to develop waterfront plans according to broad criteria established by the Greenway Council; plans promoting, for example, water-based industries rather than residential development along the river. Planning strategies that most closely meet the goals of the council would be eligible for financial and technical assistance from a Greenway Conservancy, an organization set up to help carry out projects and help purchase land.
''We are asking communities to develop their waterfronts in a way that does not preclude public access or cut off the view,'' said David S. Sampson, executive director of the Greenway Council. ''We are asking that they not develop their open space but concentrate economic development in spaces already used for that purpose. Those that do will have conservancy assistance.''
 
Local Support a Key
The success of the program will depend on local support for it, both Mr. Sampson and Mr. Pataki agreed. ''The state must provide incentives to local governments to participate in a meaningful way and to purchase open space,'' Mr. Pataki said. Such incentives, he said, should include priority consideration for communities that want Environmental Quality Bond Act funds, which provide money to purchase open space.
Croton-on-Hudson is one municipality that is seeking bond act money to purchase a strip of undeveloped land on the river at Mariner Cove for a municipal park, Mayor Salvatore P. Vassallo said. ''We have one of the most beautiful areas along the Hudson, but we already have one development, Half Moon Bay, which has taken up quite a bit of the waterfront,'' the Mayor said, adding that the public does have access to the river through those condominiums. To buy the Mariner Cove property would cost at least $6 million, Mr. Vassallo said, adding, ''We can't even think about it.''
The owners of the property appeared before the Croton Zoning Board of Appeals last week to request permission to build 216 marina slips, a 120-seat restaurant, a 25-unit hotel and a ''boatel,'' or boat-storage area on the site. Although the owners, Seprieo Associates of Sarasota, Fla., have been trying for nearly a decade to find a use that Croton municipal leaders will permit, Mayor Vassallo said the village waterfront had experienced enough development and would continue searching for alternatives.
 
Looking at a Model
In neighboring Peekskill, city planners seem to have recognized the values of their waterfront and to have incorporated those values in a comprehensive plan for the 400-acre site, which is almost entirely owned by the city. Peekskill was cited by Greenway Council leaders as a model for other riverfront communities who might join the proposed Hudson River compact.
Peekskill, said Joseph J. Seymour, the city manager, has steadily acquired its waterfront through a series of negotiations over the last 15 years, ranging from the purchase of property from the Penn Central Railroad to the acquisition of a 75-acre parcel with $1.5 million from the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation. The park has a boat-launching site, picnic areas and concert space looking out toward Peekskill Bay, Thunderbird Mountain, Bear Mountain and Harriman State Park, a view Mr. Seymour called ''one of the most beautiful on the East Coast.''
The city recently completed an $86,000 waterfront master plan with the help of Sasaki Associates of Watertown, Mass., internationally known planner, which establishes guidelines protecting open space and sets architectural standards and height and density limitations.
Six weeks ago, Peekskill got a $750,000 grant from the state's Environmental Quality Bond Act appropriation to acquire easements and to develop linear parks in the hills overlooking the city that have majestic views of the Hudson. ''We are literally bringing waterfront development to a new level,'' Mr. Seymour said.
He said preserving the Peekskill waterfront provided ''a unique opportunity to enhance the desirability of our community.''
''It makes people want to come and live and work here,'' Mr. Seymour added. ''Our waterfront is the future of this city, an asset that can be a catalytic opportunity for growth in other areas of Peekskill.''
Greenway hearings will be held in Nyack on June 27 and in Yonkers on Aug. l6. Copies of the study are avialable from the Greenway Council office in Albany and the telephone number is (518) 426-0667.

HEADLINE: Prying Out the Secrets of Co-op Sales

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
WHO really knows what a New York City cooperative apartment is worth?
''If you hunt around you find these things out,'' said Richard R. Pergolis, president of the Greater New York Chapter of the American Society of Real Estate Appraisers. ''But it would sure make life easier if we had a central body of information on sales.''
The difficulty stems from one of the many idiosyncracies of the co-op market: Precise, reliable information on recent selling prices and the volume of sales is not available at City Hall, the Register of Deeds or any other official source.
Lenders, appraisers, economists, buyers and sellers found the lack of information easier to accept during the city's housing boom of the mid-80's, when the only real question was how fast prices were rising. But with the market now in a slump, some maintain that better information on sales is becoming critical. 
''One of the things that makes markets efficient is a broad range of information, and you just don't have it in New York City,'' said Eugene Sherman, chief economist of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.
Sales information is scarce because owning a co-op is different from owning any other form of residential real estate, at least in the eyes of the law. Someone who buys a house or a condominium receives a deed and the transfer of the property is recorded with government authorities. In almost all cases, information on the transfer, including the selling price, is available to anyone who bothers to look it up.
By contrast, someone buying a co-op gets shares in the corporation that owns the building and a proprietary lease entitling him to live in the apartment. That is regarded as a transfer of personal property and there is no deed to record. And though the selling price must be reported to the state and city governments for tax purposes, stringent rules of confidentiality make it impossible for the public to get that information.
Thus, most New Yorkers in the market for a co-op must judge value, not always reliably, on what they can learn from brokers or from those who already live in co-ops, people who sometimes, but not always, know recent selling prices.
Those hoping for help from the news media get a broader picture of the market, but that picture is limited by the narrow range of reliable data available even to the brokers and lenders who are the only sources of information about sales. Most brokers have knowledge only of the sales they arrange and of a limited number more they learn of through co-broking and informal information sharing.
THE larger brokerages have been producing surveys intended to track sales and price trends. But these industry analyses, distributed widely among real estate professionals and to the media, provide little more than snapshots of the market.
They rely on samplings of recent sales that are too small to reflect the entire market or use theoretical calculations to estimate other selling prices. The surveys, moreover, focus on expensive properties in Manhattan and virtually ignore sales in the city's four other boroughs.
''Everywhere in the nation besides New York, real estate sales are reported and available to the public,'' said Clark Halstead, president of Halstead Properties, one of the Manhattan brokerages that have been trying to track the co-op market. Despite the efforts of his and other concerns, he said, ''we really know nothing.''
Recent changes in tax policies might have opened the door to more information. Since last July, the state and the city have been assessing a real property transfer tax - previously assessed only on houses, condominiums and commercial property - on co-op sales. Sellers of co-ops must now report precisely how much they have received for their homes.
But little of the information is likely to be released. The State Department of Taxation and Finance said it planned within the next six months to begin reporting ''aggregated'' information on co-ops, including the number and dollar volume of sales for each county. But it said it would not disclose specific information on the sale of individual apartments because of tax-law provisions covering the secrecy of individual tax returns.
The city's Department of Finance said it, too, was considering some kind of aggregated analysis, based on receipts from the co-op transfer taxes. Kathleen Grimm, the First Deputy Finance Commissioner, said the analysis might be started as part of a five-year plan to upgrade the department's computerized record keeping.
But the city is clearly determined not to reveal individual selling prices. Last year, faced with a lawsuit aimed at opening up its books on co-op sales, the Koch administration sought and received from Albany a new law that strengthens the city's administrative code and protects information on individual co-op sales, even if formal requests for access are filed under the Freedom of Information Act.
Mrs. Grimm said the city regarded information derived from the transfer tax on co-op sales as confidential in the same way it regards income-tax returns.
''At this point the law is clear,'' she said. ''The intent of the city is to protect the traditional secrecy of taxpayers.''
Still, the secrecy sets New York City - the only major metropolitan center where co-ops are a significant part of the market - apart from the rest of the nation. From the eastern tip of Long Island to the western shores of Hawaii, almost every sale of a residential property is reported to public agencies and is almost always available for scrutiny.
Indeed, most buyers and sellers elsewhere in the nation find it easy to get information on recent sales of houses and condominiums in their communities. They can go to their town halls and do the research themselves or they can get the data from brokers.
The prices paid for comparable properties in recent sales are reliable guides to value. Sales of ''comparables'' are the standard used by professional appraisers and by lenders when they decide how large a mortgage to offer a home buyer.
''New York City is manic,'' said John Striker, publisher of the New York Co-op & Condo Insider, a monthly publication, and its parent company, Brownstone Publishers. ''It makes it virtually impossible to get access to information that is vital to a free market.''
It was Mr. Striker's company that sued in an attempt to have co-op sales information made available by the city. Even without the access he hoped to get, his publication reports selling prices on more than 100 apartments each month with information it gets from brokers and appraisers.
The New York Times also publishes selling prices of co-ops each week in the Residential Resales column of the Sunday real estate section. The newspaper gets its information from brokerages and management companies that are willing to share their knowledge of closing prices.
Even real estate professionals say finding comparative sales figures on co-ops apartments can be difficult.
The New York City Real Estate Board, a trade group, said that in the late 80's it considered starting a broad analysis of co-op sales based on the activity of its member brokerage firms, including most of the brokers in the city.
But, it said, large firms with enough sales volume to track meaningful trends declined to share their information with smaller competitors, and the city-wide analysis has not been attempted.
''You have to do a lot of digging,'' said Anthony Lama, a New York City appraiser. Like others in the profession, he is often employed by banks to make sure their loans do not exceed the value of the homes their borrowers want to buy.
Usually, Mr. Lama said, co-op boards or their managing agents will volunteer information to appraisers, although they are under no obligation to do so. Appraisers also keep their own detailed records on sales and sometimes share them with others in the profession, he said.
Nonetheless, Mr. Lama said the relative scarcity of information on co-ops in New York City is a growing topic of debate, particularly because of the problems faced by lenders who have made bad real estate loans in the Southwest, some parts of New England and elsewhere.
''With all the hullaballoo, one of the problems at banks with bad real estate loans has been a failure to ascertain real value,'' he said, adding that there is a potential for problems among cooperative purchasers in New York City ''because there is no public record.''
The real estate industry surveys, conducted by brokerage and cooperative management concerns, try to dissect the market in many ways. Mr. Halstead reports average asking prices of apartments, but gives no indication if the apartments have sold and how much was received.
ANOTHER survey, begun this year by L. B. Kaye Associates, a residential brokerage in Manhattan, reports the average prices paid for co-ops in the first quarter of the year, but the analysis covered only 221 sales, a tiny sampling of the total sales in the city.
''It is an inexact science,'' said Marilyn Kaye, the firm's president.
A broader survey of selling prices had been conducted by Douglas Elliman, a large management and brokerage firm that until mid-1989 had been reporting prices and the number of sales in 200 buildings that it managed. The survey has not been released for more than six months.
However, Allan Rogers, managing director of Douglas Elliman, said the firm was revising its survey techniques and would begin reporting its findings on a regular basis again by this summer.
The most widely reported survey, by the Corcoran Group, tries to track many more transactions. The brokerage said it analyzed 2,463 co-op sales completed in 1989 and estimated that the average selling price per room, $108,040, had declined 9.2 percent.
''I include every listing I can get in my greedy little hands,'' said Barbara Corcoran, the firm's president, who said she included information on every apartment offered by her own firm, either exclusively or through co-brokerage agreements with others, and had her staff check frequently over the phone and through personal contacts what apartments sold for even if the deals were struck by other brokerage houses.
One limitation of the surveys is that they tend to focus on the upper end of the market. While part of Mr. Halstead's analysis tracks the asking prices for ''silk stocking'' apartments along Park and Fifth Avenues and at other prestigious locations - priced at over $800,000 for two bedrooms - comparable surveys are not available for Brooklyn, Queens or elsewhere in the city where prices are much lower.
Another problem is that even the industry professionals have limited access to information.
''It is a pain in the neck,'' complained Ms. Corcoran, who said she would much prefer ''open access'' to co-op sales information. Mr. Halstead said he warns every customer who reads his survey: ''Thou shalt not price an apartment based on the information contained within.''
To be sure, a scarcity of sales information is only one of the vagaries of the cooperative market, in which some fortunate buyers have been blessed by almost instantaneous wealth by paying cut-rate ''insider'' prices for their rented apartments in conversions. In established co-ops, the bids of buyers have been rejected simply because the boards of directors did not approve of their style of living or found their pockets not deep enough.
While some real estate professionals believe the lack of public disclosure on sales is a troublesome restraint on the market, others say it has not created major problems in the past and is not likely to in the future.
''I don't think we have a problem in terms of values not being understood by appraisers,'' said Steve Rotella, a senior vice president for Chemical Bank. ''I don't recall a situation where we have not been able to obtain information on comparable sales.''
Like most other New York City lenders, Chemical commissions outside appraisers to evaluate co-op apartments before it approves loan applications. In most cases, he said, the appraisers can find recent selling prices by asking co-op management firms, boards of buildings or others in the industry, and their appraisals are submitted to an internal review by a committee of Chemical loan officers.
Others say the difficulty of getting information is not likely to lead the New York City cooperative market into the kind of boom-and-bust cycle that has occurred in Texas and some other parts of the Southwest.
''YOU might have perfectly solid information on recent sales, but that is not much help if those recent sales went for wildly inflated prices,'' said Mr. Sherman, the economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank. He added that the deep real estate depression in the Southwest resulted from much more fundamental economic problems - like the thousands of jobs that were lost when oil prices collapsed - that had nothing to do with public access to government sales records.
Nonetheless, Mr. Sherman said, ''even if recent sales were inflated, it is better to know what they were than rely on somebody's guess.''
Brokers, appraisers and others in the New York City real estate industry say the boards of many cooperative buildings have grown less insistent in recent years about keeping their sales information private. Most are willing to help appraisers and lenders, they say, but still refuse to volunteer information on recent sales directly to prospective buyers.
Indeed, without public disclosure by the government, the flow of information on co-op sales is now controlled almost entirely by individual apartment owners and their boards. In all co-ops, board members are informed of selling prices. In most, but not all buildings, other shareholders are told as well.
Lawyers say one open legal question is whether shareholders in a cooperative are entitled to specific selling prices if they demand the information from their boards.
''A proprietary lease says the shareholder is entitled to inspect the books and records of the co-op, but what that means is open to interpretation,'' said Marc Luxemburg, a Manhattan attorney who is president if the Council of New York Cooperatives.
Although the matter has not been tested in court, he said that most shareholders are informed of selling prices directly by their boards or through word of mouth from other shareholders.
A result is a grapevine that sometimes extends to outsiders. Someone with a friend in a co-op building has a better chance of finding out about recent selling prices in the building than someone without such a source.
''My guess is that all kinds of people know what apartments here have gone for,'' said Wayde Harrison, president of the board of a co-op with 40 apartments on Pierrepont Street in Brooklyn Heights. Nonetheless, he added, his board's official policy is not to disclose the information to prospective buyers until after they have signed a sales contract.
At the Carlton House, a cooperative with 144 apartments in Jackson Heights, Queens, Beverly O'Reilly, president of the co-op board, said she would give a ''ball park figure'' to brokers or prospective buyers inquiring about what apartments had sold for in the past. ''Most of our brokers know this building and have a pretty good idea anyway,'' she added.
But information is often harder to come by in Manhattan, particularly at buildings with the most expensive apartments.
''I just don't see the need for public disclosure, and I think the government should be less intrusive into the affairs of co-ops, not more so,'' said Marsha Hunter, president of the board and managing agent at 123 West 74th Street, a building with 42 apartments.
Like some other Manhattan co-ops, the one managed by Mrs. Hunter does not reveal the exact selling prices of apartments even to others who live in the same building. Instead, she said, twice each year she circulates information on recent selling prices broken down on a price-per-share basis without specifying sellers or apartment numbers.
And, as is common among co-op boards in Manhattan, the one at 123 West 74th Street is not forthcoming when a prospective buyer seeks information on what the apartment he wants, or one similar to it, has sold for in the past.
''This information is between you and the board,'' Mrs. Hunter said.

HEADLINE: Focus: The I-5 Corridor;
A Lively New Washington Growth Area

BYLINE: By HARRIET KING

 BODY:
ONLY three years ago, the suburban community of Everett, Wash., 30 miles north of Seattle, was hobbled by a recession that enveloped the Pacific Northwest. Now commercial activity there is among the strongest in the country, and growth, accompanied by residential and retail construction, is expected to continue until well into the mid-90's.
Evidence of this can be found in the expansion taking place in a wide swath along the Interstate 5 corridor stretching south for 250 miles from Everett to Vancouver near the Oregon border and north about 80 miles to the Canadian border. Among the elements in that expansion are the following:
* The Boeing Company, which makes 747 and 767 jetliners in Everett, recently acquired 300 adjacent acres to expand by four million square feet at a cost of up to $1.5 billion over the next few years. This is attracting aircraft parts suppliers and high-tech and related companies.
* In March, the CornerstoneColumbia Development Company of Seattle, a subsidiary of the Weyerhaeuser Corporation, the timber company, bought 300 acres of forest in Everett. The previous owner, Washington Services of Seattle, had put in roads and underground utilities for an industrial park to be called Seaway Center. 
Cornerstone plans a campus-like industrial park, with 200,000 square feet of warehouse and distribution space to be built this summer and 100,000 square feet more each year for the next 8 to 10 years.
* With Seatac - the Seattle-Tacoma Airport - nearing capacity, Paine Field airport here is expected to become a major hub for the distribution of commercial goods.
If the Navy carries out its plans to make Everett the home port for the nuclear aircraft carrier Nimitz, it could affect expansion plans, which are still nebulous.
Despite the growth, economic problems persist in many rural counties that depend on the forest-products industry, which underwent a shakeout in the early 80's. Moreover, efforts to save the threatened spotted owl and the remnants of once-extensive old-growth forest in which it lives may ban logging in a million acres of that forest.
IN an effort to diversify or lure new commercial business, 22 of the hardest hit rural counties are offering a deferral of an 8 percent sales tax on construction materials as an incentive. The tax is a state levy, but under the state's sales-tax-deferral program counties can defer payment of the sales tax on construction materials for new plants for three years and then extend payment of that tax for five more years.
''The Boeing Company to some extent drives the economy,'' said Richard Bristow, executive director in Seattle for the Associated General Contractors of America. Boeing has an $84 billion order backlog for 1,700 jetliners that are produced mostly here.
Robert MacMillan, Cornerstone's vice president of development, said the company plans to invest about $100 million a year for the next eight years in the Seaway Center area, two miles west of I-5. It intends, he said, to focus on companies seeking build-to-suit facilities and corporate users looking for a campuslike setting on land worth about $5 a square foot.
It will be leased at 31 cents a square foot a month, the going rate in the area.
Seaway Center has been developed so far as a ''smart park'' with sophisticated telecommunications services already in place. Roads have been built to accommodate 29,000 vehicle trips a day and the developer plans to add nature trails, a day-care center, retail and other support services.
A decade ago, construction began about five miles south of here on Harbour Pointe, a 2,000-acre planned housing development that was ultimately to have 4,300 units of single-family detached houses, town houses and apartments. But the project lanquished, with only 400 dwellings built by the time it was bought in January 1989 from BCE Development Corporation of Vancouver, B.C., by Harbour Pointe Limited Partnership. Dennis Vrabek of Bellevue, Wash., and Roger Belanich of Seattle are the general partners of Harbour Pointe and Weyerhaeuser Venture Company is the limited partner.
With Everett now a ''hot spot,'' Mr. Vrabek said, the complex has 1,736 units built or being built, with completion of the whole project expected in five to seven years.
Three years ago, Honeywell Marine Systems Division moved into a 330,000-square-foot building in a 400-acre business park at Harbour Pointe. It was the first tenant and the new developer has begun preparing the partly forested site.
In Bellingham, about 20 miles from the Canadian border, there is so much commercial growth - total building permits last year were valued at $90 million, compared with $30 million in 1985, said Mr. Bristow of the contractors' association, that his group is considering opening an office there. Much of the growth, he said, caters to British Columbians who swarm down I-5 to shop.
The Canadian-American free trade agreement also is attracting so many Canadian companies and developers to border counties - Whatcom and Skagit - that some people are starting to call the I-5 strip between Everett and Canada the Can/Am Corridor. While retail sales statewide grew only 9 percent last year, according to William Geyer, Bellingham's director of planning and economic development, they grew 23 percent in Whatcom County, with 45 to 50 percent of the growth attributable to Canadians, compared with 23 percent five years ago.
''Canadians come down here wearing shorts and a tee shirt and head back wearing three sweaters, coat and hat,'' he said.
In Clark County, the southernmost Washington county on I-5, the Columbia River towns of Vancouver, Camus and Washougal also are attracting development. Employment at the end of 1989 was 112,800, a 27 percent increase over 1984, and several hundred more jobs a year for the next 10 years are expected to develop.
In late March, Sharp Microelectronics Corporation opened a $33 million, 102,000-square foot integrated-circuit plant on Prune Hill in Vancouver, Wash., and SEH America, which makes integrated-circuit wafers, is adding 120,000 square feet to its existing 25,000-square-foot fabrication there.
Robert Levin, executive director of the Columbia River Economic Development Council, said Clark County is attracting commercial activity because of I-5, major ports and the promximity of Portland International Airport, 10 minutes south of Vancouver.
About 10,000 of the 113,000 people in Clark County's labor pool commute daily from Oregon and county officials compete head to head with Oregon in attempts to lure plants. Even so the county's economy is so closely linked with Portland's that many residents align themselves more closely in spirit to Oregon than to Washington.
Yet neighboring counties that depend on forestry-product industries are not sharing the growth. Skamania County, adjacent to Clark, has been depressed because of lumber mill closings since the early 80's and unemployment there is 21.5 percent, the highest in the state.
But Harry Berryman, the state's director of business expansion, said, without further elaboration, that a forestry products company might locate in Skamania County, attacted by the sale-tax deferral, and become a major employer.
Mr Levin, too, is encouraged by the willingness of companies to locate in rural areas because they can be connected to larger cities electronically. He said this means some out-of-the-mainstream communites will be able to attract commercial business that just a few years earlier might have opted for an urban setting.
The Port of Port Angeles, a special-purpose district authorized by the state and created by voters in Clallam County, near the Washington coast, for example, five years ago attracted the Rogerson Hiller Corporation, which makes aircraft components. The city and the Clallam County Economic Development Counciul, a private nonprofit corporation, which Mr. Levin headed at the time, got the company to lease 140,00 square feet in four buildings on a lease-purchase agreement at 15 cnets a square foot a month. The buildings were constructed by the port and, three years ago the company exercised its option to buy them for $2.5 million.

HEADLINE: WHY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T KNOW JUST ASK E.D. HIRSCH

BYLINE: By Christopher Hitchens: Christopher Hitchens is a columnist for Harper's Magazine and The Nation. His new book, ''Blood, Class and Nostalgia: Anglo-American Ironies,'' will be published next month by Farrar, Straus & Giroux.

 BODY:
CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA., IS AN IDEAL SITE FORJU the study of American rhythms and continuities. On the famous lawn of the University of Virginia is the cloister where Edgar Allan Poe had his quarters - commemorated today by a plaque reading domus parva magni poetae. On a hill 10 miles away is Monticello, the exquisite home that Thomas Jefferson built for himself, with its slave quarters still visible (even more limited in space and comfort than Poe's), and another touching memorial, a stone obelisk at Jefferson's grave recalling his role as author of the Declaration of Independence and the Virginia Statute on Religious Liberty, and as founder of the university. It modestly and perhaps ironically omits his Presidency from the list of accomplishments. 
Yet according to a nationwide survey, mandated by Congress and carried out in 1988 by the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the chances of a 17-year-old American being able to say anything meaningful about Thomas Jefferson are disconcertingly slight. The chances of the same student knowing anything significant about Poe, or slavery, or of being able to translate the most elementary Latin (''a small home for a great poet''), or even being able to define the word ''ironic'' are slighter still. But, from this Virginian retreat, a self-proclaimed crusade against noneducation is getting under way. In a ridiculous half-timbered pseudo-English building in Charlottesville, the Cultural Literacy Foundation, and its president, E. D. Hirsch Jr., monitor the spread of ignorance and illiteracy in the United States and make proposals for remedying it.
Hirsch, the Linden Kent Professor of English at the University of Virginia, has achieved best-sellerdom with his books ''Cultural Literacy: What Every American Needs to Know'' and ''The Dictionary of Cultural Literacy'' and is on his way to even greater sales with ''A First Dictionary of Cultural Literacy.'' All three have been praised and mocked for trying to summarize essential knowledge in indexes or digests that run from Aaron, Henry, through agribusiness, Clemens, Samuel L., and homeostasis all the way through to noblesse oblige, yuppies and Zapata. Yet Hirsch, who has just completed a cross-country book tour, shrugs off those who laugh at his pedagogic efforts. ''At least,'' he says, ''we are trying to establish a core curriculum.'' ''Core curriculum'' is the key phrase at the foundation -the goal toward which everything is pointed. Unless and until American schools establish a common body of shared and imbibed knowledge, Hirsch argues, there will continue to be chaos and decline in the classroom. And not just in the classroom but further up. A survey by the National Endowment for the Humanities last year found that more than half of the college seniors taking a history and literature test were flunking it in absurd ways. Sixty-one percent did not know where ''the shot heard round the world'' was fired; nearly half didn't know who wrote ''Moby-Dick,'' and nearly 80 percent did not know what the Emancipation Proclamation did.
While at the foundation, I took Hirsch's test for cultural literacy, or a pilot version of it mailed out to a random sample of 500 American attorneys. They were chosen as a profession (Continued on Page 59) for their ostensibly broad academic background - undergraduate plus graduate education - and asked to answer questions like these:
The principal character in Arthur Miller's play ''Death of a Salesman'' is:
 
a) Willy Loman
 
b) Stanley Spencer
 
c) John Smith
 
d) Babbitt
 
e) Tom Joad
A solid-state electronic device does not use:
 
a) insulators
 
b) transistors
 
c) vacuum tubes
 
d) integrated circuits
 
e) semiconductors Very few of the questions were more taxing than the two above - one involved knowing that Nixon rather than Hoover, Carter, Roosevelt or Truman had resigned over Watergate; another that Anne Boleyn, and not Queen Victoria, had been beheaded by Henry VIII - and the average score was 91 to 92 percent. The lawyers were trusted not to cheat in the privacy of their own offices. You will be reassured to learn that your correspondent achieved 98.2 percent when doing the test under supervision, getting the solid-state question wrong and repeating a nagging boyhood blunder about the gerund.
But what could one say of a person who scored low on such a test? How many allusions in daily reading and discourse would he be bound to miss?
Hirsch remembers the day in 1978 when, as he puts it, ''my life changed.'' He and some colleagues had been running a test on readability in prose. They were trying to see in what ways clarity of style influenced comprehension. The correlation between the two seemed simple enough, and Hirsch was encouraged to find that ''students showed a definite sensitivity to the stylistic superiority of one version over another.''
But the test that had been applied to the young people at the university hit a snag when it was applied, for comparative purposes, to the students of J. Sargent Reynolds Community College in Richmond. The decoding skills of these poor and minority students were just as developed as those of their counterparts in the sylvan surround of Charlottesville. But they broke down sooner; in fact they began to break down whenever background knowledge was involved.
The University of Virginia students had shown a decline in comprehension when faced with a passage about Hegel's ''Metaphysics.'' The community college students had comparable difficulty when reading an account of Lee's surrender to Grant at Appomattox. The reason? Most of them had not heard of Lee, didn't know who Grant was, were seeing the name Appomattox for the first time. And these students were Virginians.
That did it for Hirsch. He wanted to know who had let these students down, and how, and why. From being a literary critic and analyst - his ''Philosophy of Composition'' and ''Validity in Interpretation'' are still much discussed among English scholars - he became a committed educational reformer. He delivered a paper at the Modern Language Association in 1981, suggesting that there was a strong connection between cultural illiteracy and the other kind. After an expanded version of the paper, entitled ''Cultural Literacy,'' appeared in the spring 1983 issue of The American Scholar, Hirsch was approached by the Exxon Education Foundation, which urged him to undertake more systematic research and provided some of the means for it. Other educationists, notably Diane Ravitch at Columbia University, got in touch. A team was set up to try to compile the necessary minimum of American general knowledge. (The team's recommendations appear as an appendix to the book.) In 1986, Hirsch founded the Cultural Literacy Foundation, with the purpose of developing a core curriculum and pilot programs for teaching it in the elementary schools. Originally the foundation received grants from Exxon and the National Endowment for the Humanities; today, Hirsch himself provides most of the financing. He and two part-time workers send out information on the core curriculum to the foundation's 2,500 or so members and hold seminars and workshops on how to get ''shared content'' into schools.
PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT to Hirsch's endeavors, in the climate of opinion then being generated by the Reagan Administration, talk of ''standards'' was all the rage. When William Bennett became Secretary of Education, he was able to make names like E. D. Hirsch and Allan Bloom part of the unofficial national curriculum.
Actually, the propaganda connection made between his own work and Allan Bloom's forthrightly elitist and conservative ''The Closing of the American Mind'' is a source of unease to Hirsch. Politically liberal, he grew up in Marvell, Ark., where his father ran Hirsch's General Store and then flourished in the cotton business in Memphis, where Eric Donald was born in 1928. At the age of 11, he read Gunnar Myrdal's study of the pathology of racism, ''An American Dilemma'' (he attributes his precocity to the virtues of ''a traditional education'') and rebelled against the Southern ethos.
At Cornell University, where he decided forever against the cotton business, Hirsch led an eclectic life, discovered that he wasn't cut out to be a chemist, attended Nabokov's lectures on Russian literature and became hooked on English. Two years in the Navy punctuated his progress, via postgraduate study in Paris and Berlin, through teaching posts at Yale to the professorship at the University of Virginia, which came in 1966. By then he had published an award-winning study of William Blake.
Hirsch looks younger than his 61 years, with an open, rather smooth countenance and a ready, even smile. In conversation, he's committed to talking as if everything were plain and reasonable if not common-sensical; easy enough to resolve if only good will were brought to bear. He wears a pained expression when he discusses the frequent allegation that he's an elitist and a reactionary.
''Allan Bloom's original title was to be 'Souls Without Longing,' '' says Hirsch. ''He's concerned with the spiritual condition of undergraduates at elite universities. I'm interested in the social injustice further down. So I don't see why our books are reviewed together - we aren't part of the same temper of the times. The problem isn't in the colleges. It's in the very early grades that children are being let down.''
During dinner at his house, Hirsch elaborates his disagreements with Bloom and with the whole school of the political philosopher Leo Strauss that Bloom represents. He disagrees with Bloom philosophically for his exclusive stress on Plato and Aristotle (''I'm sure that if Plato hadn't been against music with a strong sexual beat, Bloom would have kept quiet about rock-and-roll''). He dislikes what he terms the antiscientism of the Bloomites (''If there isn't a fact-value distinction, then we are in deep, deep trouble''). And he is an egalitarian (''My proposals are antitracking, antidiscrimination. They are designed to rescue the poor and the underclass''). Most of all, he considers himself a disciple of the optimistic Enlightenment tradition. ''Bloom asked me to a conference in Paris, which was basically one five-star meal and one undemanding seminar every day for five days,'' he recalls. ''The subject was 'The Decline of the West'! I can't see why these guys love Heidegger and Nietzsche and all the enemies of the Enlightenment.''
Yet, in seeking to restore the teaching of fact and information in schools, Hirsch and his allies repeatedly come up against what might be called ''progressive'' impressions. The current educational consensus is deeply in debt to the ideas of Rousseau and Dewey - to the notion that a growing child must be taught self-confidence, ''skills'' and other interpretations of its own ''potential.'' Moreover, and perhaps more powerful because partly subliminal, somewhere in the back of the mind of many educated liberals is the following imperishable memory:
''Now, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else. You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon Facts; nothing else will ever be of service to them.'' (Charles Dickens, ''Hard Times'') ''I recall positive orgies of dates, with the keener boys leaping up and down in their places in their eagerness to shout out the right answers, and at the same time not feeling the faintest interest in the meaning of the mysterious events they were naming.'' (George Orwell, ''Such, Such Were the Joys'')
DICKENS AND ORWELLJU have probably been more influential than Dewey or Rousseau in turning liberals against ''traditional values'' in education. And they make formidable adversaries. Hirsch concedes that there is force to the critique of rote learning and utilitarianism, but points out mildly that the liberal critics already know the facts they affect to despise, and must have learned them somehow. Don't they care that the poor students are so ignorant of what they take for granted?
Besides, he insists, ''Rousseau's theory is based on a tutorial system. But learning in our culture takes place in classrooms where you can't have a one-on-one tutorial. You have to build knowledge on what the children already know, which means that you must know what they know, and also that they must possess shared knowledge.''
In a now celebrated example of this approach, which led to a public exchange in The New York Review of Books with Herbert Kohl, champion of the ''progressive'' educational faction, Hirsch wrote: ''Consider now the primal scene of education in the modern elementary school. Let us assume that a teacher wishes to inform a class of some 20 pupils about the structure of atoms, and that she plans to base the day's instruction on an analogy with the solar system. She knows that the instruction will be effective only to the extent that all the students in the class already know about the solar system. A good teacher would probably try to find out. 'Now, class, how many of you know about the solar system?' Fifteen hands go up. Five stay down. What is a teacher to do in this typical circumstance in the contemporary American school?
''If he or she pauses to explain the solar system, a class period is lost, and 15 of the 20 students are bored and deprived of knowledge for that day. If the teacher plunges ahead with atomic structure, the hapless five - they are most likely to be poor or minority students - are bored, humiliated and deprived, because they cannot comprehend the teacher's explanation.''
Hirsch insisted that ''analogy forms part of the very texture of a teacher's discourse. Teachers refer constantly to concepts like Cinderella or the American Revolution in order to connect new pieces of information with things that are already familiar.'' Kohl ridiculed Hirsch's approach as formalism, proposing instead that the following method be employed:
''Ask one of the children to stand up, and then ask another to get up and walk around the first. Then have a third child walk around the first child, only in a larger orbit. Continue this with the whole class illustrating an orbiting structure. As a next step ask students to think of different natural phenomena that could be modeled by their little dance. Through questioning, discussion and, when necessary, the teacher providing information, the class would come to the notion that the solar system and the molecular system are similar orbiting structures.
''Someone might even note that some social systems have a central body and orbiting smaller bodies, and the teacher might bring up Le Roi Soleil and the analogy that title implies between Louis XIV and the solar system.''
Kohl, who wrote ''The Open Classroom'' in 1969, stressed the importance of disadvantaged students no less than Hirsch. He also proudly underlined the origins of his method in the work of John Dewey, Frances T. Parker and other proponents of ''experientially based education.'' Hirsch only just managed to be polite in his reply:
''Let's assume that using the analogy is an acceptable way to teach sixth graders who, at age 11 or so, are not ready to deal with quantum-theoretical conceptions. Let's also assume that Kohl is teaching the class beautifully, in exactly the way he imagines in his letter. Then, the class ends, and another class of sixth graders arrives to learn the same things from him. But the social background of the second group is very different from that of the first.
''These pupils show themselves to be resistant to Kohl's teaching strategy. They complain that moving about the room in orbits is 'too first-gradish'; they decline to get the larger point; they clown, and feel uneasy; they resent the whole exercise. . . . If Kohl wishes to suggest that successful classroom learning doesn't depend on students sharing extensive background knowledge, then, with regard to that particular issue, I have no hesitancy in saying he doesn't know what he's talking about.''
HIRSCH HAS PROBABLYJU made his own life harder, in this classic exchange with the Deweyites and in other jousts with ''progressives,'' by employing a language of rigorous practicality and utility. His general principle of learning ''could be described,'' he wrote, ''in an analogy with economics, as earning new wealth from old intellectual capital. A diligent first grader who starts off with a dollar's worth of intellectual capital will be able to put it to work to gain, say, 15 percent per year. But a child who starts out with a dime's worth will not only gain less new intellectual wealth in absolute terms, but will earn even that pittance at a lower annual rate, say 7 percent.''
Hirsch went on to speak of ''low educational productivity,'' saying that it now correlated with economic productivity much more closely than before. Much of this came in the context of his insistent pointing out that the United States is very low on international league tables of educational attainment, its 14-year-olds ranking, in the 1988 report of the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement, ''third to last out of 17 countries'' in science, beating only Hong Kong and the Philippines.
The ''fit'' between this kind of argument and the educational rhetoric of William Bennett has caused Hirsch's critics to accuse him of viewing education as a tool of socioeconomic engineering; a weapon in international competition overseas, and vocational, narrow training at home. ''He forgets,'' said Kohl, ''that there is more to learning in Germany and Japan than being able to recognize the kind of nationalistic cliches, names, dates, places, titles that characterize a good percentage of his list.''
Hirsch wears a look of bewilderment when this sort of attack is mounted. ''The United States is the only developed country that doesn't have a core curriculum,'' he says in the foundation's offices. ''My book is only a theory of the core curriculum - it's not the last word on what it should be. But why don't they want us to have one?''
His director at the Cultural Literacy Foundation, James D. Watkinson, breaks in at this point to say that under the headline of ''Things You Should Know,'' USA Today recently offered a sample from the index of ''Cultural Literacy.'' ''We said that by the end of sixth grade, kids should know the whereabouts on the map of Micronesia, Zimbabwe and Tel Aviv. They should recognize the terms Monroe Doctrine and underground railroad. They should know who Sojourner Truth, William the Conqueror, Mao Zedong, Louis XIV and Sitting Bull were.
''A woman who ran a radio show in New York called up and said she had never heard of Micronesia, or of Sojourner Truth. Well, the United States only happens to own Micronesia and to use it for nuclear tests.'' This doesn't quite seem the language of nationalist cliche.
Still, the shoals of race and gender are the ones that loom before Hirsch and threaten to crunch his frail bark. Members of the ''cultural left,'' as he calls it, are already suspicious of the existing Scholastic Aptitude Tests because they are said to be culturally biased. A national standard curriculum, they imply, would simply impose the dominant values upon women and minorities. This was argued very strongly by Robert Scholes, professor of humanities at Brown University, in the journal College English in 1988: ''For Hirsch, just knowing the names of the great books and authors will suffice. Both Hirsch and Bloom share, however, a nostalgia for a not very closely examined past in which things were better.'' The sociologist Stanley Aronowitz and the educationist Henry A. Giroux were even more withering, accusing Hirsch of arguing ''for a form of cultural uniformity'' and of having an insipid, one-dimensional view of history. ''Culture,'' they wrote, ''is about the production and legitimation of particular ways of life, and schools often transmit a culture that is specific to class, gender and race. Hirsch ends up with a view of literacy cleansed of its own complicity in furthering cultural practices and ideologies that reproduce the worst dimensions of schooling.''
Hirsch is impatient with such objections. ''Do you know the mural at City College in New York, which shows the immigrants being blessed by the Goddess of Education? Well, that's my ideal. Assimilation. That's how everyone else did it, and we know it works.'' He has doubts about the usefulness of the term ''cultural literacy,'' though he knows he's stuck with it by now. A synonym, he thinks, might be ''acculturation.''
But, I propose, isn't that exactly what his critics suspect him of wanting - the homogenization of America by means of safe, accepted standards? ''All education is going to acculturate anyway - even if only into a subculture,'' Hirsch responds. (For similar reasons, he is unconvinced by arguments against standard English or the canon as instruments of oppression.) ''If it's social change you want, then acculturate first, so that everyone can argue in the same language. The cultural left are willing, for the sake of an ideal or even of a theory that hasn't been fully worked out, to risk condemning a generation to ignorance and therefore to poverty.''
Hirsch sees an irony in the opposition of some minority critics of assimilation, ''who were themselves acculturated and who now want to remove the ladder on whose rungs they rose. I would like very much to get in touch with Jesse Jackson, who often sounds very good when he talks to kids in school, but I suspect that like some other black figures he wouldn't want to support me in public.''
HOW AND WHY DIDJU Hirsch, who had a perfectly agreeable career as a critic and teacher, and who by his own admission has no talent for politics, get involved in the debate on literacy and society in the first place? The incident at J. Sargent Reynolds Community College is anecdotally impressive, but did it occur to a mind that was already prepared for it? Are there any clues in his earlier work?
''Validity in Interpretation,'' published in 1967, is not an easy book, but it makes a fairly simple point. Written as a rebuttal to the deconstructionists, it asserted that language requires authorship. No matter how brilliantly it could be argued that textual meaning is independent of the author's control, it remains the case that the unaided text cannot generate its own meanings. You must posit a meaner who means; therefore motive and intention become important.
Rephrase this to say that in order to get meaning you need context, and there is a noticeable analogy between Hirsch's theory of the text and his views on tuition. Just as a reader, no matter how keen his analytic faculties, cannot divine the meaning of a text without understanding the author's intention and the work's place in a broader literary context, so students cannot hope to make sense of the material they are given in the classroom without a shared pool of basic knowledge.
Then there is the key word of ''Validity in Interpretation,'' which is hermeneutics - the interpretation of texts, whether scriptural or secular. It is, in Hirsch's view, the missing link in deconstructive criticism, because properly handled it supplies the connection between reference and meaning. There is a catch, however, in that the process requires an interpreter or mediator - a Hermes, messenger between the gods and man, who lent his name to the science of hermeneutics. In other words, someone has to be daring and presumptuous enough to put himself forward as an objective, disinterested interpreter - a creature whose existence deconstructionists would deny - and to submit his findings to the general consideration.
So, long before he took up ''cultural literacy'' as a cause, Hirsch had disclosed most of the ingredients and conceptions that now inform his public work. Perhaps most crucial was the hermeneutic concept of a mediator: someone who would propose himself as the taker of responsibility at a time when the main cultural tendency was to say that nothing was anybody's fault.
Despite the mockery and skepticism, Hirsch's steady pressure for a curriculum is producing gradual results. His promotional tour for the ''First Dictionary of Cultural Literacy'' has taken him to, among other places, the Miami Book Fair, where he addressed a meeting of high-school department heads. Out of this came a proposal from Paul Bell, superintendent of Dade County, to run a pilot program for a core curriculum for grades one to six based on Hirsch's teaching materials. An appearance on the Larry King radio show has brought sacks of mail to the Cultural Literacy Foundation. A conference on the core curriculum held in Charlottesville in March brought several dozen principals, teachers, board of education members and education professors.
How interesting are the politics of all this? In one sense, Hirsch is apolitical and cares only for quantifiable or at least testable standards. In another sense, he knows that such a proposition is naive because it challenges a politicized education system. In still another sense, he is the traditional liberal whose aspirations have lately become disconnected from practical politics altogether. ''In the 1984 Democratic campaign,'' he moaned to me at one point, ''the only instantly recognizable slogan was 'Where's the Beef?' In the Dukakis campaign, it was something about Joe Isuzu. What does it say that advertising gimmicks are the only memorable things these days?''
It doesn't say much for the common culture, perhaps. But it does say something about how a common culture is formed. And Hirsch has already made an impression by the same means as Joe Isuzu did: first by finding an unsatisfied want and second by being prepared to repeat himself.

HEADLINE: THE FELIX BLOCH AFFAIR

BYLINE: By David Wise: David Wise is the author of ''The Spy Who Got Away'' and other books about intelligence and espionage.

 BODY:
PARIS IN THE SPRING. IT IS EARLY EVENING ON MAY 14, 1989 , and Felix Bloch is strolling down the Rue Faubourg St.-Honore, one of the world's most expensive shopping streets, carrying a black airline-type bag with a shoulder strap. He pauses to look in the shop windows. He is being watched, and the watchers think he is studying the reflections in the glass to see if he is being followed.
He is not aware of it, but the busy street is swarming with agents of the Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire (D.S.T.), the French counterintelligence agency. Bloch continues walking to the Hotel Meurice, on the Rue de Rivoli. He goes through the lobby, across an immense chandeliered gallery to a small, cozy bar in the rear.
The man he says he knew as ''Pierre Bart'' is waiting for him there, a bear of a man, close to six feet, heavyset, with dark hair, a beard, a mustache and a passing resemblance to the actor Peter Ustinov. Bloch and Pierre Bart have whiskies in the bar, and the French counterintelligence agents manage to take their pictures with cameras concealed in cigarette lighters, or whatever gadgets the D.S.T. uses. From the bar, the two men walk downstairs to the Restaurant Le Meurice, a place of dark-paneled wood, red walls and hovering waiters. 
The D.S.T. is in the restaurant too, its agents dining at tables nearby, taking more clandestine photos.
Bloch places the bag under the table. The two men order wine, and they talk over dinner. Bloch, the high-ranking United States diplomat. Bart, the Soviet agent who posed as a Frenchman in Paris but lived in Vienna as Reino Gikman, a Finn.
Bloch leaves the restaurant first. A short time later, Bart/Gikman leaves, carrying the black bag. Soon after, the D.S.T. videotapes him entering his budget-priced hotel, the Saphir, near the Gare de Lyon.
It was an expensive dinner. The Meurice always is. But the K.G.B. picked up the check.
BLOCH RECALLS THAT NIGHT VERY DIFFERENTLY. WE ARE sitting in his spacious apartment in the Kalorama section of Washington. He is impeccably dressed, as usual, in shirt sleeves this morning, bright suspenders and charcoal slacks. Mephisto, his little white terrier, is trying to jump on my lap.
The dinner in Paris, Bloch insists, was an innocent meeting of two stamp collectors. ''I brought the bag to the dinner,'' Bloch said. He pauses, then adds: ''Stamps were in the bag.'' ''How many?'' ''I don't know. Albums and pages of stamps.'' ''And you left the bag behind?'' ''Yes, I left the bag behind. I left it for him.''
He did not know that ''Pierre Bart'' lived in Vienna as Reino Gikman, he claims. Or that Gikman was a spy. ''I never asked his business,'' Bloch says. ''He was always vague.''
THE CASE HAS EVERYTHING: A media and F.B.I. circus; an elusive K.G.B. agent with at least three identities who has vanished; his mistress, an attractive widow who lives behind barbed wire in Vienna, guarded by a pit bull; a blond Viennese prostitute specializing in whips and leather; and rumors of a spy ring operating from the Soviet Unesco mission in Paris.
And of course Felix Bloch himself, a reserved, seemingly austere workaholic, with a secret sex life right out of a Victorian memoir. He was born into a Jewish family in Vienna that fled Hitler, but raised as a Presbyterian on the East Side of Manhattan, a graduate, among other good schools, of P.S. 6. A cultivated, urbane lover of opera, an admirer of the Jugendstil style of Viennese turn-of-the-century art, a collector of the works of Gustav Klimt - and of the stamps of Mitteleuropa. He may, of course, be an innocent victim, trapped in an improbable web of circumstantial evidence. He is also the highest-ranking official of the Department of State to be suspected of espionage since Alger Hiss.
In almost 14 hours of conversations with me - the only in-depth interviews that Bloch has given since he became the nation's most publicized spy suspect last July - Bloch ranged over a wide spectrum of subjects, from his views on the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the relative merits of Mahler and Mozart. He talked in detail about his meetings in three cities in Europe with Pierre Bart/Reino Gikman, who undoubtedly was an agent of the K.G.B., but whom Bloch insists he knew only as a fellow stamp collector; about his reaction to the ordeal of trial by publicity; about his family, his life, his past, and his future.
Beneath the remote, Teutonic persona that millions of Americans saw on the evening news night after night last summer, I found a highly intelligent, even likable, but haunted man whose dark and nihilistic view of life had shadowed his existence long before he burst onto the nation's television screens as its premier spy suspect.
Felix Bloch's case is extraordinary. Never before has a high-ranking official of the Government been publicly branded as a suspected spy for the Soviet Union, followed around for months by the F.B.I., the television networks, and the press, yet not formally accused, indicted, or brought to trial.
For now, Felix Bloch remains in limbo. Three months ago, the State Department moved to dismiss him. The F.B.I., convinced he is guilty, hopes to put him in prison for life. President Bush has publicly called the case ''very serious.'' The Government's counterintelligence agents believe that Bloch passed classified documents, not postage stamps, to Reino Gikman. Last summer, a Federal grand jury opened an investigation, but so far the Government has been unable to make its case.
As deputy chief of mission in Vienna, Bloch had access to a broad range of classified secrets, including encoded cable traffic, C.I.A. and State Department intelligence reports, the identities of C.I.A. officers in the embassy and, possibly, of some of their sources. Bloch, a senior State Department official noted, was a Foreign Service officer for 31 years. ''You may ask what he knew,'' the official said, ''but a better question is what didn't he know?''
Bloch was not branded a spy suspect solely by reporters. Minutes after John McWethy, a resourceful and diligent correspondent for ABC News, broke the story last July 21, the State Department confirmed that Bloch had been placed on leave, his building pass revoked, and that a security breach ''has occurred'' - astonishing language that virtually convicted Bloch without a trial.
IT BEGAN, ACCORDING TO BLOCH, WITH A PHONE CALL. Pierre Bart, he says, ''had contacted me some months earlier at the behest of a mutual friend in Vienna.''
We are in the back room at I Ricchi, an upscale Washington restaurant not far from Bloch's condominium. We started with the garlic bread and now he is working on his swordfish. He has joined me in a glass of pinot grigio, although Bloch drinks very little and doesn't smoke.
I ask the name of the man in Vienna. ''I can tell you the name,'' Bloch replies. ''But he's dead.'' Bloch smiles. ''He's been dead for four, five years. Willy Loman.''
I look at him incredulously. An Arthur Miller character has wandered into the Bloch case? ''Lomax,'' he corrects himself. ''It was Lomax. An expatriate Brit who worked for the U.S. Embassy.''
How did he know that the dead Englishman gave Bart his name? ''That's what Pierre told me.'' Later, in Vienna, I tried to find out more about ''Willy Lomax.'' I discovered that no one named Lomax had ever worked for the United States Embassy. But several former Embassy employees remember a colleague named Richard Lomas, an Englishman and former British army officer who worked in the economic section. A tall man, about six feet, with a mustache and gray hair, Lomas had arrived in Vienna with the British occupation troops in 1945, married an Austrian woman who hoped for a career as an opera(Continued on Page 38) singer, and stayed. He shared Bloch's love of music and, like Bloch, was often seen at the opera. He had retired in 1978, the embassy press officer said.
Although accounts of the Bloch case have focused on the meeting in Paris, Bloch told me he had met with Bart/Gikman three times last year, in three cities in Europe. I asked Bloch how the first contact came: by phone? He nodded. They met, Bloch said, not in Vienna but ''in another European city,'' in the early part of 1989. Bloch would not discuss any more details of what he said was his first meeting with Bart, but when I asked if he had given him stamps at this meeting, he replied: ''Yes.''
By then, Bloch had returned from Vienna, where he served from 1980 to 1987, and was back in the State Department as director of the office of regional economic and political affairs in the European bureau. His long-sought ambassadorship now seemed out of reach. He was only 1 of 11 office directors in the bureau and, at age 53, his career in the Foreign Service no longer looked promising.
On May 11, Reino Gikman - the man Bloch refers to as ''Pierre Bart'' - left Vienna on a trip, accompanied by Helga Hobart, a dark-haired, handsome widow in her late 40's. Gikman, who told friends he was a Finn, carried a Finnish passport that gave his age as 59. For the past five years he and Helga had lived in her little cottage at 169 Rosenhugelstrasse, in Hietzing, in Vienna's 13th district.
They flew to Paris and checked into the Saphir. Two days later, Gikman, now metamorphosed into Pierre Bart, telephoned Bloch at his apartment in Washington. The F.B.I. was listening. Sometime that spring, by undisclosed means, Western intelligence agents had picked up Gikman's trail. Their task was complicated, officials say, by the fact that there really is a stamp collector called Pierre Bart, whose identity Gikman at times adopted as cover.
As it happened, Bloch was about to leave for France on official business. That afternoon, he flew to Paris, arriving early on Sunday, May 14, and checked into the Hotel Pullman St.-Honore, a small Right Bank hotel.
After delivering the bag to Gikman at the Meurice, Bloch attended a meeting of economic officers the next day, then flew to Madrid on May 16 for a European Community conference and returned to Washington.
The meeting in Paris, however, was not his last with Reino Gikman. Their next encounter was to cause considerable problems for the F.B.I. and the C.I.A.
PRESIDENT BUSH ARRIVED in Brussels on Sunday, May 28, for a two-day meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and a courtesy call on Jacques Delors, the president of the European Community. Felix Bloch, who had helped to prepare the Bush-Delors meeting, decided he should be in Brussels in case he was needed. At least that is what he told Michael E. Ely. Ely, a balding, bespectacled career Foreign Service officer, is currently the United States deputy chief of mission (D.C.M.) to the European Community in Brussels. There is no hint of suspicion surrounding Ely's unwitting role in what happened next. Over the course of a year, Bloch had stayed four times in Ely's large, pleasant suburban house in Woluwe-St.-Pierre. There is an informal tradition within the clubby Foreign Service that a deputy chief of mission offers hospitality to visitors of high rank. Ely had a swimming pool and three servants.
Bloch stayed with Ely for two nights. On one of those evenings, he had supper out. ''Don't worry about me,'' Bloch told his colleague, ''I'm having dinner in town with an old friend.'' Ely, a polite Princeton man, insisted on dropping Bloch off at the Hilton. He remained in his car and did not see whom Bloch met.
Bloch walked through the lobby, up a long, curved, carpeted stairway and pushed open the glass doors of La Maison du Boeuf, a dining room of soft banquettes and bright chandeliers. There a familiar, bearded companion joined him for dinner. Once again, Bloch told me, he handed materials to Pierre Bart. Stamps? He nodded, yes. The Brussels meeting created a predicament for the F.B.I. and its intelligence division in Washington. From the tap on Bloch's phone, it knew he was going to Brussels. It could not afford to let another meeting with Gikman, the Soviet agent, take place unobserved. Only two weeks earlier, French agents had provided surveillance for the Paris meeting. Logically, the Belgian Surete de L'Etat would be asked by the F.B.I. to do the same in Brussels, but that request was never made.
''We've felt the Belgian service has been penetrated by the Soviets for a long time,'' said one United States intelligence officer close to the Bloch case. There may be other explanations as well. Albert Raes, the prickly chief of the Surete, does not enjoy good relations with the other Western security services.
The F.B.I. asked the C.I.A. to provide surveillance of the meeting between Bloch and Gikman, and it did, albeit reluctantly. It was a very risky business. ''The fact that the agency covered was very sensitive,'' an intelligence source said. ''The C.I.A. was running a covert operation without telling the host country. It was very dicey. The whole station could have gotten kicked out.'' But the C.I.A.'s surveillance in Brussels may have been discreet to a fault; there was confusion about whether Bloch brought a bag to the meeting, and whether he left it with Gikman. Weeks later, when investigators questioned Ely, they went over and over the same point: had Bloch thrown a bag in the car when he left Ely's house? Try as he would to recall, Ely could not be sure. And he did not know if Bloch carried anything when he returned to the house after dinner. The Elys had retired early and Bloch, who had his own key, let himself in. Ely realized from what he was asked that the meeting had been observed, and he must have wondered at the questions. Didn't they know? But the C.I.A., reluctant to reveal its hand, may have hoped that the agency's surveillance would remain hidden if Ely could provide the needed evidence firsthand. He could not.
President Bush called on Jacques Delors on May 30, and his plane left Brussels at 3:10 P.M. Immediately afterward, Bloch left by train for Paris. He attended another economic conference, spent the weekend in Paris, and flew home.
JUST AFTER 6 A.M. ON Thursday, June 22, Reino Gikman called Bloch at his home in Washington. To the listening F.B.I. wiretappers, the call was clearly a warning. ''He did not use the word virus, it's garbled in the press accounts,'' Bloch said. ''But he said he wasn't feeling well and hoped I didn't catch the same thing. I said to him, 'I hope it's not serious.' 'No, it's not,' he said. I wished him well and hung up.''
By even the most charitable interpretation it seemed unlikely that Gikman, after three weeks, was really worried that his friend would catch the flu. James H. Geer, then the F.B.I. counterintelligence chief, realized with dismay that the Soviets had somehow learned that Bloch and Gikman were under surveillance. How is not clear. The most ominous explanation - the tipoff came from a mole inside United States intelligence - is not necessarily the only one. Soviet agents watching Bloch's apartment in Kalorama, for example, might have detected the F.B.I. surveillance.
When Bloch arrived at his office on the sixth floor of the State Department later that day, he was summoned by Ambassador Robert E. Lamb, the assistant secretary for diplomatic security. Three F.B.I. agents were waiting for him. They questioned Bloch for two and a half hours.
The agents confronted Bloch with full-face surveillance photographs of him taken in the restaurant of the Hotel Meurice. They showed him pictures of Gikman in the restaurant, taken from a side angle. The F.B.I. asked Bloch whether he had passed secrets to the Soviets. Bloch denied it. Had he received any money from the Soviets? None, Bloch said.
The F.B.I. agents pressed him. Had he ever met Gikman in Vienna, where they both lived at the same time for seven years? No.
According to Bloch, ''After a while they said, 'Tell us the truth.' 'You can accept it or not,' I said. One of them pointed to a pile of papers on the desk, about five, six inches high - this was in an office in Lamb's suite - and said these are the papers.' 'No they're not,' I said.''
In the course of the interrogation, the F.B.I. agents asked for Bloch's black diplomatic passport and his regular blue passport. Bloch voluntarily turned in both. As of our last meeting, he had not received them back.
The F.B.I. agents followed Bloch home. For the next six months, he was never to be (Continued on Page 42) without surveillance by the bureau's agents, working in three shifts round the clock.
He was questioned for several hours the next day, and turned over the key to his apartment to the F.B.I., which he says removed boxes of bank records, address books and other personal belongings.
So far, no word of these events had leaked out. The press and the public were unaware that a major espionage investigation was under way at the State Department. But that was about to change.
JOHN F. MCWETHY, 43 years old, is a correspondent for ABC News who has covered the State Department for five years. According to McWethy, in mid-July, an anonymous caller telephoned the ABC bureau in Washington to say ''a major espionage case was brewing.''
Within days, McWethy was able to confirm the story from his sources at the State Department. ''On the afternoon of July 21, I called him for the first time.'' Bloch would not comment. McWethy said: ''I said, 'A story like this on network television will change your life.' He said, 'I can't talk about it.' ''
McWethy got ready to tape his stand-up in the State Department lobby, the flags of the world's nations behind him. At the ABC bureau on DeSales Street, the Washington producers of ''World News Tonight'' lacked visuals to accompany the story. They had a photographer take a picture of two ABC producers on the street, a briefcase between them. The picture was put in a ''paint box,'' a device that allows a photograph to be retouched at will. The man on the left was made to look bald, so that he resembled Felix Bloch. Next, a grainy black-and-white street scene of Vienna was found in the files, and cross hairs and a digital clock were superimposed to click off seconds as in a surveillance film. The film was labeled ''Simulation'' but the still photo of the two men with the briefcase was not, an oversight the network says was accidental. ABC News was severely criticized, and Peter Jennings apologized on the air. The error tended to overshadow McWethy's clean scoop. For Felix Bloch, the broadcast was the end of anonymity.
FELIX STEPHEN BLOCH , now 54, was born in Vienna on July 19, 1935. His father and mother, Frederick and Hetty Stein Bloch, got out with Felix and his twin sister, Susi, in the spring of 1939, a year after the Nazis marched into Austria. The family settled in Manhattan, where Bloch's aged parents still live in the East 90's. Frederick Bloch had a successful paper export business.
''As a boy I hated the name Felix,'' Bloch said. ''Who wanted to be different?''
He suffered the usual indignities of childhood; other kids sometimes taunted him as ''Felix the Cat'' or ''Blochhead.''
Bloch and his sister were raised as Presbyterians. Bloch attended Brick Presbyterian Church, at Park Avenue and 91st Street, near their home. ''My parents were both Jews. My mother became Presbyterian and my father did not. I really don't know anything about Judaism. I didn't even know Yiddish expressions. I never heard them as a child.
''What I enjoyed about Brick Presbyterian Church and even today is the ritual. Until fairly recently, Brick Presbyterian Church had kneeling cushions. I liked the great choir, great organists, the processional and the recessional, the ritual. The ushers wore tails on Sunday. It was the church of Foster Dulles and Laurence Rockefeller. It was a class establishment.''
After P.S. 6, Bloch went to the High School of Commerce, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1957 and spent a year in Bologna, Italy, at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. He flunked his orals but met Lucille (Lu) Stephenson, a vivacious, blue-eyed fellow student from Saluda, N.C., the daughter of a state senator. They were married in September 1959.
By then, Bloch had joined the State Department as an intelligence specialist. In 1960 he and Lu were posted to Dusseldorf, where their oldest daughter, Kathleen, was born. Their second child, Andrea, was born two years later, and the Blochs were sent to Caracas for two years. He returned to the United States and got his master's degree at Berkeley. He was posted to West Berlin in 1970, and four years later to East Berlin. They moved to Pankow, a suburb, and Bloch traveled frequently to Leipzig. It is a period that the F.B.I. has studied with especial care. In 1975, Bloch was transferred to Singapore for two years. Then, in 1980, he was sent to Vienna.
TO BLOCH, VIENNA was more than his first assignment to a major capital in Western Europe, it was also a homecoming. Although he had not lived in Vienna for 45 years, he was fluent in German. He and his wife moved into a comfortable house in Oberdobling, one of Vienna's best neighborhoods.
Vienna is a lovely and civilized city, and for Bloch, the embassy's economic counselor, there were not only the usual round of diplomatic receptions, but also the opera, the Art Nouveau he admired, skiing in winter, trips to Alpine lakes in the summer, and best of all, the Mocks, Alois and Edith. Mock, Austria's foreign minister, was one of Felix Bloch's closest and oldest friends. Felix, Lu, and Alois had all met as students in Bologna more than 20 years before.
By 1982, two American ambassadors had come and gone. In October, Bloch was back in the United States on leave and met Helene A. von Damm, Ronald Reagan's longtime personal secretary, at a dinner party at Jimmy's restaurant in Los Angeles. The hostess took Bloch aside and told him that von Damm, who was born in Linz, would be named the new Ambassador to Austria.
In May 1983, von Damm, looking for a new deputy chief of mission, took Bloch to lunch at the Intrigue, a Washington restaurant. Bloch recalls the moment. ''She said, 'I want you to be D.C.M.' ''
At first, they got along well. ''I was very satisfied with him at the beginning,'' von Damm said. ''He worked very hard, he knew no hours. He did enjoy the limelight. He would have liked to be the Ambassador.''
That September, Vice President George Bush visited Vienna. Bloch, the official in charge of Bush's visit, met him at the airport. In Lu's scrapbook, there are numerous photos of Bloch and Bush during the visit. There is also a snapshot of C.I.A. Director William H. Webster, then director of the F.B.I., in tennis whites and a powder-blue sweater, holding a racquet and posing with the Blochs on a visit to Vienna.
By her second year in Vienna, von Damm, although married to her third husband, was carrying on a not-very-secret affair with Peter Gurtler, the owner of the Sacher Hotel. This did not sit well with the White House. According to von Damm, ''Nancy Reagan, who had opposed my appointment, insisted I resign.''
In May 1986, Ronald S. Lauder, the billionaire heir to the cosmetics fortune that bears the name of his mother, Estee Lauder, arrived in Vienna as Reagan's new Ambassador. At Lauder's request, Bloch agreed to stay on as the No. 2 man in the embassy. Again, relations were harmonious at first. But Lauder says he soon became disturbed by Bloch's close relationship with Alois Mock and other Austrian ministers. Lauder became convinced that confidential embassy discussions were going straight to the Austrian Government, especially to Mock. Before long, Lauder and Bloch were squabbling almost continuously.
Bloch regaled friends with stories of Lauder's worries about his personal security; once Estee Lauder called on Bloch at the embassy to voice her concerns about her son's safety. Lauder walked in on the meeting and asked, ''Mother, what are you doing here?'' Bloch also derided Lauder for hiring armed Austrian bodyguards.
Last summer, in the midst of Lauder's unsuccessful campaign for the Republican nomination for mayor of New York, and a few days after Bloch was named as a spy suspect, Bloch was quoted as saying Lauder had been the ''laughingstock of Vienna.'' Bloch, Lauder snapped back, was a ''Benedict Arnold.'' The two are not fond of each other.
In the summer of 1987, Lauder said, he finally dismissed Bloch. George S. Vest, then director general of the Foreign Service, insists that Bloch was withdrawn ''because of conflicts with the Ambassador, but he was not fired.'' Whatever the truth of the matter, by the fall of 1987, Bloch was back in Washington.
PETER KERN HAS RUN his modest gasthaus at Wallnerstrasse 3 for 16 years. The menu at Kern's is heavy on pork schnitzels, beef and potatoes. There is good draft beer. Many of the people who eat lunch there work in government offices nearby.
Kern remembers the big man with the beard coming in for the first time in 1983. ''For a year and a half he came here to eat, and one day the regulars at the Hofrate-Stammtisch'' - roughly, the bureaucrats' table - ''asked if he wanted to join them.''
Reino Gikman did. A quiet, friendly patron, he told the regulars he was a Finn who worked in computers for I.B.M.
When investigators in Finland later dug into his background, they discovered that the man who called himself Reino Gikman had written to the Finnish Orthodox Church in Hameenlinna, Finland, from Bremen, West Germany, in the spring of 1966. ''Gikman'' enclosed a copy of a purported birth certificate showing he was born on March 27, 1930, in Ino, Karelia, a portion of Finland that is now Soviet territory.
Records from that village had been moved to Kuopio, in central Finland, but in 1952 four registry books had been stolen there, probably by the K.G.B. As a result, it was impossible to verify the information on ''Gikman's'' birth certificate, but since the copy looked real, the church issued him an original.
Once he had that, Gikman was able to obtain a valid Finnish passport. Later in 1966 he moved to Finland, where two years afterward he married a woman named Martta Nieminen. The following year they moved to Dusseldorf, where a son was born in 1969.
Martta and the son disappeared into the woodwork in the 1970's. Gikman arrived alone in Vienna in 1979, one year before Felix Bloch. He lived at the Hotel Post for about five years, then moved in with Helga Hobart.
Was Gikman serving as Bloch's K.G.B. ''control'' in Vienna? To the F.B.I. it seemed an obvious possibility, but the bureau was unable to establish that Bloch and Gikman ever met in Vienna. And Bloch denied it to me. ''If Gikman was in Vienna, it was unknown to me. I did not know or meet him there.''
When I interviewed Robert (Continued on Page 55) Danzinger, chief of the Austrian federal police, in Vienna, he said the Staatspolizei, the security service, could not determine whether Bloch ''had contacts with Gikman'' in Vienna. ''It was never established they met in Austria,'' he said.
Danzinger said he knew Bloch, had met and talked with him several times at receptions. It was puzzling, he recalled. ''I am also a stamp collector, and I didn't know he was a stamp collector.''
TINA JIROUSEK IS 34 , and very attractive. Her hair is blonde, feather cut. She has clear green eyes, a pug nose, and is wearing an expensive and tasteful brown silk dress. We are having lunch at a restaurant overlooking Vienna's Stadtpark.
She is no longer a prostitute. I found her working as a waitress at a coffeehouse in Vienna. Only her three-inch gold spiked heels suggest her former profession.
For seven years, Tina said, Felix Bloch visited her almost every Saturday morning. Dressed in leather costume and boots, armed with a whip, Tina specialized in sadomasochistic sex. For her services, Tina said, Bloch paid her about $250 a week, or perhaps $10,000 a year for seven years.
She was born Anna Christina Stritzl in Vienna, and worked as a prostitute for about 10 years, until she was 30. One of the first customers to answer the advertisement she placed in Kurier, a Vienna newspaper, on Jan. 1, 1980, was Felix Bloch. She gave up her trade about five years ago, she said, but kept Bloch as a special client. She speaks of him with affection and a certain compassion. ''He's complicated, and it's hard to get to know him,'' she said. ''He has a contact problem with people.''
Felix Bloch's preference for kinky sex would be of no relevance but for the fact that Tina Jirousek was brought to Washington last August to tell her story to the Federal grand jury hearing evidence in the Bloch case. Under constant F.B.I. guard, she was put up at a Ramada Inn in northern Virginia. She testified twice to the grand jury, once for seven hours, once for three, and spent a day being interviewed by the F.B.I.
Bloch has never commented on Tina's account. But the F.B.I. was apparently pursuing two theories. One, that Bloch's sexual habits had become known to the Soviets, who blackmailed him. Since he visited a prostitute in Vienna, perhaps he had done so in Berlin 15 years earlier. If he was a spy, did his spying go back that far? A second theory was that Bloch sold secrets to pay for sex. But he did not appear to need outside sources of income. Financial disclosure forms filed by Bloch over the past three years placed his assets in the $300,000 to $1,000,000 range.
The F.B.I. went over Bloch's finances last summer and could not pinpoint any unexplained sources of income. ''The money analysis doesn't work,'' one official said. ''We've taken a hard look at that. He comes from money. His father has money. So analysis of his bank accounts does not prove anything.''
WHEN THE MEDIA CIRCUS began last July, both the press and the F.B.I. agents found it hard to keep up with Felix Bloch. A tall man with an athletic frame, he is in excellent physical shape, has always liked to walk, and led the reporters and the counterspies on some memorable treks in the heat, including a 22-mile walk in early August that left one agent with bleeding feet.
One morning, Bloch was sitting on a park bench in Dupont Circle when three young children began chanting, ''Bye, Mr. Spy!'' Then a man who said he was a Vietnam veteran started harassing Bloch. ''Did you betray your country, man?'' Suddenly, he smacked Bloch on the side of the head. An F.B.I. agent eventually persuaded the man to leave.
At Thanksgiving, Bloch went to visit his daughter Kathie in Chappaqua, N.Y., for the birth of his first grandson. On Dec. 6, he was in Macy's with his F.B.I. escort. He went uptown for lunch at the Waldorf grill, then to his parents' apartment. His mother was the first to notice. She checked the street. ''There's no one there,'' she told Bloch. And it was true; that afternoon the F.B.I. surveillance suddenly ended. The agents were gone, and they haven't been back.
ESPIONAGE IS AN ALMOST invisible crime. Unless the spy confesses or is caught in the act, leaving documents at a ''dead drop'' or handing them to a foreign agent, it is often impossible to prove.
Why didn't the French D.S.T. move in and arrest Bloch and Gikman if they suspected that documents were being passed? ''They probably had no reason to think he had violated French laws,'' said Phillip A. Parker, former deputy chief of F.B.I. counterintelligence.
Neither the the F.B.I. nor the French know what was in the bag. That is the crux of the matter. And Felix Bloch says it was stamps.
According to one news report, Bloch told his wife, in a conversation in their car, that he had received money from the Soviets. The F.B.I. did indeed bug Bloch's silver Mercedes, but Bloch said he merely ''told her that I'd been accused of taking money.''
So in the end, the agents were pulled off Felix Bloch because the F.B.I., the Justice Department and the grand jury were unable to prove that he had committed espionage. ''The case is still open,'' an F.B.I. spokesman said. But in the absence of new evidence, it will remain that way, open and unresolved.
Although the F.B.I. was widely criticized for its massive surveillance of Bloch last summer, the bureau could hardly afford another Edward Lee Howard case. In 1985, Howard, a C.I.A. officer, sold secrets to the Soviets, eluded the F.B.I., and surfaced in Moscow. In some ways, the Bloch case has been even more demoralizing to the F.B.I. Bloch lives in Washington, a free man against whom nothing has been proven despite the bureau's intensive efforts.
James Geer, who ran the Bloch case for the F.B.I., bristles at suggestions that the bureau leaked the story to put pressure on Bloch. Counterintelligence investigations, Geer pointed out, ''don't lend themselves to publicity.'' He revealed that the F.B.I. had conducted an extensive investigation of the leak to ABC, polygraphing ''all the people who had detailed knowledge of the case'' - beginning with Geer. ''It involved a lot of agencies,'' he said.
Geer would not discuss the findings of the leak investigation. But other sources said the F.B.I. investigation pointed to a ''surrogate'' acting for Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. The State Department declined to comment on any aspect of the leak inquiry.
On Feb. 7 the State Department took Bloch off the payroll and moved to dismiss him from his $81,400-a-year job under a little-used statute allowing the Government to dismiss employees for reasons of ''national security.''
Bloch asked the State Department for a closed hearing, and in a motion filed in March, he moved to suppress the tapes of the Government's electronic surveillance. If Bloch is dismissed, as is expected, the State Department could also seek to bar his pension under a separate law. In the meantime, Bloch is already looking for a job; he showed me his resume.
United States officials credit the C.I.A. for coming up with the initial clues in the Bloch affair. In French intelligence circles, however, there are rumors of a Soviet spy ring linked to Gikman operating out of the Soviet mission to Unesco on the Rue Miollis, and of a Soviet embassy staff member found dead, floating down the Seine, last spring. There were reports last summer that Gikman, as Pierre Bart, worked for Unesco. But officials of the agency in Paris said no one fitting his name or description had ever been employed there.
If Felix Bloch is a spy, what were his motives? None of his friends ever heard him express the slightest sympathy for the Soviet Union or for Communism, and Bloch told me he regards the Soviet system as ''abhorrent.'' While it is true that Bloch chafed under a series of political ambassadors in Vienna, that is not normally a motive for treason. Several friends mentioned the possibility of blackmail.
It was at lunch at I Ricchi on the second long day of our interviews that I asked Bloch why he had never declared his innocence. ''There's no way to prove you are innocent,'' Bloch replied. ''The Government, the leaks, assert that I'm guilty. Apparently they can't prove it. . . . There's a presumption of innocence in this country. Someone should not be put in the position of saying 'I'm innocent.' '' I looked at Bloch. ''So, did you pass secrets to the Soviets?'' He smiled. ''I'm not going to answer that for the same reason I haven't declared my innocence.''
Although it does not prove his story is true, there is little doubt that Bloch is a stamp collector. In his apartment he showed me album after album of stamps and correspondence and postmarked first-day issues going back to his youth. He spoke both knowledgeably and enthusiastically of his hobby.
Bloch may indeed, as the F.B.I. suspects, have had contacts with the Soviets for 15 years. Or his contacts may have been confined to the three meetings in 1989. It is even possible that Bloch, as he claimed to the F.B.I., received no money. Bloch told the F.B.I. that he gave the ''stamps'' to Pierre Bart on approval, a common practice in the stamp trade. And Bart, Bloch told the agents who questioned him, never paid and never returned them. It is a story that raises the possibility that Bloch was an unsuccessful spy. But only Bloch knows - and Reino Gikman, who left Vienna on June 11, and vanished.
Last July, Bloch's daughter, Andrea, an aspiring actress in New York, visited her father in Washington. She needed to know. The conversation took place in the street, the only place where they felt the F.B.I. would not hear them. ''I asked him. I call him Babbo, it means Daddy in Italian. 'Babbo, please tell me what is going on? Can't you tell me what is happening?' He said: 'I can't tell you anything. I'm doing it to protect you and in the long run to protect myself.' ''
Whatever Felix Bloch had done, he couldn't tell his own daughter about it.
 apartment Bloch confided his gloomy personal philosophy. ''We all die separately,'' he said. ''Very few grieve for us and even those who grieve soon forget us. And those who don't are gone fairly soon anyway.''
Later that day, we were walking near my office when Bloch suddenly said: ''As they say, life is a bitch, and then you die. So you live, and you die. Then oblivion. I think that's what I'll get when I die. Oblivion.''

HEADLINE: U.S. May Give Up One of Its Bases In the Philippines, Officials Say

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
American and Philippine officials say the United States may have to relinquish at least one of its two huge military bases in the Philippines over the next 10 years because of rising opposition to the installations in the former American colony.
The officials made that assessment as negotiators from the two countries prepare to meet on Monday in Manila to begin exploratory talks on the future of the installations, Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station.
In the Philippines, two American servicemen were shot and killed today while waiting for a taxicab near Clark Air Base. A Philippine police official said the authorities suspected that Communist rebels were responsible. 
 
Talks to Proceed Despite Killings
In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman noted that the rebels had for years said they would ''target official Americans'' as part of an effort to persuade the United States to shut down its bases. She said the talks on renewal of the agreement on the bases would go forward on schedule.
The current 25-year agreement expires on Sept. 16, 1991. While the Defense Department would prefer to keep the bases, Pentagon, State Department and White House officials say American forces will leave if Filipinos want them to go.
''We ought to be there only as long as we're wanted,'' said Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. ''If they don't want us, we ought not to be there.''
 
Duration of the Shift
Under Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz said, ''We hope to retain our military presence in the Philippines at least over the mid-term.'' But he added that ''the Philippine Government could require us to withdraw.''
The emerging consensus among Philippine officials seems to favor such withdrawal. The debate focuses on the duration of the shift to Philippine control, with proposals ranging from 2 to 10 years, and the terms under which the Americans would withdraw.
Philippine nationalists see the bases as an infringement on their country's sovereignty. They contend that Manila was forced to sign the original bases agreement after World War II because the Americans threatened to withhold aid for rebuilding the country.
Any new treaty is subject to approval by the Philippine Senate, where at least 15 of the 23 members are on record as opposing renewal. In some cases, though, the degree of opposition is uncertain.
The Government of President Corazon C. Aquino seeks a compromise that will satisfy both nationalist sentiments and more pragmatic economic needs. The Philippine Ambassador in Washington, Emmanuel Pelaez, suggests that use of the bases might be governed by a commercial contract rather than a treaty. The United States would pay for services rendered, a private worker-owned company would repair ships at Subic Bay and there would be much more use of the bases by the Philippine armed forces.
In the current fiscal year, the United States is providing $513 million in aid to the Philippines, but only $385 million is regarded as compensation for the bases. Through purchases of goods and services, the bases generate jobs for 500,000 Filipinos and inject more than $1 billion a year into the Philippine economy, accounting for at least 3 percent of the gross national product, American officials say.
The American negotiating team will be led by Richard L. Armitage, a self-confident former Defense Department official who has handled many delicate missions. The chief Philippine negotiator, Foreign Minister Raul S. Manglapus, combines the polish and debating skills of a lawyer who spent more than a decade in exile doing postgraduate work at Cornell and Harvard in the Marcos years.
 
U.S. Rescue of Aquino
The United States has a major advantage in the negotiations because it saved Mrs. Aquino's Government in December, when American warplanes helped suppress a coup attempt by Philippine soldiers.
''The Aquino Government is a hostage of the bases,'' said Renato Constantino, a professor of history at the University of the Philippines. Without decisive American support, which hinges on retention of the bases, ''it cannot hope to survive,'' he said.
But the United States enters the negotiations at a disadvantage because it has provided much less aid to the Philippines than it promised in late 1988, when the agreement was last reviewed. In a letter to Mrs. Aquino then, President Ronald Reagan pledged that the executive branch of the United States Government would make its ''best efforts'' to provide $481 million a year in the fiscal years 1990 and 1991.
By State Department calculations, Washington fell short by $96 million in the first year. To help make up the gap, Bush Administration officials say they are prepared to give the Philippines some of the surplus military equipment being withdrawn from Europe.
Pressures on the Pentagon budget are forcing the United States to reassess the need for each of its overseas bases. The fading of the cold war, reflected in a widespread perception of a diminished Soviet threat, makes it possible for the United States to consider closing some of those bases. The Pentagon has studied many redeployment options, including greater use of existing bases in Japan, Guam and Hawaii and the construction of additional bases in Singapore or on such islands as Saipan, Tinian and Palau.
 
Large Area Covered
None of the alternatives have the precise combination of virtues found in the Philippines. The bases in the Philippines support United States military forces from the Persian Gulf to Japan and Korea and provide most repair and supply services for the Seventh Fleet, which operates in the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean.
If the Administration decides to abandon the bases, it is likely that members of Congress would acquiesce. Some have become disenchanted with Mrs. Aquino, saying she snubbed Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in February and has not fulfilled the promise of the peaceful democratic revolution that brought her to power.
Some members of Congress have also expressed dismay at reports that Philippine officials had demanded $2 billion a year, or four times as much as the United States now pays.
Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado, said: ''On the one hand, Filipinos say, 'You have to stop treating us as a colony.' On the other hand, they ask for $2 billion a year. That's just an outrage.'' Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said he feared that the United States might be ''forced out of the Philippines by unrealistic demands.''
Representative G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery, Democrat of Mississippi, said: ''It would be an inconvenience to pack up those military bases and move. But we still have a powerful and mobile Navy, and I think we could project that naval power and look out for U.S. interests in the Pacific without the benefit of the Philippine bases.''

HEADLINE: In South Korea, Another Spring Is Torn by Anger

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, May 13

 BODY:
A rally to express solidarity among anti-government workers and students was disrupted this weekend when scuffling broke out on stage. ''We demand to be heard!'' a group of students shouted, trying to seize the microphone. After heated words, the protesters were allowed to denounce the shutting down of their militant campus newspaper, and the rally ended peacefully.
It was just another angry episode in this season of confrontation in South Korea, where almost everyone seems to be in a sullen temper these days. Workers are on strike; students are on the march; political allies are squabbling, and Americans are again on the defensive. 
''In Korea, April and May are always a time of democratic struggle,'' said Lee Jae Ho, a spokesman for the rally in Seoul. ''What we are seeing is the usual spilling over of people's frustrations.''
But this year politicians and dissidents alike say the protests are not nearly strong enough to threaten the Government of President Roh Tae Woo or to undermine the stability of South Korea.
 
Elderly Join Protest
Public anger is everywhere, exemplified by such events as the rampages by private investors who smashed windows and furniture in stockbrokers' offices after the stock exchange plummeted last month.
This weekend, a hundred elderly Koreans joined in, marching on the Japanese Embassy to protest Japanese wartime cruelty and to demand that Tokyo apologize to President Roh when he visits later this month.
But public ire appears directed less at the student and worker agenda of radical political change than at inflation and the skyrocketing cost of housing - bread and butter issues that few think are likely to be solved by revolution.
A major element in the contentious atmosphere is the internal fighting within the established political organizations in South Korea, many only recently formed.
 
Discord Within Opposition
President Roh's newly organized Democratic Liberal Party has been paralyzed by discord over economic and political programs.
The principal opposition leader, Kim Dae Jung, is widely regarded by other opposition groups as compromised by his friendliness with Mr. Roh and by his ambitions. Efforts to push for a united opposition group have thus been stymied by distrust of Mr. Kim and by wariness over his ambition to run for the presidency in 1992 or 1993.
''Kim Dae Jung used to be the most favored leader, but now the people are shocked and disillusioned with him,'' said Lee Boo Yong, a professor recently released from prison who is trying to organize a new left-leaning political group.
The current protests are the largest in three years. They culminated on Wednesday in marches in major cities. The marchers assailed President Roh's consolidation of power in his new political party, with thousands taking over downtown Seoul and setting fire to the United States Information Service building.
 
Students 'Busy Studying'
But at Yonsei University, where riots flared for months in 1987 before helping force an end to decades of military dictatorship, students were not in the streets this weekend. They were in the library, or tossing balls under the ginkgo trees or listening to rock music at an outdoor amphitheater.
''Most students are busy studying,'' said Kim Yong Bon, a 23-year-old business major. ''The people in the streets are mainly people from student unions who know how to speak loudly.''
Another student, Kang Kyung Ho, added: ''It's hard to make a living in this society. It's not my way to join the radicals. I want to study, to be successful and to share what I have gained by giving to orphanages and the poor.''
Workers are on strike this year, but despite some disruptions - including crackdowns on strikers at Hyundai Heavy Industries and the Korean Broadcasting System - there have been only about 100 strikes, compared to 600 last year.
Most analysts believe that militant unions command the loyalty of about 200,000 of the 1.6 million Koreans in labor unions. But many workers think that their unions are less interested in them than in heeding the Government's appeal for restraint.
''I am pessimistic about the future,'' said Kim Y. C., explaining that he had been dismissed from his job in an auto-parts factory after criticizing the union leadership. ''Poor workers like myself are being thrown into poverty.''
 
First Elected Government
Many people say the basic reason for the stable atmosphere is that although Mr. Woo's popularity has skidded as a result of economic problems and Government infighting, the country is still patient with its first elected Government in decades.
One measure of the size of the radical movement seems to be that in a country of nearly 45 million people, only about 100,000 people took to the streets in last Wednesday's nationwide protest.
In addition, the Government said it rounded up nearly 1,900 people during the week, asserting that it planned to release most after questioning. But human-rights groups are watching intently.
Asia Watch, a New York-based monitoring group, said in April that based on calculations by the National Council of Churches of Korea, 729 ''political prisoners'' were languishing in Korean jails earlier this year.
The Government rejects the term ''political prisoner,'' saying that only those charged with violent crimes or seditious acts are detained.
 
Anti-American Sentiment
The United States is also watching for a resurgence in anti-American action. Ambassador Donald P. Gregg said he was shocked by the attack on the United States Information Service center last week.
Americans also say their community has recently become jittery over an apparent rise in violent attacks by individual Koreans against American citizens.
The attacks seem to be nonpolitical and have occurred after midnight in the bars and streets of the honky-tonk Itaewon area near the main United States Army base. In some cases, individual Americans have reportedly been set upon by groups of South Koreans, although the evidence suggests that the scuffles have been caused by drinking.
The United States military authorities recently barred American soldiers from the Itaewon area from midnight to 5 A.M., and they have instituted patrols between American military and Korean police.
Americans hope that public resentment of their presence in Seoul may be eased next year when they turn over a sprawling golf course at the main military base downtown to the Government, which plans to turn it into a public park.

HEADLINE: Bush's 2 Top Budget Aides Avoid Discussion of Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
With budget negotiations with Congress set to begin Tuesday, two of the Bush Administration's top economic policy makers carefully avoided any statements today that might rile Congress or disclose President Bush's position on raising taxes.
After a week in which the Administration expressed conflicting views about taxes, John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and Richard G. Darman, the budget director, spoke almost as one in separate television interviews this morning.
Asked in several different ways whether the President might break his campaign pledge not to raise taxes, Mr. Sununu, appearing on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' answered each time with the same phrase. The President, Mr. Sununu said, is entering the negotiations with ''no preconditions.'' 
For their part, the Democratic chairmen of the Congressional budget committees said on other programs that they had no intention of discussing taxes with the President unless Mr. Bush brought up the matter. Who Will Bring Up Taxes? Who, Mr. Darman was asked, was likely to make the first mention of taxes during the negotiations?
''It occurred to me,'' the budget director responded, chuckling, ''that the President could start with a moment of silence that could turn into an hour and a half of silence.''
Until last week, Mr. Bush had not strayed from the ''no new taxes'' promise that was the cornerstone of his 1988 election campaign. Then, last Sunday night, he invited Congressional leaders to the White House and said the time had come to begin negotiations to cut the budget deficit.
Mr. Bush used the phrase ''no preconditions'' at that meeting, according to lawmakers who were present. The Democratic leaders have maintained that they could not negotiate with the President as long as he remained inflexible about taxes.
 
Sununu Stresses the 'No'
At midweek, however, Mr. Sununu told reporters: ''We're allowing the Democrats to bring their good arguments for taxes to the table. And it is our prerogative to say no. And I emphasize the 'no.' ''
That comment upset Congressional leaders, and Marlin Fitzwater, the President's press secretary, said the comment was ''crazy.''
But no sooner were those words out of Mr. Fitzwater's mouth than Vice President Dan Quayle declared in a television interview Thursday night, ''Sununu was just reflecting what the President's instincts are, what his stated policies are.''
The President finally spoke out publicly for the first time on Friday. On the way to a commencement address in Texas, he insisted, ''There are no conditions, and that's the way it is.''
The most Mr. Sununu would say today about a tax increase was this: ''The fact there's no preconditions means there's a possibility but no certainty, and that it ought to be part of the negotiations between both sides to raise and ask for certain issues to be examined, included or not included in the budget.''
 
Income Tax Increase Assailed
Mr. Darman, interviewed on the ABC News program ''This Week With David Brinkley,'' did say that raising the top income tax rate paid by the wealthy, a proposal made by some lawmakers, ''would have an adverse effect on economic growth.'' But beyond that, Mr. Darman did not discuss tax questions.
Senator Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who appeared on the ABC News program before Mr. Darman, said the only way a tax increase could come about would be for the President to propose it and ''help sell those revenues to the Congress and to the American people.''
Representative Leon E. Panetta, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Budget Committee, took the same position on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.''
But Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who was interviewed along with Mr. Sasser and who will be one of the Republican negotiators, said raising taxes was ''bad policy'' and would not be broached by Republicans.
The first negotiating session on Tuesday will be at the White House with President Bush leading the talks. After that, the meetings will move to Capitol Hill. Most people involved think it will be weeks and possibly months before anything is settled.

HEADLINE: Tax Specter Shadows a G.O.P. Leader

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: REDLANDS, Calif., May 12

 BODY:
If President Bush decides that forging a budget compromise with Congress means endorsing tax increases, one Republican he will be asking to help carry the political burden is Representative Jerry Lewis, the six-term Congressman whose district sprawls here on the eastern edge of the Los Angeles Basin.
As chairman of the House Republican Conference, Mr. Lewis is the third-ranking member of the party leadership in the House. A mainstream conservative, he has been a bridge between traditional Republicans like the House minority leader, Robert H. Michel of Illinois, and younger, more aggressive conservatives like Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip.
Like most of his Republican colleagues, Mr. Lewis says he is far from persuaded that the President will actually accept higher taxes, regardless of his willingness to discuss them. Still, Mr. Bush's opening the door could not have come at a more awkward moment for Mr. Lewis. 
For the first time in a decade, he faces a challenger in the Republican primary. Republican strategists here and in Washington see little evidence that the Congressman, who has consistently won about 70 percent of the vote in general elections in the solidly Republican area, is in danger. But the tax issue is an unexpected gift to his opponent, Mark Blankenship, who is looking for ammunition against the popular incumbent. A brash 29-year-old conservative lawyer, Mr. Blankenship says that even if he loses in the June 5 primary, he is prepared to keep trying.
 
A Campaign Against Washington
''I'll attack Lewis if he votes for a Bush plan with taxes,'' Mr. Blankenship said, ''but I would also attack him for walking away from it.'' Mr. Blankenship's main theme is that Mr. Lewis is out of touch with the needs of a rapidly growing district where constituents want more money spent on schools, anti-crime programs and the environment. ''He's on notice on this issue,'' he said of Mr. Lewis. ''He can't win either way.''
Mr. Lewis is well aware of the political bind. Military base closings last year cost his district two major military installations, and the district also stands to lose thousands of jobs as cuts in weapons programs hit Southern California's large defense industry.
Attracting new industry to the district will be difficult, Mr. Lewis said, because of a weakening national economy and higher interest rates. Lower interest rates would help, but one requirement for that is lowering the Federal budget deficit. He said, ''That's like people suggesting we should cut the city council budget, but fill all the potholes.''
If the Federal deficit is not to be reduced by further cuts in military spending, which would mean more economic pain for Mr. Lewis's constituents, the burden must fall on domestic spending. Reductions of either kind could be avoided by raising taxes, but in a district that votes as fiscally conservatively as Mr. Lewis's, that is hardly a palatable solution.
 
'Feeling It in Spades'
''I'm feeling it in spades,'' Mr. Lewis said, explaining that the implications of Washington's budget dilemma are just beginning to reverberate at home. ''I find myself almost in conflict with myself. I believe in the free market economy, that if we can shrink the size of the Federal Government, it will help the private economy.
''On the other hand, I live in a district that was built on the largesse of the Federal Government. Too quick a shrinkage could cause pain on top of what is already there, so I am trying to work with local communities in dealing with the transition. And thus a moderate Republican is born.''
Alan Heslop, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, which is in the district adjacent to Mr. Lewis's, has said he would be greatly surprised if Mr. Blankenship receives more than 25 percent of the vote in the primary.
But Professor Heslop said the tax issue is likely to become more potent, and thus more troublesome for Mr. Lewis and other Republican incumbents in the longer term as it feeds into what he called ''the broader bad news story'' about the defense economy and the political identity crisis for the conservative movement.
 
A Solidly Republican District
''This district is significantly more conservative than the state as a whole on fiscal and social issues,'' he said. ''It is one of the worst places in the world to have to back away from a no-tax pledge.''
The area is also one of the most rapidly growing in the state and is likely to be divided into two or more Congressional districts when the redistricting after the 1990 census is done.
John Buckley, a Republican political strategist in Washington, said the candidacies of those like Mr. Blankenship are ''part of a long fratricidal tradition'' in the conservative movement. But Mr. Buckley said, ''A Republican primary challenger is not going to have much of a chance of defeating a Jerry Lewis whose position on taxes is ultimately identical'' to the President's.
In the meantime, Mr. Bush's positions on taxes and the budget are ambiguous enough that a challenger like Mr. Blankenship can afford to give the President the benefit of the doubt on tax increases while forcing an incumbent Republican like Mr. Lewis to either reaffirm the no-tax pledge or acknowledge now that he may be forced to vote for some type of tax increase.
Mr. Lewis is hoping he will not have to make that choice. There is still room for reshaping Federal spending and getting the deficit down without having to raise taxes, he said, noting that is how it worked out last year. ''Frankly, I do not see a shift in the President's position,'' he said. ''But I'll face that when I come to it.''

HEADLINE: Sununu's Role in Debates on Environmental Issues Reflects Old Patterns

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CONCORD, N.H.

 BODY:
Name an environmental issue in Washington these days, and the chances are that John M. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, is in the thick of it, setting President Bush's policy.
It was Mr. Sununu, for example, who played a pivotal role in the recent White House decision to oppose financial aid for developing countries that phase out chemicals that contribute to destruction of the atmospheric ozone layer. He thought it too costly.
And it is Mr. Sununu, Administration officials say, who is seeking to ease some elements of the toughened Clean Air Act passed by the Senate in April and awaiting action by the House, because he views the provisions as too expensive to business.
Here in New Hampshire, where Mr. Sununu was Governor from 1983 to 1988, his recent actions come as no surprise. Many environmentalists and state officials say he is beginning to repeat in Washington a pattern that he set here, one that they say gives preference to economic development over environmental regulation. 
Some environmentalists and state and Federal officials go so far as to say that as Governor, Mr. Sununu at times tried to bypass Federal environmental laws to speed favored projects.
And some officials say Governor Sununu sought to intimidate them or have them replaced when they invoked Federal regulations that would have delayed projects he liked. Among the projects were the expansion of a ski resort on national forest land, the broadening of an important state highway through federally protected wetlands and the opening of the Seabrook nuclear power plant.
D. Dickinson Henry, the director of the Audubon Society of New Hampshire, said other governors had sought to bypass Federal environmental regulations in individual cases. What was different about Mr. Sununu, Mr. Henry said, was that he made this a regular policy and ''often used extreme tactics,'' like trying to intimidate officials.
 
Sununu Says Record Has Been Distored
In an interview in his office in Washington, Mr. Sununu said he had only been doing his job as Governor to promote economic growth. He asserted that the problems in New Hampshire had been created by ''external groups'' who ''dragged the Federal agencies into the process.''
''I really felt very strongly as Governor that this kind of interference from outside the state wasn't constructive,'' Mr. Sununu said. Regulation should have been left to his state environmental officials, who approved the developments, Mr. Sununu said.
Mr. Sununu said his record had been distorted by environmentalists, and he pointed to several accomplishments while he was Governor. They included passage of the nation's first acid rain legislation, which required a 25 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions in New Hampshire, and his administration's purchase of 45,000 acres of privately owned timberland to prevent its development.
Environmentalists responded that in each case Mr. Sununu acted in response to widespread public pressure. Jackie Tuxill, an environmental consultant, recalled that Mr. Sununu became interested in the acid rain issue only after a highly unusual series of statewide town meetings called for action, and she said that since most of the chemicals that cause acid rain come from sources outside the state, the effect of the bill was limited.
Mr. Sununu's timber purchase has been criticized by environmentalists and political opponents for giving a group of businessmen a large profit and letting them keep lucrative rights to mine gravel on the new public land.
 
Development Backer From Earliest Days
Right from his first days in public office, after he was elected to the town planning board of Salem in the 1960's, Mr. Sununu has been a strong advocate of development.
Patrick Jackson, a management consultant who was then chairman of the Southeast New Hampshire Regional Planning Commission, recalls that at meetings ''John Sununu used to stand up and give these speeches about the virtues of development.''
''He would say: 'These developers are legitimate businessmen. You can't stop them,' '' Mr. Jackson said. ''His idea of open space was a K Mart parking lot.''
Much of the interest in Mr. Sununu's record as Governor centers on his efforts to help the Loon Mountain ski area, already the state's busiest, double its size by expanding onto 930 acres of the White Mountain National Forest.
The Loon Mountain Corporation was founded by Sherman Adams, who like Mr. Sununu was a Republican Governor of New Hampshire who went on to become a Presidential chief of staff. Mr. Adams served under Dwight D. Eisenhower.
When the project was proposed, in 1986, the United States Forest Service initially indicated it would approve the expansion, but objections were quickly raised by other Federal and state agencies, which said the plan required an environmental impact study. The Federal environmental protection law requires such a study whenever a major Government action will have a significant effect on the environment. Federal officials have some discretion to determine which projects require studies, although in recent years the courts have tended to require them. A study can take a year or two to complete.
The officials who favored a study on the Loon Mountain project were concerned by reports that sewage lagoons for a nearby town, Lincoln, were already so strained that they were leaking, and by questions of whether the new snow-making equipment would exhaust the town's water supply from the Pemigewasset River. That, in turn, would endanger a program to restore the river's salmon.
It was then, state and Federal officials say, that Governor Sununu began calling them to head off a full environmental study.
 
Letter of the Law Thwarts an Inquiry
Mr. Sununu, in the interview, said all his state environmental officials had approved the resort's growth and had advised him that it did not require an environmental study.
Mr. Sununu said he never improperly tried to bypass Federal officials, implying that they probably should not have been involved in the first place. ''My message was clear,'' Mr. Sununu said. ''If you've got a problem, put it on the table and let the state agencies decide.''
Under the conflicting pressures, the Forest Service reversed itself and called for a full environmental study. As part of the process, the agency organized a review committee and invited the state Department of Environmental Services to send representatives to give technical advice.
But Governor Sununu permitted only one official from the department to attend, and he turned out to be the agency's public spokesman, who had little technical knowledge, several members of the review committee said.
When the spokesman was asked about reports of the leaking sewage lagoons, he assured the group that everything was fine, said Mr. Henry of the Audubon, who was a member of the panel. It was only after Mr. Sununu left office at the end of 1988 that the group was able to hear the testimony of state specialists, who confirmed that the sewage system was indeed leaking and probably could not be fixed.
''Sununu complied with the letter of the law,'' Mr. Henry said, ''but by careful omission he made it very difficult to get accurate information.'' A final decision the case has still not been made.
 
Official Speaks, Appointment Stalls
Dr. James Paine, a member of the New Hampshire Fish and Game Commission, said his reappointment to the commission was delayed after he opposed the Governor by calling for an environmental study of the Loon Mountain expansion. Like other officials, most of whom declined to quoted by name because of Mr. Sununu's current powerful position, Dr. Paine said the Governor used shouting and displays of temper to intimidate people on environmental and other matters. ''He could be real abusive,'' Dr. Paine said.
Some officials and environmentalists are concerned that Mr. Sununu is continuing to influence the debate over the Loon Mountain project from the White House. Last December, the president of Loon Mountain, Philip T. Gravink, wrote to Mr. Sununu to thank him for his ''candid advice'' on how to make it easier for ski areas to expand on public land. The letter from Mr. Gravink, a past contributor to Mr. Sununu's campaigns for governor, was then forwarded by the White House chief of staff to officials of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Another of the disputes involving Mr. Sununu that pitted development against environmental interests was an effort by the state to widen Route 101, the only east-west highway in the heavily populated southern half of New Hampshire. The plan for the road would have taken it through 80 to 100 acres of wetlands.
Without waiting for Federal approval, the state's Transportation Department began building a bridge and an access road.
But the Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal agency responsible for protecting wetlands, ordered the work halted, said Col. Thomas Rhen, then head of the New England Division of the Corp. ''It was illegal, no question about it,'' said Colonel Rhen, who has since retired.
Governor Sununu was furious and summoned several state and Federal officials, including Michael Deland, then head of the New England Region of the Environmental Protection Agency and now chairman of the President's Council on Environmental Quality.
One of the participants in the meeting said Mr. Sununu ''ridiculed the violation and accused us of sneaking around trying to find it.'' The participant, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added, ''He said Federal officials had no business determining the alignment of a state road and should stay the heck out.''
Mr. Sununu, in the interview, said he was ''upset by a lot of people using the Federal process in a way that was not intended.'' He said advocates were ''not using it to protect the environment but to block the expansion of a highway.''
Last month Mr. Sununu's Republican successor as Governor, Judd Gregg, finally reached an agreement to conduct a full environmental impact study on the route.
Mr. Sununu's most successful intervention to promote development in New Hampshire has been his support for the Seabrook nuclear plant. For years, he was one of its most visible and active supporters.
 
Using White House For Seabrook Help
In one important move, Mr. Sununu apparently worked behind the scenes to get the plant licensed. Under Federal law, nuclear plants must have an emergency evacuation plan able to protect residents within 10 miles.
The agency responsible for evaluating such plans was the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the official in charge in the Boston office in the late 1980's was Edward Thomas.
Mr. Thomas argued that the plan for Seabrook was flawed and that in the event of a disaster at the plant, thousands of people would be trapped because of the poor road network, particularly if an accident occurred during the summer when crowds flock to the Atlantic beaches near Seabrook.
Governor Sununu complained to the White House that certain ''personnel'' were not approving the evacuation plan ''in an expeditious and unbiased fashion,'' according to an affidavit by Samuel Speck, Mr. Thomas's supervisor in the Emergency Management Agency's Washington office.
In the document, given to a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy, Conservation and Power, Mr. Speck said he met with Mr. Sununu, but that the Governor, apparently still unsatisfied, complained again to the White House about Mr. Thomas.
Mr. Thomas said in a recent telephone interview that he had been ordered not to comment on the matter. But a close friend said that Mr. Thomas had felt under pressure to change his position. The friend said Mr. Thomas had been denied vacation, made to work 70 or more hours a week, and was told by superiors that his career was in danger.
 
Ronald Reagan Solves the Problem
In November 1988, shortly after President Bush was elected, Ronald Reagan ended the dispute by declaring that the Federal Government would henceforth have authority to draft such evacuation plans.
In recent weeks, Wallace E. Stickney was nominated to be the new head of the Emergency Management Agency. He was Mr. Sununu's Commissioner of Transporation in New Hampshire and had pushed the Route 101 project.
Mr. Thomas's old job in the agency's Boston office is now held by Richard H. Strone, Governor Sununu's state emergency management chief, who had been in charge of the evacuation plan for Seabrook.
Mr. Thomas, meanwhile, has transferred to do flood relief work in the South.
Mr. Sununu defends his actions on environmental matters. ''I don't feel uncomfortable having done my job as Governor where economic development is a primary requisite,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Study Offers Remedies For Impoverished Delta

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MEMPHIS, May 13

 BODY:
A new Federal study of the Mississippi Delta says the region, stricken by poverty, needs a broad range of remedies to help it catch up with the rest of the country.
The report, by the Lower Mississippi Delta Commission, is to be presented to Congress on Monday. It proposes a long list of goals and broadly worded requests for help from Federal, state and local governments, businesses and religious leaders, but makes scant mention of where the money might come from to pay for its recommendations.
The commmission, created by Congress in 1988 to prepare a 10-year plan for economic development, was not responsible for finding sources of money, said Ed Jones, a commission member. ''We don't know where the money is going to come from,'' said Mr. Jones, who is a retired Democratic Congressman from northwest Tennessee. ''That wasn't our job.''
The report, which cost $3 million, defines the delta as a 219-county strip along the Mississippi River in Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee.
The suggestions in the report included coordinated efforts by Federal agencies to reduce the high rate of infant deaths in the delta, comprehensive state programs to reduce teen-age pregnancies, expansion of Medicaid coverage, a regional bank for small and minority-owned businesses, and magnet schools in each state and a regional magnet school for mathematics and science.

HEADLINE: The Editorial Notebook;
Mr. Darman and Green Vegetables

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WADE

 BODY:
Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, is a delightful scold. Sometimes he needles business leaders, sometimes Congress or environmentalists or opinion makers, but the stiletto is always wrapped in a colorful phrase. In a metaphor-strewn speech at Harvard recently, he accused the usual suspects of having lost confidence in America. 
Mr. Darman's bete noire is green. In his view, there are good environmentalists, like his wife and children and the President; and bad environmentalists - they know who they are - who want to manage the global economy, who oppose growth, who fear all risks, and who, under their green masks, are closet socialists. ''Americans did not fight and win the wars of the 20th century to make the world safe for green vegetables,'' Mr. Darman declaimed.
Joining the bad environmentalists in Mr. Darman's doghouse are the America-in-decline theorists who believe America's prime has past and Japan is the new hegemon. What these two groups share, he explains, is an aversion to risk and the values of American Romance. Risk-taking made America great, and in Mr. Darman's view we must commit ourselves to more risk, like ''manned missions to Mars and beyond,'' missions that ''symbolize directly what is at the heart of the American Romance.''
That's stirring rhetoric but Mr. Darman has surely missed the point about risk. Not all risks are equally worth running: it depends on the reward. Now it's true that a few environmentalists speak as if every hazard were an imminent menace to life, a position that leads quickly to pastoral nomadism. But most seek precautions against real risks: for what happens when such risks are ignored, take a look at the polluted wreckage of Eastern Europe.
Businessmen dislike risk as much as environmentalists. Japanese companies are more adventurous not because they are Romantics like Mr. Darman, but because they face less risk than their American competitors. Their Government, unlike Mr. Darman's, has run its economy so as to provide plentiful capital at low interest rates. Investments look less risky at 3 percent interest than at 9 percent. Japanese companies also reduce risk by belonging to industrial groups, or keiretsu. These include a member bank, supported by the Bank of Japan. Keiretsu companies rarely if ever go bankrupt. A company that can't lose thinks longer term and can afford higher risks.
Predictions of America's relative decline will have a solid basis as long as Mr. Darman and his colleagues fail to provide the economic environment in which American companies have an equal chance.
Manned missions to Mars offer no escape from this perilous slough. To the contrary, they're an extravagant waste. Robots could explore Mars more effectively, at a fifth the cost, at no risk to human life and with vast commercial spinoffs.
Messrs. Darman and Bush and Quayle evidently hate the thought of sending robots to Mars, maybe because it seems such a dry, calculated risk. What they enjoy is grand, sweeping jetes into the unknown. They thrill at the notion of burning $50 billion to put men at risk on Martian deserts, while loftily ignoring the decadelong erosion of America's high-technology industries. That's a Romantic Risk. It makes even the bad environmentalists look like realists. NICHOLAS WADE

HEADLINE: Panama Needs Help, Now

BYLINE: By Sol M. Linowitz; Sol M. Linowitz, a lawyer, was a negotiator of the Panama Canal treaties during the Carter Administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Nearly five months have gone by since we invaded Panama, toppled the regime, brought Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to the U.S. to stand trial and arranged for the swearing in of Guillermo Endara as President. The Panamanians applauded our intervention on their behalf and anticipated economic assistance.
President Endara and his administration are still, for the most part, waiting for Washington to deliver. Meanwhile, they face the impossible task of trying to establish a Government with requisite credibility and authority in a country in economic crisis that depends on U.S. military forces to keep order. 
Before the invasion last Dec. 20, Panama's economy had withered under two years of U.S. sanctions. National income had contracted by more than 30 percent, and more than 40 percent of the work force lacked steady jobs.
The invasion and the destructive rampage that followed delivered another devastating blow. Clearly, assistance for economic reconstruction was urgently required. President Endara was warning us when he said, ''People cannot eat democracy.''
In late January, the Bush Administration proposed a relatively modest aid package. It called for renewed access to U.S. trade credits and for investment guarantees - together worth about $500 million - as well as loans of $500 million more.
These loans would be used to help rebuild housing and rehabilitate business, to open lines of credit for private and public investment and to clear up interest arrears at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, thereby allowing both institutions to restore their assistance programs.
So far, Washington has delivered only $42 million in emergency aid, as well as trade credits and investment guarantees that do not involve any current outlays.
The critical $500 million in loans -which has been cut to $420 million -remained bottled up for months while Congress and the White House haggled over the precise amount, the specific uses to which the aid was to be put and the source of the funds.
Now that Congress is finally on the verge of approving the assistance package, another obstacle has arisen. The Senate tacked an amendment onto the aid legislation that would allow the District of Columbia to use local tax revenues to finance some abortions. That amendment almost certainly invites a Presidential veto.
Instead of aid, Panama is getting a lesson in Washington politics. This performance can only fuel skepticism worldwide about the depth of Washington's vaunted support for democratic change.
How can other countries take our commitments seriously when we do not help a fledgling Government we ourselves put into office?
What does this say to the newly installed Government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in Nicaragua, which also awaits U.S. support; to the many Latin American countries that, with our encouragement, struggle toward democracy -and of course to Eastern European nations that count on our help?

HEADLINE: Census Knocks, but Few Want to Answer

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
It took Eddie Quiles exactly half an hour on a recent Saturday to knock on nine apartment doors in the South Bronx and compile one of the sorriest records in the annals of door-to-door canvassing - three households did not answer, four asked him to come back later and two told him to get lost.
That these were his neighbors apparently made no difference.
''I told one of you this morning 'No' and I'm telling you now, I won't answer it,'' one woman snapped at the 21-year-old Census Bureau worker.
Another census taker encountered a confused resident during her rounds among the cooperatives and luxury high-rises of the Upper East Side. ''I'm from the census,'' she announced. ''We don't want any,'' came the response. 
And in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, an elderly woman ushered Miguel Barreto, a census worker, into her apartment, but not before keeping him knocking for minutes.
''I almost didn't get up,'' she said. ''I thought it was the Jehovah's Witnesses.''
 
A Force of 200,000
So goes the day for the census counters, a force of more than 200,000 temporary workers who are combing apartment buildings and houses throughout New York City and nationwide to elicit information from households that failed to return questionnaires by last month's deadline.
The count is crucial for areas with low mail-back rates like New York City, not only in determining accurate population numbers but also influencing the local share of Federal aid and representation in state legislatures and Congress.
But despite its importance, the job is fraught with frustration and tedium, and a turnover rate of up to 100 percent. For each counter hired, the bureau keeps at least seven replacements ready to take over, recruited mostly from the neighborhoods where they are needed. This candidate pool stands at some 69,000 people in New York City, and about 1.4 million nationwide, bureau officials said.
The job pays $8 an hour in New York City, the highest rate in the country, and workers include professionals and the unemployed, students and homemakers, who say they do it for the money or out of a sense of civic duty. The workers must pass a basic reading and writing test, a background check by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and three days of training.
The work gives them a chance to meet new people, develop detective skills to track down the most elusive and to exercise, the census takers, known as enumerators, say. They say many residents have shown the fear, indifference, antagonism or ignorance about the census that presumably kept them from filling out the form on their own. They have also run into numerous people who insist they already mailed back the form.
''That's the second one. It's ridiculous,'' a tenant at the St. Mary's Park Houses in the Bronx told Clarence W. Rollocks, an enumerator, when he told her she had to respond again.
Mr. Rollocks, 31, a father of six children, who lived with his family in a city shelter for the homeless until recently, said he empathized.
 
Offered Coffee and Meals
But the census takers say they have found cooperation for the most part, and many report having been invited into homes and offered coffee, meals and, in at least one case, champagne. They say many residents explain that they never received the form, while others say they misplaced it, or were away or too busy to answer it.
''They're hospitable, especially if you walk in sweating,'' said Benjamin Robles, 41, a counter in Brooklyn.
The job is not for the weak, however. Many of the census workers agree that only the persistent, the resourceful and the thick-skinned are likely to make it.
In Houston, a female counter, Elizabeth Saragoza, was welcomed by a man who ''stood there totally nude.'' In New York City, 5,500 counters must negotiate access with doormen and concierges, win over the many who are fearful or suspicious of government and brave drug-infested neighborhoods.
 
Constant Paperwork
A day's work can bring slammed doors and racial slurs. Hired for up to 40 hours a week, many work longer as they keep going back for the missing at odd hours and deal with constant paperwork.
''A lot of people don't expect the job to be so hard,'' said Virginia Pei, a counter in the Chinatown section of Manhattan who said she felt like quitting on her second day.
Richard Bitzer, the Census Bureau's assistant chief for field operations, said that those who quit generally are displeased with some aspect of the work or find permanent or better jobs. He said that the bureau expects a turnover of 30 to 100 percent by the time the count ends in mid-June.
''The big cities are always the biggest challenge,'' Mr. Bitzer said. ''It's a little harder to get around Manhattan than suburban America. There are also more multi-story structures with security.''
 
Six Attempts Required
All workers carry a census briefcase, an identification tag, a register with a computer printout of addresses and blank census forms. They are required to make six attempts to reach residents at each address, three in person and three by telephone.
They are expected to complete about 10 forms a day, a production schedule that troubles New York City officials afraid of a gross undercount. They say it may be unrealistic and might prevent the workers from meeting the completion deadline.
''Theoretically they can cover it,'' said Tara Singh, a planner in Mayor David N. Dinkins's census-project office. ''Given the extremely heavy work, it's kind of doubtful.''
Since they only carry addresses, the workers often try to get names from a mailbox or a building superintendent, then try to conduct a telephone interview. As a last resort, they are to use a neighbor, a mail carrier or other knowledgeable source to find out vital information about occupants.
 
'Could I Send Her Up?'
But the job itself varies widely among regions, neighborhoods and even blocks.
On the Upper East Side, for instance, an enumerator waited in the lobby of a luxury high-rise one day last week as the concierge buzzed each unit to announce: ''There's a lady here from the Census Bureau. She'd like to speak with you. Could I send her up?''
The system was the product of delicate talks with the building's management. The census taker would not be provided the names of occupants, but the concierge would try to put her in touch with each apartment. The counter, an unemployed manufacturing executive in her 30's who asked not to be identified, said she had about 200 units to visit in the building and would likely be stationed in the lobby for weeks.
And in Chinatown, Ms. Pei found mostly walk-ups, and the only barrier between her and her objective was unwillingness to respond. She said she found many undocumented immigrants who were fearful, or elderly residents who did not want to be bothered.
 
Three Different Tongues
One day last week her assignment took her to six floors of apartments atop a restaurant. Finding her way to unmarked apartments by speaking three different tongues - Cantonese, Mandarin and Toysan - she was allowed into a four-room apartment thick with the smells of home cooking.
Six men lived there, but four were at work. The two who were present answered her questions but the men said they did not know much about their roommates. She would have to come back.
''You have to be like a hunting dog,'' she said.
Enumerators in New York City are also conducting ''sweeps'' in which groups of them visit public-housing projects to catch as many residents as possible at once and to keep each other safe in the roughest areas.
There have been only two assaults on enumerators reported nationwide, Mr. Bitzer said. A counter, 52, in Monticello, Miss., was shot in the face and chest through a window by a 71-year-old man who mistook him for teen-agers who had harassed him in previous weeks. Another census taker, in Alton, Ill., a 31-year-old woman, was bitten on the shoulder by a woman who mistook her for a fund-raiser.
Many workers say they have experienced verbal threats. As friendships develop among the workers, some male enumerators have taken time of their own to accompany their female counterparts. Sometimes police precincts are asked to patrol a building while enumerators count.
Elizabeth Losey, 28, a construction worker and a counter in the Bronx, also worked in the 1980 census. She always goes out with a partner.
''Back then people weren't scared to go out,'' she said of 10 years ago. ''Now people are more afraid to open their door. There was less crime back then. There were no drugs.''

HEADLINE: Shellfish Is Tiny, but Problems It Could Cause Are Huge

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 10

 BODY:
The zebra mussel, an aquatic invader from Europe, is rapidly advancing into New York State, threatening to become a major pest in the Hudson, Delaware and Susquehanna Rivers, marine biologists say.
It is moving into New York by a circuitous route, from the west rather than the east, after having been deposited in the Great Lakes in ballast waters of oceangoing ships traveling the St. Lawrence River from European ports.
In only three years, the mussel and its fast-swimming larvae have spread from Lake St. Clair, near Detroit, west into Lake Michigan and east into Lakes Erie and Ontario in western New York. $4 Billion in the Next 10 Years Already a major environmental problem, the small inedible shellfish, which reproduces prolifically, is dangerous in two ways: it clogs the pipes of power plants and it devours microscopic plants at the bottom of the food chain eaten by native fresh-water fish. 
So far it has been found in the intake pipes of power-generating stations at Dunkirk on the east end of Lake Erie, at the Niagara Power Project on the Niagara River just north of Niagara Falls, and at some Canadian projects on Lake Ontario as well as in some midwestern states.
Its economic impact on industry and commercial and recreational fishing will be substantial, said Robert Lange, supervisor of the Great Lakes fisheries program for the New York Department of Environmental Conservation.
''We estimate that it will cost $4 billion in the next 10 years in the Great Lakes area alone,'' said Margaret Dochoda, a biologist for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission in Ann Arbor, Mich. The costs will be borne by businesses, in changing intake pipes to keep the mussels out and in cleaning pipes already clogged; by ship owners and boat owners, in cleaning their hulls, and by the commercial fishing, sports fishing and tourist industries, in lower catches.
 
'Worse Than the Oil Spill in Alaska'
''This is a very serious problem,'' she said. ''We say it is worse than the oil spill in Alaska because these exotic introductions are permanent and spreading. They can't be cleaned up like the oil spill. In a hundred years, they will be all over America, while the oil spill will have been cleaned up.''
To monitor the spread of the mussels into New York, a research program began last month to find out how far they have penetrated into the state.
Twenty monitoring stations were set up in the Erie Canal and the Hudson, Delaware and Susquehanna Rivers by Acres International Corporation under contract with the Empire State Electric Energy Research Corporation, an arm of the state's electric industry. The results are not yet known. Another sign of mounting concern is that Maurice D. Hinchey, an Ulster County Democrat and chairman of the State Assembly's Environmental Conservation Committee, has called a public hearing on the threat of the zebra mussel for May 24 in Niagara Falls.
 
No Natural Predators
''What makes these guys bad is that they have an affinity for pipes, which affects municipal water plants, power plants and industry,'' Mr. Lange said. ''They proliferate to the point where they gum up the works, even stopping the flow of the water.''
Zebra mussels, so named because of dark brown stripes on their light tannish shells, are native to the Black and Caspian Seas. Without any natural predators to hamper their growth and expansion, they have found a new and congenial home here. They can be spread by commercial fishing boats and by recreation boats that are driven on trailers from waterway to waterway.
They attached themselves to navigational buoys, docks and ladders and even plastic bottles in addition to water intake pipes. The shells of dead mussels have already piled up on beaches, causing some bathers in Lakes Erie and St. Clair to wear footgear to prevent cuts, according to a recent report.
Adult zebra mussels grow to an inch to an inch and a half. Colonies can grow quickly from 30,000 to 40,000 mussels a square yard. The mussels prefer moving water, which is why they are so dangerous in industrial water intakes, biologists say.
 
Studying Ways of Control
By depleting the fish food supply, the zebra mussel could cause a decline in the important walleye fishing industry of Lake Erie, in the major whitefish fishing of Lake Superior and, if it reaches the Mississippi River, in the edible mussel industry, as well as in other fishing, the biologists said.
In their native habitat, zebra mussels are kept under control by diving ducks, by systematic repeated flushing of water systems with heated water and by chemicals like copper sulfate and chlorine.
In the United States, both chemical and thermal controls are being studied. At the Niagara Power Project, for example, John Malinchock, the environmental supervisor, said the project was preparing to use chlorine to eliminate them.
Bills have been introduced in Congress to spend $4 million a year for five years on prevention programs and an equal amount on eradication. But marine biologists expressed skepticism about proposed controls.
''There's really nothing that anyone knows right now to prevent them from spreading,'' said Mr. Lange.

HEADLINE: Main Builder In Stamford Is Faltering

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., May 11

 BODY:
This is the town that the F. D. Rich Company built. It was F. D. Rich that bulldozed virtually all of Stamford's decrepit downtown 25 years ago. And it was F. D. Rich that erected many of the high-rise office buildings that came to symbolize Stamford's rebirth as a corporate capital.
In the last six months, though, the 70-year-old company has faltered, battered by a glut of commercial office space and by tightened lending policies among debt-saddled New England banks. 
F. D. Rich, a closely held family-run firm, is four months behind on $2.7 million it owes in city property-tax payments; it may have liens placed on some of its properties if payments are not made by May 31.
 
Refused Further Discussion
And last month, the cash-hungry company announced that it had joined with one of the nation's largest real-estate concerns, the JMB Realty Corporation of Chicago, in what appears to be a merger or a partial sale, but which officials at Rich will only call ''a preliminary, non-binding agreement concerning the recapitalization and reorganization of F. D. Rich.''
Officials of F. D. Rich and JMB refused any further discussion of their deal, which must be approved by the company's lenders, or of other aspects of the companies.
''This is one of the risks of being a large-scale developer,'' said Charles T. Lee, chairman of the city's Urban Redevelopment Commission. ''You have to sink so much up front it's hard to hold on long enough to get your return, and you're terribly vulnerable to market downturns.''
The company's troubles are typical of the financial struggles now facing many commercial developers in New England and other parts of the Northeast. ''The real-estate business is screwed up, and it's not unique to Stamford,'' said Ed Tonnessen, senior vice president of Albert B. Ashforth Inc., a Stamford real-estate company.
In Stamford, however, some see F. D. Rich's negotiations with JMB as a sign of the end of an era of staggering growth for this Fairfield County city.
''It's a milestone,'' said Paul King Jr., senior vice president of the Grubb & Ellis Company, a San Francisco-based commercial real-estate firm with an office in Stamford.
The F. D. Rich Company was founded as a small contracting firm by F. D. Rich, an Italian immigrant stonemason who passed the business onto his sons, F. D. (Frank) Rich Jr. and Robert N. Rich. In recent years, much of the company's business has been handled by the founder's grandsons, F. D. (Rick) Rich 3d and Thomas L. Rich.
The company's rise to preeminence in Stamford started in the late 1950's, when it struck a deal with the city and the Federal Government that gave it a virtual monopoly on downtown development. In exchange, the company was required to construct office buildings long before there was any certainty that there would be tenants.
In the mid-1960's, the company demolished acres of decaying buildings in what had been a dying, brick-faced manufacturing town and started the slow process of rebuilding. It began projects like the GTE Corporation headquarters and its own 22-story Landmark Square office building. It was also a partner in the development of the Stamford Town Center mall.
 
Fortune 500 Companies
Over the years, the redevelopment of Stamford was so successful that by the mid-1980's the city had become the commercial hub for a stretch of suburbia covering Rockland to New Haven counties. More than two dozen Fortune 500 companies relocated their headquarters to Fairfield County, making it the third largest center for corporate headquarters in the nation, behind New York City and Chicago.
''If people could see the before-and-after, they would be astounded,'' said John H. Rostenberg, a partner in the Rostenberg-Doern Company, a commercial real-estate firm in White Plains and Stamford. ''Stamford would never look like what it does today without Rich.''
In 1987, however, F. D. Rich started to show signs of financial stress. It hired Salomon Brothers to help it refinance some of its projects and possibly sell some of its holdings. Last summer, it obtained a $114 million loan to refinance its Landmark Square complex.
Much of the company's financial problems have emanated from a high vacancy rate in its office buildings. About 500,000 square feet of its 3.2 million square feet in office space in Stamford is not leased.
''I don't think there is any more boom left here,'' Mr. Tonnessen said.
Stamford has an office space vacancy rate of 24 percent - a slight drop from past years, but prices have not increased and some developers have cut their prices to near-1980 levels.
''Like other cities in the country there was overbuilding in the mid-1980's,'' Mr. Lee said. ''From a city standpoint, that is a blessing in disguise. It now keeps our rental rates low, and we continue to be competitive with New York and New Jersey.''
F. D. Rich's troubles are also a result of the regional economic downturn that has flattened if not cut real-estate prices and dried up credit for both new building and refinancing.
''Stamford hit a nosedive in 1987, as many cities did, after the tax-reform act passed and stopped tax-driven speculative office building,'' Mr. Lee said.
Another drain on F. D. Rich's resources, local real-estate executives said, has been the Commonwealth Center, a $650 million theater-and-office-building complex in Boston, where the economy, and particularly the real-estate market, is softer than in Stamford.
Local business leaders, however, suspect that an arrangement with JMB will likely leave F. D. Rich with a much less active role in the management of its properties.
''It could be a direct purchase, a merger or a partnership,'' Mr. Rostenberg said. ''And how much of the company Rich keeps will be determined by the type of deal JMB and Rich strike, if they strike a deal.''

HEADLINE: SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS: STADIUMS;
Winner: Coney Island

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
A MAJOR new study by an award-winning Brooklyn research group has concluded that a domed sports stadium should be built in Coney Island and financed by a novel combination of bank loans and public donations.
''An intriguing idea,'' said Robert Zeig, the executive director of the Brooklyn Sports Foundation, which is pushing a similar project.
The report, whose simple, straightforward language could serve as a model for the frequently turgid genre, was prepared by 12 researchers. 
They spent three months conferring with public officials, conducting opinion surveys, studying transportation maps and inspecting the proposed site, much of which, they noted, ''is what we call 'bummed up.' ''
''Some of us went to Coney Island and looked around,'' the researchers said. ''We saw a lot of empty buildings and vandalism. Putting a stadium there would mean tearing down the rundown places to get land to build on.''
The report, hailed by the Brooklyn Borough President, Howard Golden, won a $15,000 first prize in a nationwide contest sponsored by American Express.
It was prepared by members of Frances Schafer's seventh grade classes at the Nathan Hale Intermediate School.
After quickly deciding that Brooklyn needed a stadium, the researchers investigated three sites. They rejected one, near their school, because ''the maps showed us that there was no train and only two buses into the area,'' and another, Prospect Park, because ''Ms. Schafer said some people would kill to save the grass and we want people to like the idea of a stadium.''
They said they liked Coney Island, an established recreation center with extensive transportation, for ''a lot of reasons.''
''It has the beach, amusement parks, restaurants and the aquarium. We figured people could go to Coney Island, spend the day, have dinner and then go to a game. It would be good for the neighborhood because it would help the businesses and it would bring more police into the area to make it safer for the people.''
The analysis ranged from the personal (''We knew it would be fun to have a stadium'') to the economic (''We also figured it would make jobs for construction and for the people who worked in the stadium.'') Schafer said that all the students had contributed to the report, but that the ''main wordsmiths'' were Nandi Ali and Angelo Melendez. ''I typed it,'' she said.
After momentary elation, the students were actually a bit crestfallen when they learned they had won the contest, but only because they had misunderstood when Schafer brought them the news.
''They thought it meant the stadium would be built,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Executives See a Chance Of Deficit Cut

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOT SPRINGS, Va., May 12

 BODY:
Despite repeated disappointments, many of the nation's top corporate executives say they think there is at least an even-money chance for a breakthrough in budget negotiations that begin on Tuesday in Washington, with a sizable number supporting such an agreement even if it includes an increase in personal income taxes.
''I'm encouraged that we will accomplish it finally this time, and it will have all kinds of good effects.'' said Edmund T. Pratt Jr., the chairman of Pfizer Inc., the pharmaceutical company.
A significant reduction of the deficit is a goal that has eluded policy makers for half a decade or more.
Mr. Pratt was one of the company chiefs interviewed at a meeting of the Business Council, a group wtih 100 active members, many of them chief executives of the nation's largest companies. They gather twice a year at the historic Homestead Hotel here. 
Others declaring themselves more or less optimistic included Lewis T. Preston of J. P. Morgan & Company, John G. Smale of the Procter & Gamble Company and Frank P. Popoff of the Dow Chemical Company.
But though a majority of the executives said higher taxes would have to be part of any successful budget deal, not all were willing to accept higher income tax rates.
Mr. Smale, for example, said he would have ''real difficulty'' with any plan to raise rates, including one that would eliminate a feature in the tax law that taxes a portion of middle-income earnings at 33 percent while those with higher incomes are taxed at 28 percent.
Another participant, Michael J. Boskin, the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, cited rising interest rates and lower corporate profits as factors that prompted the Administration to make budget overtures. He also seemed to indicate that taxes involving fuels and the environment would be prominent candidates if the Administration did agree to higher taxes.
Mr. Boskin, one of the eight members of President Bush's negotiating team, met with reporters after a presentation to the Business Council on the environment, the main subject of the two-day gathering. He responded to an observation that the subject of environmental taxes is increasingly under discussion by noting that the Administration was ''predisposed toward user fees in general.''
In February's Economic Report of the President, Mr. Boskin's office contended that economic incentives were to be preferred over statutory compulsions to deal with the environment and said ''a variety of policy tools, including user charges,'' could be employed, for example, ''to slow the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.''
Mr. Boskin declined to comment on whether he considered gasoline taxes to be user fees.
 
Ending the Deadlock
Many members of the Business Council seemed almost eager for new taxes if that would break the long-standing fiscal deadlock that, among other things, has forced the Federal Reserve to adhere to a relatively restrictive monetary policy that has produced high interest rates.
The White House budget director, Richard G. Darman, another of the President's negotiators, said in a lecture last week at Harvard University that ''reducing the deficit is probably necessary to get interest rates satisfactorily down.''
While the members agreed with the Administration in mostly favoring spending cuts over tax increases, they were considerably less interested in the mechanism by which reducing the deficit occurs than in seeing it accomplished.
''Put everything on the table - and not take anything off if it solved the problem,'' advised one executive who asked not to be named. The executive supports raising the top income tax bracket to a uniform 33 percent.
Willard C. Butcher, the chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, also proposed higher taxes and spending cuts, perhaps some kind of tax on consumption and the means-testing of entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare to exclude those who do not need them.
To raise the savings rate, Mr. Butcher suggested that no limit be imposed on the size of yearly contributions to individual retirement accounts.
 
The Issue of Gas Taxes
Roger B. Smith, the chairman of the General Motors Corporation, said that he opposed higher gasoline taxes because they are regressive, but that he could support a ''greenhouse'' or ''carbon'' fee, taxing fuels like oil and coal that pollute the air. He said such taxes would not fall so heavily on the poor.
The group still had numerous doubters as to whether a deficit-reduction agreement could be reached.
''It's not a very good start,'' said G. William Miller, the chairman of Federated Stores Inc. and Treasury Secretary during the Carter Administration, referring to the public sparring that has occurred since the negotiations were set. ''One still has to be skeptical.''
Tom H. Barrett, the chairman the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, said he thought it ''too early to tell'' the odds of a successful outcome but he also expressed a fairly widespread suspicion that the talks would not be taking place had there not been some clandestine winks and nods.
''It sounds,'' Mr. Barrett said, ''like there's something going on behind the scenes.''

HEADLINE: New Game Plan for Sports Daily

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
The creators of The National thought they had a formula that could not fail: a daily sports newspaper packed with local and national news.
But so far, the strategy has not been a success. Now, the newspaper is drastically scaling down its coverage of local professional sports in its regional editions to focus more on stories of national interest.
''Our research told us that our readers didn't need The National to give them local sports coverage,'' said Frank Deford, the paper's editor in chief. ''They said they wanted something extra from us.'' 
Since it was started in late January on an initial investment of more than $30 million, The National has received praise from some journalists for innovative graphics and dramatic photographs, and for articles about sports personalities.
But it has been criticized by others because many articles about local sports are too short to give any compelling sense of the games.
 
'No Sense of Urgency'
''There's no sense of the urgency of a daily newspaper,'' said Mike Lupica, the brash columnist who The National hired from The Daily News in New York. ''There's nothing to grab people.''
Among its problems, The National has been unable to provide all the late sports scores in its New York and Chicago editions. Unlike its competition, it does not own its printing presses and cannot set its deadlines as late as it might want to.
Some dailies in New York and Chicago consider the late scores so important to sales that they print editions well into the morning to include them. USA Today also includes late scores in its Eastern editions.
Mr. Deford said the paper was unlikely to add the late scores soon.
Several journalists also said the paper had not yet delivered on its promise of investigative reporting about sports.
Mr. Deford said the paper had produced a few major investigative articles, but he acknowledged that The National had not ''blown the roof off'' of any scandals.
In addition, media executives questioned The National's schedule for expanding circulation. ''They are moving too slowly if they want to attract a lot of national advertising,'' said John Meskil, the media director at Warwick, Baker & Fiore, a New York advertising agency.
Analysts said a primary reason for The National's shift toward national sports coverage was the overwhelming competition from local newspapers and radio and television stations.
''Matching the local sports coverage was simply too difficult to do on a daily basis,'' said Gary Pranzo, the media director for Young & Rubicam.
But The National's new strategy may not fare any better, analysts say. The newspaper will now have to compete for readers and advertisers with well-established weekly sports publications, like Sports Illustrated and The Sporting News, and with USA Today, which many readers buy for its sports coverage.
''We really don't need another national sports publication,'' Mr. Meskil said. ''The National certainly isn't setting the world on fire.''
The newspaper, which is sold primarily in the New York, Los Angeles and Chicago areas, claims a circulation of about 200,000. A limited number of copies are also available in a few other cities, including Buffalo, St. Louis and Bakersfield, Calif.
That circulation, however, has not been verified by an independent audit, and some analysts believe the correct figure is closer to 150,000. Doubts about total circulation, they say, are hurting advertising sales.
Peter Spina, the paper's advertising sales director, said the paper's circulation would probably be audited at the end of this year.
During the second half of this year, The National plans to expand its distribution nationwide, adding one city a month, starting with San Diego in June and San Francisco in July.
''The name 'National' really doesn't fit yet,'' Mr. Pranzo said. As a result, he added, the newspaper is not a ''must buy'' for national advertisers.
The National is running an average of five pages of advertising in each issue, Mr. Spina said. And while he said this exceeded the paper's projections, most advertising was sold at discounted rates.
 
'Jaws of a Media Recession'
The advertising climate is not likely to improve any time soon, analysts said. ''They launched the publication in the jaws of a media recession,'' said John Morton, an analyst at Lynch, Jones & Ryan, an investment firm in Washington.
Advertising in newspapers and magazines has drastically fallen since the first of the year. At Sports Illustrated, for example, advertising pages were down 17.8 percent for the first quarter of 1990.
The National is trying to lure advertisers away from magazines by offering exclusivity. Recently, for example, the paper sold an entire issue to a single advertiser, Philip Morris USA, which ran six ads. ''It is almost as if the paper is a sales brochure for them,'' Mr. Spina said.
The paper also plans to start a classified advertising section in July and special advertising sections for important sports events like the Indianapolis 500 auto race.
But getting the kind of wide distrbution and large circulation that national advertisers demand might prove to be too costly for the paper, analysts said. USA Today, for example, lost more than $100 million in each of its first two years.
 
Prediction of Big Losses
''As the paper expands into new markets,'' Mr. Morton said, ''the costs are going to keep increasing, but for several months the advertising won't increase commensurately and there are going to be big losses.''
The National is backed by Emilio Azcarraga, whose company, Televisa, owns four television stations in Mexico. He pledged $100 million to start the paper. The National's publisher, Peter O. Price, a former publisher of The New York Post, owns a minority interest in the paper. Starting The National cost more than $30 million, Mr. Deford said, but he would not say how much it was costing to keep the paper going on a daily basis and to move into new cities.
Meanwhile, The National will make changes in its staff as it increases its focus on national coverage. It does not need as many local sports reporters as it initially hired, and Mr. Deford said some reporters would be transferred to offices that the paper plans to open in San Diego and San Francisco this summer.
One writer who might be leaving is Mr. Lupica. He said he was unhappy with the direction the paper was taking, and some people who asked not to be identified said he had been negotiating to return to The Daily News.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
U.S. Company Loses Bolivian Mining Deal

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, May 13

 BODY:
Faced with public opposition that underscores Bolivians' deep-seated distrust of big capitalism and foreign business, the Government has backed away from a proposed mining accord with an American company.
The contract with the Lithium Corporation of America, which is based in Gastonia, N.C., and known as Lithco, had been viewed by its supporters as an important symbolic step in the efforts of Bolivia, the poorest country in South America, to modernize and expand its economy.
But as President Jaime Paz Zamora, who took office in August, advocates a freer economy and more foreign investment, he faces a formidable obstacle - decades of opposition to capitalism, which he and his predecessor, Victor Paz Estenssoro, and their parties once fostered.
 
Painful Decision
The Government announced on May 4 that it would not proceed with the Lithco deal, which it has been negotiating for several years. 
In announcing what he called a painful decision not to proceed, Mr. Paz Zamora noted that most countries in the world are fighting to attract foreign investment. He urged Bolivians to assume ''a new, modern mental attitude, without complexes or fear of progress.''
The President decided not to complete the agreement after being confronted by hunger strikes from opponents of the contract, widespread criticism of its terms and indications that Congress would not approve it. During labor demonstrations on May 1, some marchers carried signs calling for ''Death to Those Who Would Hand Over the Uyuni Salt Flats,'' the area in southwestern Bolivia covered by the now-rejected contract.
Saying the issue had become ''politicized in the extreme,'' Mr. Paz Zamora said that because of the competition for foreign investment, Bolivia ''ought to place the least number of obstacles in the road and create the best conditions to capture that investment.''
 
Angered by U.S. Ambassador
Both opponents and critics of the contract were angered several weeks ago when the United States Ambassador, Robert S. Gelbard, called on Bolivia to ''overcome its history of statism, confiscations, and nationalizations and cast aside its persistent fears of potential investors.''
The Bolivian Labor Federation responded by saying that it was declaring Mr. Gelbard ''persona non grata.'' Bolivian congressional leaders and editorial writers accused the Ambassador of exceeding the norms of diplomatic behavior.
Mr. Paz Zamora has not abandoned the idea of awarding the contract to a foreign company but said that this time he would put out a call for competitive international bids to explore and exploit the salt flats, which are situated about 400 miles south of La Paz.
The contract with Lithco had been negotiated by the Government. Mining experts said the direct approach was used because the small world lithium market is largely controlled by two companies - Lithco and Foote Minerals. Since Foote is already working in Chile, which is Bolivia's main competitor as a source of minerals other than tin, Bolivia did not want to turn to Foote.
For this reason, there is some doubt here about how much interest there will be in the future bidding. Lithco officials were unclear about whether they would bid.
Lithium, which is found in the salt brine near the surface of the Uyuni Flats, is used in a variety of products ranging from drugs for treating mental illness to ceramics and glass. It may have a more promising future in energy uses, especially if there is a breakthrough in thermal fusion.
 
Value of the Contract
Given the modest demand for lithium, the value of the contract to Bolivia would not have been great. It called for Lithco to spend $6 million in exploration and feasibility studies over three years, then invest $40 million in a processing plant if it decided to proceed.
Experts estimate that lithium exports from Bolivia could total $100 million to $110 million over 10 years, on which the Government would have received roughly 8 percent in taxes and royalties under the Lithco proposal. About 200 people would have been employed.
Mr. Gelbard said the Lithco negotiations would be viewed in the international business community ''as somewhat of a test case.'' The defeat of the deal ''cannot but have an adverse effect on the perception of the investment climate in Bolivia,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Panel Calls for More Spending on Advanced TV <

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 13

 BODY:
At a time when the Defense Department appears intent on cutting back support for research on high-definition television technology, a Pentagon advisory panel is urging that support for such research be increased tenfold to at least $100 million a year for the next five years.
The recommendation is part of a report completed this month by the High-Resolution Systems Task Force, which was established a year ago to suggest an appropriate role for the Pentagon in the development of high-resolution video displays and related technology. The Report Could Change The task force was made up of 33 representatives of the electronics industry, universities and labor unions. Its chairman is Alexander B. Trowbridge, the former president of the National Association of Manufacturers. 
The report will now go to the Defense Science Board, a Pentagon advisory body, which could change it. The report, which has not yet been officially released, is likely to be met with a cold reception by the Administration, which has expressed opposition to any Federal program that seems to favor a particular industry.
The Pentagon is reportedly trying to reduce the $10 million a year that is now budgeted for work on high-resolution technologies. The Defense Department last month also abruptly removed Dr. Craig I. Fields, the director of its Advanced Research Projects Agency, who favored programs that help industry.
An earlier draft of the task force report was the subject of news stories last month, but the early draft did not contain the spending recommendation.
 
Two Years of Debate
The report comes after two years of debate over whether the Government and industry should mount a program to develop televisions with pictures twice as sharp as those on existing sets. The debate is no longer confined to consumer televisions. Potential applications include screens for personal computers and medical imaging systems, and the technology involves developing a variety of semiconductor chips and sensors needed for capturing and processing images.
The report's conclusions are reflected in its title: ''High-Resolution Systems Critical to National Security - Both Military and Economic.''
This is partly because high-resolution displays will be used in future military systems, like radar screens, the report says. But it also argues that if foreign vendors end up dominating production of both display screens and semiconductors, they ''could capture the fastest growing segments of our domestic computer industry: work stations, high-end personal computers and portables.'' From there, the report says, foreign companies would be in a position to capture the rest of the computer industry.
 
Risks for Military Security
That in turn would pose unacceptable risks for military security, the report says, because ''our computers control our defense systems.'' Relying on foreigners ''would place the dominant foreign suppliers in a position to alter the balance of power between ourselves and our potential adversaries by their decisions as to which nations would or would not receive their most advanced computers.''
The report said that the United States is not irreversibly behind in development of high-resolution systems because such systems are not yet ready for widespread commercial use. Moreover, the United States is developing the basic technologies in universities and industrial laboratories which could enable the nation to become a ''world class competitor'' in the field.
Manufacturers in the United States still maintain control of the computer industry, which would provide a large market for high-resolution displays, the report says.
The task force report urges the Defense Department to use commercial high-definition products whenever possible, rather than those built expressly for the military. That would save the Pentagon money and stimulate the development of American industry.
But the task force also says that foreign-owned companies could be involved in Pentagon-backed programs provided they do much of their research and manufacturing in the United States.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rates Expected to Drop Further

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Many participants in the credit markets say they expect a further decline in interest rates this week, as more investors in fixed-income securities become convinced that the Bush Administration and Congress are moving to confront the nation's budget deficit.
New signs of economic weakness and declining inflationary pressures last week also contributed to the mood change in the bond market.
On Friday, the Government's reports on April retail sales and wholesale prices showed declines that exceeded expectations. The reports caused demand for fixed-income securities to soar and interest rates to drop. Any softening in the economy and easing of inflationary pressures is bullish for holders of fixed-income securities because it keeps interest rates from rising and thus eroding the value of outstanding debt issues. 
 
Bond Yields Are Lower
The market's positive mood was reflected in the sharp drop in yields on both the new and old benchmark Treasury long bonds last week. The 8.75 percent bond maturing in 2020 that was auctioned at an average yield of 8.84 percent on Thursday traded to yield 8.63 late Friday. The yield on the 8.5 percent long bonds due February 2020 plunged to 8.66 percent, from 8.83 percent on Thursday and 8.82 percent the week before.
''Interest rates actually began to drop May 4, after the April employment data showed an unexpectedly small rise in non-farm jobs and rise in the rate of overall unemployment,'' said Philip Braverman, chief economist at the DKB Securities Corporation, the domestic arm of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. of Tokyo, the world's largest commercial bank. ''But the full impact of what was happening was delayed by the usual concerns that precede a quarterly Treasury refunding. Once the week's auctions of the record $30.5 billion of notes and bonds were over and the paper quickly distributed to retail investors, the rush to lock in yields was on.''
But Mr. Braverman, who has steadfastly predicted that the flow of economic data in the second quarter would cause interest rates to fall, said, ''The credit market believes the latest signs of a weakening economy have caused the Administration to enter into a sort of social contract with the Federal Reserve and money market to reverse the upward pressure on interest rates by working toward a budget compromise with Congress that is likely to include tax increases.''
 
Threat to the Economy
The Administration has little choice, he said, because if it does not act to increase revenues the high borrowing costs plus the cost of the savings and loan bailout will lead to even higher interest rates that will throttle any chance for reviving the economy.
Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, said: ''Perceptions in any marketplace carry as much weight as reality. In the credit market, the fact that politicians are even willing to discuss increasing taxes in a Congressional election has had a tremendous impact on thinking in the credit market in recent days. So has Washington's indirect admission that it has mismanaged the economy.''
But Mr. Kellner also noted that interest rates, as measured by the yield on the Treasury's long bonds, are still almost a percentage point above the level of late December. ''Thus, prices of long-term debt have a way to go on the upward side before we see a significant decline in interest rates,'' he said. ''But we expect that the next batch of economic data will be sufficiently negative to push up prices of fixed-income debt and lower interest rates.''
Leif H. Olsen, who heads a financial management and consulting firm bearing his name in New Canaan, Conn., said on Friday: ''The behavior of the stock market may unnerve some in the fixed-income market, but the 63-point surge in the Dow Jones industrial average mainly reflects the drop in interest rates and lessening inflationary pressures, not the fact that the economy is steadily deteriorating. The market has been blinded by the near doubling of the gross national product in the first quarter, which climbed at an annual rate of 2.1 percent. The next G.N.P. report due out on May 24, will show a downward revision.''
 
Outlook for Other Reports
Mr. Olsen expects this week's flow of economic data to show declines in housing starts and permits, industrial production, factory use and the Consumer Price Index, which will reflect a further decline in consumer spending in April. But the nation's merchandise trade balance for March is expected to show a sharp increase.
Francis A. Scotland, managing editor of the International Bank Credit Analyst, which is based in Montreal, said an important question for the American credit market is how much longer the Federal Reserve is willing to let the dollar drop. ''A further weakening in the dollar, such as one we witnessed this week, combined with falling interest rates could discourage foreign investors,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Bright Outlook For Pacific Rim

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 13

 BODY:
Economists from 15 Pacific Rim nations said last week that they expected further modest slowing of growth in the region this year but that the overall outlook for the region remained bright.
The economists forecast overall growth this year of 5 percent after a growth rate of 5.3 percent in 1989 and an average rate of 7.2 percent in 1988. 
 
The outlook came from the
Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference, a group that includes China, Japan, Indonesia, the United States, Canada and Australia.
Lawrence Krause, a professor at the University of California at San Diego, said that compared with the rest of the world the Pacific economies were still in outstanding shape.
''There were nine countries in the Pacific in 1989 in this group that grew at about 5 percent or better,'' he said. ''It is very hard to find a country outside this group that grew at 5 percent anywhere.''
Thailand was the leader, with growth this year forecast at 9.1 percent, followed by Singapore and Malaysia, each with an expected 8.1 percent growth rate.
At the low end of the scale were Australia, Canada, the United States, New Zealand and Brunei.

HEADLINE: WORLD TRADE BODY IS EXPECTED TO LET SOVIETS HAVE ROLE

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
In an initial step linking the Soviet Union more closely to the global economy - a goal urged by the Bush Administration - Moscow is expected to be granted observer status this week in the organization that oversees world trade.
Observer status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a 97-nation organization based in Geneva, would for the first time bring the Soviet Union into the international organizations that have helped shape the postwar world economy. The move is expected to be approved by the GATT Council at a regular monthly meeting scheduled for Wednesday.
An Administration official said today that President Bush wanted a favorable decision before his meeting in two weeks with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as ''a tangible sign of American interest in bringing the Soviet Union into the world economy.'' 
 
U.S. Opposition Ends
When Mr. Bush last met the Soviet leader at Malta last year, he pledged to remove American obstacles to Soviet participation in GATT. But the plan at that time was not to allow Moscow in until early next year.
During most of the last decade, the United States had flatly rejected the idea of granting the Soviets observer status at GATT, considering it politically undesirable and economically impractical. Europeans, on the other hand, felt there would be little harm in letting the Soviets in.
Earlier this year, the Administration decided to speed up the process started at Malta.
Torie Clarke, an aide to the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said, ''This decision stands today.''
 
No Guarantees
''The United States has let it be known that if agreeable to all other GATT members, we would have no problem with observer status, but we have made it clear that this does not guarantee full membership,'' Ms. Clarke said.
Observer status, said David Woods, head of information at the GATT headquarters, means the Soviets would be able to attend the monthly meetings of the GATT Council and participate in standing committees, like the Committee on Trade and Development, which works with the third world.
In addition, the Soviet observers could speak at meetings, if invited, usually after the full members. They would receive all documentation.
But the Soviets would not be able to vote. Neither would they be permitted to observe nor attend meetings related to the Uruguay Round, the GATT-sponsored effort to get rid of barriers to trade in services and farm products and providing better protection for patents, copyrights and other intellectual property. The Uruguay Round, which began at a negotiating session in Punta del Este, Uruguay, four years ago, is due to be concluded at the end of this year.
While observer status does not guarantee full membership, it does provide experience in the workings of the trading system. To make the transition to full membership, an applicant nation must enact policies to open its economy to competition and foreign goods. There is a no set list of measures that must be adopted for membership, such as moving to a convertible currency, but the overall drift of the nation's policies must be seen as a clear move toward more liberal trading practices. Full membership in GATT usually insures lower import duties on the products of a member country.
The move from observer status to membership can take several years. For example, China has been an observer for the last three years. It was moving to satisfy the membership requirements until it crushed student demonstrations last June. The membership talks have been suspended since.
 
Some Dispute in Congress
The decision to back an early approval of observer status for the Soviets could be contentious, because it comes as the Soviets are cracking down economically on Lithuania.
President Bush announced on April 24 that for the time being he would not order American sanctions against Moscow, but the conflict over Baltic independence is having a significant impact on Washington.
A resolution calling on the President not to support observership so long as the economic blockade of Lithuania remains has been introduced in the Senate.
Japan has also used the issue of GATT observer status for the Soviets as a vehicle for underlining its differences with Moscow. Signaling its displeasure over continued Soviet occupation of four Japanese islands off Hokkaido seized in 1945, the Japanese Government asked for a delay last month when the GATT Council first took up the Soviet issue.
Japan has set the unconditional return of the islands as a condition for concluding a peace treaty and establishing full-fledged economic ties with Moscow.
But Japanese officials, who want to see the Soviet Union move toward a market-oriented economy, say they do not plan to use the island issue to keep the Soviets out of the GATT.
''We are coordinating our position with the U.S. and the European Community,'' said Shataro Yachi, political counselor at the Japanese Embassy here. He said the GATT and island issues ''are not directly linked.''
Mr. Gorbachev is expected to visit Japan next year, and many Japanese expect that he will try to resolve the territorial problem in return for Japanese economic assistance.
GATT is important for both the Soviet Union and China as they seek to normalize commercial relations with the rest of the world. Membership protects a nation's trade interests from the discrimination against nonmembers.
For example, had the Soviet Union been a full member of the GATT, it would have been much more difficult for the United States to deny so-called most favored nation status to Soviet imports, a situation that imposes 10 times higher duties on imports from the Soviet Union than other countries.
Under a Soviet-American agreement that both sides hope to have ready by the time Mr. Gorbachev meets with Mr. Bush, the Soviets could be accorded lower tariffs.
GATT membership is also important as a sign of legitimacy and acceptance by the world community.
Mr. Woods, the GATT official, said membership would involve significant commitments to economic change. ''It cements the reform process that governments wish to pursue,'' he added.
Mexico and Morocco, two of the newest members, for example, have undertaken significant trade liberalization as a result of their accession.
The Soviets have been interested in other international economic organizations besides the GATT.
A $12 billion European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is expected to open later this year, includes the Soviet Union as well as the United States.
Moscow has long expressed interest in two important postwar institutions, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The Soviet Union participated actively in the 1944 conference at Bretton Woods, N.H., where these organizations were born. Yet the Soviet Union decided not to join, foreshadowing the cold war.
The Soviets have not applied for membership in either of the Bretton Woods twins, and it is considered unlikely that Moscow would join, at least until the mid-1990's.

HEADLINE: A Soviet Circus, Deeply in Debt, Is Stuck in U.S.

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MARIETTA, Ga., May 14

 BODY:
A troupe of the Soviet Union's leading acrobats, clowns, jugglers and animal trainers entered the United States six weeks ago with visions of sellout crowds and warm applause, only to end up in a frustrating odyssey that has left them stranded in a Marietta motel.
The tour of 125 performers in the Great Soviet Circus Bim Bom ran out of money several weeks ago because of a dispute between its American managers and a Kuwaiti investor that backed the group.
Now the circus is deeply in debt and unable to pay its bills. Several dozen circus animals, including lions, bears, horses and monkeys, are stuck at a farm in Newburgh, N.Y. And instead of soaring on trapezes or juggling fire in packed coliseums, the performers, who have been ejected from two motels in the last 10 days, have been spending their days holed up in one of the few motels that will accept them, watching television or practicing their routines in the motel parking lot. 
''They've taken everything in stride,'' said Ben Silva, the art director for International Show Business Inc., the Florida-based company that is managing the circus. ''They're cordial people who don't want any trouble. They go along with what's necessary.'' Debts and Bad Checks The circus, made up of star performers from 60 Soviet circuses, came to this country on March 31 and has left a string of debts and bounced checks in its path. The group trained in West Virginia for several weeks before playing to near-empty arenas in Hershey, Pa., and Knoxville, Tenn. The tour was suspended last week in Johnson City, Tenn., when the group was unable to get enough money to cover the cost of equipment and an arena.
A Holiday Inn in Johnson City evicted the circus, forcing it to come to Marietta, $450,000 in debt, to return rented equipment to its suppliers. Barely unpacked, it was evicted from the Motel Six in Marietta on Wednesday, when it was unable to pay its bill.
At the center of the circus's financial crisis is a disagreement over a contract between the circus managers and a principal investor.
Business managers say the investor agreed to pay $1.5 million to cover the circus's expenses, but abandoned the group after providing only $331,000. ''They said they would finance the whole thing, whatever it takes,'' Mr. Silva said.
Brooks Savage, the lawyer for the Kuwaiti investor, said that the $331,000 was a loan and that the investor was to receive 10 percent of the ticket proceeds. ''It was absolutely a loan,'' said Mr. Savage, who declined to identify his client. ''But it's looking more like a gift every day. We're standing in line to get our money back.''
Meanwhile, people have come from all over town to help the Soviet circus get back on its feet. A laundromat has offered to let the performers clean their clothes at no cost. Several restaurants have sent over free meals. People have gone door to door to collect canned food for them. And the East Side Baptist Church brings lunch over every day.
''I'm in love with them,'' said Kay Bryant, an outreach worker at the church. ''They're precious, sensitive people who have appreciated everything we do.''
But all the warm gestures do not address the real problem. ''There's been a lot of community good will,'' said Gay Watson, a spokeswoman for the local convention and visitors bureau. ''But they don't need just dinner. They need a major investor.''
Their most immediate concern is keeping a roof over their heads. The group is occupying 75 percent of the rooms at the Scottish Inn here, and it's a scramble every day to cover the $1,550 lodging bill. One day it's a credit card, another day, cash. Sunday a friend of the circus manager flew in from out of town to write a check to cover the night's expenses.
Greg Patton, manager of the Scottish Inn, said he took the group in not for political reasons, but for humanitarian ones. ''I just didn't have the heart to put 130 people on the street,'' he said.
While the Soviet performers seem grateful, they do not know enough English to thank Mr. Patton or any of the other volunteers. But the group's best English speaker, Boris Rivchun, the musical director for the circus, said: ''We are a month and a half in American land. Wonderful people. Open souls.''

HEADLINE: Economic Watch;
Debate on Puerto Rico's Future Has a Bottom Line

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
If President Bush and Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon have their way, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico will get the chance next year to vote on joining the Union or casting it off forever.
For many supporters of a binding referendum, the principle of free choice matters more than the choice that will be offered among the three alternatives: statehood, independence and retention of commonwealth status. And as enabling legislation inches its way through e Congress and the debate in Puerto Rico builds momentum, practical questions of jobs and government benefits, not national or cultural integrity, are looming largest.
''Only in Puerto Rico,'' said John Stewart, a consultant to the commonwealth's Economic Development Administration, ''do the taxi drivers refer to sections of the Federal tax code by their numbers.''
 
Effects Would Be Momentous
The economic consequences of a change in political status would be momentous for the island's 3.4 million inhabitants. 
Statehood would make Puerto Ricans eligible for billions of dollars more a year in food stamps, medical insurance and income support payments, and this might explain why statehood narrowly leads the commonwealth option in early polls.
But even advocates of statehood or independence concede that under either option the loss of Federal tax benefits linked by law to commonwealth status would lead to an initial decline in employment and would force sharp cutbacks in the size and reach of local government. Computer simulations by the Congressional Budget Office suggest that growth would be slowed one to two percentage points a year into the foreseeable future.
The best hope in the long run, economists on all sides seem to agree, is that statehood or independence would shatter the sense of Puerto Rico as an economic appendage of the United States, stimulating the savings and enterprise that are needed to break the island free of its dependency.
Puerto Rico's commonwealth status carries with it a unique package of privilege and penalty. Its residents cannot vote in Presidential elections. Nor are they entitled to all the social benefits available to residents of the 50 states.
 
Current Benefits
But Puerto Ricans are American citizens, free to live where they choose. If they live in Puerto Rico, they pay no Federal income tax. And under a benefit that is crucial to the island's economy, subsidiaries of American businesses in Puerto Rico enjoy unrestricted access to American markets but pay no Federal taxes on profits.
That benefit (Section 936 of the United States Tax Code) and the commonwealth's own generous tax incentives for new businesses have induced hundreds of manufacturers to build plants in Puerto Rico. Most are makers of pharmaceuticals, chemicals and electronics equipment, industries that are well positioned to transfer to their island subsidiaries the profits they earn on the mainland from intangible assets like patents and trademarks. And as a result of this encouragement of highly automated industries, relatively few jobs have been created for each dollar of investment.
But so many tax-sheltered investment dollars have been attracted to the island that the overall effect on the size and shape of the Puerto Rican economy has been enormous. Output per person grew at a remarkable 5 percent a year in the 1950's and 60's. The rate of growth plunged to about 1 percent in the mid-1970's after the virtual collapse of the island's tax-sheltered oil refining industry, but it has picked up to 3.6 percent over the last five years.
The overall economic performance, supplemented by substantial infusions of Federal aid and borrowed capital for improvements, has been superb. The densely populated, resource-poor island now enjoys a living standard far above that of any Caribbean or Latin American nation.
The catch, says Bernard Wasow, an economist at New York University, is that the Puerto Rican economy has been cultivated as a fragile orchid, seemingly incapable of blossoming outside the Federal hothouse. Manufacturing, virtually all of it free from Federal corporate taxes, accounts for 40 percent of its output, while agricultural production accounts for only 1.5 percent, far below the level one might expect to find in the tropics.
 
Labor Costs Are High
And labor is in great oversupply on the island. But Mr. Stewart says the effects of Federal minimum wage laws, which have kept worker compensation high by island standards, and the unlimited right of workers to move to the mainland, where they are drawn by higher salaries and greater diversity in employment, have kept labor costs close to levels in the United States. Per capita output in Puerto Rico is two-thirds that of Singapore, Mr. Stewart notes, but worker compensation is twice as high. This discourages the growth of labor-intensive industries, like tourism and apparel, that might absorb excess workers.
Not surprisingly, elected officials in the commonwealth are under chronic pressure to provide the well-paying jobs that private employers cannot. One in four Puerto Rican workers is employed by the Government, and at a cost that Puerto Rico would be hard pressed to cover without Federal aid and tax revenue from the corporations on the island drawn there by the tax breaks.
Either change in status contemplated in the referendum would upset this equilibrium. The Congressional Budget Office confirms that under statehood, Federal aid to individuals would increase to $5 billion by 1995 from $2 billion now, and would provide about one-third of the island's personal income.
The loss of preferred tax status for corporations could prove devastating to the productive economy. The Congressional Budget Office asserts that without the tax incentives, manufacturers would scale back investment in their plants by one-third to one-half. As a result, the rate of economic growth would slow, increasing unemployment by four to seven percentage points by the year 2000. KMPG Peat Marwick, a consulting firm working for partisans of the commonwealth option, predicts that 145,000 jobs, or one in six, would be lost.
Many supporters of the statehood option concede that there would be disruptions in manufacturing, but they believe that the losses would be made up quickly by businesses attracted by the opportunity of expanding into the 51st state.
But if they are wrong, Puerto Rico's economic problems would multiply.
 
Cutbacks in the Offing
Any reduction in Section 936 profits or wage income would cut into Puerto Rico's tax revenue and its ability to borrow capital for development. Under statehood, it could not easily make up the loss by raising the personal income tax. Indeed, there would be pressure to reduce tax rates because middle- and upper-income families would be required to pay Federal taxes for the first time.
Consequently, says Jose Villamil, a private economic consultant in San Juan, the government would be forced to cut back. That need not be a bad thing, even in the eyes of statehood proponents. Michael McKee, a Washington-based consultant to the party that supports statehood, sees benefits in a sell-off of money-losing enterprises owned by the commonwealth. But there is little doubt that jobs would be lost.
Forming an independent nation would also mean the phasing out of Federal aid. And without Federal money, Mr. Wasow, the New York University economist, said, ''Puerto Rico could become the inner city of the Caribbean.'' Moreover, the new nation could have serious problems in replacing the capital now being borrowed from Wall Street or in attracting companies like those lured there by tax incentives.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost of borrowed capital would rise by at least two percentage points, because interest on the bonds of an independent Puerto Rico would be fully taxable to American investors.
Puerto Rico would become eligible for help from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But the line for assistance is already long, and with the breakup of the Soviet empire, it is likely to get much longer.
 
Independence's Edge
But an independent Puerto Rico would have a significant edge over a Puerto Rican state in attracting corporate investment. United States law gives American companies a $1 tax credit for every dollar they pay in foreign taxes. So if Puerto Rico were to set its tax equal to the Federal rate and then plow much of the revenue into subsidies that made the island a more attractive place to operate, it might win a corporate following.
But Mr. Stewart, the commonwealth's consultant on development, is skeptical. If that strategy is so promising, he asked, ''Why don't other third world countries try it?'' Most, he notes, can already offer foreign corporations the advantage of far lower labor costs.
The strongest economic cases for statehood and independence rest on the idea that the Puerto Rican economy must change radically to achieve its potential. Partisans of statehood make much of the intangible benefits of stability conferred by full partnership in the Union. A more mixed blessing might be the harsh lesson in modern capitalism, as Puerto Ricans discovered that local government could no longer afford to be the employer of last resort, and that tax breaks could no longer substitute for entrepreneurial spirit in creating good jobs.
What applies to statehood applies in spades to independence. ''Instead of being a rich Caribbean country,'' Mr. Wasow said, Puerto Ricans now think of the island ''as a poor part of the U.S.''
Were the island to go it alone, Puerto Ricans might be willing to make the sacrifices that have permitted nations like South Korea and Singapore to make the leap into self-sustained growth. Specifically, they might accept lower wages to increase employment and become competitive internationally. They might also curtail consumption to pay for the capital that now comes entirely from Wall Street and the Federal Government.
''Statehood or independence could have big payoffs 15 years down the road, but the risks are enormous'' Mr. Villamil said. ''Commonwealth is a safe bet.''

HEADLINE: Warily, Congress and White House Gird for the Budget Joust

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
White House officials and Congressional leaders begin budget negotiations Tuesday with each delegation torn internally by political and philosophical disagreements.
Those differences will probably have to be resolved before the Administration and Congressional negotiators address the fundamental disputes between the two sides.
In appearance if not in reality, the two leaders of President Bush's team are somewhat at odds on the question of raising taxes.
John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff and the President's top political adviser, suggested last week that Mr. Bush might allow Democrats to propose higher taxes and then reject them out of hand. In a television interview on Sunday, he said the White House would probably ''look askance'' at a tax increase. 
But Richard G. Darman, the budget director, has hinted that some forms of higher taxes might be acceptable if the Administration got concessions in return.
Which view represents Mr. Bush's is unclear. All he has said publicly is that he is entering the negotiations with ''no preconditions.''
 
Political Ambush Is Feared
Among the Democrats, their leaders in Congress, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, are worrying openly about walking into a political ambush.
Mr. Mitchell, for example, said today that ''a great many Democrats'' believed that President Bush, having realized that he must break his campaign pledge not to increase taxes, was now ''looking for political cover.''
Other Democrats, however, say the deficit problem is so severe that party leaders must put politics aside and join with the President to find a solution.
Most of the Democratic negotiators have said they will sit tight on the issue of raising taxes unless President Bush puts the matter on the table first. And if the issue does come up, there are differences of opinion among the Democrats on what taxes to raise.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, for instance, has proposed an elaborate plan that involves higher taxes. He would increase the Federal tax on gasoline by 15 cents a gallon. But Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, chairman of the Finance Committee, has said he is unalterably opposed to a higher gasoline tax.
The Republican Congressional team also divides into at least two camps. Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the party's leading Congressional spokesman on budget issues, conceded again today that additional taxes would probably be required to make this ''the last budget summit of the century.''
But another pivotal Republican in the talks, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, rejected all forms of higher taxes.
 
President Will Avoid Specifics
Mr. Bush will preside over the first negotiating session Tuesday afternoon in the Cabinet Room at the White House. His press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said today that the President would open the meeting by expressing ''general goals about getting the deficit down'' but would not offer any specific proposals.
That in itself concerns the Democrats, who believe Mr. Bush should speak publicly, perhaps on television, about why he believes the budget situation is so much more serious now than it was in January, the last time he addressed the nation on the subject.
In those comments, in his State of the Union Message, he painted a rosy picture of the economy, citing progress in cutting the deficit and asserting that his budget for the next fiscal year would meet the $64 billion deficit target of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law without painful spending cuts or higher taxes.
Now, Mr. Darman is saying that even if the Bush budget were passed intact, a political impossibility, the deficit could be $50 billion higher than was anticipated in January.
The economy has not performed as well as the Administration had hoped, Mr. Darman says. Tax receipts are thus lower, and higher interest rates on Government bonds make payments on the national debt more costly. Moreover, the budget director says, the annual cost of liquidating failed savings and loan associations could be much higher than expected in the next fiscal year, although some of this money should be recovered in the following years.
 
Democrats Scoff at Analysis
Democrats accept the Darman assessment of the severity of the problem but scoff at his analysis of what went wrong. They observe that the country's economic performance since January has been about what most private economists and those on Congressional staffs predicted.
They liken the Administration's optimistic economic projections in January to a basketball player in a tie game who heaves a shot from half court just before the final buzzer. If the shot miraculously goes in, his team wins the game. If it misses, he is none the worse for trying.
The Bush budget, they say, was no more than a political shot from midcourt that was almost certain to miss.
After Tuesday's session, the negotiations are expected to move to Capitol Hill. Most of the participants on both sides agree that the substantive issues of spending and taxes cannot be addressed until such procedural matters are settled as how to account for the savings and loan bailout and how to handle Social Security calculations in the budget.
The two sides also agree that the negotiations will last a long time.
''It will go on probably weeks, if not months,'' Mr. Fitzwater said today. ''It is not the kind of thing where anybody expects to run in and throw a proposal on the table and vote on it. It's going to be painstakingly worked out sentence by sentence and debate by debate over a longer period of time.''
Although some last-minute changes are possible, these are the likely participants in the budget negotiations:

HEADLINE: Of German Pride and German Conscience

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Like A. M. Rosenthal (column, May 3), I visited Auschwitz (and Birkenau) last month and have also been back to Germany, where I was born, the child of Holocaust survivors. My parents were born in Poland and lost, as did almost all Polish Jews, most of their families.
Growing up in West Germany, I lived well, went to school and university without experiencing anti-Semitism (except for an occasional stupid remark, which did not antagonize me). In the beginning 1980's, however, as I turned 30, I felt a change. 
More and more often I encountered among average Germans indifference and a lack of sensitivity concerning the Hitler regime and the Holocaust, and I decided to come to the United States. It was not anti-Semitism or denial of facts about the Holocaust but a dilution and diminution of its importance which I noticed and found unacceptable.
Certainly, my own sensitivity had increased, but there was also a palpable change of atmosphere, which somewhat coincided with West Germany's development into an economic superpower and with Helmut Kohl's becoming Chancellor. Obviously, there was desire and there was room for national pride, and statements by Mr. Kohl and others pointed to their determination not to allow the national heritage of the Holocaust to overshadow their wishes to feel proud as Germans again, wishes that they shared with many of their countrymen. I believe that this was palpable several years before Bitburg (1985) and the demonstrative inclusion of members of Waffen-SS into the honorable part of the German national heritage, unfortunately with the support of Ronald Reagan (whose talent not to remember was already remarkable at that time).
I understood then that time must go on and that there is real dilemma. West Germany has since 1948 (with few exceptions) been a liberal democracy and contributed much to the unification of Western Europe. Most Germans alive today have no reason to feel guilty for the crimes committed by those Germans who supported or followed or allowed themselves to be used by the Nazis, and most Germans understandably do not want to be burdened with the heritage of the Holocaust.
When I visited Germany recently, however, I did get the impression that a new conscience and interest in and finally an acceptance of the Holocaust is emerging. This development has been credited to the philosophical influence of West German President Richard von Weizsaecker.
However, after a visit to Auschwitz or whenever one just begins to think of the cruelty of the Nazi ideas and of the cruelty of the executioners of those ideas, one feels the urge to speak up for the many whose voices are gone forever: Do not allow what happened to us to be forgotten. Do not let it happen again to whomever, whenever, wherever! With due respect to Mr. Rosenthal's opinion, I do not think that choosing Auschwitz as the place where ''documented German unification and reconciliation with the world should be signed'' would help this purpose. In my belief Auschwitz belongs only to the dead and to their memory. One should walk humbly there and not make much noise. The symbolism of staging the act of reunification of Germany there is understandable, but it is too bizarre.
I am sure that there are better ways to assure that the end of the German separation will not efface the history of the Second World War and the Holocaust, which led to this separation. My suggestion is to retain a part of the Berlin Wall, namely where it cuts to the center of Berlin around the Brandenburg Gate, and to use this area - as it is or with monuments -as a memorial to the victims of Nazi Germany. The center of Berlin, which in the future may well become the center of a unified Europe, would remind and warn generations of the cruelty of which man was and is capable.

HEADLINE: Let Private Lawyers Prosecute S & L Fraud

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh says the Government is unlikely to prosecute all the more than 1,300 major savings-and-loan fraud cases for lack of staff (news story, April 27). I suggest that private lawyers bid to handle these cases for a percentage of the recovery. The higher they estimate the chance of winning a case or the size of the judgment, the more they will want that case and the lower will be the percentage they will bid as their contingency fee.
The taxpayer's burden will be eased a bit and the typical citizen's confidence in the legal system will be increased by seeing that justice was served upon the perpetrators of the biggest white-collar crime wave in the history of the United States.

HEADLINE: Subsidized Housing Hurt in Ailing Market

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
As real-estate prices continue to decline throughout the Northeast, one casualty of the falling market is some of the cheapest housing of all, subsidized housing.
After Federal construction subsidies were largely ended in the early 1980's, many housing programs began offering builders incentives to include lower-priced homes in their developments. In many cases, a builder would be allowed to put up additional residences in return for offering some at reduced prices.
For local governments, these subsidies were a relatively painless way to build affordable housing without tax money.
But those incentives worked only when large numbers of houses and apartments were selling in a lively real-estate market. As the market sags and auctions and distress sales must be used to sell what is already on hand, developers are reluctant to enter into projects that rely on these types of subsidies because they depend on building even more units. 
''I don't know of anyone trying to move a new Mount Laurel project,'' said Patrick J. O'Keefe, executive vice president of the New Jersey Builders' Association, referring to subsidized housing undertaken as a result of the state's Mount Laurel court decisions, which require all communities to provide some affordable housing. The loss of this kind of subsidized housing will generally hurt working families with incomes under $35,000 a year, the same families that even with the drop in house prices are shut out of the Northeast's housing market.
Communities across the nation have tried these subsidies, but they have been most heavily used in the Northeast, where the demand for housing had been so great that until recently almost anything built could be sold.
About 50 communities in California, including San Francisco, use the subsidies, but the real-estate market there has held up better than in the Northeast and officials say most of their programs are unaffected.
Affordable housing programs in New York City and its suburbs have been weakened, as have similar efforts in Massachusetts and Connecticut. But the greatest effect is being felt in New Jersey, where market-driven subsidies are at the heart of its court-ordered Mount Laurel housing plan.
''As market rate units are slowing, the delivery of Mount Laurel housing will be slowing,'' said Ara K. Hovnanian, a member of the State Council on Affordable Housing, and president of K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, N.J., the state's largest builder of Mount Laurel housing.
''For the first two months of the year, building permits were off 30 percent,'' he said. ''I'd expect Mount Laurel deliveries to be off 30 percent.''
New Jersey does not keep such figures, but interviews with developers and local government leaders indicate that affordable housing production is slowing.
 
Bankrupt With Houses Unfinished
Hovnanian, for example, is completing 225 subsidized town houses in three suburban projects that were started years ago, but besides one other project in Newark, it has no others using internal subsidies. Before the most recent projects, it had built 1,612 subsidized houses, most of them after 1983.
Smaller companies have been hurt so badly that they have stopped building in midstream. In Old Tappan in Bergen County, the developers of Knickerbocker Village declared bankruptcy before any of the 57 houses were finished. The 12 that were supposed to be subsidized were never built.
Others developers are simply waiting until market conditions change, though they can be reluctant to admit it.
In Princeton, 60 of the 300 homes at Calton Homes' White Farm development are to be set aside for low- and moderate-income families. The project has been given preliminary approval, but Anita Robinson, administrative secretary of the Regional Planning Board of Princeton, said the market has held back the developer. ''We haven't heard a word from them,'' she said. #145,000 Affordable Houses Needed A vice president of Calton, Richard M. Griffith, said the company is obliged to meet all of its Mount Laurel obligations and that ''current market conditions have not affected our willingness to proceed.''
The subsidy programs vary. Some let developers build more houses than zoning allows if they set aside 20 percent for the poor; others use profits to write down costs on a few units in the same project or another across town. But all the programs depend on a market that could absorb large numbers of houses or apartments, some at very high prices.
Those market conditions describe New Jersey in the years following the State Supreme Court's Mount Laurel ruling in 1983.
Internal subsidies have been used to help construct 75 percent of the 8,000 Mount Laurel housing units that have been built, according to the Alliance for Affordable Housing, a nonprofit group. The state Council on Affordable Housing has estimated that New Jersey needs more than 145,000 affordable houses.
 
Gone Too Far to Stop
The current slowdown began just as it appeared that many suburban communities had finally decided to end their long opposition to the Mount Laurel dictates and were including subsidized housing projects in their plans. Affordable housing production was just starting to pick up steam when the market stumbled.
Many projects begun before 1988 have gone too far to stop, regardless of current conditions. Morris Township, Lawrence Township and Bridgewater in New Jersey all have current projects with Mount Laurel components. The Hills, in Somerset County, the largest residential development in the state, also continues to build, and has about 50 Mount Laurel homes under way.
Experts say the full impact will be felt in a few years. Joseph J. Seneca, a professor of economics at Rutgers University, said that building permits are running at less than 30,000 a year, compared with more than 60,000 in the peak building years of the 1980s.
''Why build four houses when you can't sell one?'' Mr. Seneca asked.
 
'Just When We Need It Most'
Several housing production programs in New York City also depend on the subsidies, and experts say they are all in trouble. That is especially worrisome because city and state budget problems are likely to result in diminished housing subsidies.
''Just when we need it most we're wiped out,'' said Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Housing Partnership, a nonprofit group that helps build affordable houses.
Ms. Wylde said her organization has decided to delay three mid-rise buildings in Harlem that would contain 800 apartments. She said that in the current market there is no way to sell 80 unsubsidized units at $200 a square foot to provide subsidies that, combined with city money, would reduce prices on 160 others to $75 a square foot. The remaining 560 apartments would be sold at cost.
Ms. Wylde said the subsidies have become ''tools we can no longer use anywhere in the city.'' Projects proposed for Clinton, Roosevelt Island and the Seward Park urban renewal area of the Lower East Side have been stalled.
 
Mixed Impact in Connecticut
Massachusetts has an array of these programs, and many of them are strained by an overbuilt and declining market. ''We've had some projects scuttled, some that are on hold,'' said Amy S. Anthony, secretary of the state's Executive Office of Communities and Development. ''Our solicitation of new projects has slowed.''
In Connecticut the impact is mixed. The state plans to buy unsold condominiums and use them for public housing. But a new law that establishes a special panel of judges to hear cases in which towns have rejected affordable-housing projects using subsidies and other assistance may be rendered temporarily useless because of the market slowdown.
The director of policy and planning for Connecticut's Department of Housing, Patricia Downs, said she knew of no developer or nonprofit group waiting to file under the new law when it takes effect July 1.
In Yonkers, officials say the city has been forced to amend its long-range plan to meet a housing desegregation order. The plan called for 4,000 new houses to be built, 3,200 at market rates and 800 to be subsidized with assistance from the full-priced houses.
Nothing has been built, and Karen V. Hill, executive director of the city's Fair Housing Implementation Office, said the city will now rely on tax abatements, zoning variances and state housing assistance.

HEADLINE: Cheating on Sleep: Modern Life Turns America Into the Land of the Drowsy

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER

 BODY:
IF it is sleep that knits up the raveled sleeve of care, then an overwhelming number of Americans are walking around with distinctly tatty shirtcuffs.
Experts in sleep behavior and sleep disorders have found that a majority of people are sleeping at least an hour to 90 minutes less each night than they should. That discovery may not surprise hard-driving workers who scorn the call to relax, but sleep researchers say that even those level-headed people who think they put in a reasonable stint in bed each night probably suffer from some degree of sleep deprivation.
''People cheat on their sleep, and they don't even realize they're doing it,'' said Dr. Howard P. Roffwarg, director of the Sleep Study Unit at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas. ''They think they're O.K. because they can get by on six and a half hours, when they really need seven and a half, eight or even more to feel ideally vigorous.'' 
Basing their conclusions on recent surveys, experiments at sleep disorder clinics, trends in the labor force toward shift work and night work, and the swelling number of Americans who suffer from sleep pathologies and chronic fatigue, sleep scientists insist that there is virtually an epidemic of sleepiness in the nation.
''I can't think of a single study that hasn't found people getting less sleep than they ought to,'' said Dr. David F. Dinges, a biological psychologist at the Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia.
Sleep experts compare sleep deprivation with another common problem, that of excess weight. ''Some people are a couple of pounds overweight, and it's no big deal,'' said Dr. Thomas Roth, director of the Sleep Disorders Center at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. ''Others are obese, and that can be life-threatening.''
Likewise, experts say that mild sleep deprivation is not terribly worrisome, although they believe that people would be more productive, good-humored and satisfied with life if they were able to get a full complement of sleep each night. But when sleep deprivation becomes chronic and extensive, they say, it can have serious consequences, leading to gravely impaired judgment and an increase in automobile and industrial accidents.
So apparent are the potential hazards of chronic sleep deprivation that Congress, as part of an omnibus health bill passed in 1988, has asked a panel of a dozen sleep scientists to conduct a comprehensive study of the subject, to be completed by mid-1991. The commission will attempt to gauge the economic and medical impact of sleep disorders and sleep deprivation and suggest ways that the Government might help ease worker fatigue.
''The Government is finally waking up to the problem of sleep deprivation,'' said Dr. Mary Carskadon, a sleep researcher at Brown University and a member of the commission.
There has yet to be a large-scale epidemiological study of the nation's sleep habits, but sleep researchers have gathered insights about sleep deprivation by studying defined groups, particularly young adults and the elderly, and then estimating from those findings how many people over all are getting less than an ideal amount of sleep.
In a new analysis of several health surveys of 21,000 people 65 years and older, the National Institute on Aging found that more than 50 percent reported sleeping badly and feeling poorly rested upon waking. If applied to the older population as a whole, said Dr. Andrew Monjan, a sleep researcher at the institute, at least 13 million Americans are aware enough of their chronic sleep deficiency to cite it as a source of misery.
More revealing of the problem of hidden sleep deprivation is a series of studies of several hundred college and graduate students between the ages of 18 and 30, conducted over the past several years at Stanford University, Brown University and the Henry Ford Hospital.
In one representative experiment with the young adults, who were generally healthy and got an average of seven to eight hours sleep a night, sleep researchers discovered that 20 percent of these apparently normal students could fall asleep almost instantaneously throughout the day if allowed to lie down in a darkened room. That sleep pattern matched ones exhibited by narcoleptics and others suffering from clinical sleep pathologies - evidence, the researchers said, that the students, despite having had what most would consider a perfectly reasonable amount of sleep, were nevertheless sleep-deprived.
The sleep researchers further discovered that even the students who seemed alert and did not quickly fall asleep under test conditions could benefit from more sleep. If they spent one week getting to bed an hour to 90 minutes earlier than usual, the students improved their performance markedly on psychological and cognitive tests.
To sleep researchers, such results strongly suggest that most, if not all, people who think they are sleeping enough would be better off with an extra portion of rest.
As added evidence that people do not sleep enough, Dr. Wilse Webb, a psychologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville and a sleep research pioneer, cites the most pedestrian of bedside staples, the alarm clock. ''Whenever I ask an audience, how many people woke up by an alarm clock that morning, about two-thirds raise their hand,'' he said. ''If that's how you wake up every day, you're shortening your natural sleep pattern.''
Researchers also point out that ever more people are consulting sleep experts and sleep disorder clinics complaining of constant fatigue. Today there are more than 140 accredited sleep disorder centers in the United States, compared with 25 in 1980. About 1,200 clinicians are members of the American Sleep Disorders Association, a professional organization, up from 710 in 1985.
''Every year over the past decade there's been an enormous increase in our number of patients, sometimes as much as 50 percent a year,'' said Dr. Neil B. Cavey, director of the Sleep Disorders Center at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. ''And at least 40 percent of those people are suffering from some sort of extreme sleep deprivation.''
 
The Causes
After Light Bulbs Came Talk Shows Researchers trace the beginning of the sleep-deficit crisis to the invention of the light bulb a century ago. From diary entries and other personal accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries, sleep scientists have determined that the average person used to sleep about nine and a half hours a night. ''The best sleep habits once were forced on us, when we had nothing to do in the evening down on the farm, and it was dark,'' said Dr. Roffwarg.
According to surveys of school children in California and popular accounts in magazines, say researchers, that sleep schedule had been whittled dramatically, to between seven and a half and eight hours by the 1950's and 1960's. Now social and economic trends are slicing ever deeper into slumber.
Perhaps the most relentless robber of sleep, researchers say, is the complexity of the day. Whenever pressures from work, family, friends, the community and the health club mount, many people consider sleep to be the most expendable item on the agenda.
''In our society, it's considered dynamic, a feather in one's cap, to say you only need five and a half hours sleep,'' said Dr. Cavey. ''If you say you've got to get eight and a -half hours, people look at you askance, as though you lack drive and ambition.''
Also to blame is the increased prevalence of shift work, in which people either toil at night, or alternate between a day and night schedule. Researchers say that the brain has difficulty adjusting to daytime sleep or varying sleep times, which means that shift workers usually suffer a net loss of sleep. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 22 percent of all employees are shift workers.
The number of workers keyed into some aspect of the international economy likewise is soaring. Last year about 330,000 commercial planes operated by domestic carriers and tens of thousands of foreign-owned carriers took off for international destinations, carrying with them passengers destined for jet lag. Even if they are not traveling, few people in business can afford to ignore markets abroad.
''If you're in finance, the New York Stock Exchange may be closed at night, but if you don't watch Tokyo and London, you're vulnerable in the morning,'' said Dr. Dinges.
Many sleep researchers indict the availability of round-the-clock entertainment, especially the advent of all-night television. They point out that it was not so long ago that television stations signed off at midnight or 1 A.M. with ''The Star-Spangled Banner,'' a prod to many viewers to retire.
Yet another reason for the sleepiness trend is the prevalence of sleep disorders. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute estimates that 4 percent of all people suffer from sleep apnea, in which breathing stops repeatedly during the night, waking a person for a few seconds each time and ruining the restfulness of sleep. Researchers say that an unknown but possibly far greater number of people are chronic insomniacs, who spend their nights tossing fitfully and their days in tired misery.
''You can see how all the causes of sleep deprivation really mount up,'' said Dr. Monjan.
 
The Effects
On the Night Shift At Chernobyl Whatever the root of a person's sleep deficit, sleep scientists have devised tests to assess its extent and consequences. Researchers agree that the most accurate measurement of relative sleep deprivation is the Multiple Sleep Latency Test, devised by Dr. William Dement, director of the Stanford Sleep Disorders Center in California, along with Dr. Carskadon of Brown. Subjects are hooked up to electroencephalograms, which measure brain wave patterns, to track the precise second at which they fall asleep; they are allowed to lie down for 20 minutes in a dark room every two hours.
Those who fall asleep in under five minutes each time are considered pathologically sleep-deprived, because their sleep pattern matches that of somebody with a known sleep disease, such as apnea. An average score of between 5 and 10 minutes is borderline pathological, that between 10 to 15 is fine but not optimum and those who stay awake 15 minutes or longer are considered at their peak of restedness.
Researchers have also put subjects at sleep disorder centers through a battery of psychological and performance tests, like asking them to add up columns of numbers or to recall a passage that was read to them only minutes earlier. ''We've found that if you're sleep-deprived, performance suffers in many areas,'' said Dr. Charles Czeisler, director of Circadian and Sleep Disorders Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. ''Short-term memory is impaired, the ability to make decisions is impaired, the ability to concentrate is impaired.''
Sleepy subjects have difficulty discriminating between loud and soft tones, or seeing flashes of light on a board. Because their reaction time is affected, sleep researchers say, sleep-deprived people may be more prone to making mistakes on the job. Experts note that many major industrial accidents, including the ones at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, occurred at night, when workers who monitor equipment were probably not optimally alert.
Sleep researchers say that sleepiness is second only to drunkenness as a cause of automobile accidents. Reporting to Congress last year, the Department of Transportation said that at least 40,000 traffic accidents a year may be sleep-related, and that more than 20 percent of all drivers have fallen asleep at the wheel at least once. And in new studies, Dr. Roth has found that sleep-deprived people are impaired by smaller quantities of alcohol than are rested people, a factor that could further contribute to automobile accidents.
Dr. Dement of Stanford said he was shocked recently when he met a 30-year-old limousine driver who said he worked from 5 A.M. to midnight seven days a week. ''That man is losing up to three hours of sleep a night, and he knows he's headed for trouble,'' said Dr. Dement. ''He told me, 'I'm so sleepy it's scary.' ''
Sleep scientists have found that one bad night's sleep can make a person less efficient on mental tasks. Worse still, they say, the effects of sleep loss are cumulative. A person who chronically sleeps 90 minutes less per night during the workweek than is necessary will feel far worse on Friday than on Tuesday.
''By the fifth night, you've lost seven and a half hours, or virtually a whole night's sleep,'' said Dr. Dinges. ''That's the day when you're just praying to get through it.''
Sleep deprivation also destroys a person's capacity to feel pleasure or to laugh at a joke, which may be equally critical for getting through the workweek.
Trying To Cope More Caffeine Is Not the Answer Sleep scientists say that most people attempt to make up for the sleep deficits of the week by sleeping in on weekends, and that the tactic does help the body recoup vital sleep time. But they warn that in cases of chronic sleep deprivation, a weekend of 10-hour nights is not sufficient.
''I've had businessmen come in who are chronically sleep-deprived complaining of sleepiness they can't understand,'' said Dr. Charles P. Pollak, head of the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at New York Hospital-Cornell University. ''They say they try sleeping longer on a weekend, but that it doesn't help. Of course a night or two doesn't help. In extreme cases, you may need six weeks of adequate sleep to reverse the effects of sleep loss.''
Scientists say that many people skate through their days on too little sleep by seeking outside stimulation, including banter with colleagues, exercise or the old standard, caffeine. But the stimulation does not solve the sleepiness; it merely masks it temporarily. ''If I start slapping you around, you'll be awake for a little while, but that stimulation is a crutch,'' said Dr. Dement. ''Withdraw it and you're back to where you started.''
Sometimes a severely sleep-deprived brain will try to snatch a break by falling into so-called microsleeps, which last for a few seconds and which may occur without a person's quite noticing it. In Mediterranean and other warm-weather countries, people often take siestas between 1 and 3 in the afternoon, to make up for their traditional late nights. Researchers say that the brain does fall into a lull in the afternoon, indicating an evolutionary predisposition toward napping, but they add that a person who has had a truly full night's sleep will not need a nap.
Sleep experts insist that the effort to squeeze ever more tasks into one's days and nights ultimately backfires. The person who invests in a full night's sleep, they say, will be more than recompensed in heightened productivity, creativity and focus.
But even sleep specialists have trouble taking their own advice. Although Dr. Dement says he is adamant about getting eight hours a night, others, in their zeal to promote the benefits of sleeping, admit that they often work themselves to exhaustion. ''I get by on maybe six, six and a half hours,'' said Dr. Cavey. ''I'm just too busy to get a good night's sleep.''

HEADLINE: Experimental Propulsion System Has No Moving Parts

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
JAPAN, the United States, and perhaps the Soviet Union, are racing to perfect a revolutionary type of propulsion for ships and submarines. It has no moving parts, is virtually silent and promises great reliability at relatively low cost.
The basis for the advance is a tongue-twisting phenomenon known as magnetohydrodynamics, or MHD, in which magnetic fields are used to move water. There are no moving parts - no motors, no propellers, no gears and no drive shaft. Instead, a superconducting magnet, more efficient and powerful than conventional magnets, exerts a magnetic force on sea water passing through its core, driving water out the back and creating forward motion.
The technology is featured in the movie ''The Hunt for Red October,'' based on the book by Tom Clancy in which an advanced Soviet submarine powered by the process is hunted by the American and Soviet navies. 
In real life, scientists say MHD propulsion might find both military and civilian uses. It might economically power commercial ships and cargo submarines. And it might pave the way for a new generation of military submarines that are quieter than ever, helping them elude foes.
''It's provocative in its simplicity,'' said Dr. Michael Petrick, a scientist who directs research on the idea at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. ''But there's lots of work that needs to be done to make it viable.''
Questions to be answered include both its technical feasibility and utility. So far, the idea has undergone no known large-scale trial, although that is about to change.
Early next year, the Japan Foundation for Shipbuilding Advancement plans to launch a 100-foot-long, prototype MHD-powered ship that will carry up to 10 people. The test is a sea trial for commercial operations.
And the Argonne lab is spearheading a military-sponsored program that centers on a 21-foot-long, 180-ton monster superconducting magnet. Its trials, confined to the laboratory, are to begin early next year. In a different project, the Navy is considering sea trials for MHD propulsion.
''The marriage of an MHD propulsion system to underwater vehicles is a natural,'' said Dr. Daniel W. Swallom, who manages the Navy-financed program on the propulsion system at the Avco Research Laboratory in Everett, Mass. His program's goal is an open-ocean test with a remotely piloted vehicle.
The Soviet Union has carried out much basic research on this form of propulsion, but intelligence experts are at odds on whether the Russians are applying the idea to their submarines.
Magnetohydrodynamics involves magnetic fields (magneto) and fluids (hydro) that conduct electricity and interact (dynamics). The phenomenon occurs naturally in the Earth's core, giving rise to the planet's magnetic field.
In MHD propulsion, a pair of electrodes on either side of the thruster pass an electric current through sea water. The process does not work effectively with fresh water because it can carry little current. At a right angle to the current is the magnetic field generated by the superconducting magnet. The interaction of the magnetic field and the current produces a strong force on the water, moving it through the duct in the center of the magnet. If the polarity of the current is reversed, so is the direction of thrust.
The action is identical to what happens with an electric motor when its magnetic field crosses a bundle of copper wires carrying an electric current, causing it to move and the central shaft of the motor to rotate.
The activity in each case revolves around charged particles. In the motor, the current-filled wires are filled with moving electrons, which carry a negative charge, and are strongly acted upon by the magnetic field. In MHD propulsion, the electric current flowing through the seawater causes the formation of charged particles, or ions, which in a similar manner are acted upon by the powerful field of the superconducting magnet. It propels both the ions and the seawater.
The direction of the force is at right angles to the matrix formed by the current and magnetic field. This effect, known as the Lorentz force, was first quantified by the Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz in the late 19th century.
 
'The Same Old Story'
This form of propulsion was conceived and tested in the United States more than two decades ago but languished until the advent of superconducting magnets. These can be made very powerful and very efficient because, when their coils are cooled almost to absolute zero, they lose no electricity to resistance.
In the late 1980's, Japan became the first nation to publicly embark on a sizable program meant to achieve MHD propulsion. ''It's the same old story,'' said Dr. Petrick at Argonne. ''The idea evolves in this country but someone else picks it up and runs with it.''
Leading the Japanese work is the Foundation for Shipbuilding Advancement, a private concern working with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Hitachi Zosen and Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding. The foundation is believed to have spent about $31 million on the research since 1987.
''They've gotten the best people from industry, government and the universities to work on this thing,'' said William J. Andahazy, a staffer on the House Armed Services Committee who was once associated with the American MHD effort.
The Japanese work focuses on the 100-foot ship, whose top speed is to be eight knots. It has two MHD thrusters on two huge fins protruding from the craft's hull, according to a paper by the foundation. A thruster is made up of six magnetic modules, each fitted with a sea-water duct some 10 inches in diameter. One thruster assembly is being built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and the other, with a slightly different configuration, by the Toshiba Corporation.
 
A $12 Million Magnet
The Japanese ship is simply a technology test, its small thrusters being relatively inefficient. If the technique is to work commercially, magnets must become lighter, larger and more powerful.
The Japanese work has helped increase American interest in MHD propulsion, although the Defense Department had been studying it for many years. At Argonne, a $4 million program seeking potential Navy applications is under way sponsored by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
The centerpiece of the lab's work is a huge $12 million superconducting magnet originally built for research on super-efficient generation of electricity from coal. The program's funds were cut, so the giant magnet was never used. Argonne is adapting the behemoth to search for subtle troubles that might complicate the MHD process for large volumes of water.
The big magnet's water channel, 20 inches in diameter, will speed 25,000 gallons of water per minute through a 75-foot closed loop, giving researchers their first clues about the feasibility of full-scale MHD propulsion. If no show-stoppers crop up, the next challenge will be engineering, mainly making heavy superconducting magnets much lighter and more powerful.
''Because the conductivity of sea water is so low, you have to go to very large sizes on the thruster, with big superconducting magnets,'' said Argonne's Dr. Petrick. ''They have to be lightweight. All that's going to require almost a breakthrough.'' The problem is that superconducting magnets are so strong they literally try to tear themselves apart. Intense magnetic fields cause tiny movements of internal parts and coils, in turn generating heat that can trigger the violent loss of superconductivity. To solve the problem, magnet designers use heavy metal fixtures to inhibit movement.
For ships and submarines, said Dr. Petrick, the new generation of super-strong, super-light composite materials would have to be applied to the making of superconducting magnets. ''Theoretically, you can exceed the efficiencies of propellers,'' he said.
 
An 'Acoustic Signature'
Even at low efficiencies, MHD propulsion may be attractive to the military because of its relative silence. Much tracking of enemy submarines centers on listening for the sounds generated by complex power trains and propellers.
MHD propulsion, notes a recent statement from the Navy's David Taylor Research Center in Annapolis, Md., ''offers the potential for an extremely quiet system for propelling underwater vehicles.''
Potential problems from the Navy's point of view include hydrogen bubbles given off at the system's electrode from the electrolysis, or breaking into component parts, of sea water. The bubbles, according to the Taylor statement, ''have an acoustic signature and may produce a visible wake.'' Potential solutions, it said, include gasless electrodes and bubble capture.
Another potential hurdle is a magnetic ''signature,'' or detectable signal. This might be reduced by special magnet designs or shielding.
Hopeful of solutions, the Navy is now building a $1.2 million facility in Newport, R.I., to study the use of superconducting magnets in undersea propulsion. MHD, said the Taylor statement, ''could provide a revolutionary new propulsion system for underwater vehicles in the next century.''
Intelligence experts are divided on where the Soviets stand in the propulsion field. The Russians have published many scientific papers on the topic and have pioneered all kinds of MHD technology.
Some experts say the Soviets have even been trying it at sea, noting the long pods atop the vertical rudder of all first-rank Soviets nuclear attack submarines. However, other experts disparage such analysis, saying the pods are probably for stowing sensors that can be towed behind the submarines. Soviet MHD propulsion, they say, can only be found in fictional exploits such as ''The Hunt for Red October.''

GRAPHIC: photo: The Race For 'Red October': The mysterious propulsion system powering the submarine Sean Connery commands in the movie ''Hunt for Red October'' is actually under development in several labs. The system, magnetohydrodynamics, involves running an electric current through water in a powerful magnetic field. The interaction of the current and the magnetic field produces a strong force on the water, moving it out through the back of the thruster. If the direction of the current is reversed, so is the direction of thrust.; diagrams

HEADLINE: THE DOCTOR'S WORLD;
Despite Many Shifts, Oath as Old as Apollo Endures in Medicine

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.

 BODY:
AS America's newest physicians receive their degrees, many will swear to the Hippocratic oath, one of the most enduring documents in history.
The oath is attributed to Hippocrates, a Greek physician in the 5th century B.C., but no one is certain about its origins and use over the last 25 centuries. Even today not every medical graduate swears to Hippocrates's standards of professional behavior and the wording of the oath may change from year to year, even in the same medical school.
Doctors probably did not begin swearing to the Hippocratic oath until about 1100. But ''it is as hard to find a carefully researched history of the oath as it is to find out its current use,'' said Dr. Albert R. Jonsen, who heads the department of medical history and ethics at the University of Washington in Seattle. ''There is a lot of mythology about the oath,'' he said. 
Contrary to widespread impression, doctors are not required to take any oath. Another surprise is that the Hippocratic oath is seldom studied in medical school, even at a time of heightened interest in medical ethics. For many doctors, the graduation ceremony is the first and only encounter with the Hippocratic oath.
This single encounter leaves little lasting impression about its content among many physicians, according to a small survey reported in a recent issue of Academic Medicine, published by the Association of American Medical Colleges.
The indifference reflects a feeling among many medical leaders that the oath is inadequate for the enormous scientific, economic, political and social changes that medicine has undergone since ancient Greeks swore to pagan gods and goddesses and relied on garlic poultices and other treatments long discarded. Because ancient physicians could do so little for patients, they did not share the modern physician's problem of differentiating between what can be done and what ought to be done.
Yet many others yearn for traditional values and say that the Hippocratic oath and other ancient codes deserve greater emphasis in medical education. Times may have changed but general principles should not, they say in pointing out that medical leaders are now criticizing their own colleagues for greed, fraud, cheating and even stealing the books for their courses on medical ethics. The oath covers obligations to professional colleagues and patients. Much of it seems sensible, like proscribing sex with patients and breaches of confidentiality. But a literal interpretation would also eliminate tuitions for students that now can reach $24,300 a year.
Many of the oath's principles or moral rules, like prohibiting abortions, have been modified by laws, judicial decisions, professional customs and medical advances.
Physicians now are supposed to report cases of certain communicable diseases to health departments and, in some areas, must inform sexual partners that a patient is infected with the AIDS virus. Confidentiality is further eroded by demands from the Government and private health insurance carriers for access to the contents of medical records.
The original version would leave surgery to a once separate guild; now surgeons are an integral part of the medical profession. And the oath forbids euthanasia, something some physicians practice openly and many more practice in secret. Other points in the oath conflict with trends that have developed over recent years.
Paternalism, for example, is central to the oath; doctors who swear to it promise healing according to their judgment and skills, but the oath ignores the wishes of the patient. The oath also fosters professional secrecy. Today, a prevailing belief is that medical knowledge belongs to the community.
Scholars are skeptical that universal adherence to the oath ever existed. That doctors performed abortions and had sexual relations with patients in ancient Greece is obvious from the proscriptions in the oath. Recent surveys have found that about 5 percent of physicians have admitted to sexual intercourse with their patients.
The humanizing theme of the oath is reiterated in a long list of oaths and codes from Judaism, Christianity, Moslem, Hindu, Chinese and many other religions and cultures.
Many graduating classes write their own oaths. Others use an oath written in 1964 by Dr. Louis Lasagna, now a dean at Tufts University Medical School in Boston. His oath included such vows as emphasizing prevention over cure.
Which oaths are used at which schools is not known. Spokesmen for the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Association said neither organization had conducted a survey of the oaths given in medical school because the issue was a low priority.
The latest published survey was conducted in 1977 among 112 medical schools in the United States and 16 in Canada by Walter J. Friedlander of the University of Nebraska College of Medicine. An oath was administered in 94 percent of the United States medical schools and 63 percent of the Canadian institutions.
In this country, 6 percent of the schools offered the classic Hippocratic oath and 42 percent a modified version. The Declaration of Geneva, a modernized version of the oath that was written by the World Medical Association in 1948, was administered in 28 percent of medical schools. Ten percent offered the Prayer of Maimonides, an ethical guide to medicine attributed to the 12th century rabbi, physician and philosopher.
The basic axiom of medical ethics, ''above all, do no harm,'' is often attributed to the oath. But the axiom comes from another Hippocratic work, ''Epidemics.''
If the oath is a rock and fortress of medicine, as many contend, it ought to be administered on entry to medical school, used as a takeoff point in classes for further study of the history and ethics of medicine, and repeated at graduation.
A major obstacle to wider study of the oath and other codes is a prevailing belief among medical educators that most students do not find them relevant. Dr. Jonsen says he includes the oath in his course in Seattle and asks students to recite it just before they begin caring for patients for the first time.
Despite a crowded curriculum, medical schools might find room for more discussion of the oath and medical history. As a continuing reminder of the noble tradition of medicine, doctors who take oaths should hang copies along with diplomas and professional honors in their offices as is seldom the practice now.
 
'I swear by Apollo . . .'
Classical Hippocratic Oath
Attributed to Hippocrates, fifth century B.C.
I swear by Apollo, the physician, . . . that according to my ability and judgment, I will keep this oath and stipulation: to reckon him who taught me this art equally dear to me as my parents, to share my substance with him and relieve his necessities if required; to regard his offspring as on the same footing with my own brothers, and to teach them this art if they should wish to learn it, without fee or stipulation and that by precept, lecture and every other mode of instruction. . . .
I will follow that method of treatment which, according to my ability and judgment, I consider for the benefit of my patients, and abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous. I will give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; furthermore, I will not give to a woman an instrument to produce an abortion.
With purity and holiness I will pass my life and practice my art. I will not cut a person who is suffering with a stone, but will leave this to be done by practitioners of this work. Into whatever houses I enter I will go unto them for the benefit of the sick and will abstain from every voluntary act of mischief and corruption; and further from the seduction of females or males, bond or free.
Whatever, in connection with my professional practice or not in connection with it, I may see or hear in the lives of men, which ought not be spoken abroad, I will not divulge . . .
 
Oath for New Doctors
Written by Dr. Louis Lasagna in 1964.
I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:
I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.
I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures which are required, avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism.
I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or the chemist's drug.
I will not be ashamed to say ''I know not,'' nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient's recovery.
I will respect the privacy of my patients, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God.
I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, or a cancerous growth, but a sick humanbeing, whose illness may affect his family and his economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.
I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.
I will remember that I remain a member of society, with social obligations to all my fellow men, those sound of mind and body, as well as the infirm. . . .

HEADLINE: Singapore Aim: High-Tech Future

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SINGAPORE

 BODY:
For most of the 25 years since it became an independent state, Singapore has found industrial fortune by luring many of the world's best manufacturers, first American, then Japanese. It offered a haven of inexpensive but highly skilled labor and Government-supported factories that could be up and running in weeks.
Today, though, companies looking for low-cost labor are politely directed to neighboring countries like Malaysia or Thailand. Singapore is trying to become, in a modest way, the Japan of Southeast Asia: a nation that fosters and attracts research and development, automation and technologies that go far beyond its assemble-it-here image.
 
Risky Strategy
What the Government cannot attract, it has begun to buy. For the first time, in another move reminiscent of Japan, Singapore is actively scouting the United States and Europe for promising high-technology companies that it can snap up and use to hone its own industrial skills. 
This strategy is perhaps the last phase of economic development to be led by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who is scheduled to step down later this year. Brooking little dissent or second-guessing, Mr. Lee has dominated even the minutiae of planning since Singapore gained its independence from Malaysia in 1965.
But the strategy he has chosen now is risky, for it is unclear whether Singapore has the critical mass of population, universities and high-technology companies to support the ambitions of Mr. Lee's Government. So fearful is the Government that its 2.7 million people will not be enough that it is racing to build more support and incentives for research and is even encouraging young couples to have more children.
Officially, Singaporeans express few doubts that their future holds careers as researchers, software engineers and biotechnology specialists - not factory workers. The effort is starting in places like Singapore Technologies, a conglomerate of companies spun off from Singapore's Government-owned and well-financed concerns that make military goods, probably the strongest base of native technology.
Already, Singapore Technologies has bought a share in a promising Silicon Valley chip company, Sierra Semiconductors; made a faltering entry into the personal computer market, and dipped into joint ventures in everything from telephone switching software to jet engines.
''Our vision is to create a technology base for the nation, an engineering company that will be the first multinational based in Singapore,'' said Wong Kok Siew, the president of the new company, in his office in one of the city's many gleaming new towers. ''We plan to manufacture in any country in the world where there is an advantage - to make things in Thailand where the cost is low, in Germany because the market is big, to do R.& D. in Boston.''
 
Foreign Investment
Like almost every other economic strategy Singapore has adopted in the last two decades, this one depends on foreign participation. Eighty-nine percent of the $1 billion in direct investment here last year came from abroad. And with few native-developed technologies to offer, Singapore is depending on its arsenal of tax incentives and its strategic location in the heart of Asia's flourishing markets to persuade companies to make Singapore a center of design as well as manufacturing.
''Foreign investment has provided us over the years with jobs and markets,'' said How Peck-Huat, the director of the services promotion division of the country's powerful Economic Development Board. ''But now our plants are more automated and our skills much higher. What we need is production technology. We need to learn how to design integrated circuits; we need companies willing to do serious R.& D. that will train our people.''
As Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea have learned, it is exactly those skills that countries like Japan are loath to part with. The strategy of Japan, and to some extent of the United States, has been to keep the highest ''value added'' skills at home. Thus, while Japanese companies make computers all around Asia, they do most of their software research in Japan. While videocassette recorders are produced everywhere, most recording heads - the high-technology, expensive components -are rarely made outside Japan.
''If the critical components are made elsewhere, what does it help?'' said Mr. How. ''The value then goes elsewhere.''
 
Signs of Success
There are some early signs that Singapore's efforts are succeeding, if modestly. The Hewlett-Packard Company runs Singapore's largest research and development operation, designing many products for Asia here, and it is one of the few multinational companies that has put Singaporeans into the most senior management posts. The Japanese have not -just as they have not put Americans into the most senior posts of branch offices in the United States. Yet Matsushita, Japan's electronics giant, has, after years of resistance, set up a research and development divison in audio-visual equipment and information technology in Singapore, though it is still dwarfed by the company's manufacturing operations here.
''The only way to get Government incentives now,'' said Eugene Chan, director of domestic marketing at the company, ''is to bring in the very highest technology you can.''
In fact, if companies came first for low-cost labor, they are staying for other reasons: the huge availability of electronic components and other supplies here, the ease of communication and transportation, and the political stability of Mr. Lee's Government. Stability seems especially valuable at a time when Hong Kong and the Philippines seem vulnerable to political turmoil.
The quickness with which companies have adjusted is remarkable. At the sprawling Apple Computer Inc. plant, on a street that looks as though it could be in Silicon Valley in California, Apple II and Macintosh computers came down a production line that turns out a huge slice of Apple's yearly output even though the factory employs only 600 people.
''We could build a plant like this almost anywhere,'' said James L. Forquer, the managing director of Apple's Singapore manufacturing operations, as he walked past machines that were placing and soldering chips on circuit boards, one of the laborious tasks that companies used to come to Singapore to do by hand. But now the process goes on even as the few workers leave the floor for a coffee break. ''The difference here is the source of supply,'' he said. ''Just-in-time delivery is fabulous.'' Most big American chip manufacturers have plants within miles of Apple's factory, and more than half of the world's supply of disk drives for small computers are produced in Singapore.
But what the Government is most interested in at Apple's plant is a small room upstairs, overlooking the manufacturing operation. There Apple recently began development work on video screens for future models. ''It is an area where most of the current technology, particularly in manufacturing, is not in the U.S. anymore,'' Mr. Forquer said.
 
Obstacles Remain
Whether efforts like Apple's will flourish into full-scale research and development centers is questionable. Video screens are important, but are only a small part of the value of an Apple personal computer. While highly skilled labor here is still relatively inexpensive - a software engineer with seven years' experience earns about $1,700 a month - Singapore still lacks the nexus of universities, entrepreneurial companies and experienced engineers to attract the biggest value-added work.
One reason is the shortage of the most highly skilled labor. For years, the Government declined to disclose how many top professionals were leaving. Last year, Mr. Lee, in a speech, gave a figure of 4,700. But many local business people say anecdotal evidence suggests that is too low.
Many of those who leave are reacting to a combination of opportunities abroad and a Government that retains extraordinary control over its workers. Young people who were trained abroad invariably use words like sterile and stifling to describe the country.
Social control remains tight, with the Government seeking to assure that its three main population groups, the Malays, the Chinese and the Indians, remain contained, if not entirely harmonious. All three are mixed in the lookalike Government housing units, in precise ratios. While some people grumble, the country's atmosphere is wholly apolitical, at least publicly. ''When Tiananmen Square happened, Chinese in Hong Kong demonstrated in the streets,'' one senior American businessman here said. ''In Singapore, they just went back to their desks. Protests would have been bad for business.''
 
Opinion Polls
But in the last year or so, the Government has begun to seek public opinion on questions like housing and pensions.
The professional class says that the changes are not enough. ''There are a lot of places I can work, even in Asia, where the Government does not tell me where to work or who my neighbors will be, what newspaper I will read, or exactly how much my pay will go up,'' one Singaporean engineer complained.
How much that changes depends in large part on Mr. Lee's successors.

HEADLINE: High Court Backs Curb On Prices

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
Ruling in a closely watched antitrust case, the Supreme Court today gave new protection against antitrust liability to manufacturers that seek to improve their competitive position by imposing price ceilings on dealers.
The Court held that even if such an arrangement is an illegal conspiracy to fix prices at an artificially low level, competing dealers may not sue for damages unless the maximum resale prices are so low as to be ''predatory.''
The 7-to-2 decision overturned a ruling by a Federal appeals court in California in a case against the Atlantic Richfield Company. That 1988 ruling, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, permitted the USA Petroleum Company, an independent gasoline retailer, to sue ARCO for a policy of lowered prices that made ARCO dealers more competitive with independent discounters. 
 
No 'Antitrust Injury' Seen
Writing for the Supreme Court today, Justice William J. Brennan Jr. said that lower retail prices helped consumers and did not ordinarily create the kind of ''antitrust injury'' that competitors must show to have standing to sue under the Clayton Antitrust Act.
Because the suit has never gone to trial, the allegations by USA Petroleum against ARCO are unproved. ARCO denied forcing its dealers to lower their retail prices under a new marketing strategy it adopted in 1982, saying instead that its dealers simply passed along lowered wholesale prices.
USA Petroleum, which competes with ARCO in the retail gasoline market in California, Nevada and Washington, said it began losing $800,000 a month when ARCO adopted its 1982 pricing policy.
 
Illegal Under Sherman Act
USA Petroleum sued under the Clayton Act, which permits suits for triple damages by ''any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws.'' USA Petroleum contended that its injuries were the direct result of a price-fixing conspiracy that is automatically illegal under Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
A Federal District Court in California dismissed the suit in 1986, agreeing with ARCO that regardless of whether the pricing policy violated the Sherman Act, USA Petroleum could not bring a private lawsuit under the Clayton Act unless it could show that the prices were ''predatory.'' The Supreme Court has never defined predatory pricing, but economists use the term to refer to a monopolist's tactic of pricing below cost to drive competitors out of business.
The District Court said ARCO's market share of 17 percent did not give it enough power to engage in predatory pricing.
But the appeals court reinstated the lawsuit in a 2-to-1 decision. Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote for the majority that because ''price-fixing of any kind distorts in a basic way the competitive process the antitrust laws were meant to protect,'' a price-fixer's competitors had standing to bring Clayton Act suits regardless of whether the pricing was predatory.
 
Analysis Is Rejected
In the decision today, ARCO v. USA Petroleum, No. 88-1668, the Supreme Court decisively rejected this analysis. ''The antitrust injury requirement cannot be met by broad allegations of harm to the 'market' as an abstract entity,'' Justice Brennan said. He added: ''Low prices benefit consumers regardless of how those prices are set, and so long as they are above predatory levels, they do not threaten competition. Hence, they cannot give rise to antitrust injury.''
The Court rejected the argument by USA Petroleum that because price-fixing is treated in antitrust law as a ''per se,'' or automatic, violation of the Sherman Act, a competitor should automatically have standing to bring a private lawsuit under the Clayton Act.
Justice Brennan said the different approaches under the two antitrust laws served different purposes. He said the ''per se rule'' of the Sherman Act represented a ''conclusive presumption'' that certain kinds of business practices ''by their nature'' were highly likely to be anticompetitive.
 
Competition Reduction Stressed
But Justice Brennan added that private plaintiffs under the Clayton Act should not be permitted to recover damages on the basis of theoretical presumptions, but ''only if the loss stems from a competition-reducing aspect or effect of the defendant's behavior.''
Justice Brennan's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, and Anthony M. Kennedy.
Justice John Paul Stevens filed a dissenting opinion that was joined by Justice Byron R. White. They accused the majority of acting in ''haste to excuse illegal behavior in the name of efficiency.'' ''In carving out this exception to the enforcement of Section 1'' of the Sherman Act, the dissenters said, ''the Court has chosen to second-guess the wisdom of our per se rules and to embark on the questionable enterprise of parsing illegal conspiracies.''
 
Suits Against Unions
In a second decision today, the Court ruled that union members may not sue their labor unions for negligence growing out of the way the union carries out its contractual responsibilities.
The 6-to-3 decision, a big victory for organized labor, overturned a ruling by the Supreme Court of Idaho. That court permitted the families of some of the 91 miners killed in a 1972 fire at the Sunshine silver mine to sue the United Steelworkers of America.
The families contended that because the union had undertaken responsibilities to prevent accidents and monitor mine safety, it was legally responsible under Idaho law for the fatal fire. The case had not yet gone to trial.
 
Federal Law Cited
Writing for the majority today, Justice White said that Federal labor law pre-empted state law in all lawsuits growing out of a union's duty under a collective bargaining agreement. Under Federal law, he added, a union's negligence, even if proved, did not breach its duty to represent its members fairly.
The steelworkers and other unions had warned that unions would be reluctant to negotiate safety clauses in contracts if they could then become targets of lawsuits. Suits by union members have been increasing, the steelworkers said, because state worker compensation laws typically permitted only small recoveries by employees against their employers.
The decision, United Steelworkers v. Rawson, No. 89-322, was joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun, Stevens and O'Connor. Justices Kennedy, Scalia and Chief Justice Rehnquist dissented.

Sallie Mae Chief Takes A Post at Dartmouth

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Edward A. Fox, who built the Student Loan Marketing Association into a major financial enterprise, is leaving as its president and chief executive to become dean of the Amos Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth University.
''This came with startling speed,'' Mr. Fox said yesterday, noting that he was informed over the weekend that he had been chosen. ''I'm still coming down to earth.'' At Dartmouth, Mr. Fox, 53 years old, will succeed Colin C. Blaydon, who announced earlier this year that he planned to step down to write and do consulting work after seven years in the post. 
Mr. Fox was the first employee of Sallie Mae 17 years ago. It is a federally chartered, stockholder-owned corporation that buys insured student loans, thereby replenishing local supplies of student credit.
Mr. Fox's move, announced yesterday, coincided with the news that Ronald F. Hunt, 47, Sallie Mae's executive vice president and general counsel, plans to resign and return to North Carolina to begin a private law practice.
''He wants to be a country lawyer,'' Mr. Fox said, adding that there was no connection between the two departures. ''This is just two people making an adjustment at roughly the same time.''
The two announcements were made in Washington by Harry R. King, Sallie Mae's chairman. He said the board will meet this week to begin looking for a successor to Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox will be leaving for Dartmouth about Labor Day.
Mr. Fox, a graduate of Cornell with an M.B.A. from New York University, said he planned to apply the same amount of energy to being dean that he had put into the Sallie Mae post.
He was director of finance for the Federal Home Loan Bank System in Washington when he was chosen to start up Sallie Mae. ''I never expected that I would create a $40 billion company as an entrepreneur,'' he said.
The first five or six years were entrepreneurial, he said, and in the late 1970's demand for the company's services took off with high inflation and soaring tuitions. Of the situation then, he said, ''You don't manage it, you survive it.'' In 1983 the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and has become one of the larger financial services companies.
Mr. Fox said that Ross Perot, the Texas businessman, had remarked to him that not many had created such large corporations. ''Mr. Hewlett, Mr. Packard, Mr. Wang, himself,'' Mr. Fox said. ''I told him that 'you guys did two things: You created them, but you also learned how to own them.' ''

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Behind the Rally In Bank Stocks

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
BANKING company stocks, after being shunned by Wall Street for the last seven months, increased sharply during the stock market rally of the last two sessions, and may be treated more graciously in coming months.
The problems that caused bank shares to fall sharply persist: mounting losses from bad real estate loans and fears of losses on loans to heavily indebted companies if the economy weakens. But some analysts and investors say bank share prices have fallen enough to compensate investors for the remaining risks.
An index of bank stocks compiled by Keefe Bruyette & Woods showed that through May 11 these stocks had fallen more than 22 percent from their early-October peak; in the same period the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index slipped 1.8 percent. But from April 6 through May 11 the bank index has rebounded to gain 9.6 percent, while the S.& P. was up 4.3 percent. Yesterday, the S.& P. rose less than 1 percent, and bank stocks also gained. 
Charles P. Vincent, an analyst and money manager at the PNC Financial Corporation, a banking company, said, ''Even if you cut banks' projected 1990 earnings by a third, their current prices are looking pretty reasonable.'' After pulling out of the bank stock market last summer, he is not yet ready to buy heavily, but says, ''I think we have seen the worst of it.'' By the second half of this year, he expects many companies to be reporting higher earnings than they did a year ago.
One impetus for the surge by large banks in the last few days has been the drop in yields for Treasury securities. Declining interest rates usually help bank stocks, even though many analysts say that for many banking companies, the interest they earn on loans tends to fall at least as fast as the rates they pay on deposits.
But a decline in rates does make bank dividends more attractive, expecially for banks with common stock dividend payments so large, and presumably so reliable, that stockholders earn yields considerably higher than are available from the Treasury.
Now that Treasury bond yields have fallen to 8.57 percent, from 8.97 percent as recently as May 3, the dividend yields of several New York City banks are looking better than ever.
''To the extent the decline in bond yields continues, it is the No. 1 near-term trigger event for higher prices for money center banks,'' said Frank DeSantis, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. Although Mr. DeSantis does not recommend buying shares of the Chemical Banking Corporation, the Chase Manhattan Corporation or the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation, he said dividends of those companies were secure, and high enough to attract investors willing to wait for improved earnings.
Chase, which pays an annual dividend of $2.48, yields 9.77 percent at yesterday's closing price of $25.375, up $1.125 in the rally of the last two sessions. Chemical, paying $2.72 annually, yields 10.41 percent at yesterday's close of $26.125, up $1 in the two days, and Manufacturers Hanover yields 9.37 percent, at a price of $35, up 75 cents.
High yields for stocks are a reliable sign of risk, just as they are with bonds. But many analysts have concluded that their dividends are safe, although they are not likely to be increased soon. By allowing Chemical to declare its 68-cent quarterly dividend on Thursday and Citicorp to raise its quarterly payment to 44.5 cents from 40.5 cents earlier this year, regulators signaled their faith that those large banking companies can both improve their earnings and strengthen their financial condition in coming quarters.
Among other large New York banks, dividend yields are lower than those at Chase, Chemical and Manufacturers Hanover, but still high by standards of past years. Citicorp closed yesterday at $23.875, up $1 for the two days, to yield 7.46 percent. J. P. Morgan & Company, whose earnings have not been rising but which remains financially the strongest New York bank, pays $1.82 annually to yield 4.89 percent at yesterday's close of $37.25, up $1.75 over the two days.
Carol Berger, a banking analyst at C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. does not recommend any New York City banking companies. But she noted that in past years investors did well if they bought large New York bank stocks when their payouts rose to an average above 8 percent.
In addition to the attraction of high dividend payments, Richard Bove, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said large banks stand to benefit greatly from recent developments in Argentina and Brazil, neither of which has been paying interest on its bank debt.
He noted that last week's $60 billion increase in the International Monetary Fund's capital makes much more money available to help refinance the debts of those countries, particularly if they continue to reform their economies. Banks have already made reserves for partial losses on Latin American loans, and the resumption of even limited payments of interest by Argentina and Brazil ''would be of tremendous benefit to the large banks,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Inventories Steady as Sales Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
Businesses held inventories steady while increasing sales in March, the Commerce Department reported today.
Analysts said the report indicated that there was little threat of production cutbacks or losses of jobs.
The department said that shelf and backlot inventories were unchanged at a seasonally adjusted $794 billion. Backlogs had risen a revised four-tenths of 1 percent in February and three-tenths in January. February inventories originally were reported to have fallen by four-tenths. 
Sales rose in March by six-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $539.1 billion following increases of 1.4 percent in February and four-tenths in January. The February increase was first reported at 1.3 percent.
 
View Called Realistic
What the report means, said Gilbert Benz, an economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York, ''is that producers are looking very realistically at domestic demand and the possibility of a slowing overseas demand for United States-made goods and are bringing production in line with those expectations.''
He added that ''unlike a period of slow growth where businesses often get caught short with an excess buildup of stocks, in the current environment we see they are anticipating a slowdown and adjusting production so they don't have to slash inventories and cut production radically.''
March business activity produced a 1.47 ratio of inventories to sales, down from 1.48 in February and matching a January 1989 ratio that was the lowest since the current economic expansion began after the 1981-82 recession. The ratio means that it would take 1.47 months to exhaust inventories at the March pace. It peaked at 1.70 in October 1982.
 
Drop for Second Month
The decline in inventories was greatest in the manufacturing sector, dropping by three-tenths of 1 percent for the second consecutive month. However, backlogs edged up by two-tenths at the wholesale level after declining by three-tenths in February. Retail inventories rose by three-tenths after posting a loss of seven-tenths the previous month.
Sales, on the other hand, dropped by two-tenths of 1 percent at the retail level. The Commerce Department reported last week that retail sales fell by another six-tenths in April, the biggest plunge in six months. But manufacturing sales rose by 1.1 percent and wholesale sales increased by eight-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long-Term U.S. Securities Rise

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The bond market rally continued yesterday, as prices of long-term Treasury securities rose in moderately active trading, and yields fell to their lowest levels since mid-April.
Credit market participants said that clients were buying in the hope that conferees in the Washington budget talks today would be able to hammer out a substantive accord to cut the Federal budget deficit.
''Based on the price action, right now we are ignoring the larger needs of the Treasury, Refcorp and all the rest,'' said David Green, head of government bond trading at Chemical Bank. ''People are focusing on the fact that something is going to come out of this budget conference.'' 
Another bond trader, who asked not to be identified, said that ''deficit reduction, arms reduction, higher taxes and fiscal responsibility are all terms that have appeared prominently in the media recently and are all phrases that give people a better feeling about bonds,'' adding, ''I think the market is in excellent shape.''
Based on the move in bond prices over the last two weeks, it is difficult to muster a case for pessimism.
Since May 1, yields on 30-year Treasury bonds have fallen by more than 40 basis points, or hundredths of a point.
The rally was unleashed on May 4 by April employment data that were much weaker than expected, suggesting the Fed would not need to tighten credit. It received further support last week from the successful auction of $30.5 billion of new Treasury notes and bonds, as well as from retail sales and inflation figures that suggest the economy is soft and that inflationary pressures are receding from their torrid first-quarter pace.
As a result of all this good news, ''domestic investors are interested again, and dealer inventories are very light,'' the bond trader said. ''That is very encouraging news.'' The bulk of yesterday's buying was concentrated in long-term Treasury securities. Prices of intermediate- to short-term issues, by comparison, did not move much.
By late in the day, the Treasury's new 8 3/4 percent benchmark bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 101 7/8, up 5/8 point, to yield 8.57 percent, down from 8.63 percent on Friday. It is the lowest yield on the bellwether bond since April 11, when the 8 1/2 percent issue of 2020 was offered at a price to yield 8.56 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 26/ 32, up 1/4 point, to yield 8.60 percent. And the 8 7/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 21/32, up 1/ 32, to yield 8.50 percent.
Rates on new three-month and six-month Treasury bills fell sharply at the weekly auction.
Bids on the new three-month bills produced an average discount rate of 7.67 percent, down from an average rate of 7.79 percent at last week's sale.
Meanwhile, six-month bills were auctioned at an average discount rate of 7.68 percent, compared with a rate of 7.84 percent at the auction a week ago.
 
Cause to be Optimistic
Over the years, the credit markets have tended to cast a highly cynical eye on attempts to cut the Federal budget deficit. But analysts said that this time there was some cause to be optimistic.
''The difference between a structural budget deficit of $150 billion and the Gramm-Rudman target of $64 billion is so large that there is now a willingness to take some action,'' said Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation. ''The magnitude of that gap is what has brought the President and the Congress to the threshold of a new aggreement.''
Even if a mixture of new taxes, accounting changes and revised economic assumptions pares $50 billion to $75 billion from the deficit figure, Mr. Soss said there is no reason to expect that interest rates will fall by much.
''In 1987, the year Gramm-Rudman was first implemented, the budget deficit fell by one-third,'' he said, ''but interest rates didn't go down. They went up. There is no magical link which says that lower budget deficits mean lower interest raets on a day-by-day basis.''
Encouraged by recent rate declines, a number of corporations priced new debt issues yesterday.
Among them, the Cincinnati Gas and Electric Company, offered $100 million worth of 30-year first mortgage bonds. The 10 1/8 percent bonds, which mature May 1, 2020, were priced at $99.567, to yield 10.17 percent, 1.55 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the 8 1/2 percent Treasury bonds of 2020 at the time of pricing.
The bonds, which are nonrefundable for five years, are rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB-plus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. Morgan Stanley & Company acted as lead manager for the transaction.
Activity in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds was fairly light, traders said. Prices of most widely quoted issues rose by 1/4 point to 1/2 point.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most actively traded issues rose by about 1/4 point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury notes:

HEADLINE: Careers;
Students Aid East Europe Businesses

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
NOW numbered in the dozens, hundreds of business school students may eventually be spending summers abroad to help Hungarian, Polish and other foreign businesses. Plans for such programs have already been disclosed at three major schools - Cornell University, the University of Michigan and the University of Pennsylvania.
James M. Jennings, a 26-year-old M.B.A. student at Cornell's Johnson Graduate School of Management, got the idea last September to introduce such a program.
''The Berlin wall was still up, so choices were between Hungary and Poland, '' he said last week. ''We decided on Hungary.'' Hungarian business had been focused on the West for some time through joint ventures, he explained. 
Eight students are going, he said, adding that Dean Alan G. Merten had a discretionary fund that will cover air fares. The five men and three women will live in dormitories at Budapest University, known until recently as Karl Marx University. Hungarian companies will pay them about $150 a month, which Mr. Jennings says is enough to cover room and food.
''We do not see ourselves as missionaries of American capitalism; we don't want to force our thinking on anyone,'' he said. ''Part of the excitement is that we are doing something positive. We will be working for entrepreneurial ventures in Budapest, sharing with them our knowledge of marketing, strategic planning and finance. They are starved for management help.''
He explained that in Hungary entrepreneurial companies were considered ''separate,'' which means only that they are apart from the central planning authority. ''We will be involved with companies that must export to gain money so that Hungary can import consumer and other goods it needs,'' he said. Hungary's growth, he stressed, would be ''export-led.''
At the University of Michigan's School of Business Administration, the initiative for students going to Poland came from Edwin L. Miller, an associate dean and professor. He said last week that the students ''will be taking part in a major historical drama while they help a controlled economy turn into a free-market one.'' He added that ''I sense an idealism like that in the early days of the Peace Corps.''
Four out of the nine going to Poland will be financed by the business school, said Kathleen Hulik, its media director. She added that a real estate developer, Samuel Zell, a graduate of the University of Michgan, had given money to help. The business school will provide the four interns with stipends of about $2,000 a month to make up for lost summer earnings. A fifth, Anne-Laurence Mace, a French exchange student, is being financed by her graduate school, L'Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales, at Jouy-en-Josas, France.
Another four have ''volunteered'' to go by paying their own way, an estimated $3,500 to $4,000, including air fare.
A husband-and-wife team, Kenneth and Karen Knister, expects to rent an apartment while others will live in dormitories or with Polish families.
The nine students are now taking a crash course in Polish history, culture and language. Dr. Miller, who plans a midsummer trip to Poland, has asked them to keep day-by-day journals of their experiences.
At least two will work on financial analyses of state enterprises for the bureau of privatization, a unit of the Polish Ministry of Finance. The aim is to prepare state-owned operations for sale through public offerings or private placements.
Dr. Miller said that Doradca, a consulting firm in the city of Sopot, on the Baltic Sea near Gdansk, would assign students to work with a variety of companies that make plastics, wooden products, medicines and cosmetics, and a firm that organizes music festivals. In Cracow, a student will make marketing plans for a computer software company and another skilled in operations management is assigned to an agricultural equipment plant in Bydgoszcz.
At the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Bulent Gultekin, an associate professor of finance, said he tentatively planned to spend the summer helping the Polish Ministry of Finance, along with ''half a dozen Wharton students.'' The program has not been made final, he said.
Dr. Gultekin, who returned last year from a two-year stint helping the Turkish Government privatize some industries, explained that the stituation in Poland ''is like a turnaround situation'' in the United States. ''They don't have to start from scratch; however, 80 percent of the economy probably will be privatized,'' he said, noting that capital markets must be organized, including a new stock exchange.
Another Wharton group, mostly minority students, returned recently from their third and final week in St. Croix, V.I., where they helped businesses hurt by Hurricane Hugo last fall. The group - three in the graduate program and 10 undergraduate seniors - was financed by $10,000 anonymously donated by a professor and by corporate gifts.
Describing the advice offered, Suzanne Virgo, who will receive an M.B.A. this month, said she and others had helped an owner of two pharmacies, one of which was demolished by the storm, with inventory control. They also urged a soft-drink bottler to improve distribution by adding trucks.

Dollar Off More Than 2 Yen In Tokyo Morning Session

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, May 15

 BODY:
The dollar plummeted more than 2 yen against the Japanese currency this morning. The American currency closed the morning session here at 151.15 yen, down 2.20 yen from Monday's close of 153.35 yen.
The yen's strength against the dollar bolstered Japan's stock and bond markets. 
The Nikkei stock average, which rose 530.51 points on Monday, gained 73.34 points, or 0.22 percent, to close the morning session at 32,115.99 points.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Japanese Government bond edged higher to 88.06, from Monday's close of 87.86 points. That dropped the yield to 6.945 percent, from 6.988 percent.
Currency dealers said the dollar's retreat followed its overnight decline in New York, where the American currency ended at 152.50 yen, down from 152.70 yen on Friday.
''The market's dollar-selling mood results from investors' expectations of a slowdown in the U.S. economy ahead of the release of major U.S. economic indicators,'' said Masato Hayashi, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
Washington is to release its April report on industrial production today, April consumer prices and housing starts tomorrow and March trade figures on Thursday.
On Monday, the dollar was unchanged to weaker against the British pound. Sterling cost $1.6817 in London, unchanged from Friday, and $1.6825 in New York, up from $1.6790.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's quotes, included: 1.64288 West German marks, up from 1.6380; 1.3915 Swiss francs, down from 1.3995; 5.5360 French francs, up from 5.5295; 1,208.00 Italian lire, up from 1,207.75, and 1.17715 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17575.
Late dollar rates in Europe on Monday, compared with late Friday rates, were: 1.6442 West German marks, up from 1.6300; 1.3952 Swiss francs, down from 1.3955; 5.5430 French francs, up from 5.5096; 1.8472 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8330; 1,209.75 Italian lire, up from 1,200.40, and 1.1767 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1783.
Gold prices fell after rising overseas.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $368.40 a troy ounce, down 40 cents from late Friday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $368.10 an ounce, also 40 cents lower.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $369.75 an ounce, from $369.05 bid late Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to $368.75 an ounce, from $368.80 Friday.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 97 cents to close at a bid $369.10 an ounce.
Silver prices gained ground. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.066 a troy ounce, up from $5.043 Friday. Silver rose in London to $5.09 an ounce from $5.06.

HEADLINE: Partnership in Firm Awarded to Victim of Sex Bias

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
A Federal district judge in Washington has ordered Price Waterhouse, one of the nation's largest accounting firms, to give a partnership to a woman who said she was denied the promotion in 1983 because of negative sexual stereotypes.
The case, which had gone to the Supreme Court and back to trial, is apparently the first in which a court has awarded partnership in a professional firm as a remedy for discrimination based on sex or race.
Throughout the 1980's there has been heated legal debate on whether accounting and law firms can be ordered to award partnerships to victims of discrimination, or whether partnership involves such special personal relationships that courts cannot intervene in a firm's decision making.
In the ruling handed down on Monday and reported yesterday in The Washington Post, the judge said that making the woman, Ann B. Hopkins, a partner at Price Waterhouse was the best way to right the wrong. 
''Ordering Price Waterhouse to simply reconsider Ms. Hopkins for partnership would be futile and unjust because the testimony of Price Waterhouse's chairman suggested that the deck is stacked against her,'' wrote the judge, Gerhard A. Gesell. ''Price Waterhouse plainly does not want her and would not voluntarily admit her. Partnership, not simply a new vote, is the logical remedy, given the finding that Ms. Hopkins was likely to have been made a partner if not for unlawful discrimination.''
Ms. Hopkins's lawyers presented evidence in the case that the partners at Price Waterhouse had called her overbearing, macho and abrasive and had said she would have a better chance of becoming a partner if she would wear makeup and jewelry, and walk, talk and dress ''more femininely.''
Ms. Hopkins, 46 years old, who now works at the World Bank in Washington, was awarded back pay amounting to about $400,000, in addition to the partnership. The exact amount of the back pay and the interest due her has not yet been computed.
Judge Gesell said Price Waterhouse must make Ms. Hopkins a partner as of July 1 and pay her as much as the average management consultants who were admitted to the partnership in 1983, when she was turned down, now earn.
Ms. Hopkins said she was ''prepared to go back'' to Price Waterhouse but was yet convinced that her seven-year legal fight was finished.
''It's not over until it's over,'' she said. ''The judge hasn't signed the order yet and Price Waterhouse has appealed everything so far, so I'm not going to deal in conjecture. My kids keep asking how many times we have to win this before it's over.'' #27 of 900 Partners Are Women Ms. Hopkins said she had not yet heard from anyone in management at Price Waterhouse. ''And frankly, I would die of shock if I do,'' she added.
A spokeswoman for Price Waterhouse, a 900-partner firm with 27 female partners, said the firm was still studying the decision to determine its response.
Douglas B. Huron, a lawyer who represented Ms. Hopkins, said: ''The most important thing about this case is the remedy that was ordered. The judge looked at it carefully and decided that she was entitled to what she had been denied. That means that under the law, women and minorities can get what's coming to them.''
Ms. Hopkins went to work as a management consultant at Price Waterhouse in 1978 and was nominated for partnership in 1982, the only woman among the 88 candidates for partnership. Although Ms. Hopkins had brought in more business than any of the other candidates, she was also the subject of more negative comments from partners than any of the others. Most of the comments criticized her handling of interpersonal relationships.
 
'An Irrational Explanation'
In early 1983, Ms. Hopkins was told that the partnership decision had been delayed, and a few months later she was told she was not being renominated. In 1984 she resigned and sued the firm for sex discrimination.
''I never thought being a woman was an obstacle when I was at Price Waterhouse,'' Ms. Hopkins said. ''At the time I left, I just thought I had been given an irrational explanation for a bad business decision. It was only later, when we were in litigation, that I found out about the comments that I needed to go to charm school, that I was too macho, that I was overcompensating for being a woman.''
The question of whether someone passed over for partnership can sue for employment discrimination first went to the Supreme Court in 1984, in a suit brought by Elizabeth Hishon against King & Spalding, an Atlanta law firm. Although the High Court said such claims would be allowed, the case was settled out of court; Ms. Hishon never returned to the firm.
Ms. Hopkins's case went to the Supreme Court last year on the question of what standard had to be met by claimants and employers in such discrimination cases.
The Court ruled, 6 to 3, that claimants had the initial burden of showing some evidence of discrimination but that it then fell to employers to prove their innocence.
 
Evidential Standards Eased
The Court said employers had only to show ''a preponderance of the evidence,'' not ''clear and convincing evidence,'' that they had legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for denying the promotion.
The case then went back to trial. In his ruling on Monday, Judge Gesell found that Price Waterhouse had not met the lower standard. Judge Gesell found that the firm maintained a partnership evaluation system that ''permitted negative, sexually stereotyped comments to influence partnership selection.''
The judge acknowledged that ''it is indeed a strained partnership relationship that lies ahead'' for Ms. Hopkins, one that would require mutual accommodation.
He said he would order Price Waterhouse not to retaliate against her for having brought the lawsuit.

HEADLINE: Novel Program for the Jobless Aims to Create Entrepreneurs

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VANCOUVER, Wash.

 BODY:
What if the Government gave people who lost their jobs their half-year of unemployment benefits all at once, in one check, to start a business?
Soon there will be an answer. Glen P. Meyers, Dixie Gantka, Marvin W. Mills and about 30 other laid-off workers here received checks averaging $4,100, most of them in January, and went to work for themselves.
They are the first of 1,000 people in the State of Washington who are being selected under a state-supervised experiment, which is backed by $2.75 million from the Federal Department of Labor to see if such a program might work nationwide. Cathy Countryman, the state's director of research projects, said she expected about 500 of the participants actually to start businesses by the time the program ends in December. Most so far are small manufacturing or service operations. 
This idea is not for most unemployed people. Participants must be highly motivated and willing to take risks, and each must submit an elaborate plan that persuades the authorities that the business can succeed.
Still, fierce believers in entrepreneurship think the idea could prove a boon to the economy, spawning big new companies. Others say that even if it merely gives some unemployed people the chance they need to make a modest living, that is good enough.
The notion that businesses as tiny as those in the Vancouver program can succeed, much less blossom into corporate giants, seems quixotic. The odds against any new business's surviving a few years are fairly high, especially those starting with just $4,000 to pay for inventory, machinery, advertising and the like. Some participants have savings and spouses with jobs, but few can qualify for additional funds, and few have experience in the rudiments of commerce.
Whatever the odds, Mr. Meyers, who has started a welding business; Ms. Gantka, a doll maker; and Mr. Mills, who makes videotaped programs for companies, are plugging along.
''There's no doubt in my mind that this will work,'' said Mr. Mills, who is 34 years old.
Ms. Gantka, who is 51, said: ''I have never been so happy in my entire life. Ever since I was 18 the one thing I wanted to do was have a doll repair shop or make dolls.''
Ms. Gantka spent most of her career as a secretary and was laid off in November. Now she is the president, proprietor and sole employee of the Doll Company. She makes exquisite china-like dolls in her ranch house in Vancouver, just across the Columbia River from Portland, Ore. She makes one model about 4 inches tall, one about 10 inches and one about 16 inches.
Ms. Gantka starts with a soupy gray clay that she pours into plaster molds to form hollow heads, arms, legs and torsos. When the parts are removed, she sets them to cure for three days.
''I scrape off the seams and sand them,'' she continued, ''and then I put on the pre-bake paint. I put them in the oven at 375 degrees for an hour and a half. I paint on the skin coloring. Then I do eyelashes, lips, nostrils and nails.''
Ms. Gantka says she now makes only three dolls a week but is picking up speed. She sells mostly at doll shows but has found a candy shop to sell them for her and is looking for other stores.
She asks $40 to $150 for each doll and is earning very little so far, about $500 a month. But with her two children grown and her mortgage at only $6,000, she says she is getting by. Of her $3,100 lump sum start-up money, which she is using to buy more molds and materials, she said, ''I still have $1,300 left.''
 
A New Look at Laws
Three years ago, Congress authorized the Government to examine the unemployment-benefit laws to see if they could be made more helpful. As it is, even without Government help. 6 percent of people who lose their jobs start businesses, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says.
But the laws discourage starting businesses, because to qualify for the typical 26 weeks of unemployment pay, people have to demonstrate that they are busily looking for jobs, and they have to agree to take any that suit their skills. So for people admitted to the experimental program, the Self-Employment and Enterprise Development project, the job-hunting requirement has been waived.
Since late last fall in Vancouver, and since February in Seattle and four other Washington cities, people who lose their jobs are told of the SEED program when they first seek benefits. They are invited to apply and to fill out a detailed form about their plans. Fewer than 5 percent of the unemployed have responded.
A computer randomly selects two groups of applicants, one of which will become eligible for the lump sum payment. The authorities then monitor both groups to see how many in each group are able to start a business.
Once selected, a participant must join a training program conducted by a public-private business development group - in the case of Vancouver, the Columbia River Economic Development Council. The recipient is required to take four classes: business feasibility, marketing, finance and accounting, and organization and management. Participants are then given reading material and must go the library to do market research.
The candidate must prepare a business plan discussing the market for the product or service, projecting the business's progress and showing that there is adequate financing. All this is subject to the scrutiny of the candidate's counselor, often a recently retired business operator.
There is an incentive to hurry, especially with the business plan, the hardest part of the program. Candidates receive their weekly benefits throughout the training, but the more they receive in benefits, the smaller the lump sum payment. One received $7,110, the maximum allowed, and the lowest payment so far was $904.
There are also incentives to be thorough - or to drop out, if the business idea seems unrealistic. Self-employed people do not pay unemployment insurance, so they cannot receive benefits if their businesses fail.
There is also a risk for the Government. A participant can abandon the business after getting the lump sum payment, go work for someone else yet keep the money. So far, said Clare Phillips of the State Department of Trade and Economic Development, only a couple of people have done so.
Danny Gaughan, 31, laid off from a construction job, appeared at the SEED training center here in early May for his first appointment with Kirk Williams, a counselor. The computer had selected Mr. Gaughan for SEED, and he brought with him a packed three-ring binder and a preliminary business plan, painstakingly handwritten on pages of yellow legal paper.
 
Purchase of Vehicle
Mr. Gaughan said he wanted to open Mr. D's Deli and Pasta Shop, a food truck that he would take to fairs and other crowded places. He has already made an essential investment, a 28-year-old camper that cost $395, and he is remodeling and fitting it with a kitchen.
Mr. Williams said he had been surprised by some of his charges, like Marvin Mills, 34, who lives east of Vancouver in Washougal. ''He's doing about what he forecast in his business plan,'' Mr. Williams said, ''which I thought was quite wild.''
In November, Mr. Mills lost a $32,000-a-year job as a production manager when the Japanese-owned plant where he worked in Portland shut down. He formed the See First Video Company, using his bedroom as his office and his television set for editing. He uses a typical home video camera but says he is getting a professional model.
In December, while waiting to be approved for the SEED program, Mr. Mills approached an aluminum company. ''They wanted an orientation video for new employees about how aluminum is made,'' he said. ''I do a lot of movement with the camera, zooming, putting in fades. I ended up getting $4,750.''
Mr. Mills says he has other clients lined up and is busily trying to drum up more business. His secret, he said, is a dearth of competition. He charges $250 per minute of completed taping, while the closest competition, burdened with overhead, charges $1,000.
Mr. Meyers, who is 51 and lives in the rustic town of Castle Rock, about an hour north of Vancouver, thinks he has a similar edge in lack of competition. His business is field welding: he loads $3,000 in welding gear into a pickup truck and goes to construction sites and logging camps to fix big shovels and grapples, the things logging companies use to grab fallen trees.
''I charge $30 an hour,'' he said. ''The lowest I've seen around here is $42. The $30 grab covers my overhead and my wages. I don't charge any overtime, and I'm on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week.''
 
Dropouts From Program
Some people have dropped out of the program. Pauline Witthauer, a widow with three children who was laid off from a bookkeeping job, wanted to expand a tax accounting business she had started in her spare time. ''I found I wasn't able to create a lot more business than I had in the past,'' she said.
She said she might have been able to pursue more business with a bigger lump sum. Even so, she has been smitten by the appeal of self-employment. With what is left of her own resources, she says she is starting another business called Sweats and T's, taking orders from businesses for sweatshirts and T-shirts emblazoned with their emblems and having them made by a local company.
''I'm not going back to working for someone else,'' she said.

HEADLINE: STRIKES TESTING CHAMORRO'S RULE

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, May 15

 BODY:
Striking civil servants loyal to the opposition Sandinista Front ignored a Government ultimatum ordering them to return to work by 9 A.M. today, confronting the new and impoverished Government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro with its first serious political crisis.
Police officers in riot gear intervened to help Government ministers enter their offices in several buildings occupied by the strikers. At the Foreign Ministry, they fired tear gas, but were unable to gain access. They made no attempt to eject the strikers, who had expanded a weeklong work stoppage to paralyze telephone service, public transportation, border crossings and the national airport. [The Government's deteriorating political circumstances are matched in the economic sector. In a letter to President Bush seeking an emergency loan from the United States, Mrs. Chamorro declared her country bankrupt. Page A10.] 'The First Big Showdown' 
The strikers, led by Sandinista labor unions, are demanding a 200 percent raise and the reinstatement of a law giving sweeping protections to the Sandinista-dominated civil service. Union leaders have asserted that as many as 60,000 of an estimated 150,000 Government workers are taking part in the strike.
But the strikers' specific demands are widely seen as secondary to the larger test of wills between the new Chamorro Government and the Sandinista Front. Sandinista leaders have repeatedly declared their intention to ''rule from below'' despite their defeat in national elections Feb. 25, and Mrs. Chamorro's Government has now committed itself to breaking the Sandinistas' hold on the state bureaucracy and public services. It has declared the strike illegal and threatened to dismiss any strikers who do not return to work.
''This is the first big showdown,'' a European diplomat said. ''They are measuring each other's strength.''
In confrontations with workers at barricaded government offices around Managua today, the Chamorro Government appeared to have authority over the large, Sandinista-trained national police force, whose loyalties are considered a crucial variable in the current standoff. But the Government apparently made no attempt to test the limits of its control because the police did not try to eject the crowds of Sandinista workers who occupied the buildings, chanting slogans such as ''Not one step back!'' and ''Violeta, start packing your bags!''
 
Services at a Standstill
Truckloads of helmeted riot troops with shields, rubber clubs and tear gas were deployed outside the entrances to several government buildings. But they were withdrawn to a safe distance after helping government ministers enter their offices, and no serious violence was reported. The situation appeared stalemated, leaving vital government services at a virtual standstill and Sandinista strikers defiant.
''If the Government doesn't reflect on this and come to the negotiating table, this problem can escalate,'' said Jose Angel Bermudez Lazo, secretary general of the Sandinista-controlled National Employees' Union. ''The strike will continue.''
The specter of a paralyzing confrontation with the Sandinista Front, which shaped the government bureaucracy and filled it with militant supporters during 10 years in power, has shadowed Mrs. Chamorro since she won election in February. The desire to avoid a crippling showdown is believed to have been a key element in her decision to keep a central figure of the Sandinista Government, Gen. Humberto Ortega Saavedra, as her top military officer.
But even before Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration on April 25, Sandinista unions staged a number of demonstration strikes that interrupted telephone service and power and water supplies and halted the bus system, the main form of transportation for the capital's estimated one million residents.
 
Civil Service Law Suspended
In the wake of those strikes, many Nicaraguans had come to believe that a confrontation between the Sandinista leadership and Mrs. Chamorro's Government regime was only a matter of time. But many, including senior Sandinista leaders, appeared to be taken off guard by the timing of the current dispute, which appears to have been pressed forward in large part by government leaders in an attempt to face down Sandinista labor strength while the new Government still enjoys a burst of post-inauguration popularity.
The immediate catalyst for the current strike was Mrs. Chamorro's decision last week to suspend a civil service law that would have granted broad job protection to state workers hired under the Sandinista Government.
The law, which would have protected even senior Sandinista officials from dismissal, was part of a series of measures passed hastily after the Sandinistas' election defeat. Its suspension brought predicted protests from the Sandinista unions, beginning with a small work slowdown.
But the Government then responded with the tough ultimatums that helped produce the current standoff. Government spokesman have sought to portray the spreading strikes as an attack not only on the Chamorro Government but also on the county's broader democratic process.
''What we are now experiencing is a strike that has absolutely no economic merit,'' said Luis Sanchez Sancho, a senior member of Mrs. Chamorro's coalition and vice president of the new National Assembly. ''It is a seditious strategy to hinder the consolidation of the new democratic Government.''

HEADLINE: CAUTION PREVAILS IN OPENING SESSION OF BUDGET TALKS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
President Bush opened budget negotiations with Congress today by refusing a request from the Democratic Congressional leadership that he make a televised address outlining the nation's economic problems and putting forward his own remedy.
In the first session of the talks today at the White House, Mr. Bush said a sense of political caution prevented him from explaining the severity of the budget deficit to the public or from offering a sweeping solution of his own.
Although the meeting was closed to reporters, several people who were there said Mr. Bush expressed concern over creating a financial panic if he described the depth of the problem without presenting a solution. The President added that if he were to offer a solution before a deal was struck with Congress, it would be rejected and the country would be no better off than if he had said nothing. 
 
The Delicate Tax Matter
Participants said neither side touched on the pivotal question of whether tax increases would be needed to reduce the deficit, which the budget director, Richard G. Darman, has said could soar as high as $190 billion in the next fiscal year. Since the question of higher taxes was not discussed, the politically sensitive question of who would first broach the subject was left unresolved.
The meeting was described as an inconclusive get-acquainted session full of partisan maneuvers but free of disputes. What jousting there was centered on whether the President would take public responsibility for financial sacrifices that might be needed.
The White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, quoted Mr. Bush as saying that no crisis was at hand but that ''it is important to act while the economy is still growing, for growth is not as strong or secure as it should be.''
 
One by One, a Challenge
After Mr. Bush's presentation, he called on several of the 21 lawmakers around the table in the White House Cabinet Room to make presentations of their own. It was at this point that Mr. Bush was challenged by the Democrats to make his case publicly.
''Foley, Gephardt, Rosty, Mitchell,'' said Representative Silvio O. Conte of Massachusetts, a Republican negotiator, calling off the names of some of the Democratic participants. ''They sounded like a broken record. They asked the President to go on television and lay this all out.''
Mr. Bush waited until the end of the meeting to turn down that suggestion. The Democrats did not challenge the President directly, but many of them did say in the meeting that they would not be able to sell belt-tightening to their constituents without his help.
In the end, Mr. Conte and other lawmakers said, the President promised to go out of his way to help negotiate an agreement and to persuade the public of its worth. But he said he would not hold an immediate news conference or make a major speech on the subject because he did not want to affect the financial markets adversely.
Participants said today's meeting consisted primarily of a general discussion of the economy and the nature of the deficit problem. Taxes were only mentioned generally as a matter that would have to be addressed later.
Most of the participants expect several more meetings in which they dance around the ring before a real punch is thrown. The next session is scheduled for Thursday on Capitol Hill, and the President is not expected to be there.
 
Some Optimism About Success
Lawmakers and Administration officials alike said the meeting today lacked the edge they expect once full-scale negotiations get under way, but they expressed guarded optimism that a way could be found to reduce the deficit.
''I get a feeling from having been around a lot of deals in my time that this one's going to happen,'' said Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who spent most of his career as an investment banker on Wall Street.
Still, Democrats said after the meeting that they were not satisfied with Mr. Bush's refusal to make a public statement. ''There is still a sense of unease and an expectation on the part of the Democrats that the Administration will take the leadership role and lay out its solutions,'' said Senator Jim Sasser, a Tennessee Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
The House Budget Committee chairman, Representative Leon E. Panetta, Democrat of California, shared that assessment. ''At some point, he's going to have to get the message to the American public,'' Mr. Panetta said.
The Democratic view is that the urgency of the problem is a result of an unrealistic budget that Mr. Bush sent to Congress in January. He said then that reduction of the deficit to $64 billion, as required by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings balanced budget law for the fiscal year that begins in October, could be accomplished without higher taxes or painful spending cuts.
The Administration's figures were based on economic projections that were much more optimistic than those of private economists and the Congressional Budget Office, whose forecasts have since proven to be accurate.
 
A New Administration View
For example, the Administration's prediction was that corporate profits would rise in the next fiscal year by 17 percent. The consensus of private economists was that the figure would be less than 5 percent. So far this year, those profits have actually dropped from last year.
Mr. Darman, the budget director, told the lawmakers today that the Administration now believed about $75 billion in deficit reduction would be required to meet the law's target, as against the $36 billion predicted in January.
If expenses associated with propping up failed savings and loan associations are counted, Mr. Darman reportedly told the lawmakers, the $75 billion figure could rise to $125 billion.
If the deficit target is not achieved, the budget balancing law calls for sharp reductions in most Government programs except Social Security and welfare benefits. Both the Administration and Congress want to avoid those broad cuts.
Lawmakers said that neither the President nor Mr. Darman apologized for the poor economic forecast. But Mr. Darman said that lower corporate profits had meant less revenue for the Government, and that higher interest rates than expected had meant the Government had to pay more on its bonds. In addition, expenses for Medicare, food stamps and some other programs had turned out to be higher than anticipated, Mr. Darman reportedly said.
