HEADLINE: For an Avant-Garde Center, An End and a Beginning

BYLINE: By DULCIE LEIMBACH 

 BODY:
Martha Wilson was sitting in her sister's kitchen in Olympia, Wash., two summers ago when she experienced an epiphany. That is how Ms. Wilson, the founding director of Franklin Furnace, the performance art and gallery space in TriBeCa, recalls the moment. She was looking out the kitchen window at Mount Rainier, which had the effect of "centering" her, she said. Then it hit her: she was about to embark upon renovating the 19th-century Italianate Franklin Furnace loft space, but renovation was not what she wanted the gallery to be remembered for.
"I realized the money was going toward something that had no future," she said. "I wanted to kill myself." 
 What she wanted Franklin Furnace to be remembered for, she suddenly knew, was its success at championing art -- artists' books, performance art -- overlooked by mainstream institutions. "I knew I had to come up with something," she said recently about her Olympian moment, and it meant new plans.
If she has used this anecdote frequently in the last year to justify to friends, artists and foundations her decision to close Franklin Furnace, to put its 20-year history into an electronic archive and to go on line with live performance art next spring, Ms. Wilson is not ashamed. After all, it is an anecdote that proves she can operate both in the then and in the now.
Ms. Wilson is no stranger to risk-taking. You see it in her appearance: orange-red spiky hair. ("I love being called Red on the street," she said.) In her personal life: she gave birth to her only child, Comly, eight years ago, when she was 41, with no expectations of marrying the boy's father. And in what she has accomplished in the arts.
Through Franklin Furnace, she has nurtured the artists Willie Cole, Jenny Holzer, Barbara Kruger and Ida Applebroog, among others, and introduced Eric Bogosian, Karen Finley, Annie Sprinkle and Paul Zaloom to the New York City performance art scene.
Ms. Wilson describes her next big risk by borrowing a line from her friend and fellow performance artist Spalding Gray: "Life boils down to getting the next hot dog."
To get her next hot dog, she is selling the Franklin Furnace loft space in TriBeCa for nearly $500,000. With that money, she will meet a challenge grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and begin archiving the reams of Franklin Furnace material, about 25,000 slides and hundreds of videos, which will tell the story of the last 20 years in the world of avant-garde art.
Other Government and private grants for her archiving have given her a big cushion. Indeed, after she pays off the mortgage at Franklin Furnace, hers will be, she said, "the only in-your-face arts organization with a cash reserve."
The paradox of having these grants is not lost on her. "They've been hammering at me for years," she said, referring to Government agencies. And now they have given her money to preserve the very activities that might have contributed to the arts endowment's undoing.
Who will want information on the history of Franklin Furnace? Documentary filmmakers, schools, electronic and print publishers, critics, Ms. Wilson said. "I get inquiries every day for the Karen Finley material," she said, referring to slides and tapes of the performance artist's work.
By looking at the last 20 years, the public can see that performance art didn't operate in a vacuum. "It tells the story of AIDS, feminism and Government financing," she said. "It's a social lens on the value of performance art in politics and economics."
Ms. Wilson's enthusiasm gives way to regret when she discusses actually closing Franklin Furnace. "My installation artists are unhappy," she said, but she had to face the fact that free-standing arts organizations can no longer pay their expenses.
Ms. Wilson, who was born in Philadelphia in 1947, attended Wilmington College in Wilmington, Ohio, and did graduate work in English literature at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In the mid-1970's, after teaching English to the art students at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, she came to New York, where she opened Franklin Furnace in 1976. From the beginning, the gallery, a former chandlery, was shaped to realize her ambition to meld the two worlds of art and words she had always longed to inhabit.
A performance artist whose impersonations of Barbara Bush and Nancy Reagan are legendary, she is also subject to bouts of sentimentality. "When I first started Franklin Furnace, we were all groping in a fog," she said, tears collecting in her eyes. "We had potlucks there; I lived on the mezzanine; my kitchen was in the back. And there was this hole in the art world, no one else was collecting artists' books."
So she did, and subsequently sold the collection to the Museum of Modern Art for $350,000, about the same amount, she said, it cost the gallery to preserve and catalogue the books. "But now artists are terrified," she said. "There is no support."
No wonder, then, that the World Wide Web seems to be performance art's savior. The computer screen can be used as a backdrop to provide far more variety, innovation and dimension to performances than was possible at Franklin Furnace, and with the Web, Ms. Wilson can do what she does best: cultivate talent, explore a new medium and go beyond the mainstream.
Cathay Che, a young performance artist who has appeared in New York at P.S. 122 and Exit Art, is eager to leap onto Ms. Wilson's Web bandwagon. "I like the stop-motion of cyber," she said. "It gives everything a science fiction feel."
More experienced performance artists are more circumspect. "I expect diversity in the medium just as in the others," Ms. Finley said. "And the reality is, do I have any other choice?"
Ms. Wilson plans to pair unknown artists with well-established or prominent ones, like Laurie Anderson. Their performances will be cybercast from Thinking Pictures, a studio and multimedia company in Chelsea that is already producing live rock group performances at http://www.rock.com. (These can be seen on computers equipped with cable modems and broad-band lines.)
Live performance on the Web is not new, but the necessary technical skills and production equipment are still out of reach for many arts groups. At this stage, too, the technology is imperfect: frames move robotically, and audio and visual components need to mesh better.
Exit Art, the SoHo gallery, used the Internet last year for broadcasting live theater performances inside its space. "We got responses from all over the world," said Jeanette Ingberman, the co-founder and director.
Right now, the Web's strongest feature is its air of great expectations. "The Web will introduce a new dimension to performance art," said John Hanhardt, the senior curator for film and media arts at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. "You have to develop your languages, your understanding of the medium, how it affects your performance, how you see it, how it moves. This is where I wait and see what artists will do with it."
"Martha's idea of taking so much a part of performance art history and putting into a digital archive will make it available to artists who should know that history," he added. "Scholars and critics should know that history, too."
Ms. Wilson, of course, has gone beyond waiting, but she can't help feeling ambivalent about shutting down the Furnace. If only, she seems to want to say, the art world were more appreciative of what she did. Her voice ringing with pain, she added, "Not every artist realizes the debts we paid."

Pay Attention

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
In mid-July a Saudi Arabian aircraft secretly took off from Syria for Saudi Arabia, carrying one passenger and several guards. And therein lies an intriguing tale of shifting geopolitics in the Middle East.
The passenger, a Saudi Shiite Muslim code-named "Khassab," was one of five key suspects initially sought by Saudi Arabia for the June 25, 1996, bombing of the U.S. Khobar Towers barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, which left 19 Americans dead. Of those five suspects, Jaafar Chueikhat "committed suicide" in a Syrian prison; Hani al-Sayegh fled to Canada and has been turned over to the U.S.; and Ahmed al-Mughassil and Ali al-Khuri remain at large, suspected of being in Iran. Khassab was apparently tracked down by the Syrians in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. Officials familiar with the inner workings in Syria (which initially resisted helping the Saudis) say the Syrians simply telephoned the Saudis one day and told them to send a plane, because they had "someone" for them. Presto: a key suspect was handed over. 
 Pay attention to this newfound Syrian cooperation: The Syrians' arrest of Khassab followed by just a few weeks a visit to Syria by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah. Abdullah has always been the most pro-Syrian of the Saudi leaders and he had been embarrassed at home by Syria's lack of cooperation on Khobar. In late June, Abdullah spent a week in Syria and Lebanon, accompanied by a 172-member official delegation.
The Saudis have apparently decided to deal with Khobar in their own, Middle Eastern way. The Saudis seem to feel that by leaking information from their own investigation that points to a possible Iranian involvement in Khobar they have effectively deterred Iran from mounting any more mischief in Saudi Arabia. The Iranians are on notice that anything that goes "boom" in Saudi Arabia will now be blamed on them. That is all the deterrence the Saudis need or want. The last thing the Saudis desire now is for the U.S. to start shooting up Iran, with Saudi Arabia then left to deal with Iran's wrath. I believe the Saudis don't trust the U.S. to handle Iran or Syria, so they are doing it their own way. Through quiet diplomacy the Saudis are getting Syria to roll up the anti-Saudi forces in Lebanon, and they have signaled Iran's new President, Mohammed Khatami, that they are ready to have good relations with him, if he reciprocates. If not, the Saudis can always summon the U.S.
The Syrians are using their rapprochement with Saudi Arabia to help construct a new regional coalition. In the wake of the U.S.-led victory over Iraq in the gulf war a de facto "American coalition" arose in the Middle East, comprising Israel, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Morocco and Kuwait. This American coalition was going to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict, forge a new Middle East economic order and establish a regional system in which the U.S. and its friends were predominant. The attack on U.S. troops at Khobar was an attack by one (or several) of those parties left out of the U.S. coalition -- Iran, Iraq, Syria, Hezbollah or Islamic Jihad -- in order to halt its momentum.
In many ways, it worked. Those who want to deconstruct American dominance are now on the rise, energized by the collapse of the peace process, a new regime in Iran ready to have better Arab relations and the chilling aftermath of Khobar. So Syria has patched up ties with Saudi Arabia, Syria is pressing for a new Arab summit with Iraq included, Syria has reopened trade and borders with Iraq, and President Hafez al-Assad, who rarely travels, recently visited Iran, where he mediated between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The Syrian goal is to blunt U.S.-Israeli pressure to make peace on their terms and to counter a growing Israel-Turkey alliance.
The symbol of the American coalition has been the annual Middle East economic summit, held for the past three years, at which Israelis, Americans and Arabs mix openly and cut deals in an Arab capital. Syria has been trying to organize a boycott of this year's economic summit set for Doha, Qatar, in late November, and as part of the Saudi-Syrian rapprochement, the Saudis will likely join that boycott. By coincidence, an Islamic summit is set to be held Dec. 9, just after Doha, and it will be interesting to see how many Arab leaders attend that, instead of Doha.
That Islamic summit will be held in Teheran.

HEADLINE: New Voice in Drug Debate Seeks to Lower the Volume;
Group Calls for Moderation and Pragmatism

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

 BODY:
When Robert MacCoun, a psychologist at the University of California at Berkeley, set out to analyze American perceptions about illegal drug use, he found himself treading a political minefield.
"I was stunned at how emotional the debate is," Professor MacCoun said. "The emotions are very understandable -- drugs can cause a lot of serious harm to society. But I think the emotions have made it hard to talk about solutions in an effective way." 
 Now a group of 34 scientists, drug policy experts and public officials, Professor MacCoun among them, is moving to stake out the middle ground in the drug debate by asserting that while drugs should not be made legal, the policies adopted to prevent their use have sometimes done more harm than good.
The polarized words of the debate have upset drug researchers and policy experts who find themselves caught in a crossfire between those who say the war against drugs has failed and should be abandoned in favor of more liberal policies and those who believe that reconsideration of existing policies is tantamount to a sellout.
"It's impossible to talk about any other alternatives without one side accusing you of being a traitor and having a hidden agenda," Professor MacCoun said.
The polarization has been illustrated by the refusal of Senator Jesse Helms to let the Foreign Relations Committee that he leads consider the nomination of William F. Weld as United States Ambassador to Mexico. Senator Helms, Republican of North Carolina, accuses Mr. Weld, the former Massachusetts Governor, of being soft on drugs because he favors making medicinal marijuana available for seriously ill people. In fact, Mr. Weld, as a Federal prosecutor, put drug traffickers behind bars.
The 34 professionals advocating a new look at drug policy plan to announce 14 "principles for practical drug policies" at a news conference in Washington on Tuesday. Their move constitutes the first attempt in years to bring pragmatism as well as civility to what has degenerated into a shouting match.
"It's being done to make clear to people that the argument between the legalizers and the drug warriors isn't where the action is, if what you're really trying to do is reduce the damage that drugs do to American society," said Mark A. R. Kleiman, a professor of public policy at the University of California at Los Angeles. "What we'd like to do is make it politically safe to say something sensible about drug policy."
Though the people who have signed the statement are generally known for their work on issues like drug addiction, most have not publicly spoken out about drug policy before. To avoid partisanship, none of the prominent personalities on either side of the drug debate were invited to sign the declaration, which also avoids much of the language of the current heated debate. For example, it speaks of reducing the damage of drugs to society rather than "harm reduction," a phrase that connotes cutting down on the harm addicts do to themselves.
The signers said: "The current drug policy debate is marked by polarization into two positions stereotyped as 'drug warrior' and 'legalizer.' This creates the false impression that 'ending prohibition' is the only alternative to an unrestricted 'war on drugs,' effectively disenfranchising citizens who find both of those options unsatisfactory."
In such a climate, the statement continued, "every idea, research finding or proposal put forth is scrutinized to determine which agenda it advances, and the partisans on each side are quick to brand anyone who deviates from their 'party line' as an agent of the opposing side."
The signers included the former New York City Police Commissioner, William Bratton; Detroit's prosecuting attorney, John O'Hair; criminal justice experts like John J. Dilulio Jr. of Princeton and Francis X. Hartmann, Mark H. Moore and David McLean Kennedy of Harvard and economists like Glenn Loury of Boston University and Philip Jackson Cook of Duke.
The signers known for their scientific research into drugs included Avram Goldstein of Stanford, George Vaillant of Harvard, George E. Bigelow and Solomon H. Snyder of Johns Hopkins, Lewis Seiden of the University of Chicago and Marian W. Fischman of Columbia.
"I oftentimes think that elected officials never hear from those of us who espouse moderate principles," said one of the document's signers, Charles R. Schuster, a former director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
"It's very important to have spokespeople for the moderate positions," said Dr. Schuster, who directs clinical research on drug abuse at the Wayne State University School of Medicine. "All they're hearing from are the two other extremes."
Several of the signers said that they had begun drafting the principles after voters in California and Arizona approved the ballot initiatives endorsing marijuana for medical purposes last November. Those referendums triggered heated exchanges between government officials and supporters of more liberal availability of marijuana.
Jonathan P. Caulkins, a drug policy analyst at Carnegie-Mellon University, said he signed the statement because he favored a "smarter prohibition" of illegal drugs. His recent analysis of mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, published by the Rand Corporation, concluded that tax money would be more effectively spent on treating minor offenders for drug abuse than on locking them up for long periods.
"One of my frustrations is that the drug legalization groups are intellectually irresponsible in a lot of their thinking, except they raise valid criticisms of the current regime," Professor Caulkins said. "And the current regime is intolerant of criticism. It feels that even constructive criticism is an act of treason."
The signers said: "We cannot escape our current predicament by 'ending prohibition' or 'legalizing drugs.' " Lifting controls, they contended, could increase drug use. But they said that law enforcement and punishment should be designed to minimize overall damage. "The use of disproportionate punishments to express social norms is neither just nor a prudent use of public funds or scarce prison capacity," they said.
Other principles make these points:
*Policies to curtail drugs should be judged by the results they produce, and not by their intentions.
*Social disapproval, while a powerful, economical means of reducing drug use, should not breed indiscriminate hostility toward drug users. But people who violate the rights of others while under the influence of drugs or while trying to obtain them should be held responsible.
*Policies should be tailored for different drugs because every drug carries its own risks and has its own patterns of use.
*Treatment that reduces drug use but fails to produce lasting abstinence should be considered an incomplete success, not a failure.
*Drug prevention messages should reflect accurately what is known about specific drugs.
Several signers expressed hope that their statement would provide a cover for politicians who have been reluctant to discuss the nation's drug problem more openly for fear of sounding soft on drugs.
"A lot of politicians have avoided talking about drug policy because there is no articulated middle ground, so they just stay silent on the issue," Professor MacCoun said. "We want to make clear to them that there's a whole palette of choices, and any criticism of the status quo doesn't have to imply endorsement of drug use."

HEADLINE: In Labor Day Bonus, U.S. Raises Minimum Wage

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
Millions of Americans have a little extra something to celebrate this Labor Day: a pay raise of 40 cents an hour.
On Monday, the Federal minimum wage will rise to $5.15 an hour in the second phase of an increase approved by Congress in the summer of 1996. In the first phase, last fall, the wage for hourly workers was lifted to $4.75 from $4.25, where it had been for more than five years. 
 The change will affect more than just the estimated 6.4 million workers who make less than $5.15 an hour; many employers plan to raise all wages to preserve pay scales.
"We can't pay a crew leader the same" as a regular employee, said Ed Guerra, who runs Dairy Queen restaurants in West Texas.
About 10 million minimum-wage workers will have benefited from either last fall's increase or Monday's increase, the Labor Department said. Some workers got raises last fall that pushed them above the new $5.15 minimum, the agency said.
Supporters say the wages are well deserved.
"Corporate profits and earnings for the average worker are rising," Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman said. "This minimum wage increase will help insure that the lowest-paid Americans also share in this prosperity."
The increase comes at a time when the booming economy has pulled unemployment down to 4.8 percent.
And Jared Bernstein, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, said that raising the minimum wage "had no job-loss effect," despite earlier fears that it would.
But critics who had warned that there would be consequences, like reductions in the number of jobs or in working hours, say the strong economy has simply delayed problems.
The wage increase could, for example, make private companies less likely to hire welfare recipients who are losing benefits, said Jeffrey H. Joseph of the United States Chamber of Commerce.
"I think you'll start seeing the movement from welfare to work will slow down," he said. "You're now digging deeper into the welfare ranks to people who have fewer skills, yet what we're doing now is increasing the price people have to pay for them."
Monday's increase is the 25th since the minimum was instituted in 1938 at 25 cents an hour. At the new rate, yearly earnings for full-time work at minimum wage will be about $10,700.
In contrast, the Government said the poverty level for 1995 -- the latest year for which figures are available -- was about $15,600 for a family of four.

HEADLINE: Profits From Casino Help an Indian Tribe Reclaim Its History

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

DATELINE: LEDYARD, Conn.

 BODY:
History books may now have to acknowledge what Theresa H. Bell, a member of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, has always felt in her heart: The Pequots did not disappear in the 17th century when, ravaged by the combination of a war with the colonists and smallpox, measles and other European diseases, the tribe supposedly succumbed to European culture and was assimilated.
That is what the gently rolling woodlands of southeastern Connecticut seem to say. And the secrets archeologists are unraveling here bring vindication to a group that was sometimes derided in the 1970's for seeking Federal recognition as a tribe, the purest Pequot being a one-eighth Pequot, and the accompanying right to operate a casino. 
 Now, profits from Foxwoods, the Pequots' 24-hour-a-day casino, are paying for a $135 million museum and research center to house evidence found mere footsteps away from the conspicuously turquoise-and-purple gambling hall. More than $1 million has been spent on the dig itself.
The findings unearthed by archeologists suggest that the Pequots not only endured but also maintained many native practices -- what they ate, how they cooked, how many family members lived together and more -- through at least the 18th century.
"We knew there had to be a story underneath the ground that hadn't been told," said Ms. Bell, granddaughter of Elizabeth George Plouffe, who pressed the dispersed tribe to reunite a quarter-century ago and was the founder of the modern Pequot nation. "This just proves what our oral history says."
The evidence backing Ms. Bell comes from the discovery of the trace remnants of a fortified Pequot village, probably built in 1670 and abandoned in 1675, and several 18th-century dwellings.
There are fragments of wampum, nuts, flint, tools, the oldest peach pit in the Northeast (probably) and much else. The biggest treasure is an earthenware cooking pot, as big as a pumpkin, pieced together from shards. Together, these clues tell how the Pequots hung on after they began their long slide in 1637. That year, after a series of raids by English colonists intent on taking the Pequots' land and taking over their fur trade, soldiers killed about half of the tribe in a battle at Mystic that lasted less than an hour. Then they burned down the Pequots' homes.
There is much work to do to before history could actually be revised, but many experts agree it should be. "This archeology is really going to be important," said Kathleen J. Bragdon, an anthropology professor at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., who has visited the sites and is the author of "Native Peoples of Southern New England."
Kevin A. McBride, an associate professor of archeology at the University of Connecticut at Storrs who is the director of research for the Pequots, said: "We now understand how they survived and maintained their cultural integrity. After all this is done, we will know, in terms of the Pequots, more about natives after their contact with the Europeans than has ever been known before."
And he sees further ramifications. "I believe that what we're finding here is not unique, that this has broader implications" for other Indians of New England, he said. "The individual decisions that each tribe made were different. But they made decisions that would assure and maintain their culture." He said the findings supported his belief that the tribes "were not passive," as the colonists had said.
In addition to traces of the Pequots' staying power, Mr. McBride has also found material that places their ancestors backward in time: vestiges of a prehistoric camp site dating back 10,000 years, with hints, as yet unproven, of evidence from 11,000 years ago.
"Ten thousand years is very old for a documented site in New England," Dr. Bragdon said. "There are others of that period in other parts of North America, but this is one of the first that shows continuous occupation in New England."
Next June 1, the 361st anniversary of the massacre at Mystic, the tribe plans to open its museum complex, with Ms. Bell as executive director. It will devote 85,000 square feet to telling the tribe's story and 5,000 square feet to galleries for special exhibitions about the culture of other American Indians. It will also house a research center and library.
The complex, conceived 30 years ago, was one reason the tribe built Foxwoods, whose annual gross revenues approach $1 billion. Some of the profits, which have not been disclosed, have been invested in fisheries and a shipyard and used to make an annual payment to all 400 tribe members and pay fees to Connecticut. But some have always been earmarked for the research and the museum.
"We realized we'd need to generate a lot of money because we wanted to understand and find parts of our history and culture that had been lost for so many years," said Ms. Bell, whose own hopes were reinforced by memories of the bottles and arrowheads and other trinkets she found on the reservation as a child on her personal "treasure hunts."
 
Presumed Lost, Accidentally Found
Professor McBride, who is not an Indian, had no such hopes rooted in his background when he set out in 1983 to study the Pequots' native grounds. "I didn't think much would be here," he said recently. "Most of the archeological record has been destroyed."
Laurence M. Hauptman, a history professor at the State University College at New Paltz, N.Y., and a co-author of "The Pequots in Southern New England: The Fall and Rise of An American Indian Nation," explained why. "Village sites are hard to find because most are now other towns, like New London," he said. "We Europeans didn't discover the geopolitical or economic importance of certain sites."
While the Pequots once presided over a 250-square-mile territory, Mr. McBride's most important finds are taking place on the 214 acres that, saved from encroachment, eventually were established as a reservation.
Many finds have simply emerged accidentally. Early this year, for example, the contractor for a parking garage wanted to move some soil on a small south-facing slope nearby. "He cut in, and we saw some of this," Mr. McBride said, pointing to thin, dark stains that look like chocolate frosting in a sandy-colored layer cake.
These blotches teem with the residue of a 10,000-year-old civilization: pit houses, probably made of wood pieces and beams, maybe covered with hide or sod, for perhaps 5 to 15 people.
Since winter, graduate and undergraduate archeology students from the University of Connecticut and other colleges have been digging, separating soil samples into plastic bags, sifting some to find artifacts and storing others.
The alternating layers of dark and light suggest that a family returned to this site each winter to enjoy its southern exposure but left for a less tethered life for the rest of the year.
 
Two Black Lines Add Up to a Fort
"The fort is the coolest thing we've found," Mr. McBride said. Although nothing but tiny fragments has been uncovered, he gets little argument from other experts.
"To find something like this fort, from this time period, is unique," Dr. Hauptman said. "Here, in Esopus country," he added, naming a Delaware Indian tribe, "we know there was an Indian fort, and we've never found it. Archeologists have been looking for it for a century."
As Mr. McBride tells the story, discovery of the Pequot fort was serendipitous. Stopping his red Toyota Land Cruiser on a bumpy dirt road leading to it, he said the modern Pequots planned a maintenance building on the site.
Because the Pequots send in the archeologists whenever they plan to build, Professor McBride and his staff members explored. With some core drilling, they found some stone tools, English flint and other "bits and pieces that told us there was a historic site here," he said. That was in 1986, and it was enough to stop the construction.
More intense work followed in the early 1990's. The crews found artifacts from the 1780's: some brass, some beads. "We thought it was a 1780's farmhouse," Mr. McBride said. "But slowly it began to dawn on us that we might have found something from the 1670's. We found Pequot pottery that doesn't date after 1680," judging by its style. They have also tested their findings with radioactive carbon dating.
Then came the revelation. The archeologists had found one long black stain of material and another long black line perpendicular to it. "It came to me on Block Island," where he had gone for some respite, Mr. McBride said. "I woke up at 3 A.M. and said, 'God, it's a fort.' I called back and said: 'Connect the dots. Extend the two lines and dig and see if you get a corner."
His colleagues did.
Eventually, diggers discovered a square fort, with bastions at the corners. The design demonstrates that the Pequots, who sided with the English in King Philip's War, an Indian uprising to turn back the Puritans that engulfed New England in the 1670's, learned from them. Records show that a previous Pequot fort, from 1637, was circular, not square, and lacked bastions. A forge, meanwhile, demonstrates that the natives used European technology in gun smithing.
Inside the fort is a village of 8 to 10 houses, yielding a trove of fragments from iron kettles, pothooks, pottery pots with Pequot marks, pipes stamped with English makers' marks, wampum, musket balls, gun flints, arrow points, spear points and decorative objects.
"We also found two garbage dumps," Mr. McBride said, "one in which everyone threw everything and one in a wigwam with incredible food remains." These included indications of nuts, corn, beans, squash, peach pits, pig, deer, raccoon, duck, turkey, geese, and fish from both the coast and local ponds.
Clearly, the Pequots interacted with the English colonists in many ways at least as early as the 1670's. Sites where wampum was manufactured and stored suggests, too, that they "were probably getting rich, though not rich in the European sense," said Professor Bragdon of William and Mary.
Sifting through all the information, Mr. McBride can surmise much else about Pequot life. The presence of more than one fire in a household, for example, suggests that extended families lived together, possibly siblings as well as grandparents, parents and children.
The food wastes tell a tale that differs from colonial records, which are heavy on the improvements Europeans brought to Indian meals. The Pequots apparently did eat domesticated animals like pigs, but they also continued to fish, hunt and gather food from nature.
"When you look at all the food remains, you'll find, with a few exceptions, an overwhelming native eating pattern," Mr. McBride said. The Pequots also continued to cook outdoors in pits.
The existence of the Pequot fort itself provides another example of divergence from accepted wisdom. "History says they were not well-organized, but this shows they were well-organized, with an organization that allowed them to maintain their own practices and take advantage of the fur trade," Professor Bragdon said.
"What Kevin has," she added, "documents their active participation in the fur trade and shows that they were real players in the economy, not pawns of the Europeans."
Professor McBride sums up what he has learned so far this way: "We are finding European cultural influences, but also native culture underlying it." Instead of assimilating, the Pequots made some strategic retreats.
To Ms. Bell, remembering her grandmother's tales, the discoveries ring true. "I am glad we started this," she said. "We don't need an archeological site to learn a lot of this; my grandmother still cooked outside, and I have a fire pit, too. But other people do. Outside people have to have proof to change the history books."

HEADLINE: Western Senators Are Pushing to Break Up Circuit Court

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 31

 BODY:
For more than a decade, a group of senators from the Northwest has been trying with little success to break up the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, complaining that it was too large and, more important, was dominated by judges from California who issue liberal environmental rulings.
But this summer, the lawmakers, all Republicans, managed to insert a little-noticed rider into an appropriations bill that would split the circuit. It passed the Senate days before the August recess. The House has approved a different measure, one that would authorize only a study of the issue, and it is likely to balk at the Senate's swifter approach. 
 Nonetheless, the Senate action is the high watermark of the effort to dismantle the Ninth Circuit, which decides Federal appeals from nine Western states and two territories, making it by far the nation's largest appellate court.
The Senate vote also comes almost 60 years to the month after President Franklin D. Roosevelt tried and failed in his famous "court packing" scheme to enlarge the Supreme Court because he was angered at its rulings on his New Deal programs.
Critics of the latest effort in the Senate, including some usually reticent Federal judges, describe the effort to split the Ninth Circuit as similarly motivated, a kind of "court unpacking" plan in response to unpopular judicial decisions.
Chief Judge Procter Hug Jr. of the Ninth Circuit said in an interview that the primary motivation behind the divide-the-court effort was that many of the court's decisions had been unpopular and had caused political problems in the Northwest.
"If there are a few high-profile cases that are decided in such a way as to be unpopular, there is a remedy for that through the Supreme Court," he said. "My sense is that this is a wholly inappropriate reason to suddenly decide on changing the entire structure of a court."
Albert T. Goodwin, a former chief judge of the circuit, has been more explicit, once telling reporters that the effort was a reflection of the frustration that timber and mining interests felt about the Ninth Circuit's ruling in favor of preserving habitats of the spotted owl.
Judge Hug and Judge James R. Browning, also a former chief of the circuit, have even arranged to come to Washington next week to lobby House members to resist the move.
But not all of the court's judges agree with Judge Hug. Judge Andrew J. Kleinfeld, who sits in Fairbanks, said he thought it was absolutely necessary to divide the circuit and its workload. He said that with a complement of 28 judges, the court was too large, too unwieldy and too unmanageable.
"It's impossible for a judge on our court to keep up with all the rulings of the other judges," he said. "This has resulted in a far less coherent and disciplined body of law from this circuit."
The Federal appellate courts, the level just below the Supreme Court, are organized into 11 regional circuits and one in the District of Columbia. The new legislation would leave just California and Nevada in the Ninth Circuit while creating a new Twelfth Circuit composed of what's left: Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and the Pacific Territories (Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands).
The legislation is opposed by the White House, the majority of judges on the Ninth Circuit, including the last three chief judges, the American Bar Association, the California Bar Association and Gov. Pete Wilson of California, who has called it "judicial gerrymandering."
The reason this effort was successful in the Senate earlier in the summer appears to be that the Ninth Circuit recently aroused the ire of Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Senator Stevens had previously been a steady but lukewarm advocate of dividing the circuit, but he seemed energized by a decision last year in which a panel of the circuit's appellate judges, none from Alaska, decided a tax case involving Alaskan Indian tribes. After that, he declared it was time for a change.
Mr. Stevens inserted the provision about the Ninth Circuit into the appropriations bill for the Departments of Justice and State. The rider, an often used way of effecting policy, passed with no hearings and no consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would usually deal with such an issue.
The Alaska case involved a Ninth Circuit ruling in December that two Indian villages in the state had the same broad sovereignty rights, including taxing power, as Indian villages in the lower 48 states. Senator Stevens denounced the ruling as upsetting the state's economy and told The Anchorage Daily News that he would raise anew the effort to split the circuit. "That court has too much to do to even learn about Alaska," he said. "I don't think any of those judges ever have been to Alaska and yet we have them issuing an opinion like this which has so much to do with our future."
Senator Stevens's comments mirror those of the more aggressive sponsors of the effort to split the court. Senator Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana, has said that his state needed judges who grew up in the region who would be more sensitive to "how we manage our own resources."
But the senators in the Northwest have emphasized instead the issue of the court's size, arguing that it makes judicial administration unwieldy. The court was set up in 1891, before California grew into the most populous state.
In 1996, 8,502 appeals were filed with the Ninth Circuit, according to the Administrative Office of the Courts. The next busiest circuit was the Fifth, in the Southeast, which had 7,546 cases filed.
A Senate study in 1975 recommended splitting the circuit and doing so by dividing California down the middle.
But the executive director of that study, Prof. Arthur Hellman of the University of Pittsburgh Law School, now says the division may be unnecessary. He said there was little doubt that the motivation behind the effort to divide the court was a misguided belief that it would produce more conservative rulings.
He said critics mistakenly think that the judges in California are, as a whole, more liberal than those in the other states. "Essentially, these people want to secede from a circuit that includes California," he said.

HEADLINE: GAINS PUT UNIONS AT TURNING POINT, MANY EXPERTS SAY

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
With the United Parcel Service settlement seen as a major triumph and an omen of future success, union leaders and many experts say the labor movement is in its strongest position in nearly a generation and is poised to increase its membership after a two-decade decline.
This Labor Day might be a watershed moment for unions, some experts say, because the 15-day U.P.S. strike created a surge of sympathy for unions as many of the efforts at revitalization pushed by John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, have taken root. 
 The labor federation, with 13 million members, is spending $20 million a year on organizing new members, up from $2.5 million a year in the early 1990's, and several unions that had essentially stopped organizing have started pumping money and staff into recruiting new members. Hundreds of college graduates are signing on as union organizers, while a new generation of labor leaders in their 40's has emerged, far more interested in shaking up and expanding the labor movement than were the crusty old leaders who dominated labor in the 1980's.
"Things are better for labor than they've been in a very long time," said Tom Juravich, director of the Labor Relations and Research Center at the University of Massachusetts. "The mood is fundamentally different from just two or three years ago, when there was a sense of hopelessness."
As part of Mr. Sweeney's push to reverse labor's slide, there is a surge in union organizing, including campaigns to unionize 16,000 teachers and school aides in Dallas, 20,000 strawberry workers in California, 55,000 apple workers in Washington State, 70,000 home health care workers in the Los Angeles area and 110,000 employees at Federal Express.
Labor has recently scored some of its biggest victories in two decades, among them unionizing 5,000 mechanics at Continental Airlines and 30,000 government workers in Maryland.
There have, of course, been major defeats, too, most notably losing an election two weeks ago to represent more than 5,000 textile workers at a dozen North Carolina factories owned by Fieldcrest Cannon. And despite the new confidence within labor, some critics assert that all the activity aimed at reversing labor's decline has generated little but sound and fury because it has failed to increase labor's bottom line: the number of Americans belonging to unions. In 1996, the first full year after Mr. Sweeney was elected president, union membership declined by 92,000 and the percentage of American workers belonging to unions slid to 14.5 percent, down from 35 percent in the 1950's.
"Unions have become much better at communicating," said Thomas J. Donohue, the new president of the United States Chamber of Commerce. "They're spending a lot of money. But they still seem to be flailing around trying to find something that works."
The decline in membership as labor tries to expand its ranks is due to numerous persistent forces like retirements, plant closings and downsizing. In addition, labor must contend with expensive campaigns by employers to keep out unions and the hostility felt by many Americans who see some officials driving Cadillacs or using union money to attend conferences in Hawaii or Italy.
Mr. Sweeney predicted in an interview that in the next few years, his big organizing push would begin raising labor's overall numbers. He said the decline in labor's ranks last year was understandable because he had only begun putting his organizing plans into place and because the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s focus in 1996 had been on the Congressional and Presidential elections, not on organizing.
"The bottom line is, nobody has any unrealistic dreams of doubling our membership in one year," he said. "We're going to get on a modest growth pattern of 2 or 3 percent a year. We're going to get results as more newly trained organizers get involved and more unions step up their efforts."
Under Mr. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has provided many unions with matching grants to encourage them to do more organizing. The labor federation has also reorganized dozens of city labor councils to make them focus on recruiting. It has also set up a program in many cities, called Street Heat, in which hundreds of union supporters hold raucous protest marches at companies that dismiss workers who back unionization drives.
To extend labor's reach, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has sponsored teach-ins with academics and has established alliances with members of the clergy, environmentalists, women's groups and ethnic groups. One of these alliances is bearing fruit on Labor Day weekend -- hundreds of pro-union priests, ministers and rabbis invited workers and union leaders to deliver sermons to their congregations about the values shared by labor and religious faiths.
"A lot of what we're doing is for the long term," Mr. Sweeney said. "We're just beginning to see the payoffs." He said he believed the strike by 185,000 U.P.S. workers, the biggest strike in the nation since an AT&T walkout in 1983, would attract more Americans to unions because the public saw what the teamsters were able to accomplish by standing together. The U.P.S. workers won most of their demands, including converting 10,000 part-time positions to full-time jobs and restrictions on subcontracting.
Richard Bensinger, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s new director of organizing, said that the day after the strike ended, he had been on an airplane, wearing a T-shirt with large letters saying, "Union Yes!"
"The woman sitting next to me started talking to me and said she's never been for unions her whole life," Mr. Bensinger said. "She told me her husband is a part-time worker, and she said she started thinking a lot better toward unions when she saw what the teamsters had won for the part-timers at U.P.S."
The emergence of dozens of younger leaders like Mr. Bensinger, 46, is one of the most important factors driving labor's renaissance. Mr. Bensinger is an inspiring speaker who began climbing labor's ladder after successfully organizing the ski and tennis racquet factory he worked at in Colorado.
Among the new leaders in their 40's are Karen Nussbaum, 47, the director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s women's division and founder of 9 to 5, an organization that represents secretaries. John Wilhelm, 49, the secretary-treasurer of the hotel workers' union, has masterminded an innovative drive over the past decade that has unionized 27,000 hotel maids, cocktail waitresses and other workers in Las Vegas, Nev. Andrew Stern, 45, president of the Service Employees International Union, has, more than any other labor leader, focused on recruiting, moving many headquarters staff members out to the field to organize. With this new strategy, the service employees have, in the first six months of this year, organized 23,000 janitors, nursing home employees and other workers.
Douglas McCarron, 46, president of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, has also refocused his union on organizing and has led the way in showing that unions should serve their members more than union officials. To make sure that money from dues is used more efficiently, he has merged dozens of locals, a move that left dozens of local business representatives complaining that they had lost their $90,000-a-year jobs.
Despite all these changes, many things are still not going labor's way. Last year, unions won only 47.3 percent of elections in which workers voted whether to join unions, the lowest percentage in five years. The number of such elections held last year, 2,792, was less than half the number in the early 1980's, when labor was thrown on the defensive by a recession, rising imports and President Ronald Reagan's dismissal of 11,500 striking air traffic controllers in 1981.
Mr. Bensinger said that labor's victory rate in representation elections had not risen because employers had grown more aggressive in fighting unions and because, in his view, the nation's labor laws were skewed against organizing drives. He nonetheless predicted that labor's new unionization push would soon pay off in larger numbers because labor unions were seeking to organize larger units and because many Americans were frustrated with stagnant wages.
Some labor experts predict that the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s expansion efforts will be to no avail because of powerful countervailing forces.
Leo Troy, an economics professor at Rutgers University, said labor's advances would be checked by business owners' need to hold down costs in the face of increased global competition and by the transformation of the workplace, with more people working at home, part time or as temporary workers or independent contractors. Noting that unions traditionally focus on full-time, permanent employees working at one site, Mr. Troy said, "The nature of unionism is at odds with the nature of the new work force."
He added: "Despite the rhetoric, the flamboyance and the fireworks, nothing has changed for the good for unions, and it's not going to in the private sector, where just 1 in 10 workers belongs to a union."
But many labor leaders say these forces may bode well for unionization drives because, in their view, these trends point to increased exploitation by employers and increased unhappiness among employees. These trends, labor leaders say, explain why the public overwhelmingly supported the U.P.S. strikers, while in walkouts in the 1980's, the public generally supported management. "The public's sympathies are different from 10 years ago," said Harry Katz, a professor of labor relations at Cornell University. "The 90's have produced huge skepticism about the motives of management, about stagnant wages and the astronomic rise in C.E.O. pay. That has made a lot of people think maybe unions aren't such a bad idea compared with corporate executives."

HEADLINE: Saving the Whales' Hearing;
Some Fear That Fleets of Watchers May Harm Mammals

BYLINE: By JANE FRITSCH 

DATELINE: MONTAUK POINT, N.Y.

 BODY:
It was nearly three hours before the first, tentative shout rose from the squinting crew. It could be a whale. It looked like a whale. "We have the animal off the bow at 11 o'clock!"
Within minutes, two more boats carrying hundreds of passengers arrived, alerted by radio that a whale had finally been spotted. Engines idled, cameras snapped and the lone minke whale dove deep and disappeared. 
 Off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and, increasingly, around the world, such scenes are a cause of gratification and concern for whale researchers. While whale watching offers a greater appreciation of the animals, which could help save them from extinction, the din caused by such scenes and other noise made by humans could be damaging their hearing. And that, some researchers theorize, might be fatal.
"A deaf whale is a dead whale," said Peter M. Scheifele, a bioacoustic researcher at the University of Connecticut. "If you're in the ocean and you rely on hearing for navigation, and to avoid predators and to find your mate, I don't think nature's going to let you live too long deaf."
Because little is known about whale hearing, Mr. Scheifele and researchers from several institutions are planning a project to determine the effect of the huge increase in underwater noise created by engine-driven vessels over the last century.
The greatest share of ocean noise is created by supertankers and other merchant ships that send sound waves miles ahead of their location, Mr. Scheifele said. "But whale watching and fishing boats figure in," he said, "not because one of them is very loud, but because a lot of them can be around at one time."
And the benign activity of whale-watching boats could be having another unintended effect, Mr. Scheifele added. "We have to worry," he said. "We are conditioning animals not to be afraid of ships." Still, Mr. Scheifele said he believes whale watching is valuable and should not be stopped.
A chance to see earth's largest mammal frolicking in the sea, sometimes only yards away, is a mighty lure that has led to tremendous demand for whale-watching tours over the last decade. An estimated 5.4 million people in 65 countries or territories went on whale-watching expeditions in 1994 and the numbers grow by as much as 10 percent each year, according to statistics compiled by the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, based in Bath, England.
Two-thirds of organized whale watching is done in the United States, where it was started in 1955, according to the society. The activity now generates more than $500 million in revenue around the world.
On the East Coast, whale watching began in earnest in 1975, when Al Avellar, a fisherman in Provincetown, Mass., began taking tourists aboard his boat. He eventually built his whale-watching business into the highly successful Dolphin Fleet. Now, dozens of companies along the Atlantic coast offer whale-watching tours.
Customarily, crews now radio each other, even if they are from competing fleets, when they spot a whale. This explains why three or more vessels may suddenly converge on the same whale.
Recognizing the potential for harm to the whales, the National Marine Fisheries Service has set guidelines recommending that boats stay at least 100 yards from whales, that they not charge or pursue whales and that they travel parallel to them.
But sometimes, to the delight of passengers, close encounters cannot be avoided. Once a boat cuts its engine, it may stay in its position even if whales approach, which often happens, according to Robbins Barstow, the founder of the Cetacean Society International, a volunteer organization that promotes whale watching.
Some whales seem to enjoy the encounters, Dr. Barstow said. "They breach and show off their calves." Many have become well known to observers over the last 20 years and have been given names, he said.
"Occasionally, you'll get a wild guy in an outboard motor," he added. "He'll tear over to where a whale is and really harass it."
But over all, whale watching has been beneficial for whales, he said, helping to turn public sentiment against the whaling industry. And as whale watching becomes a major tourist attraction, it may become an economic alternative to whaling, he said.
Several whale-watching expedition operators now offer space on their boats to researchers, who use the trips to observe whale behavior and to track the population. At Montauk Harbor, the Viking Line offers space to the Riverhead Foundation for Marine Research, whose staff runs an education program for whale watchers on board.
Dr. Barstow said he has seen no evidence that whale watching has affected the hearing of whales. "There is a much greater threat from tankers, oil ships and military ships," he said. "Whale watching is very incidental."
Mr. Scheifele first became concerned about excessive noise four years ago during a trip to Tadoussac Harbor, in the St. Lawrence Seaway. At about 11 P.M. one day that summer, he was struck by the amount of noise in the surrounding water and tossed a hydrophone overboard to measure the level, he said. "It was party loud."
At the height of the summer tourist season, he said, it is not uncommon to see one whale surrounded by 25 boats, all jockeying for position. "What I suspect," he said, "is that in the St. Lawrence there are times of the year, days and sites that are potentially dangerous to the hearing of whales."
Mr. Scheifele, director of bioacoustic research at the National Undersea Research Center at the University of Connecticut, is planning a three-year study with a team of researchers who will set out to answer some basic questions about noise levels and what whales hear.
But studying whale hearing is fraught with difficulties. Simple observation of whale behavior may be meaningless, he said, because it is not necessarily true that a whale will flee from damaging sounds. Humans, for example, may endure repeated loud sounds or generally high noise levels without realizing that their hearing is being damaged. The same could be true for whales, he said.
And because most whales travel thousands of miles in a year, it is difficult to know where or how their hearing might have been damaged. Further, as in humans, whale hearing declines with age, so the age of the whale must somehow be taken into account. "We don't know what a whale hears," Mr. Scheifele said. "For whales there are no hearing standards."
The first step will be to define standards of whale hearing, he said. The second will be to examine the ears of dead whales for damage to the hair-like cilia inside the ears to see whether they are broken or bent, signs of damage from loud or prolonged noise. The study will focus on the 700 or so beluga whales that inhabit the St. Lawrence Seaway. Because they never leave the waterway, it should be easier to determine the level of noise they have been exposed to in their lifetimes, he said. And the belugas may be in greater danger from noise because they cannot flee from it, he added.
"It's a very complex problem," Mr. Scheifele said, "not one that will be solved in the next year."
But Mr. Scheifele said he believes whale watching should continue. "Whale watchers are good people," he said. "They want to do what's right for the whale. And we need good scientific proof."
"The object is not to put somebody out of business," he said, but rather to find a way to live with other animals.

HEADLINE: 1997 U.S. OPEN;
Haas Shows Potential As the Last German Out

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY 

 BODY:
Early last week, a German television station, DSF, sent its reporters into the field to conduct an informal poll. Eighty people were interviewed and 40 of them said they believed that Boris Becker had a good chance to win the United States Open.
Becker must have appreciated the support, particularly because he was not playing in this United States Open. 
 As it turns out, no German has a chance to win at Flushing Meadows. For the first time since 1982, no singles player from Becker's once tennis-mad land has advanced to the fourth round.
Anke Huber, who has sting but little strategy in her ground strokes, became the last German woman to lose on Friday night. Yesterday, the last German man, Tommy Haas, lost to the No. 10-seeded Marcelo Rios of Chile, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 1-6, 6-1.
At a time when the United States Tennis Association is clearly concerned about the future of player development, the German Tennis Federation is in a similarly edgy frame of mind. Becker and the former Wimbledon champion Michael Stich have announced their retirements from Grand Slam singles play. Steffi Graf, who has won 21 Grand Slam singles titles, is recovering after major knee surgery and is now 28 years old.
Germany has been tennis's economic engine throughout this decade, and the dearth of successors to its stars is not simply of concern to 82 million Germans. It is also of concern to tennis administrators such as Mark Miles, the ATP Tour chief executive officer, who rely on German corporations and German television contracts for major chunks of their operating budgets.
Nick Bollettieri, the American coach with the dark shades and the bright smile, believes Haas could be part of the solution. At 19 years 5 months, he is the youngest men's player in the top 100, and yesterday he very nearly became the youngest men's player in the fourth round.
"I think, the next couple years, we should see him potentially become the top player in the world," Bollettieri said. "I think he needs more experience and a little bit more maturity mentally and continued physical work because he's grown up so quick. But he's got all the shots."
Haas has lived at Bollettieri's Academy in Bradenton, Fla., since he was 11 when he and his father, Peter, a tennis teacher, decided that the road to Grand Slams passed through Bollettieri. Haas now lives in his coach's house.
When the teen-ager reached the semifinals at a major ATP event in Hamburg, Germany, this spring on clay, Germans were quick to leap to conclusions: "Our New Boris" read one headline in one newspaper. But while Haas is clearly a gifted prospect with his big frame, increasingly effective serve and powerful, if somewhat mechanical, ground strokes, he remains prone to misjudgments under pressure. He also is prone to leg cramps, which he began experiencing after losing the third set yesterday.
"That was my first five-setter," Haas said.
His opponent had physical problems of his own. Before this tournament began, Rios's sponsor, Nike, provided him with a custom-made pair of shoes to match his clothing line. Unfortunately, the custom-made shoes left him with a badly irritated tendon on top of his right foot. He survived a five-setter in the second round against Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark and went back to his old footwear, but he could only practice briefly on Saturday and received treatment throughout the match yesterday. Afterward, he complained of numbness in his lower right leg.
"He can't push off with his right foot on his serve," his coach, Larry Stefanki, said. "The good news is he toughed something out."
Rios, one of the most gifted shot makers on tour, has a reputation for folding when adversity strikes, but he has now won seven five-set matches in a row. Germany could use him. Instead, it will have to rely on Haas and a five-player development team sponsored by Mercedes and coached, in part, by Becker.

HEADLINE: California Draws Newspaper Chains Eager to Cluster

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: MONTEREY, Calif.

 BODY:
Stroll down the sunny side of Alvarado Street in this old seaside city until you reach Bonifacio Plaza and you will all but bump into the competitive reality of today's newspaper business: a miniature Stonehenge of sidewalk news boxes selling eight different daily papers.
Each of the papers -- including three published from the East Coast -- are vying for the attention of readers in the prosperous San Francisco region. 
 And yes, the only local paper, The Monterey County Herald, which has a weekday circulation of 36,000, still sells more copies here than any of the others. But like local papers in many big states, The Herald is feeling rising pressure from bigger papers with statewide or national ambitions.
Now, though, The Herald may be in a better position to fight back. On Aug. 24, the paper became part of the Knight-Ridder Inc. chain, which already owned six other dailies in the Bay Area.
It is the latest example of an expanding trend that newspaper industry executives call clustering. The concept is playing out in various markets, including New Jersey, where the Gannett Company earlier this month acquired the 156,500-circulation Asbury Park Press and the 86,000-circulation Home News and Tribune of East Brunswick. The deals raised Gannett's presence in the state to five papers with a total circulation of 553,000.
By assembling collections of dailies within a region, called clusters, newspaper chains can achieve savings on administration, production and distribution costs. Most importantly, they can also strengthen their defenses against competition by offering special cluster-wide advertising deals to big advertisers.
The affluent San Francisco region has become a particularly popular place to cluster, as Knight-Ridder's recent deal demonstrates.
Knight-Ridder already owned The San Jose Mercury News (daily circulation, 290,000) in Silicon Valley, north of here. And in October 1995, it acquired five daily newspapers in Contra Costa County, east of San Francisco Bay, that now offer clustered advertising deals for major retailers and in classified ads for the East Bay area.
Knight-Ridder, though, has stressed only its expectation of growth for its new California papers, and has not yet suggested that The Herald might begin to cooperate with its other properties in the area.
Just the same, the Herald acquisition now gives Knight-Ridder a reach farther south in the region. Monterey is about 90 miles south of San Francisco, and about 50 miles south of San Jose.
"It enlarges the footprint," said John Morton, a newspaper analyst and head of Morton Research Inc.
Clustering lets a handful of smaller regional papers act like one big-city daily, said William Dean Singleton, president and chief executive of the Media News Group, a pioneer in the practice -- and with a big presence itself in the San Francisco area.
"If you're one 40,000-circulation regional daily, it's pretty hard to get the big advertisers to take you seriously," Mr. Singleton said. "But if you can sell space in five 40,000 regionals, then the advertisers start to treat you like a 200,000-circulation metropolitan paper."
It was precisely such thinking that prompted E. W. Scripps to make its recent swap with Knight-Ridder. In exchange for the Monterey paper and The Telegraph-Tribune in San Luis Obispo, down the California coast about 180 miles north of Los Angeles, Scripps received The Boulder Daily Camera in Colorado.
The Scripps flagship newspaper, The Rocky Mountain News in Denver, is close enough to the chain's new Boulder paper to offer both the operating efficiencies and advertiser incentives that should greatly strengthen Scripps's hand in its fight for survival with its archrival in Denver -- which happens to be Mr. Singleton's Denver Post.
Mr. Singleton, meanwhile, is competing for ad dollars in the Bay Area with the Knight-Ridder papers, as well as the region's biggest daily, The San Francisco Chronicle, which has a weekday circulation of 500,000.
In Oakland and Alameda Counties, Mr. Singleton controls the four papers jointly produced by the East Bay Alameda Newspapers Group; they have a total circulation of nearly 200,000. The Alameda group's fifth and newest member, The San Mateo County Times (37,000 daily circulation) is just to the south, on the neck of the San Francisco Peninsula.
However attractive clustered ownership may be for management, changes in ownership can present a rough ride for newspaper employees, as the staff of The Monterey County Herald found out. A few days after announcing Knight-Ridder's deal with Scripps in late July, P. Anthony Ridder, the company's chairman and chief executive, visited The Herald and said that the new owners planned to invoke a condition of the Federal law governing asset swaps and set aside all union contracts at the paper.
This is the first time Knight-Ridder has adopted the tactic, but the wholesale dismissal and re-hiring of staffs is a legal -- though seldom used -- way for new owners in various industries to sweep away union contracts.
The law's provision enabled Knight-Ridder to dismiss the entire Herald staff of 235 full- and part-time employees. All were then invited to reapply for their jobs at their same base pay -- but without the fringe benefits, night differentials and job security of their existing contracts.
Mr. Ridder said that the labor contract was "not suitable" but that the new owners would recognize the union and commence bargaining at some point. The paper's staff, represented by three unions, promptly took strike votes and authorized walkouts if the company failed to treat the workers "fairly."
"I can't see that any company would benefit from demoralizing 200 people like this," said Bonnie Gartshore, who has worked at The Herald off and on for 30 years as an editor and columnist.
"I assume they have consulted psychologists and know what they are doing," Ms. Gartshore said. "But it just baffles me what good it can do to the company to treat people this way."
The company said that The Herald's contract was simply too lush.
"The working terms and salaries are out of line with the size of the market and the size of the newspaper," said Lee Ann Schlatter, a spokeswoman for Knight-Ridder. "They are much more in line with a newspaper in a major market."
Through the years there has been little turnover among the reporters and editors, pressmen and circulation workers at The Herald, because people tend to stay put in Monterey, satisfied that they already live in paradise, tucked between the crescent of ocean bay and the tawny hills of the Coast Range mountains. So news of the mass dismissals was particularly jarring to the staff -- and dismaying to many townspeople who consider the paper a central institution of the community.
"I think the thing that's distressing to me was this meat-cleaver approach," said Dan Albert, the city's Mayor.
Mr. Albert, already aware that Knight-Ridder has not yet quite shaken off the effects of an acrid, sometimes violent strike at its Detroit paper, The Free Press, said he wondered if Monterey should start worrying, too.
"I have to ask, what is going to happen with that kind of disruption?" he asked. "Are there going to be labor problems here? Are people's lives going to be disrupted? It just doesn't seem right to me."
The Mayor expressed puzzlement that no one from Knight-Ridder had called to introduce themselves and discuss the labor and economic impact of such sweeping change at the Monterey Peninsula's sixth-largest commercial employer.
Mindi Keirnan, a corporate vice president at Knight-Ridder who is supervising the transition at The Herald, did not respond to a request for an interview. But on Aug. 21, Knight-Ridder took out a full-page ad in the paper over the signature of Patricia T. Keil, who will be the new publisher of The Herald, to try to explain things.
"This is not exactly the way I wanted to start my new job," Ms. Keil began. Farther down she wrote, "Undeniably, the transition process here is painful, but it is something we must get through in order to move forward."
In a radio interview that same day, Ms. Kiernan and Ms. Keil said that Knight-Ridder wanted more flexibility to hire part-timers or stringers, instead of using staff reporters for every story, and to change work assignments when the need arose.
Eventually, Knight-Ridder rehired 90 percent of the Herald employees who reapplied for their jobs; however, 24 did not do so.
Those rehired, as Ms. Gartshore was, were taken back at their base pay, which averages about $42,000 for a reporter with more than six years' tenure.
Non-Herald people would start at lower scales, the company has told its employees.
Knight-Ridder has made no statements about the future relationship between The Herald and its new cousin, The San Jose Mercury News. But other chains have learned to tread lightly when they try to link papers under common ownership.
Mr. Singleton recalled, for example, that when he began forming the Alameda Group in the early 1990's, he had his papers share editors and even entire news pages as a money-saving move. But after readers quickly came to suspect that they were not getting their own, locally tailored paper and responded angrily, the publications cut back, sharing only special sections and features.
Still, the lesson was not perfectly learned. There was another backlash two years ago when The San Mateo County Times, on the West Bay, joined the Alameda Group, and its readers rebelled against the group's East Bay point of view.
"We started losing readers, so we had some focus groups to find out why," Mr. Singleton said. "We found out they thought we were giving them an East Bay paper with coverage of the Oakland Raiders and the Oakland A's. Their focus was on the 49ers and the Giants."

HEADLINE: Only Employment For Many in Europe Is Part-Time Work

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Tabienne Rogard just started a job as an executive secretary at one of France's biggest food companies. But she is not excited: This will be her 10th job in four years, and she already knows she will be looking for work again in six months.
"I used to think that if I was very good and very involved, that I could stay with the company," said Ms. Rogard, who is 32 and a single mother. "But no. There is no possibility. With this job, I am replacing a woman who is having a baby. When she comes back, I leave." 
 Ms. Rogard is at the center of a broad shift in the way Europeans work: the rapid decline of the traditional full-time job. Temporary jobs, part-time work and other forms of nontraditional employment -- long anathema to European unions and governments -- have become by far the most important source of new jobs across the Continent.
Indeed, although the recent United Parcel Service strike focused attention on the use of part-timers in the United States, the global trend is quite different. The proportion of part-time workers in the United States has been steady at about 18 percent for more than a decade. But the proportion is higher in many European countries and is growing quickly. And the number of temporary workers -- people who may work a full week but move from company to company -- is soaring.
In France, the national job-placement agency reports that 66 percent of its postings are for temporary contracts that last less than a year. In Spain, more than 90 percent of all new jobs go to workers with temporary contracts, and only a small percentage of those turn into permanent positions. In the Netherlands, 37 percent of all workers are part-timers.
That is a tremendous shift from 10 years ago, not just in numbers but in cultural taboos. For years, European governments prided themselves on enforcing strong job-protection rules, making it extremely difficult for companies to lay off workers the way United States companies did. Temporary job agencies were scorned in many countries and illegal in some.
Now, with unemployment running more than twice as high in Europe as it is in the United States, many governments and unions are encouraging alternatives to traditional work. Companies have jumped at the new opportunities, creating few new permanent jobs and plugging gaps with temporary workers or part-timers as much as possible.
Executives say the biggest force driving this is the rigidity of standard workplace rules, which make it almost impossible to lay off workers when business slumps. Temporary workers typically receive benefits and pay comparable to those of full-time workers, but they do not have the job security. Part-time workers tend to be paid less and receive fewer benefits.
"We have to accept the fact that this is the byproduct of inflexibility," said Jean-Pierre Rodier, chairman of Pechiney S.A., an aluminum and packaging company in Paris that went through a painful revamping several years ago and now uses temporary workers for about 5 percent of its jobs. "We need a reasonable amount of flexibility."
The trend is immediately apparent at the Place de la Defense, a huge office and shopping complex on the edge of Paris. Three temporary agencies are within a few doors of one another, among them the American firms Kelly Services Inc. and Manpower Inc. Manpower, the world's biggest temporary staffing company, operates more than 650 offices in France and generates almost as much revenue in this country -- $2.7 billion a year -- as it does in the United States.
"The perception is that Europe is changing very slowly," said John Chait, executive vice president in charge of Manpower's international operations. "But the market is changing faster than the laws are. Things are changing faster on the street than most people realize. It is true in France. It is true in Spain. It is true in Italy."
But the solution has also led to a two-tier economy in many countries: older workers who effectively have lifetime jobs, and younger workers who trek to new jobs at least once a year, whether they like it or not.
The broad trend away from permanent jobs plays out differently in different countries, depending on national laws. In Spain and France, companies have shifted overwhelmingly to hiring temporary workers. About 11 percent of all jobs in France, and more than 33 percent of those in Spain, are now filled by temporary workers, according to data compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a research institute in Paris. Though statistical comparisons are dangerous, because countries define temporary work differently, Washington estimates that only 2.2 percent of American workers are in temporary jobs.
In other parts of Europe, companies have greatly increased their use of part-time workers. The undisputed leader is the Netherlands, which has attracted enormous attention in recent years as a possible model for promoting workplace flexibility in the rest of Europe. The Government and Dutch unions have actively encouraged part-time work -- with benefits comparable to those of full-time workers -- and the proportion has skyrocketed from 21 percent in 1983 to 37 percent in 1996. The overwhelming majority of part-time Dutch workers are women.
To the envy of neighbors like Germany, where unemployment continues at nearly record levels, the Netherlands now boasts one of the lowest jobless rates in Europe, about 6.5 percent. Government officials say the rise of part-time work is only one of many reasons for the success, but the contrast is nevertheless stark. Part-timers also make up more than one-fifth of the work force in Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Denmark.
But Europe's entrenched system of rigid work rules is cracking in other ways, even if laws have not been relaxed. In Germany, where Government regulations heavily discourage temporary workers, companies are filling hundreds of thousands of jobs with people listed as self-employed contractors.
Consider Artur Niessen, a 32-year-old truck driver in Frankfurt who has been working for a beverage company under three separate temporary contracts. The company now wants to convert all its drivers into independent contractors and persuade them to buy their trucks. But the company will not guarantee the drivers a fixed volume of work, and Mr. Niessen is worried about being saddled with a truck he cannot afford.
That case is hardly unique. A study last year by the Nuremberg Institute for Labor Market Research concluded that 430,000 workers who were officially self-employed were actually company employees without the standard social benefits or job guarantees.
Many temporary and part-time workers say they prefer their jobs to full-time permanent positions. "What I want to do is work for several companies, so I can learn about several fields," said Pedro Rodriguez, a 27-year-old electrical engineer in Madrid who has worked under a series of temporary contracts at a company that makes air-conditioning equipment.
Still, temporary workers became so numerous in Spain over the last several years that unions waged a major campaign to rein in their use. Spain, which once had some of the toughest job-security laws in Europe, relaxed its rules three years ago to let companies hire apprentices for as long as several years. By 1996, virtually all new jobs in Spain were temporary, according to the O.E.C.D. More than one-third of all workers were temporary -- an astronomical percentage, even in comparison with France.
Last spring, unions and employers hammered out a new agreement that requires companies to keep apprentices for at least two years. In exchange, the agreement makes it easier for employers to justify layoffs of full-time workers in court and somewhat reduces the size of mandatory severance payments. Union officials say the agreement, which was also codified into law, tripled the number of long-term contracts given to workers in July.
"Very strong, very interesting," remarked Antonio Gonzales, lead negotiator for the General Workers Union.
But John Martin, a top labor economist at the O.E.C.D., said the only real solution to the jobless crisis in many European countries was to begin loosening the entire structure of workplace regulations.
While some countries have made it easier to hire temporary workers, the preservation of rigid job protection laws for those with permanent jobs heightens the pressure on those who have lost their jobs or are just finishing school and looking for their first jobs.
"What the changes have done is to give a certain amount of flexibility to employers while maintaining a high degree of job protection for those who have permanent jobs," Mr. Martin said. "That kind of two-tier solution may be satisfactory from the point of view of the protected employees and from the point of view of the employers, but it does not improve the chances for unemployed people to find stable employment."

HEADLINE: On Ancient Terraced Hills, Urbanism Sprouted With Crops

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
IN the high country of Yemen, long before the reign of the legendary Queen of Sheba, farmers terraced hillsides and prospered with crops of barley, wheat and sorghum. They produced tools and weapons from obsidian, the glassy rock found in the slopes. They also settled in walled villages, perhaps the earliest experience in urbanism in all the Arabian peninsula.
Archeologists from the University of Chicago have uncovered ruins of two such towns on a 6,500-foot-high plateau about 50 miles south of Sana, the capital of Yemen. Preliminary excavations indicate that the towns were built more than 4,000 years ago, several hundred years before the frankincense trade in the region that scholars previously thought stimulated development of the first Arabian towns. 
 "Urbanism did not take off here because of the frankincense trade," Dr. Tony J. Wilkinson, an archeologist at the university's Oriental Institute, said in an interview. "It began much earlier and apparently was supported by advances in agricultural engineering."
In expeditions over the last three years, led by Dr. Wilkinson and Dr. McGuire Gibson, also of the Oriental Institute, archeologists found the stones, sediments and other traces of ancient terraces that enabled farmers to cultivate the steep slopes and prevent erosion.
People still practice terrace farming in Yemen, but the oldest agricultural terraces, which have fallen into disrepair, probably date to 3000 B.C., making them among the oldest in the world. Other early terrace farmers were the Chinese and other cultures in the Middle East.
The region was presumably less arid at the time, the archeologists said, but the people there also enhanced farming conditions by erecting a system of dams in the mountain valleys. Using finely cut volcanic rock, the people built low dams to collect rainwater and direct it toward fields and high dams to contain and deflect flood water. The archeologists said they found evidence of sluices adjacent to the dams and in some cases, channels carved through bedrock.
"The builders of the dams had a precise understanding not only of dam construction, but also of the whole watershed system that fed the dams," Dr. Wilkinson said. "They were able to construct just the right size dam for each particular area."
While studying the ancient dams and terraces, the Chicago team came upon several dozen sites of settlement ruins, a few of which appeared to be large enough to have been towns. The archeologists have excavated two of them: Hamat al-Qa, which flourished between 2250 B.C. and 1500 B.C., and al-Sibal, which dates between 2500 B.C. and 1700 B.C.
Dr. Wilkinson, Dr. Gibson and Dr. Christopher Edens of Harvard University describe the archeology of the two towns and other remains in the current issue of the journal Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy. "Present evidence," they wrote, "suggests that there occurred a fairly abrupt development of settlements in probably the third millennium B.C."
The two excavated towns, they reported, covered an area of 10 to 12 acres each and were characterized by "dense architecture," indicating fairly large populations and some degree of social complexity. They traced the outlines of rectangular buildings of large stone blocks that were separated by streets and open spaces. They also found ruins of a defensive wall around the settlements and gates. No large public buildings like temples or palaces have been uncovered.
The style of pottery at the towns and the absence of any trade goods from faraway led the archeologists to conclude that this ancient culture was local, with no apparent economic links to the rest of the Middle East either by sea or caravans across the desert. Although sorghum is normally considered an African crop, traces of it in the terrace fields do not necessarily reflect significant contacts at that time between Africans and the hill people of Yemen.
Many of the later towns in Yemen had contacts far and wide. They sprang up on the fringes of the Arabian desert, near the trees that were the major source of the aromatic resin for the frankincense so prized in ancient times. Camel caravans fanned out from these towns, bearing incense to cities in Mesopotamia and around the Mediterranean.
The height of the frankincense trade between southern Arabia and the Mediterranean was in the first millennium B.C., which happens to be the time that King Solomon of Israel was supposed to be having dealings with the Queen of Sheba. That part of Yemeni history is "very shadowy," Dr. Gibson said. There were queens of Sheba, or Saba, a region that is part of Yemen today, but the ones for whom there is firm documentary evidence lived later in the first millennium B.C.
In 1992, explorers and archeologists reported finding in Oman the buried ruins of one of the earliest of the caravan cities. They tentatively identified the site with the fabled lost city of Ubar, which T. E. Lawrence called "the Atlantis of the sands." Some artifacts uncovered there indicated that the ruins were some 4,000 years old, making them the oldest known settlements in southern Arabia before the older towns in Yemen came to light.
When Ubar was just beginning to trade in incense, farmers miles away on the more verdant plateau to the southwest in Yemen were tilling their terraces in virtual isolation.

HEADLINE: Now at a Theater Near You: That Disappointing Season

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Sept. 1

 BODY:
The summer ended on a melancholy note in Hollywood, which was far better than what was predicted.
Before the summer began, producers, agents and studio executives predicted a blood bath, the most commonly used term, because of the record number of films costing more than $100 million that were being rolled out week after week in June and July. Well, the blood bath did not take place. But the Hollywood landscape still has its pockets of devastation. 
 Warner Brothers, Hollywood's strongest studio over the last decade though now in the midst of turmoil, had a terrible summer. The studio's highly expensive comedy "Father's Day," starring Robin William and Billy Crystal, which may have cost at least $90 million, grossed about $28 million, one of the major failures of the summer. "Batman and Robin," the fourth in the series, was a significant disappointment, although the film may perform better overseas. "Conspiracy Theory," a thriller starring Mel Gibson and Julia Roberts, was even more disappointing than the Batman film. A smaller movie, "187," an urban drama, also failed. Only Robert Zemeckis's "Contact," starring Jody Foster as an astronomer who receives an extraterrestrial radio signal, seems to be a modest success for the studio.
The biggest mishap of the summer was at 20th Century Fox: "Speed 2: Cruise Control," the sequel to "Speed." The action film has grossed about $50 million. Its cost was probably triple that figure. William Mechanic, chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, said with a sigh, "It's the luck of the draw." He added that "Speed 2" would probably perform well overseas.
Asked about the lessons of the summer, Mr. Mechanic said: "Nobody learns. You've got to make movies that are different, you've got to make movies that speak more to the audience than those big effects-driven films. The common complaint is that too many movies aren't about anything. Some of them are fun rides, but I don't think that's enough anymore."
Fox's biggest success, and one of the hits of the summer, is the poignant British comedy "The Full Monty," which is the kind of film that most studios claim to want but rarely seem to find. The movie, which cost less than $3 million, is about some men left unemployed by the closing of steel mills in Sheffield, England. Though most of them have only ordinary physiques, they decide to perform a striptease act in a club for women. The film, which is slowly expanding around the country, has played to virtual sellout crowds in New York City and Los Angeles.
"It's timing and luck: those elusive sisters have aided us," said Lindsay Law, president of Fox Searchlight, the studio division that made the movie. "It's been a summer watching movies that aren't about real people. And at the end of the day, this is a reminder to all of us that what audiences respond to is truthful storytelling about people whom we recognize and who behave normally." Mr. Law's comments were echoed by other Hollywood executives.
The total value of summer movie ticket sales was down only narrowly, no more than 1 percent, from last summer's record of $2.38 billion, according to the Exhibitor Relations Company, which monitors the box office. But since movie tickets are more expensive this summer, the figures indicate a drop in attendance.
"The biggest audience is now over 25," Sherry Lansing, chairwoman and chief executive of the Paramount Motion Picture Group. She said a maturing audience "wants movies with people you care about and not just explosions and special effects."
"I think we've blown up everything we can blow up," she said.
No single theme seemed to link the summer's biggest successes. The top film of the summer was Sony's "Men in Black," a science-fiction comedy projected to gross about $240 million, that was loosely based on a comic book whose hip characters had never been seen before on film. The second-highest-grossing film of the summer, the sequel "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" (Universal), which is set to rake in about $230 million, was, to some degree, a triumph of the director Steven Spielberg's appeal; it dropped off sharply at the box office after its first weekend.
The third was Sony's "Air Force One," an action-drama directed by Wolfgang Peterson and starring Harrison Ford as a President whose plane is hijacked; it will probably reach box office revenue of $175 million. The star power of Mr. Ford in this role, the nonstop action and the patriotic theme contributed to its big success.
The two unexpected studio hits were "My Best Friend's Wedding" (Sony), a romantic comedy in which Julia Roberts plays a woman who wants to sabotage the wedding of her friend, played by Dermot Mulroney, and "George of the Jungle," a Disney family film based on Jay Ward's late-1960's television cartoon. Shrewdly, Disney sold the film not simply for families but to teen-agers, mostly girls, who showed up to see its star, Brendan Fraser, half naked. The film is expected to gross more than $100 million.
"We got lucky," said Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios. "We struck a nostalgic vein for parents, who knew the old cartoon show and the song from it. And kids picked up on it very quickly. It was good clean fun and a little bit outrageous."
Mr. Roth said that if Hollywood has learned anything from the summer it is that too many movies appealing to teen-age boys, coming out one after the other in the early summer, hurt one another in the marketplace.
"Next summer," he said, "you're seeing more diversity, more coherence. You're not going to see the congestion of young men's movies."
If June and July saw a flood of action films, the last few weeks were marked by the proliferation of mid-level movies that sought to reach more grown-up audiences. One of them, "Cop Land" (Miramax), a gritty police drama written and directed by James Mangold with a cast that included Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel, was given lavish media attention because one of the stars, Sylvester Stallone, played a pudgy, sad-sack New Jersey sheriff, not the kind of musclebound action hero that turned him into a top moneymaker.
In recent years, though, Mr. Stallone's career, at least in the United States, has stumbled. The film, which earned mixed reviews, has grossed about $35 million. It is too early to say whether it will actually eke out a profit.
Similarly, "G.I. Jane" (Disney), the No. 1 film at the box office in the last weeks, marks an effort by its star, Demi Moore, to turn her career around after a series of failures like "The Scarlet Letter" and "Striptease." The film has so far grossed about $26 million, which is less than its cost to produce and promote. Its profitability remains uncertain.
In the meantime, several smaller films opening recently have proved to be big disappointments, including "Mimic" (Miramax), "Event Horizon" (Paramount), "Excess Baggage" (Sony), "A Smile Like Yours" (Paramount) and "Leave It to Beaver" (Universal).
In fact, the failure of "Leave It to Beaver," is the aftermath of other television-to-feature flops, like "Flipper" and "McHale's Navy," both from Universal. As Daily Variety tautly put it the other day, "Baby-boomer nostalgia seems to be on the way out."

HEADLINE: Trade Accords That Spread the Wealth

BYLINE: By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich, former Secretary of Labor, teaches social and economic policy at Brandeis. His most recent book is "Locked in the Cabinet."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
The contest at United Parcel Service may be over, but a much larger labor battle begins in just a few weeks when the Clinton Administration introduces a "fast track" bill to make it easier for the President to negotiate trade deals.
The White House needs such legislation in order to extend the North American Free Trade Agreement to Chile and the rest of Latin America, and to expand trade with Southeast Asia. Organized labor and (if you believe opinion polls) a large percentage of Americans on the bottom half of the income ladder don't want more trade with developing nations. 
 And here is the crux of the problem: more trade is good for the American economy over all, yet not necessarily for all Americans. Trade hasn't been the main cause of the widening gap between rich and poor during the past decade and a half, but surely it has played a role -- accounting for perhaps a quarter to a fifth of the nearly 20 percent increase in wage disparities between skilled and unskilled worker.
Trade on a far greater scale with poorer countries presumably will widen the gap still further. The only way to prevent such downward competitive pressure, say some opponents of fast track, is to condition such trade on a developing nation's willingness to raise its wages and working conditions to a level approximately as high as our own minimum standards.
Yet any such requirement would be protectionism in another guise. Most nations of Latin America and Southeast Asia cannot afford to meet our labor standards. Their economies aren't rich or productive enough. If global companies had to meet minimum United States standards in Latin America or Southeast Asia, they simply wouldn't build factories there.
What level of wages and working conditions should we expect developing nations to achieve? Is it any business of ours to begin with? These are moral as well as economic questions. It's unrealistic to expect that workers in poorer nations will receive American-style wages and working standards. But we can and should insist that as these nations become steadily wealthier, their bottom-rung workers do better. The benefits of trade and growth should be widely shared.
Our national interest does not lie in protecting American jobs from cheaper goods produced by lower-wage workers in developing nations. Yet the United States has a legitimate interest in spurring the creation of broad middle classes in these nations -- large enough to buy our export goods, strong enough to stabilize democratic institutions, confident enough to affirm our values about how human beings should be treated at work. To the extent that the benefits of economic growth in these countries are concentrated in narrow economic elites, while the ranks of the poor stay the same or even increase, these aims are thwarted.
In many developing nations, the record to date has not been encouraging. The widespread adoption of market reforms, including deregulation and more open trade, has boosted growth rates: Latin America as a whole is now growing at a rate of over 3 percent a year, up from 1.5 percent in 1988. In Southeast Asia, growth has soared during the past decade.
But too often, the gaps between rich and poor have widened, and middle classes have shrunk. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development reported last month that in almost all developing nations that have rapidly liberalized trade, inequality has increased as the wages of unskilled workers have dropped -- by 20 to 30 percent in some Latin-American countries.
Fast-track legislation should commit the United States to negotiate trade accords requiring developing nations to spread the benefits of economic growth. At the very least, we should insist that as their economies grow, their minimum wages should rise in tandem, workplace health and safety standards should become stricter, and the minimum age for child labor should increase.
These nations should establish credible means of independently monitoring and enforcing these rising standards, and their workers should be able to organize unions so that they have the bargaining leverage they need to press for continuing gains.
Such a principle of steadily increasing wages and working standards in proportion to a nation's capacity to afford them is consistent with new initiatives by global lending institutions.
Until very recently the International Monetary Fund focused almost exclusively on getting developing nations to deregulate and open their markets. But several weeks ago the fund extended a line of credit to Argentina on the condition that it give priority in public spending to improving health and education and reducing poverty. I.M.F. officials are now saying that long-term growth depends on more than open markets; it requires political stability and broad middle-class prosperity.
American manufacturers in developing nations should be guided by the same principle. Clothing and sneaker manufacturers with factories in Latin America and Southeast Asia face growing criticism for running "sweatshops." The companies claim they're just paying the going wages, even at pennies an hour, and doing what every other employer does there, like employing young teen-agers for long stretches at a time.
"The minimum standards have to be put in place by the governments involved," says Andrew Young, the former United Nations Ambassador, who was recently hired by Nike to inspect and report on its overseas plants.
 While we cannot expect American companies to give their third-world employees United States levels of wages and working conditions, we should expect something more from them than merely following accepted practices or meeting minimum legal requirements in these nations. American companies should exert leadership by being among the first to raise their workers' pay and to improve working conditions in line with productivity gains.
Third-party monitors should assure American consumers that our companies are setting the rising trend.
Ultimately, if America is to make a convincing case for sharing the fruits of growing prosperity within developing nations, it must dedicate itself to the same principle at home. The most advanced of all advanced nations is now enjoying its most buoyant economy in decades, but median incomes are scarcely rising, and a large fraction of the American work force has been losing ground. A backlash against trade is but one consequence of the top-heavy gains of economic growth here at home. Surely in this era of extraordinary prosperity, we, too, can afford to do better for all our people.

The Babies From Yemen: An Enduring Mystery

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Sept. 1

 BODY:
For a few days last week, two ordinary Israeli women became an extraordinary news media sensation.
Tzila Levine, the daughter of a Yemenite Jewish woman, had been put up for adoption as an infant without her mother's knowledge after they immigrated to Israel nearly 50 years ago. Last week Mrs. Levine traced and apparently found her biological parent, Margalit Umaysi. A DNA test confirmed their relationship with a certainty of 99.99 percent. 
 Their emotional reunion attracted wide attention because it nourished a persistent conspiracy theory that is part of an ethnic fault line running through Israeli society.
Those who believe the theory contend that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Yemenite babies who were reported to have died or to have disappeared after their parents came to Israel were actually kidnapped and given or sold for adoption to European-born Israelis and American Jews.
The controversy over the Israeli establishment's treatment of the 50,000 Yemenite Jewish immigrants, most of whom were airlifted to Israel in 1949 and 1950, has festered for years. It has stoked deep-seated feelings of resentment among the country's Sephardic Jews of Middle Eastern and North African origin.
A generation of young Israelis of Yemenite descent has demanded explanations for the disappearance of their lost brothers and sisters from crowded tent camps where the Yemenite Jews were housed when they arrived. Babies were often taken from their parents to be put in nurseries and hospitals, and their parents were often told that the babies had died or were simply no longer there.
"I am living proof that things like that happened," said Mrs. Levine, 49, as she sat with Mrs. Umaysi in her simple stucco home in Ramat Gan, a suburb of Tel Aviv. "It's an inexcusable act, and it's time to apologize and make restitution by uncovering it." Mrs. Levine was brought up by her adoptive parents on an Israeli kibbutz and now lives in Sacramento, Calif.
The circumstances of Mrs. Levine's adoption and even her link to Mrs. Umaysi remain unclear, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the fate of the Yemenite babies. Her adoptive parents, both of whom have died, told her she came to them from a clinic where a doctor had children available for adoption.
Last week, at a hearing of a Government commission inquiring into the treatment of the Yemenite infants, Mrs. Levine's adoption papers were produced by a lawyer for the commission. The papers indicate that the adoption procedures began in 1948, a year before the records say Mrs. Umaysi arrived in Israel. Mrs. Levine's lawyer asserted that the papers were forged. The commission suggested a second DNA test.
Ami Hovav, an investigator who served on two earlier official commissions that examined the fate of the Yemenite babies, said that out of 650 cases of babies reported missing by their parents, 80 have still not been solved. Records showed that the rest of the babies died, except for a few dozen who were put up for adoption when their parents could not be traced, he said.
Conditions in the tent camps were chaotic, Mr. Hovav said. Records were sloppy and communication with the immigrants was poor because of language difficulties, leading to frequent mix-ups when babies were transferred to and from nurseries and hospitals. Many of the infants died because they were suffering from diseases and malnutrition that developed during their families' trek through Yemen to a transit camp in Aden. Sometimes parents were not informed of a child's death.
At a time when the new state of Israel was still fighting skirmishes on its borders and facing severe economic difficulties, the mass immigration strained the country's resources, contributing to the disorganization, Mr. Hovav added. "There was negligence, but you have to understand the conditions that contributed to it," he said.
Dov Levitan of Bar-Ilan University, a leading authority on the Yemenite immigrants, cites similar statistics, adding that he has found no evidence of an organized conspiracy to spirit away Yemenite children for adoption. But there was a condescending attitude toward the new arrivals that led to carelessness in tracking down children and their parents, he said. The problem was compounded when successive Israeli Governments refused to order investigations, fearing damaging political fallout.
The two earlier inquiries about the Yemenite babies produced only limited findings. The latest commission was announced after a shootout in 1994 between a radical Yemenite group and the police that left one militant dead. The group, led by Uzi Meshulam, who is now serving an eight-year jail sentence, contends that more than 4,500 Yemenite babies were kidnapped for illegal adoption.
Other Yemenite Jewish advocates put the numbers at between 1,000 and more than 2,000. They assert that the European-born Ashkenazic Israeli establishment looked down at the new immigrants and their traditional ways and felt free to take their children for adoption by childless European Jewish couples, many of them Holocaust surivors.
Avner Farhi, an Israeli reporter of Yemenite descent who has been investigating the disappearances, contends that the children were deliberately separated from their parents and moved to nurseries or hospitals to pave the way for their adoption.
"There was a planned system to transfer children to adoption," said Mr. Farhi, whose sister was reported to have died in a tent camp. "Perfectly healthy children ended up with an adoptive family in Israel or abroad, and no one looked for their parents. It was criminal negligence."
Mr. Hovav disputed Mr. Farhi's arguments, asserting that many infants who seemed healthy to their parents were actually quite sick. And babies were kept in heated nursery buildings because the tents where their parents lived were exposed to the elements, he said.
Mr. Levitan agreed that there was a patronizing attitude toward the immgrants. In some cases the Yemenites' religious studies were restricted and their traditional side-curls were cut to remake them into modern, secular Israelis.
"The concept was absorption through modernization, by inculcating the values of Western society," Mr. Levitan said. "The parents were treated like primitive people who didn't know what was good for them, who aren't capable of taking care of their own kids. There was disregard for the parents, an unwillingness to make the effort to investigate, but not a conspiracy."
The disappearance of the children left a trail of grief that continues to haunt their parents nearly 50 years later. Several weeks ago, four families of missing children opened graves bearing their children's names, but found no remains, deepening the mystery.
"I was looking for her for 50 years, dreaming about her," said Mrs. Umaysi of her lost daughter. She had fed her one day at a hospital near her tent camp, and the next day the baby was gone, Mrs. Umaysi recalled. Mr. Hovav says the baby girl was mistakenly returned to a different tent camp and never traced to her mother.
Mrs. Levine, who knew she was adopted from the time she was 6, said that she began searching for her biological parents in the 1970's. Two years ago, she said, she saw Sampson Giat, the chairman of the Yemenite Jewish Federation of America, on a television program, and began corresponding with him about her case.
Earlier this month she arrived in Israel, and a picture of her as a child appeared in an Israeli newspaper. Families who got in touch with her Israeli lawyer were screened, and a DNA test was given to Mrs. Umaysi and Mrs. Levine by a Hebrew University geneticist. The results left them in no doubt that they are mother and daughter.
"The circle has closed," Mrs. Levine said. "I feel that I've won a war -- a lifelong war."

HEADLINE: Israel Eases Ban on Entry of Palestinian Workers

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Sept. 1

 BODY:
The Israeli Government today eased a ban on the entry of Palestinian workers into Israel, taking a first step to loosen a tight border closing imposed on the West Bank and Gaza Strip after a suicide bombing in Jerusalem in July.
The move came about a week before a planned visit here by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to help revive faltering peace efforts. American officials have criticized economic sanctions that Israel imposed after the bombing, especially a suspension of tax and customs payments to the Palestinian Authority. 
 Israeli officials discounted speculation that today's move was linked to Mrs. Albright's visit, asserting that they were guided by security considerations, as well as by a concern that worsening economic hardship was increasing support among Palestinians for violence against Israel. "It is not true that we are lifting the closure," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Israel Radio. "We are easing it gradually to the limit set by our security assessments, which are examined daily."
An Israeli Army statement said 4,000 married workers over 35 years old would be allowed back to work in Israel, half from the Gaza Strip and half from the West Bank. Most suicide bombers involved in attacks in Israel in the last two years have been single and younger than 35.
The number of renewed entry permits was small, although Israeli officials said it could grow over time if security conditions permitted.
Before the closing -- imposed after the bombing on July 30 that killed 15 people and the 2 attackers in a Jerusalem market -- more than 50,000 Palestinian workers were allowed into Israel, mostly for construction jobs and other manual labor. At least 30,000 more worked in Israel illegally, circumventing checkpoints to get to jobs.
During the month of border closings, the loss of income by workers and the freeze on tax and customs payments collected by Israel and ordinarily transferred to the Palestinian Authority have crippled the Palestinian economy.
The army said it would allow another 2,000 Palestinian businessmen over the age of 30 to enter Israel, bringing the total of such permits to 4,000, as well as 250 West Bank teachers who work in East Jerusalem and 200 employees of the Authority who need to move between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
But the suspension of tax and customs transfers remains in force.
"We don't feel that they are doing a thing on the infrastructure of terrorism," said David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to Mr. Netanyahu. "If we feel that they are doing something, we will release more funds. It depends on the actions of the other side."

HEADLINE: Door to Tolerance Opens Partway As Gay Life Is Emerging in China

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Sept. 1

 BODY:
On a side street not far from the waterfront, a small restaurant filled up one recent evening with customers, many of them gay. Some came to see a long-haired, cross-dressing singer perform, but more seemed happy just to find a place to relax and laugh.
Plainly dressed men in their 20's and 30's crowded around tables overloaded with plates of steamed fish and sauteed vegetables. A singer in a slinky black gown and curly shoulder-length hair stood on a chair to croon a love song, his protruding Adam's apple the only clue to his sex. Mixing his own suggestive lyrics with more conventional ones, the singer evoked hoots of laughter from the crowd, who thrilled to his irreverent humor. 
 "No one bothers about us anymore," said a 32-year-old man with a crew cut, sitting with a half-dozen friends at a corner table. "As long as we're not disturbing anyone else, we can enjoy ourselves and the police will leave us alone."
As official tolerance of gay men and lesbians quietly grows in China, they are taking their first steps toward openness, as the mere existence of this restaurant -- run by two openly gay managers -- testifies.
The last few years have brought a significant, if tentative, coming-out for gay men and women in urban China. Until recently, gay life in Communist China existed only behind closed doors, almost uniformly considered a social disgrace or a form of mental illness, sometimes treated with electric shock therapy.
Now, in cities all over the country, gay people gather and socialize in places openly known as gay hang-outs like restaurants, bars and public parks, largely unafraid of the kind of police roundups that were common only a few years ago.
Yet many gay men and lesbians, speaking on condition of anonymity, complain that they still face harsh discrimination, that Chinese society is still so closed that an overwhelming majority of them keep their sexual orientation secret from their families and co-workers.
"We all talk about it much more openly than before," said a 28-year-old fashion designer in Beijing. "I think most of my gay friends now accept it in themselves. But if you can't tell your family or colleagues, how open are you?"
There is no law against homosexuality in China. In the past, the police have often arrested people and charged them with hooliganism or disturbing public order simply for gathering in places where gay men were known to meet, although such incidents are gradually becoming less frequent.
Wan Yanhai, a former health official in China and now a visiting scholar at the University of Southern California, said that while life was gradually becoming easier for homosexuals, the authorities were still nervous about any sort of gay-related organization, as they are about any group -- religious, environmental, political -- that they could not fully control.
Mr. Wan helped set up and run an AIDS telephone line in Beijing in 1992, when the authorities also allowed several books about gay life to be published. But Mr. Wan was forced to close down the phone line a year later after he began speaking out about gay rights, and he was dismissed from his job at a public health institute the following year.
"The Government no longer has a problem with gays; it has a problem with political organizations," Mr. Wan said. "As long as you don't organize or speak out, you can do what you want."
A landmark case involved two lesbians who were arrested for living together in Anhui province in 1992. But after lengthy internal debate, the Ministry of Public Security ruled that there was nothing illegal about two people of the same sex living together.
Although lesbians say life is changing for them as fast as it is for gay men, they have fewer public gathering places.
"The pickup attitude that a lot of men have is less true for women," said a 29-year-old public relations executive in Beijing, who acknowledged that she was a lesbian. "We use more informal networks, going through friends."
One of the driving forces behind the growing openness, several scholars agreed, is China's economic growth and the increased communication and open-mindedness that have accompanied it.
"People are busy, they're making money and they don't care about your private life," said a sociologist in Beijing. "Before, people were idle and liked to tell you how to lead your life, but that's changed."
As with any touchy issue in China, official practice varies from city to city, and town to town. In many places, gay men and lesbians still face possible dismissal from work if their sexuality becomes known to their superiors. At the same time, a growing number of their colleagues may accept it.
"Everything is becoming much more open," said a manager at the restaurant with the cross-dressing singer. "Gay people themselves are starting to understand that the way they live is natural."
Yet he acknowledged that one reason his restaurant was so popular among gay people was that it was one of the few places where they feel completely comfortable.
"They go to work all week, pretending to be someone they are not," said the manager, whose white polo shirt had the word Golf emblazoned on his collar. "When they come here, they can let it all out and feel really open."
Shanghai's main public meeting place for gay men is just two blocks from the restaurant and directly across the street from a police station, a sign of how permissible such gatherings have become.
Hundreds of men gather there each evening, some holding hands as they wander along the tree-lined paths, while others chat as they congregate on low-lying benches. A murmur of conversation fills the summer air, relaxed and lively at the same time.
"You can do it, but you can't talk about it," said a 37-year-old man with short hair and a toothy smile. "At least I'm not afraid to come to a place like this and meet other people. That's progress."
The odd, halfway position many gay people now inhabit, this man said, was exemplified in the way he himself was quite eager to talk with a stranger about the situation they face in China, but would not tell his family or allow his name to be used.
"I think my parents wonder because I've never married," he continued. "But they still hope that I will change somehow. I know I won't."
A small but growing number of younger men are becoming fully open about being gay, telling their families and friends, and dressing more distinctively.
A 20-year-old singer in Shanghai who uses a single name, Coco, decided last year to become openly gay. Sporting several earrings and a nose ring, torso-hugging body shirts and frequent changes of hair color, Coco says it is now possible to live a psychologically healthy life as a gay man in China.
"There is no reason to hide it anymore," he said. "It's mostly about being honest with yourself. I've never been in trouble with the police. Why should I? I haven't done anything wrong."
Coco added that he was surprised how many of his heterosexual friends seemed even more accepting after he told them.
"They think I'm telling them a big secret, that I'm being unusually honest with them," he said. "That makes them closer friends. It's the opposite of what I expected."
Mr. Wan, the scholar, pointed out that such openness and self-awareness was greater in large cities like Shanghai and Beijing, which draw many gay men and lesbians from smaller cities and towns, where they often feel isolated.
"It can feel like being in jail," he said. "In a small place, you feel completely lonely and strange."
A common problem facing young gay men who migrate to large cities is that, unable to find other work, they sometimes turn to prostitution, becoming "money boys," as they are known here.
Homosexuality is still classified as a mental disorder by the Chinese Psychiatric Association, and psychologists typically regard the sexual orientation of gay patients as an illness than can be cured. In the past, some doctors have used electric shock therapy, although their claims of success have been challenged by other doctors.
Many gay men say they still wonder what is wrong with them.
"I think I'm missing a gland or something in my brain," said a 30-year-old hotel worker in Shanghai, who was looking for conversation in the park known as a gay hangout. "I read that in a newspaper -- that homosexuals are the same as everyone else except that we are missing some gland."
Back in the restaurant with the cross-dressing singer, one diner listening intently seemed to find more than the bawdy humor that other customers enjoyed. To him, the restaurant was not so much a sign of growing openness as evidence of how closed off to gay people most of China remains.
"You hear the pain in his voice?" the diner asked. "That builds up all week long before he can come here to let it out. This is the only place he can do it. Out there, it's not the same."

HEADLINE: 3 Centuries of South Carolina Tradition Woven Into Baskets

BYLINE: By PHILLIP SAYRE 

DATELINE: MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C.

 BODY:
Amid the zips of sports cars, the drones of pickups and roars of tractor-trailers, a stretch of four-lane highway through the lowlands of South Carolina has been turned into a marketplace.
Just 30 feet from the growling traffic along a six-mile stretch of U.S. 17 are dozens of stands, knocked together with 1-by-4's grayed by years of duty, where passers-by can find the fruits of a 300-year-old heritage of making sweetgrass baskets. 
 Making the baskets is a way of life that has been passed from generation to generation here in this town of some 40,000 people, where baskets have been woven with spoon handles since slaves from West Africa brought the craft with them more than 300 years ago.
One vendor, Yvonne Firby, 41, said she had been taught by her mother and grandmother when she was 5 years old. "They gave me a doll baby and spoon handle and they said, 'There you go,' " Ms. Firby said.
Another basket maker, Livinia Nelson, 76, who has a stand to one side of her yard along the southbound lanes, said she learned the craft from her mother and has been making baskets all her life. Mrs. Nelson added that she had passed the skill to four daughters, a daughter-in-law and four grandchildren.
The baskets were the everyday containers of the rice plantations that were the economic foundation of the South Carolina Lowcountry from the last decades of the 17th century until the end of slavery. In those days, the work baskets and the "fanners" -- round, nearly flat baskets two feet or more in diameter used for winnowing rice -- were made from heavier materials, usually bulrushes, the marsh grass that the Bible says was used to make the basket that held the baby Moses.
Other baskets for home use were made with sweetgrass, so named for its pleasant odor. The baskets are also known as coil baskets because they are made by knotting a small bundle of grass fibers and sewing them together with strips of palmetto palm leaf that are forced through the coil using a spoon handle.
From the knot, the basket is a continuous coil that makes the basket tighter and stronger than most other types of baskets. Darker, contrasting rings are formed by weaving in dried needles of longleaf pine.
From this one method come fruit baskets, bread baskets, planters, magazine holders, waste baskets, small coin cups and the biggest of all, the Moses baskets able to hold a small child. It can take from about an hour to nearly three months to make a basket, depending on its size.
Some baskets are so beautiful that samples are in the permanent collections of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Smithsonian Institution, said Mary A. Jackson, the president of the Mount Pleasant Sweetgrass Basketmakers' Association.
The stands first went up in the 1930's, as the country lanes paralleling the coast were paved and turned into U.S. 17, the main north-south route before Interstate 95. The basket makers, almost without exception black women, found that they made more from these roadside stands than by selling to a middleman who peddled the baskets across the harbor in Charleston.
But as the highway has brought customers, it has brought change that has threatened the basket makers. A village of just 5,000 in 1965, Mount Pleasant has become one of the state's fastest-growing areas, adding 1,800 to 2,000 residents a year, Mayor Cheryll Woods-Flowers said. It has become a town of mostly upper-middle-class residents nestled against the Cooper River and Charleston Harbor. Minorities account for about 10 percent of the population.
There has been "a tug-of-war between developers and roadside stands," Ms. Woods-Flowers said. As stores and houses have been built along the road, some stands have been forced to move to allow access to businesses or houses. But she added, "Developers are not opposed to accommodating the stands because it is a special art form."
Mrs. Jackson is more pessimistic, and she said that because of development, "within 10 years you won't see basket stands out there anymore."
Development has also destroyed sweetgrass and restricted harvesters' access to the spiky dune grass.
But after years of pursuing sources as far away as Little St. Simons Island off the southern coast of Georgia, workers can now cultivate sweetgrass, said Bob Dufault of the Clemson University Coastal Research and Education Center in Charleston.
Mr. Dufault, a horticulturist, said: "I really got addicted to trying to grow the sweetgrass. Now we have figured out what we need to know."
While some basket makers sell their wares at the Old Slave Market in Charleston and a few work at attractions like Boone Hall Plantation, a historic restoration framed by 200 yards of live oaks, most stay camped beside the highway.
It is a part of their life that is hard to give up. "I know I couldn't live by it," Ms. Nelson said as a tractor-trailer heading north growled by on the other side of the road. "It's a hobby and I love it."

HEADLINE: As Tourism Rides Rails, New Barons Gain Clout

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SILVERTON, Colo.

 BODY:
Town officials might have thought they had the final word in June when they refused a request by the Durango and Silverton tourist railroad for the exclusive right to sell photographs of tourists standing in front of the line's antique locomotives.
But then, at the height of the tourist season, trains mysteriously started squealing to a halt four blocks short of the center of town here. 
 "If you are a little old lady, and the altitude is bothering you, that's a hike," said Jon Denious, editor of The Silverton Standard, a weekly that for 122 years has been chronicling life in this village at 9,318 feet.
Before long, the owner of the railroad, Richard Monteleone, zoomed into town from his home in Hollywood, Fla., met with town officials behind closed doors in late August and emerged with the photography monopoly.
"The railroad is pretty quick to point out, 'We bring 200,000 people to your town, and you should do what we say,' " Mr. Denious said.
Mr. Monteleone flew off almost immediately for a business trip to Europe -- and left his lawyers to contest a lawsuit filed by the United States Forest Service and other agencies seeking $750,000 in costs related to fighting a forest fire three years ago that was sparked by cinders from the railroad's steam locomotives.
Westerners have a long tradition of griping about railroad barons. But as Amtrak reduces passenger service in the West, the rail barons of the next century may well be the quirky titans of the tourist trains.
"Eastern rail interests want two Colorado tourist railroads," The Denver Post warned readers in a headline last year about the pending purchase of the Silverton line and another one in southern Colorado.
Throughout the country, tourist trains are soaring in popularity, said Steve Shoe, executive director of the Tourist Railway Association, an industry group.
"In the U.S., the number of trains has doubled over the last 20 years," Mr. Shoe said. "Nationwide, at least 14 tourist railroads are trying to get going by next year."
Colorado, with 11 tourist trains and trolleys, ranks third in the nation in tourist railroads, after Pennsylvania and California, Mr. Shoe said. The state's eight largest tourist trains last year carried about 800,000 passengers, five times as many as got on and off Amtrak trains in Denver.
The Ski Train, which for decades has carried skiers from Union Station in Denver to a city-owned resort, this year began summer service from Denver through Glenwood Canyon, Amtrak's last route in Colorado.
"People just loved it," said Jim Bain, the train's general manager. "Our last two trains were sold out."
In a sign of the times, the Union Pacific on Aug. 23 ended freight service over Tennessee Pass, the nation's highest rail pass. Almost immediately, three tourist-train operators bid for use of the 178 miles of track that will be abandoned there.
In a state where tourism is the second most important economic sector after manufacturing, and where visitors can choose among cog, funicular, narrow-gauge and standard-gauge rail lines, a train owner can make or break a small town.
"These small towns have always been at the mercy of the railroads," said Thomas J. Noel, a history professor at the University of Colorado. "Today, it's just like the rail barons of old. You have a private meeting with the town, and you tell them what to do."
In towns like Georgetown, Colo., and Chama, N.M., restaurants, hotels and gift shops plan their seasons around the operating schedules of railroads.
The Animas Fire Protection District here has been trying for three years to get the Durango and Silverton railroad to pay its $10,000 share of the 1994 firefighting bill.
"They just ignore us," Allen Clay, chief of the district, said of the railroad. "We have sent them the bill two or three times. They outweigh us. We're mostly volunteers. We can't afford to retain a lawyer for long."
But Amos Cordova, a vice president of the 125-year-old Durango and Silverton Narrow-Gauge Railroad here in Colorado's southwest corner, sums up the relationship differently.
"If the train weren't here," Mr. Cordova said, "Durango wouldn't exist."
And, he added, "the train is the only reason that Silverton exists."
In fact, Durango was founded by the railroad in 1880, and the train is incorporated in the city seal. In Silverton, a town of 500 people, the last of the mines that gave the town its name closed in 1991.
Chugging out of Durango on one of the train's pumpkin-colored gondola cars, it was easy to see on a recent August morning how this 45-mile route has become the region's lifeline. Rocking gently down a meadow, the train seemed to pass more signs than on the parallel stretch of Highway 550: riding stables, real estate brokers, rafting companies, trout fishing ponds, glider rides and an antique-car museum.
With so much commerce dependent on nearly a quarter of a million tourists drawn here by the train, criticism is sotto voce.
Along the line, some residents are angry at a Durango neighborhood group that has gingerly objected to the gray clouds of coal smoke billowing from four trains that roll in and out of town every summer day.
"My mother used to run a boarding house that was 10 feet from the line," said Gerald Swanson, a 65-year-old lifelong resident of Silverton who runs a hotel named after his mother, the Villa Dallavalle. "She just knew to get the laundry in from the line before the train came back. Back then, they realized that the train was their livelihood, getting the ore out, carrying the goods in."
A former Mayor, Mr. Swanson prefers the conciliatory approach.
"We've got to work together to survive up here," he said, estimating that the town collects 80 percent of its sales tax revenue in the summer tourist train season.

HEADLINE: Manhattan Endorsements

 BODY:
Primary elections will be held Tuesday, Sept. 9. This page will not endorse a mayoral candidate until the final vote in November. But many of the other races will be decided for practical purposes in next week's Democratic primaries. These are The Times's endorsements for some of the more competitive races in Manhattan.
 
Borough President
The two strongest candidates in this large field are City Councilwoman Virginia Fields of Harlem and Assemblywoman Deborah Glick of Greenwich Village. A longtime reformer, George Spitz, and John Clark Fager, a schools activist, are not close to winning. Antonio Pagan began his Council career with promise, but over the long haul he has shown himself unable to forge alliances or foster consensus. Adam Clayton Powell 4th, another Council member, is strong on the campaign trail but weak at delivering on the job. 
 Ms. Glick was the first openly gay member of the State Legislature, but she has proved to be far more than a one-issue politician. In a sea of mediocrity, she stands out as an effective and independent lawmaker. But back at home, she sometimes seems captive of a familiar New York mentality that meets any plan for change with endless reservations or calls for more public hearings. Ms. Glick voted against the important reform of the public school structure. She opposed the city's initiative to control porn shops and was for far too long an opponent of the much-needed Hudson River Park.
We prefer Ms. Fields, who is not as strong a legislator as Ms. Glick, but outstrips her as a consensus-builder. Ms. Fields has grown over her last four years in the Council. Community leaders praise her willingness to negotiate honestly and find common ground with her opponents. She has been helpful in the struggle to improve Harlem's faction-ridden school district. On the Council, she has worked hard on issues ranging from the Civilian Complaint Review Board to that bane of neighborhood life, delivery bicyclists on the sidewalk.
The borough president's office has been a job in search of a function since the City Charter revision. The title comes with a large staff, some discretionary funds for community projects and the power to appoint community boards and one member of the Board of Education. We hope Ms. Fields will keep her promise to use these tools to help improve the borough's schools, and that Ms. Glick continues her valuable work in Albany.
 
City Council
First District (Soho, Tribeca, Chinatown, Little Italy, Battery Park, parts of the Lower East Side and Greenwich Village): The theme of this diverse district is expanding residential areas at war with freewheeling business districts. The incumbent Council member, Kathryn Freed, has made more than her share of enemies in her fights with Soho sidewalk art venders, Chinatown fish merchants and produce warehousers. Her opponents, Marie Dormuth and Jennifer Lim, claim that Ms. Freed is overly confrontational. They may be right, but we do not believe either of them would be as successful in managing the needs and conflicting demands of these crowded, contentious neighborhoods. We support the re-election of Ms. Freed, on the basis of her hard work and commitment to her district.
Second District (Murray Hill, Gramercy Park, Lower East Side): The two women waging the most active campaigns in this district come from opposite political poles. Judy Rapfogel, chief of staff to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, is imbued with the traditional networking and favor-trading skills of New York politics. The district leader Margarita Lopez is much more of an advocate, with an intense commitment to the needs of the most vulnerable residents of her community. Albert Fabozzi, a former community board chairman who helped lead the fight to restore Tompkins Square Park, does not appear to have the organizational base to challenge the other candidates. Ms. Lopez, a social worker, is an openly gay Hispanic whose energy and dedication would be an asset to this largely low-income Spanish-speaking district. But Ms. Rapfogel seems a better bet to deliver improved services the area desperately needs. We endorse Ms. Rapfogel in the hope that she will help stabilize a district often plagued by political factionalism.
Eighth District (East Harlem, Manhattan Valley, part of Mott Haven in the South Bronx): The five-person race to succeed Adam Clayon Powell 4th includes Federico Colon, Mr. Powell's chief of staff, Jorge Vidro-Ortiz, the chief counsel to State Senator Olga Mendez, and Philip Reed, a community activist who has organized H.I.V. care networks and youth programs in some of the city's poorest neighborhoods. Any of these three men would represent the district well. The district leader Wilma Sena, a teacher, has a history of community involvement in East Harlem, but questions about her residence have clouded her candidacy. The fifth candidate, the entertainer Edwin Marcial, is running far behind. Mr. Colon and Mr. Vidro-Ortiz are good candidates. We were particularly impressed by Mr. Colon's interest in economic development. But we endorse Mr. Reed for his strong history of public service and good judgment.
Ninth District (Harlem, Morningside Heights, part of East Harlem and the Upper West Side): The seat being vacated by Virginia Fields has drawn another crowd of candidates who can point with pride to their records of community involvement. Mary Sweeting, a tenant activist, has been of particular service to her fellow residents of northern Harlem. William Allen has roots that go deep in the district, and I. Ronnie Holly has put years of effort into building up his neighborhood Democratic club. Virginia Montague has a good understanding of the district, drawn from her experience as Ms. Fields's former chief of staff. But the candidate who appears to be by far the best qualified is Bill Perkins, a district leader who works for the State Assembly's Education Committee. Mr. Perkins says his top priority will be turning around the troubled schools in District 5, and he speaks with both passion and intelligence about his hopes for improving education in Harlem. Mr. Perkins, who has held patronage jobs controlled by the Democratic organization for a long time, will have to fight to prove he can be an independent city official. But his strengths include a political veteran's sophistication about how to get things done in the city.
10th District (Washington Heights, Inwood, part of Marble Hill in the Bronx): This page places a high value on the re-election of Guillermo Linares. Mr. Linares's seat is threatened solely because he cast the deciding vote in favor of the deal to develop a Pathmark supermarket in East Harlem. Mr. Linares had to choose between pandering to a bloc of influential campaign donors who own local grocery stores or supporting a project that would bring jobs, cheaper food prices and economic growth to his district. Mr. Linares chose the people over the campaign contributors. His main opponent, Roberto Lizardo, will have plenty of chances for public office in the future. Francesca Castellanos, an energetic grass-roots candidate, also shows promise. But if Mr. Linares is thrown out of office as a result of his principled stand, it will send the worst possible message to other city officials.

HEADLINE: America's Bureaucracy Keeps Adoptions Down;
Racial Hurdles

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Deborah R. Wells (letter, Aug. 26) raises the specter of racism as a possible explanation for why "rich white couples" are adopting children from disparate cultures, not American black or Hispanic children "languishing in a foster environment." 
 Ms. Wells's generalization about the economic status of people who adopt children from other countries creates the image of wealthy Americans pillaging foreign cultures and snatching their children. It would be interesting to see the income data on which Ms. Wells based her judgment.
More egregiously, Ms. Wells seems to be blaming the victims. She is apparently unaware that in 1972 the National Association of Black Social Workers labeled transracial adoptions as "cultural genocide," and that most adoption agencies try to place children in families of similar racial backgrounds. Given these social and practical impediments to adoption of black children by white couples, her assertion that racist motives might be at play seems bizarre.

HEADLINE: Irradiated Food Is Too Pure for Our Own Good

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Richard Rhodes's ode to food irradiation ("Food Safety's Waiting Weapon," Op-Ed, Aug. 28) lacks balance. Yes, gamma rays can kill the harmful bacteria in food, but one big problem is that they kill the helpful microflora, too. Bacteria are not just agents of disease. The vast majority of live bacteria we ingest are positive aids to digestion, competing with unhealthy bacteria for space in our intestinal tracts. 
 Without live bacteria, our bodies could not produce vitamin B12 or break down milk sugars, for example. Americans already suffer from a paucity of fresh, raw foods containing the live bacteria we need.
Food and Drug Administration regulations that limit food irradiation to certain classes of foods are premised on the fact that to irradiate all food would cause a greater threat to health than sporadic outbreaks of food poisoning, which usually signal lapses in hygiene or good animal husbandry.
As Mr. Rhodes says, pasteurization saved lives. But only probably, for it also resulted in the dietary elimination of vital live organisms like lactobacillus acidophilus. We are now beginning to add such bacteria back into milk at increased cost. To do this for all foods would be impossible, technically and economically.
Mr. Rhodes is right to say that Americans have an irrational fear of radioactivity. But the horrors of the atomic bomb gave rise to an equal and opposite irrationality: uncritical belief in the redemptive potential of atomic energy. One need not be a Luddite to recognize the cult of nuclear idolatry.

HEADLINE: Some at Fed See a Test In New Data

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: JACKSON HOLE, Wyo., Aug. 30

 BODY:
Once again, the surprisingly robust economy is testing the limits of the Federal Reserve's pragmatic new approach to monetary policy.
Several Fed officials, interviewed Friday and Saturday during their annual meeting here with central bankers, government officials and economists from around the world, said that they were less confident that the economy was about to slow on its own. While they said it remained unclear whether the long-lasting expansion was finally pushing the economy into an inflationary danger zone, for now the economy should be considered guilty unless proved innocent. 
 The officials, however, gave no direct indication of whether they were more likely to raise interest rates when the Fed's policy-making body meets next on Sept. 30.
Some officials admitted that they had underestimated the economy's resiliency, especially in light of Thursday's figures showing that second-quarter growth was 3.6 percent, not the 2.2 percent originally estimated by the Commerce Department. And they suggested that they were now less inclined to assume that prices would continue to be stable.
Despite its reputation for waging an uncompromising war on inflation, the Fed has proved willing over the last year and a half to generally refrain from interest rate increases even as growth remained strong and unemployment was low and falling. It has done so because there have been no real signs of accelerating price increases.
During that period the Fed felt compelled to raise rates only once, on March 25, when it nudged its Federal funds target rate up by a quarter-point, to 5.5 percent. That action came at the end of a quarter in which the economy grew 4.9 percent, roughly twice what most economists consider a prudent rate.
Since then the Fed has left official rates unchanged at three policy meetings, in May, July and August, and the central bank's chairman, Alan Greenspan, has ruminated publicly about whether unrecorded improvements in productivity have helped to increase the economy's noninflationary growth capacity.
But with that big question still unresolved, Fed officials said they continued to examine the economy closely, looking for hints that the strong growth might be creating the conditions that lead to inflation. The concern is that labor markets may become so tight that wages are pushed up and demand so strong that it begins to outstrip the nation's capacity to produce goods and services without bottlenecks.
Fed officials said that they viewed the economy as subject to swirling crosscurrents that make it difficult to predict for the rest of the year. Much of the unexpectedly strong growth in the second quarter came from a buildup in inventories. The typical pattern after a rapid inventory buildup is for companies to cut orders while they work off their backlog of supplies, thereby slowing the economy.
But in this case, there were early signs that the economy retained sufficiently strong momentum that it could whittle down the inventories without any discernible slowdown, some officials said. In particular, the Commerce Department report on Friday that consumer spending rose eight-tenths of a percent in July, the biggest increase in six months, suggested that companies would have little trouble moving goods in coming months.
Still, the statistics indicated that consumers were financing their spending sprees in part by cutting back further on savings. And the Commerce Department said personal income grew only a tenth of a percent in July.
"The consumer is a real question," Susan M. Phillips, a Fed governor, said.
From the Fed's view, the best-case course of events, other officials said, would be an inventory-induced slowdown taking some steam out of the economy through the rest of this year and into next year. At that point other factors -- like the rise in the dollar, which dampens demand for American products abroad -- are likely to help keep growth at noninflationary levels. Fed officials emphasized that they did not seek slower growth for its own sake, but to help avoid the imbalances that lead to recession and to sustain the economic expansion that began six and a half years ago.
Given the economy's recent history of proving far stronger than predicted, officials said, they were having a much harder time waiting for a slowdown to materialize on its own. Before the latest data, most economists and investors had argued that the Fed would need to impose no more than a quarter-point interest rate increase, if that, between now and the end of the year. But a few economists said they were now beginning to think that growth would not slow at all in the third quarter and that falling unemployment could force the Fed to act sooner and more aggressively than expected.
Some Fed officials acknowledged a slight reluctance to act as aggressively as the central bank had in the past to strike at inflation long before it strangled the economy. In part, they said, that was because there was little evidence of even incipient inflation, and in part, it was because there would be such strong political opposition to slowing the economy at a time when it appeared to be in perfect balance.
But the minutes of the Fed's monetary policy meeting on July 1 -- the minutes of the August meeting will not be released until after the Sept. 30 meeting -- showed that even then the central bank appeared to be taking a slightly more hawkish stance toward inflation, despite its decision then and in August not to raise rates.
While welcoming the absence of actual inflation, the Fed minutes in July stated that "continuing pressures on resources associated with economic growth in line with the members' current forecasts could well be reflected in rising inflation over time."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: The Face of The Future In Japan;
Economic Threat Of Aging Populace

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 1

 BODY:
The year is 2025. The nation has twice as many old people as it has children; its economy is groaning under the weight of heavy taxes; its population is shrinking, and the Government's reserve of social security funds has run dry. 
 America in the next generation? Not exactly. For unless things change, this is the not-too-distant future of Japan, once the fastest-growing economy on the globe and now the world's most rapidly aging industrial society. With one person in six already older than 65, the challenge of how Japan will support its aging society grows more bedeviling with each passing year.
Not that the United States will be exempt from some of the same hardships. But Japan will be the world's guinea pig: No nation has ever had experience with such an elderly society and Japan is graying faster than the rest of the industrial world in North America and Europe. So how it faces the quandaries presented by a rapidly aging society is likely to serve as a model -- or a warning -- to other nations that will eventually undergo the same transformation.
The lessons from Japan so far are not encouraging, for it seems that the only way that Tokyo will be able to finance the nation's wrinkled future will be with significantly higher taxes and considerably smaller benefits.
"There is no golden egg," Atsushi Seike, an economics professor at Keio University, said. "So we have to get money from somewhere and that is only from the people or an increase in their productivity."
A declining birth rate and a graying society -- rather than exchange rates and trade surpluses -- are likely to be the key factors during the next several decades in shaping the economies of Japan and other rapidly aging industrial countries.
Unless policies change substantially, high payments will exhaust Japan's pension reserve fund sometime before the year 2025. By that time, the total social welfare burden -- much of it retirement and health care costs for the elderly -- could reach as high as 73 percent of national income, according to an official forecast. Taxpayers, of course, will have to pick up much of the swollen tab, and higher tax rates could lead to a flight of talent -- even among the famously loyal Japanese.
"Who's going to work?" asked Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. in Tokyo. "The most productive guys will go somewhere else."
A simulation analysis by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's advisory council forecast that unless the Government's finances are overhauled, the burden from social welfare and fiscal debt will balloon. For 2025, it projects an overall national debt of 153 percent of gross domestic product, compared with just 11.5 percent of the overall economic output in 1995.
As a result, the analysis concluded with perhaps a touch of typical Japanese alarmism, if the current system is not changed, the "economy will collapse."
"We don't have any concrete direction," Junichi Sakamoto, an official at the Health and Welfare Ministry, said. "But I think that many people think a cut in the benefits is inevitable."
The future strains on society are evident in the reaction of those unlucky workers, like Atsuto Hayahara, who have already suffered pension cuts for other reasons. A 55-year-old employee at Seishoku Kohyo, Mr. Hayahara saw his benefits cut when the pension fund at the troubled textile firm was bankrupted by the ailing economy and a stifling regulatory climate. Mr. Hayahara had been anticipating a lump-sum pension payment of 2.21 million yen -- or roughly $18,300 -- but that has been cut by more than half, to 880,000 yen, or $7,285.
"I'm just infuriated," Mr. Hayahara said. "I believed in the system, and look how it turned out. I've been betrayed.
"I wanted to do something good for my wife, who has had a harsh life, but now that the pension will be reduced, my dream has evaporated," he added. "We were putting in our own money. What we thought would be for our retired life has disappeared."
Japan's experience is relevant precisely because it is not unique, just ahead of its time. Many experts say that the United States and other countries face similarly difficult outlooks, as the populations born after World War II all begin to age at about the same time.
Still, America is aging more slowly than Japan, and -- at least for now -- its Social Security program is running decent surpluses. Elderly Americans will make up only 20 percent of the population in the year 2030; in Japan, they will account for 25 percent of the population by 2015.
By the year 2029, though, America's Social Security program could be technically bankrupt, too. Unless the Government restructures the system, argues Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economist who served for a while as President Ronald Reagan's chief economic adviser, it will become a "bad deal" for participants in the program who stand to receive less and less in benefits.
In some respects, Japan is better off than America. For starters, 55 percent of Japanese older than 65 still live with their children, compared with less than 20 percent in other industrialized countries. That means that even if pension checks do not come on time, someone will look after most of the elderly here.
The Japanese are also legendary savers, and worries about their future have already driven them to accumulate an average of 9.6 million yen, about $79,500, in savings for each man, woman and child.
But even this tendency to save may be in jeopardy. In general, most people save money in middle age and then spend it after retirement, so that an elderly population is expected to have a much lower savings rate.
For the rest of the world, that means that Japan may no longer be the source of excess savings that are channeled into investments abroad, helping to prop up foreign bond markets.
"The savings rate could be zero or negative by 2010," said Charles Horioka, an economist at Osaka University who has analyzed the savings habits of the elderly. "Japan will have less savings, less money to finance investment and the economy won't grow as fast."
In any case, since the United States and other countries are not far behind in their own aging process, Japan will be forging a plan from which others may learn.
That is, if it develops a plan. Many economists say that the Government has been slow to revamp the nation's archaic pension system, a pay-as-you-go arrangement like the United States' Social Security system and most others in the industrial world.
The Government pension system has generally tried to provide enough money to cover all of a retiree's daily expenses. Every Japanese worker is now required to join the national pension system, and some also join supplementary corporate plans. Most workers pay at least the basic fixed monthly amount, around 12,700 yen, or $105, into the national system regardless of how much they earn.
But many individuals, mainly the self-employed, are not making their contributions to the national pension system because they no longer trust it. Failure to contribute is technically illegal but quietly tolerated.
Japan's complex social security system embraces a network of public, corporate and individual pension plan with numerous quirks and peculiarities that have developed over the years.
As in Mr. Hayahara's case, many employees join company pension plans to supplement the national program, and the troubles of the economy since the stock market collapsed in the early 1990's have plunged numerous pension funds into bankruptcy. Interest rates are at rock bottom in Japan, with the benchmark overnight lending rate at half a percent. The conservatively managed pension funds have been able to get returns of only 2 percent to 3 percent, which could cut deeply into future payments.
In the meantime, pensioners are making out well, for many of them joined pension plans later in their working lives but collect full benefits now. The result is that young and middle-aged workers are effectively subsidizing the elderly.
"If we keep the structure of the present system unchanged, then there will be intergenerational inequities," Mr. Horioka said. "The younger are getting less than they paid, losing out to the older people who are making out like bandits."
Many company pensions do not have enough money in reserve to cover their future payouts comfortably, and collectively, publicly listed companies could be underfinanced by as much as 40 trillion yen, roughly $331 billion, according to estimates by Watson Wyatt, a pension consulting firm in Tokyo. Official statistics show that 53 percent of the nation's 1,873 pension funds are running deficits or just breaking even.
This year, even the Honda Motor Company, which is flush with profits, said that for the third consecutive year, it had set aside extra money, about 25 billion yen, or $207 million, to bolster its skimpy pension reserve. Honda may be well able to afford it, but for most companies, such moves come at the cost of missing important business opportunities.
"It's a big deal for corporations," Mr. Feldman of Salomon said. "You can't build capacity for expansion. If you normally make a hundred bucks and buy a machine to build your business, now you've got to put that into a pension fund."
So far, the Government's remedies, like the actions taken in Washington, amount to little more than tinkering. Starting in 2001, Tokyo plans to gradually push the age at which pensions begin to 65 from the current 60. The Government has also suggested that pension benefits will have to be cut by one-fifth.
Government projections show that by 2025 workers' monthly contributions at corporations will have to be raised to about 35 percent of the average salary from an average of 17 percent now. But many experts say that the Government's fiscal system must be overhauled along with the social security system.
"Japan's scheme will not bring success," Kiyoshi Murakami, a prominent pension specialist in Tokyo, said. "There must be fundamental change."
Any solution is likely to include proposals to extend the employment of the aged, cut benefits to the wealthy and rebalance the system's benefits and burdens among the different generations. For the first time, the Government is also considering shifting part of the pension system to the private sector, an idea that is also under discussion in the United States.
But these considerations have increased mistrust of the public system among the Japanese. In a recent survey, more than 70 percent of those polled said that their biggest worry about retirement was whether their Government pensions would continue. Like aging baby boomers in the United States, many individuals here are setting up their own retirement funds in what has become one of the fastest-growing areas in pension management.
"One housewife in her 20's or 30's said she couldn't count on the public pension in the future," said Junichi Nezu, who monitors a hotline on old-age financial matters at the Japan Institute of Life Insurance. "So she said, 'I would like to stop paying the premium for the public pension and solely invest in an individual pension.' "

HEADLINE: Driving Increases, as Do Gas Prices

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
With demand surging this summer, the price of gasoline at the pump just took one of its biggest monthly jumps ever. Even running their refineries full tilt, oil companies have barely kept up with the nation's drivers, who increasingly favor hefty, less efficient vehicles.
And the industry will pocket much of the cash from the higher prices, since the price of its raw material, crude oil, has remained fairly steady. 
 The jump in prices, which rose as much as 15 cents a gallon for regular unleaded fuel at some stations in the New York area, represents a confluence of several long-term trends, analysts say. These trends are likely to continue, though the end of summer driving is expected to bring some relief.
One trend is the popularity of sport utility vehicles, which burn more gasoline per mile and have become the staple of many households for vacations and commuting to work. On top of that, Americans have driven more this summer, some to escape rising air fares and others because a strong economy has given them the money to take more elaborate vacations.
"People feel they have the ability to take the vacation they want to take," said Mike Morrissey, a spokesman for the American Automobile Association, which predicted that Labor Day weekend travel would be at record levels.
The result has been an unexpectedly big rise in gasoline consumption, which in recent weeks has been running about 3 percent higher than around this time last year. The demand has caused the nation's refiners to operate at a record 99.4 percent of capacity.
"The industry is straining to keep up with demand," said Frederick P. Leuffer, an oil analyst for Bear, Stearns, who has concentrated on the trends in refining for the last several years.
The last time drivers experienced such a big run-up in prices was in the spring of 1996, when gasoline rose 18 cents a gallon, but that was spread over four months. At the time, the oil industry was accused of price gouging, but it could point to a surge in crude oil prices as justifying the increases at the pump.
In recent months, though, crude oil has remained in a range around $19 to $21 a barrel. In contrast, retail prices in Connecticut -- which just cut its gasoline tax -- have risen 11 cents a gallon.
According to the Energy Information Administration, a part of the Energy Department that keeps track of prices, the average nationwide cost of regular unleaded gas rose to roughly $1.24 a gallon on Aug. 25 from a little less than $1.18 a gallon on July 21. The increases have been greater in the Northeast. In New England, regular unleaded jumped to $1.33 from $1.22. In the Middle Atlantic states, which include New York and New Jersey, the average price rose to $1.29 from $1.20.
After years of overcapacity that kept refining margins thin and profit lower than now, the major producers and independent refiners are in a strong position to increase prices, analysts say. Frustrated for years by often-low profit from refining -- except in a crisis like the Persian Gulf war -- the industry has sought to bring capacity more in line with demand.
It has not built new refineries since the 1970's, but has invested billions of dollars to upgrade existing refineries to produce the cleaner-burning fuel now required. The big surpluses in refining capacity that in years past could be called on to meet spikes in demand have disappeared. In addition, many refiners, to cut costs, are keeping lower supplies on hand, and this has increased uncertainty.
"The balance between demand and supply has become fragile," Mr. Leuffer of Bear, Stearns said. "Anything can tip the scales. Any interruption of supply has an exaggerated impact on prices."
Thus when the Tosco Refining Company shut down parts of its Bayway refinery in Linden, N.J., for maintenance early in August, spot prices shot up in the futures markets as traders became nervous about supplies.
Victor J. Cino, president of the Pyramid Oil Company, which leases six stations in New Jersey, stressed in an interview in his office in Tenafly that the current price rise could not be attributed to costlier crude oil. Instead, he said, it showed what happens when strong demand pushes up against refineries' running at nearly full capacity.
"Bayway has this tremendous power," he said. "It's not something that Tosco sought to gain deliberately. It's something that has evolved, that the marketplace gave them."
Bill Strobel, an assistant manager at a Mobil station in Northvale, N.J., pointed to bills from a refinery that showed that the price he was charged had risen to $1.19 a gallon for unleaded regular gasoline last Thursday from $1.05 in mid-July. For retail customers, that translated to an increase to $1.28 from $1.15. The station is set among a string of gas stations along Route 303, all of which had similar increases.
"People want to know what's going on," he said.
None of the half-dozen customers interviewed while filling up expressed any anger at the oil industry. Nor have they cut back their driving, and few shop for a better price. Even at current levels, the price at the pump is about the same as it was last year, when strong demand and rising crude oil prices kept the price up for most of the summer.
Thus, there has not been the kind of outcry among elected officials and consumer advocates as there was in the spring of 1996, when rising prices became a political issue, leading to an investigation by the Energy Department. In an analysis issued in June 1996, the department found that the main culprit was the run-up in the price of crude oil.
On the East Coast, one alternative at times of peak demand has been to import gasoline, but the latest price spike came so quickly that European refiners, whose tankers take about 30 days to reach United States ports, could not have an impact.
Mr. Leuffer said, however, that European refiners had stepped up their shipments, and that this, combined with a seasonal downturn in driving, would tend to bring prices down.
"Relief for the consumer is on its way," he said.

HEADLINE: With Markets Closed in U.S., Dollar Is Mostly Flat in Europe

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: LONDON, Sept. 1

 BODY:
The dollar was relatively flat in overseas trading today, underpinned by a general weakness in the yen amid persisting concern about the health of the Japanese economy.
Profit taking kept the dollar below 121 yen, after it rose from its trading level late Friday in New York, but dealers said that bearish sentiment about the Japanese currency was likely to remain. 
 "The market has been wary of selling the yen too aggressively because of the perceived official resistance to a further sharp weakening beyond 120," said Paul Meggyesi, senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell here. "But so far," he added, "there has been no attempt to prevent, let alone reverse, the latest downdraft on the yen."
Late in London today, the dollar traded at 120.85 yen, up from 120.80 in New York on Friday. The dollar fetched 1.8045 German marks, down from 1.8095 on Friday.
Financial markets were closed in the United States for Labor Day.
Japanese retail sales for July, due for release Tuesday, are expected to show a drop of 3.5 percent, which would re-emphasize the lack of a rebound in domestic demand, analysts said. "The Japanese economic situation is not looking encouraging in the near term," said Neil MacKinnon of Citibank, "and investors feel encouraged to push the dollar up against the yen."
The faltering Japanese recovery has been further burdened by the prospect of a Southeast Asian slowdown. Currency and stock losses there, and a possibly resulting slowdown, could damage Japanese competitiveness. But some economists say the impact on Japanese trade will be limited in the near term.
The dollar traded in a narrow range against the mark today in Europe, with attention fixed on Tuesday's setting of the tender for weekly securities-repurchase agreements by the German central bank. This will be followed by a bank council meeting on Thursday.
Traders say both events seem likely to evoke nervousness on a German interest-rate rise, helping the mark against the dollar. "Now that the Bundesbank has successfully talked the dollar down, it need worry no more, as the underlying inflation trend is stable at 1.5 percent," said Gottfried Hoerich, interest-rate analyst at J. P. Morgan in Frankfurt.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
U.S. Bull Nears Age When Japan's Stumbled

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Countries, like companies, take pride in rising stock prices. So it is no surprise that both corporate and government officials see the prolonged rise in stock prices -- to a level about 10 times where they were just over 15 years ago, when the bull market began -- as proof of the superiority of the nation's economic system. And it is no surprise that they are freely advising other countries that success will come from emulation.
That description applies to the American market today, including the belief that the country's economic success stems in part from the ruthless efficiency that comes from giving companies flexibility to hire and fire when they wish even while Europe, with greater protections against layoffs, has lagged behind. 
 But the situation above was equally true of Japan in late 1989. That stock market rose by an almost exactly equal amount, over almost exactly the same period of time. And books abounded on Japanese management theory. The unique combination of Government economic management and a tradition of lifetime employment, we were told, had produced the greatest economic success story ever.
Emulating Japan was fashionable in business circles around the world, and many Japanese officials, both corporate and government, were quite willing to explain other countries' failures by contrasting those countries' systems with the superior Japanese ones.
That bull market ended badly, and is now almost universally seen as having been a bubble. It damaged Japan's economy because banks were left with huge quantities of bad loans that had been based on inflated asset valuations.
But while the bull market was going on, few worried about possible problems in Japan. Those who talked about valuations being far too high began doing so years too soon, and had been largely discredited well before the actual peak in stock prices, at the end of 1989. Japan's notions of value were different from those of other countries, it was said, and were justified by the very success of the market and the economy. The Japanese public eagerly bought stocks recommended by Japan's Big Four securities firms, which were widely suspected of being able to control prices to assure that there would rarely, if ever, be any losses.
In this country, some old-fashioned valuation measures -- like the dividend yield on stocks -- flashed warning signals years ago. But anyone who got out of stocks on the basis of such measures has lost out on a lot of profits, and those who cited them have been forced to change their tune or be dismissed as irrelevant in the new era that has dawned. The public has embraced stock mutual funds, perhaps more than individual stocks, and has put its faith in fund managers who in some cases have become well-known celebrities.
There were similarities in attitudes as well when the two bull markets began. Japan's stock market bottomed in October 1974, when worldwide recession brought on by soaring oil prices had depressed investors. Japan, it was said, was an island nation largely devoid of natural resources. How could it hope to compete in a new world of rising prices for such resources? In less than a year, the Nikkei 225 had fallen almost 25 percent.
The American stock market suffered then as well, and for some of the same reasons. But it took years for the American market -- and for America's economic psyche -- to begin to recover. By the late 1970's, amid a new round of rising oil prices, Japan seemed to be coping while the United States talked of a national malaise and seemed unable to deal with soaring inflation.
The American stock market hit bottom on Aug. 12, 1982, with the Dow Jones industrial average at 777.92 points, down nearly 25 percent in about a year. There was widespread pessimism and a belief that the recession the country was then in would continue indefinitely.
In the years that followed, the revivals of both stock markets were greeted first by skepticism and then by growing acceptance. Only after the bull markets had persisted for more than a decade -- and clearly outpaced those of other major countries -- did most economic commentators find evidence of superiority in the system of the country that had produced soaring stock prices.
There are, of course, significant differences between the Japanese bull market of 1974 through 1989 and the American one that began in 1982. Even now, the valuations accorded American stocks are nowhere near as high as the peak Japanese valuations. While the two bull markets produced very similar returns in their first 15 years -- Japan was up 903 percent during the period, and in the United States the Dow gained 925 percent -- they showed some significant divergences along the way.
The Japanese bull market ended just over 11 weeks after its 15th birthday, with the Nikkei 225 up 1,008 percent from its 1974 low. Were the United States bull market to similarly end, the Dow would peak on Oct. 30, at 8,605.90.
No current piece of economic news would clearly explain why stocks should stop climbing, just as there were no obvious economic problems in Japan in 1989. The economy is growing, and corporate profits continue to rise at a rapid pace.
Still, it may be worth recalling that things can change, and that widespread expectations can be wrong. In an article published in this newspaper on Aug. 15, 1982, it was noted that brokerage firms were reeling because the public had largely abandoned the stock market over the previous year. Nearly everyone on Wall Street expected stock prices to continue falling, the article added, citing as reasons the following:
"The economic upturn is nowhere in sight. It did not appear in the second quarter of the year, as many people had hoped. It does not seem to be appearing in the third quarter, either. 'My analysts come back from visiting companies,' said John R. Groome, senior vice president in charge of equity research at the U.S. Trust Company, 'and everybody's despondent. No orders. No sign of an upturn.'
"Corporate profits are continuing to slide, increasing the likelihood that companies will have to cut their dividends. A recent Standard & Poor's survey of 885 companies found that corporate earnings sank 16 percent in the second quarter following an 11 percent drop in the preceding three months."
It only goes to show how easy it is to be dead wrong about the future. In fact, the bear market had ended a few days before, and the economy was soon to enter a prolonged boom as well.

DOO-DAH!
Stephen Foster and the Rise of American Popular Culture
By Ken Emerson
Illustrated. 400 pages. Simon & Schuster. $30.
 It's a real feat to write an engaging biography of a person about whom almost nothing is known for certain. Thanks to a judicious pruning of family records on the part of his mortified descendants, the facts surrounding the short life and the squalid death of the American composer Stephen Foster are exceedingly sparse.
He was born in 1826 on the outskirts of Pittsburgh, a booming industrial city on the edge of the American wilderness, to a large, musical and often impecunious clan. With documented stays in Cincinnati and New York City, and a presumptive visit to Bardstown, Ky., Foster lived in Pittsburgh for most of his life. There, he wrote songs suggesting that the singer was languishing in painful exile from a lovely and almost wholly imaginary South. ("My Old Kentucky Home," published in 1853, is a case in point.) 
 Stephen Foster married in 1850. The union was marred by Foster's chronic inability to support a family on the proceeds from the sale of sheet music containing a growing library of minstrel songs that would someday become American standards, including "Camptown Races," "Oh! Susanna," "Old Folks at Home" and "Jeanie With the Light Brown Hair." The latter, copyrighted in 1854, may be a tribute to his long-suffering wife, Jane, written at the end of one of their frequent separations.
Foster, it seems, drank to excess, much to her horror. In his book about Foster, Ken Emerson suggests that Mrs. Foster may have had other causes for complaint, too. Their daughter was probably conceived on the couple's wedding night, he argues, and thereafter "they might never have had sex again." In any case, she was not present when Stephen Foster died of dissipation and drink in Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan in 1864. America's greatest composer had spent the final months of his life alone, picking out melodies on an old piano in the shabby back room of a German grocery store on the Bowery.
All this might amount to so much tragic trivia, however, were it not for Mr. Emerson's determination to use Foster to trace the rise of popular culture in the United States back to the 1840's and 50's and to industrial cities, like Pittsburgh, where a song first became a commodity, like an iron ingot or a bale of cotton.
In common with the manufactured goods that moved up and down the rivers from the Five Points district of Pittsburgh, songs passed through many hands before they finally reached a mass audience. Composers, lyricists, famous performers who introduced numbers and lent their images to the covers of sheet music, publishers and printers all played roles in the creation and distribution of the cultural products of the Industrial Revolution. They each took their cut of the profits, too, leaving Foster and other composers as underpaid junior partners in the business of songwriting.
It is not surprising, then, that machinery, modern industry, and the calamities associated with entrepreneurship are often the themes of Foster songs that seem wholly bucolic. The second verse of "Oh! Susanna," for instance, has the singer jumping aboard one of two fast steamboats that held the record for the run from Cincinnati to Louisville (it promptly explodes), sending a telegram, and finally riding a new railroad locomotive (it breaks down, of course), all in the space of five short lines.
Most of Foster's output fell into a recognized category of minstrel songs, music performed by white artists in blackface that purported to describe a Southern slave culture neither Foster nor his Pittsburgh friends knew anything about. The reasons for the widespread popularity of minstrelsy in the decades before the Civil War are closely related to the sense of loss experienced by those who lived in Pittsburgh and other burgeoning industrial centers.
Mr. Emerson sees blackface as a nostalgic lament for a natural world overrun by progress. The imaginary primitivism of blackface music was a form of consolation for white Americans suddenly cut off from their pioneer roots, buttoned into business suits and locked into offices or factories. However bad the lot of the wage slave, there was always someone worse off than himself: the interlocutor of a typical Stephen Foster number, toiling in the make-believe cotton fields back home.
In their own era, Foster's songs were highly topical productions. Mr. Emerson says the famous "Doo-dah!" refrain in "Camptown Races" may have been the cry of a hooker, plying her trade at illegal, nighttime contests of speed held in shantytowns on the fringes of respectable communities. The songs often drew on well-known source material from the theater and serial fiction, as when Foster recast the titular theme of Harriet Beecher Stowe's abolitionist novel, "Uncle Tom's Cabin," as his own "Old Kentucky Home."
Although Stowe's tract seemed to reviewers to condemn blackface high jinks, she had a great deal in common with Foster. Both, in their respective fields, were media stars; like Foster, Stowe had written a best seller about a South she had never seen. Yet the novel and the songs (however inadvertently, in Foster's case) both also promoted a new understanding of the human character of people of color on the eve of the Civil War. The African-American singers of Stephen Foster's plaintive melodies love their families, work hard and pine for the peace and serenity of home. They are, in short, a lot like white entrepreneurs from Pittsburgh.
With "Doo-Dah!," Mr. Emerson, who has written about popular music for 30 years, has made an impressive contribution to a growing body of analytic literature on popular culture. Perhaps because the incidents of his subject's life are lost to history, he has looked to the social, cultural, economic and artistic milieu in which Foster operated. The result is a readable, fascinating book that seems particularly pertinent to an understanding of American culture in the 1990's, a culture driven by many of the same forces and prejudices that first found expression in Stephen Foster's music of the antebellum era.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Up on Stock Rally And German Rate Stability

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against major currencies yesterday, setting a nearly two-week high versus the German mark. Its rise was helped by a stock market rebound and by a German central bank decision to leave a money market rate alone.
The demand for dollars was fueled by the stock rally, which pushed the Dow Jones industrials to their biggest one-day point gain. The rally, in turn, was driven by doubts that the Federal Reserve would soon raise interest rates. 
 The dollar was also helped by a weak Japanese retail sales report, which added to pessimism about Japan's economic recovery. The Japanese Finance Minister suggested that interest rates there would remain low and said that the yen's recent weakness was in line with economic fundamentals.
"The dollar looks set to move higher during the rest of the month," said Roger Chapin, foreign-exchange manager at Banc One International in Columbus, Ohio.
Late in New York yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.8335 marks, up from 1.8095 late Friday. The dollar traded at 121.47 Japanese yen, up from 120.80 on Friday. The British pound fetched $1.5920, down from $1.62. American financial markets were closed Monday for Labor Day.
The stock market got a push from a report by the National Association of Purchasing Management showing that growth in manufacturing slowed in August. That eased fear of inflation and of higher interest rates; such concerns had scared stock buyers.
The dollar was also aided by remarks by a member of the Bundesbank's policy council, Olaf Sievert, that it was premature to think German inflation was strong enough to require a rate increase soon.
Against the yen, the dollar continued a strong rally as Japan reported that retail sales at department stores and supermarkets fell in July, adding to a spate of recently sluggish economic data.
The dollar's current level above 120 yen, which until Friday had not been seen since early in May, has been cited as the benchmark for inciting trade tension between the United States and Japan. A weak yen makes Japanese goods more affordable in the United States, increasing the American trade deficit.

HEADLINE: Bronx and Queens Endorsements

 BODY:
Next Tuesday's primaries will be more important than the November finale in many parts of New York City with overwhelming Democratic majorities. These are our endorsements for some of the more competitive races in the Bronx and Queens.
 
Bronx Borough President
 Today's Bronx is a far different place than it was when Fernando Ferrer first became Borough President in 1987. The images of that old, bad era have begun to fade -- burned-out buildings, shuttered businesses, "Fort Apache" frontier lawlessness and a bumbling, corrupt government epitomized by Mr. Ferrer's predecessor, Stanley Simon. New housing, economic development, lower crime and more efficient government have begun to turn the borough around. The Bronx, of course, is still plagued by problems, and Mr. Ferrer can hardly take all the credit for progress. But good things have happened on his watch. Unlike previous Bronx leaders, he has pushed forward. 
 The City Council member Israel Ruiz Jr. is an energetic but eccentric politician whose agenda has never been entirely clear. In this race, despite a well-financed campaign, Mr. Ruiz's explanation of what he would do is incredibly fuzzy, focusing on a promise that his "leadership" will somehow reduce the number of dysfunctional families in poor neighborhoods. His attacks on the incumbent have ranged from unfair to outrageous. There is no question that Fernando Ferrer deserves re-election.
 
Bronx City Council
12th District (Co-op City and northeast Bronx): For the week preceding the passage of the city's budget, the incumbent, Lawrence Warden, lobbies fairly effectively for projects in his district. The rest of the year he is all but missing in action. His challenger, Shirley Saunders, is an aide to Representative Eliot Engel who shows commendable enthusiasm but seems familiar only with her home base at Co-op City. In a near toss-up, our endorsement goes to Mr. Warden for his close ties to all parts of his district.
14th District (west Bronx): The departing incumbent, Israel Ruiz, is supporting Richard Soto, a process server who was once the Councilman's chief of staff. The Bronx Democratic organization is backing Adolfo Carrion Jr., a former city planner and community board manager. The party has used its familiar tactic of trying to win the election by throwing opponents off the ballot in court challenges. It would be tempting to back Mr. Soto, the only survivor, out of protest if Mr. Carrion were not so clearly the better candidate. But Mr. Soto, like his mentor Mr. Ruiz, seems to be off in a political world all his own, with no agenda beyond vague talk about accountability. Mr. Carrion is familiar with the district's problems and has good ideas about economic development. We endorse Mr. Carrion.
 
Queens City Council
20th District (Flushing, parts of Fresh Meadows and Whitestone): Flushing is booming, but is strained by an influx of immigrant families. It needs a Council member who can ease the effects of overcrowding, help bring newcomers into the community and soothe the feelings of disrupted longtime residents. Julia Harrison, the veteran incumbent, no longer provides either inclusiveness or initiative. Her opponents are the district school board president, Pauline Chu; a community activist, Debra Markell, and John Liu, an actuary who is vice president of a civic association.
All offer more energy and good will than the incumbent. Mr. Liu shows real promise, but has relatively little experience in community affairs. Ms. Markell has a long resume of volunteer work, from leading protests against low-flying planes at La Guardia Airport to an anti-litter program in downtown Flushing. But Ms. Chu's work on education issues and aggressive campaign organization may give her a better chance of winning the nomination. Our endorsement goes to Pauline Chu.

Nonprofits' Wall St. Home Filling Up

BYLINE: By MERVYN ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
The Association Center, opened five years ago at 120 Wall Street to help keep national and international nonprofit organizations from leaving New York City because of high rents, is about to become 100 percent occupied.
Roger A. Silverstein, a vice president of Silverstein Properties, which runs the Association Center building, said that a lease for 50,000 square feet was expected to be signed this month. He would not identify the new tenant. The center, created in cooperation with the city's Economic Development Corporation, occupies 400,000 square feet, 20 floors of the 34-story building at South Street, which was built in 1929. 
 Because of incentives from the city's Industrial Development Agency, nonprofit organizations that rent offices in the building are exempt from city real estate taxes, which are usually passed through by landlords to tenants as part of the rent. (The Economic Development Corporation runs the agency.)
Except for tenants of the Association Center, nonprofit groups must own and occupy property in New York City to qualify for a real estate tax exemption. Exemptions for nonprofits are also available at office buildings set up as condominiums, like the former B. Altman store at 34th Street and Madison Avenue, now home to the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, Oxford University Press and the Science, Industry and Business branch of the New York Public Library.
The 38 nonprofits in the Association Center include the National Urban League, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International, the Alan Guttmacher Institute and the International Planned Parenthood Federation/Western Hemisphere Region.
Mr. Silverstein said he was in discussions with the Economic Development Corporation to incorporate into the center the building's remaining 200,000 square feet, which are leased to for-profit organizations. "The first of those leases is up in early 1999, and we hope within four or five years to have the 200,000 square feet available," he said.
Charles Millard, the president of the Economic Development Corporation, said that "expanding the initiative within that building is a particularly good option, though nothing is final." The leasing of the center, Mr. Millard said, is "a column of strength in the fulfillment of the Mayor's Downtown Revitalization Plan -- a building that had substantial vacant space now hardly has any."
Mr. Silverstein said that under its contract with the city, Silverstein Properties charges nonprofits an average annual rent of $19.74 a square foot over 15 years -- an average of $16.74 for the first five years, $19.74 for the next five and $22.74 for the final five. The rents reflect an annual tax exemption of $5.26 a square foot, which was the tax rate when the program began. It has since dropped to $3.05, a rate that would be reflected in any lease renewal, Mr. Silverstein said. Market-rate rentals in a similar downtown building would be about $25 a square foot a year, he said.
"Not-for-profits are required to make a lease commitment for 15 years in exchange for the tax benefit," he said. "The lease also includes free rent for the first year and a $35-a-square-foot landlord contribution for renovation work."
The real estate recession of the late 80's and early 90's, which hit downtown especially hard, played a significant role in the length of time it took to fill the center, Mr. Silverstein said. But now that downtown is picking up, with several empty office buildings converted to residential use and commercial tenants again leasing space, the center is reaping the benefits.
"When the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation came aboard in 1995, it gave us a strong identity, and not-for-profits started to take notice of the building," Mr. Silverstein said. "Our leasing program started to accelerate, and this year the National Urban League became another strong anchor tenant. In a few short months, we jumped from 75 percent to near 100 percent occupancy."
The creation of the center did not immediately halt the flow of nonprofits elsewhere. In 1994, the United Negro College Fund moved its headquarters from East 62d Street to Fairfax, Va., and that year the Boys and Girls Clubs of America moved to Atlanta. In fact, between 1983 and 1994, more than 2,000 nonprofit headquarters left the city. "Because of New York's increasing tax rate, cities like Washington and Atlanta were offering rental rates far better than New York's," Mr. Silverstein said.
But as the center's identity grew, it made New York competitive with other urban areas.
"The Association Center was the beginning of the end of the exodus of not-for-profits from New York City," said Joel A. Dolci, president of the New York Society of Association Executives, a trade group. "If anything is going out of New York now, it's a rarity, and some not-for-profits are coming in and considering coming in. I believe all the tenants at the center would have left if they didn't have an affordable place in a Class A building."
According to the Economic Development Corporation, there are about 11,600 nonprofit organizations in the city, employing almost 600,000 people and paying about $1 billion in taxes a year.
When the National Urban League became the Association Center's largest tenant, it leased 48,568 square feet on two floors. Before the United Negro College Fund moved its headquarters to Virginia, it and the league had shared a 21-story building at 500 East 62d Street.
The Urban League was represented in the deal by Arlene Wysong of Newmark & Company Real Estate and David Lebenstein of Time Equities, brokers who specialize in placing nonprofits and who also recently brought the Center for Urban Community Services (12,600 square feet) and the United Negro College Fund's New York regional office (4,400 square feet) to the Association Center.
Both Ms. Wysong and Mr. Lebenstein said there could be problems in placing nonprofit organizations, especially local ones.
"With rents rising in the city, we're going to run into difficulties," Ms. Wysong said. "The Association Center is wonderful, but it's only for national and international organizations. Local not-for-profits are usually the poorest groups, and they're in the direst straits. What we need is an across-the-board solution, such as some kind of tax abatement to any landlord who rents to not-for-profits."

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
A new Belgian carrier is modeling itself after Southwest Airlines, apparently with success.

BYLINE: By Paul Burnham Finney

 BODY:
UNDAUNTED by the demise of Sir Freddie Laker's Skytrain and other low-priced trans-Atlantic carriers over the years, City Bird -- a new Belgian airline owned by City Hotels -- began low-fare flights between Miami and Orlando, Fla., and Brussels last March and then added New York (Newark International Airport), Los Angeles and San Francisco (Oakland International Airport) in June. Today, the carrier says it is packing passengers in with a 92 percent load factor.
Right now, City Bird is offering unrestricted one-way coach tickets between Newark and Brussels for $148, good until mid-December, when they will increase to $189. Even a one-way seat in the carrier's business-class section is a relative bargain -- $699 on the Newark-Brussels run, compared with $1,900 that Delta Air Lines, Sabena and other airlines charge. City Bird will throw in a free rental car for three days for those who buy a round-trip business-class ticket -- a pretty good deal considering the high cost of renting a car in Europe. 
 "City Bird is a Southwest-type operation," said its senior vice president, Serge Barder, referring to Southwest Airlines, the profitable -- and popular -- American no-frills carrier. Like Southwest, the Belgian imitator is using electronic ticketing to keep costs down.
City Bird has two wide-bodied, 371-seat MD-11's, the McDonnell Douglas successor to the DC-10. With the addition of another MD-11 and two Boeing 767's, the carrier expects to increase its current four flights a week between Newark and Brussels to daily service next spring. City Bird's 36-seat business class, called Royal Eagle, has fully reclining seats and power outlets for laptop computers, plus frills like vintage wines and amenity kits. Travelers can upgrade from coach to business class right at the airport -- if seats are available -- for only an additional $250, compared with the $699 for an advance reservation.
For leisure travelers, landing in Brussels may not be one of City Bird's strengths. But veteran business travelers know the city as the capital of the European Community and a headquarters town for American companies.
The Belgian capital has also turned into something of an air and rail hub for Europe. For example, Virgin Group's Virgin Express, which works closely with City Bird and also tickets electronically, flies between Brussels and Madrid, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Milan and Rome for around $100 and London (both Heathrow and Gatwick) for $78. Alternatively, after making the rounds in Brussels, travelers can now take the high-speed Eurostar train through the English Channel tunnel to London.
 
High Hotel Prices
Is there some relief ahead from high United States hotel prices? Maybe, considering that occupancy declined slightly in the first half of 1997 for the first time in five years, according to Smith Travel Research. But don't hold your breath waiting for rates to reflect the change. The figures are national averages, and in top business markets like New York, where the average daily rate has increased to $160 from $142 a year ago, room demand continues firm.
"The economy is doing well, and international travel is strong," said Chuck Ross, a vice president at Smith Travel Research. "Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco have high occupancy and high room rates similar to New York's." Where are the lower rates? "In Atlanta and Nashville, among the 25 biggest hotel markets," Mr. Ross said. "And in the Midwest and secondary cities."
 
Village Passports
The New York Passport Agency opened for business yesterday at its new, roomier offices in the West Village at 376 Hudson Street between West Houston and King Street -- a less convenient location for business travelers in midtown offices but closer to Wall Street. Travelers who need a new or renewed passport in a hurry must still have tickets indicating a departure within 14 days, or a convincing letter of explanation, to qualify for personal processing. The agency is an appointment-only operation, as it was in Rockefeller Center; the new telephone number is 212-206-3500.
 
Refurbished Ruble
Business travelers who have been fumbling with ridiculously high-denomination paper rubles in Moscow and other Russian cities will find things easier in early January when the Government plans to lop three 000's off its notes. The paper currency now comes in 1,000; 5,000; 10,000; 50,000; 100,000, and 500,000 denominations, with a 5,000 denomination note worth about $1. After the change, 10 rubles -- roughly the equivalent of $2 -- will be the lowest paper denomination available. Smaller amounts will be in coins.
In any case, the currency will still not be easily convertible. "Take dollars or Deutsche marks to Russia and exchange them there," an American Express representative said, "but you don't want to bring rubles out." Wherever possible, old Moscow hands advise, use credit cards to pay for hotel, restaurant and other travel expenditures.
 
Teeing Off at St. Andrews
Here's a hot reward for very frequent travelers: silver or gold members of British Airways' Executive Club program can use 210,000 miles (the equivalent of 30 round trips between New York and London) to play golf in Scotland at the sport's fountainhead, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews. Travelers can add in AT&T True Rewards and Diners Club earnings to help qualify. The 210,000 miles will pay for trans-Atlantic business-class tickets on British Airways for two and two nights at the Old Course Hotel, plus greens fees. The offer expires on Oct. 31.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Rally After Purchasing Report

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Bonds rallied yesterday after a weaker-than-expected manufacturing report helped eased concerns that the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates soon to rein in the economy.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond ended the day up 20/32, to 97 21/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.55 percent, from 6.60 percent on Friday. The Treasury market was closed on Monday in observance of Labor Day. 
 Prices rose after the National Association of Purchasing Management said that its factory index fell to 56.8 last month from 58.6 in July. Some economists had expected a reading of about 59. The prices-paid component, a gauge of inflation, barely moved, rising to 53.8, up two hundredths of a percentage point. The national report relieved worries raised on Friday, when the Chicago Purchasing Management Association's report came in much stronger than expected.
The Chicago report gave a distinct impression that the economy was surging. But the two reports rarely share the same outlook. Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said the national report proved "once again that the Chicago puchasing managers index can be a serious misleading indicator on a month-to month-basis."
"Of the more important N.A.P.M. index, the bond market is rallying on the unexpected news," he said, adding, "At the same time it must be recognized that the N.A.P.M. index is still indicating broad expansion in the industrial sector, and that the prices-paid index is suggesting increasing price pressures, with a growing net differential between those reporting higher prices and those reporting lower."
Dave Shabelman, a Treasury market analyst with Standard & Poor's MMS in San Francisco, a market research and analysis firm, said: "Despite today's weak report, there are still traders who want to get out of the market given that prices are nearing the top of the range. The upside is likely limited in front of the jobs data," a reference to the August jobs report due on Friday.
Some of the buying in the Treasury market yesterday was by investors who had bet that prices would fall, and were forced to buy back securities to limit their losses.
A strong dollar in currency markets also buoyed Treasury prices.
At the Treasury's regular weekly auction, rates were moderately mixed as expected, with the three-month rate averaging 3.07 percent, down from 5.12 percent last week, and the six-month bill rate at 5.19 percent, up from 5.14 percent.
The bond market next turns its attention to data on leading indicators, due today, motor vehicle sales, construction spending, factory orders and chain store sales. But the market's chief focus will be Friday's employment statistics, which will be a primary determinant of the near-term direction of bond yields. The payroll number is expected to be depressed as a result of the United Parcel Service strike.
Following are the results of yesterday's weekly Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.718	97.376	Discounted Rate	5.07%	5.19%	Coupon Yield	5.21%	5.40%	High Price	98.723	97.386	Discounted Rate	5.05%	5.17%	Coupon Yield	5.19%	5.38%	Low Price	98.718	97.376	Discounted Rate	5.07%	5.19%	Coupon Yield	5.21%	5.40%	Accepted at low price	60%	20%	Total applied for	$36,948,409	$38,280,087	Accepted	$6,122,209	$4,498,695	Noncompetitive	$1,321,987	$1,139,818	

Both issues are dated Sept. 4. The three-month bills mature on Dec. 4, and the six-month bills on March 5.

HEADLINE: Candidates Striving to Be Heard;
It's Uphill for 2 Trying Not to Be Also-Rans for Mayor

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
A man wearing a double-breasted suit and a broad smile strode amid the canned beans and Pampers at a market in Lefrak City in Queens, handing out smudgy photocopied fliers and telling shoppers, "I'm Eric Ruano-Melendez, and I'm running for mayor."
"Mayor of what?" one man asked. 
 Another man, apparently assuming that this unknown must belong to a fringe party, said: "I can't vote in your primary. I'm a Democrat." So is Mr. Ruano-Melendez.
When two checkout clerks explained in Spanish that they could not vote, Mr. Ruano-Melendez rolled his eyes, laughed and asked, "Where are the citizens?"
All year, the knock on the best-known candidates in the Sept. 9 Democratic primary, Ruth W. Messinger, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Sal F. Albanese, has been that they are second-tier material, uninspired candidates with quixotic, uncoordinated campaigns, and neither the message nor the money to topple the Republican incumbent, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
If those three are in danger of being also-rans, then what to make of Roland Rogers and Mr. Ruano-Melendez, who round out the Democratic primary field? Without renown, money, political connections or paid campaign staffs, they plod against their own obscurity, half willing to admit that they stand no chance of winning, yet trying mightily to be taken seriously. If there is a theme to their campaigns, it is the struggle to be heard.
At a candidates' forum in Harlem on Aug. 26, each candidate was promised 15 minutes, but Mr. Rogers was cut off after 7. He talked about the kind of meaty economic development issues -- the need for a railroad freight depot in the city and a rehabilitated Brooklyn waterfront -- that would gladden the heart of a city planner, but the city's news media made little mention of his performance.
Mr. Ruano-Melendez, 49, won some news coverage at an earlier debate by singing a snippet of "The Star-Spangled Banner," by his apparent inability to understand the moderator's questions and by getting the primary date wrong.
Each likes to spin elaborate scenarios for his victory. Mr. Rogers, 50, has called on Mr. Albanese, a City Councilman, and Mr. Sharpton to meet with him to unite behind one of them, a call they have ignored.
"I'm the logical unity candidate, because I'm Rudy Giuliani's worst nightmare, a credible African-American," Mr. Rogers said. According to this plan, such Sharpton and Albanese endorsements would so shock the city that media attention and money would follow, and he would be able to force Ms. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, into a runoff. "Then the momentum is with me all the way," he said.
Mr. Ruano-Melendez offers his own version. "The turnout's going to be low, see, so if I can motivate the Hispanic vote, as the only Hispanic in the race, and if we can hold Messinger under 40 percent and force a runoff, I'm poised," he said.
Mr. Rogers is a former marketing consultant and, by his own account, a failed real estate investor who is president of the New York City Birthday Committee, which was organized to celebrate the anniversary of the city's first government formed in 1653 by the Dutch. He goes at his quest with an earnestness that is almost infectious.
He hands out leaflets on the subway, talking intently about economics and race relations and exhorting riders to "help me pull off the upset of the century." He introduces a friend, John F. McHugh, a lawyer and railroad expert, as "my deputy mayor for economic development." His fax machine pumps out news releases describing in triumphant terms his performance at candidate forums and declaring that the other Democrats in the race fear him.
And he insists, at least most of the time, that he can actually win, that even in an era of mass advertising, face-to-face campaigning can prevail. All evidence to the contrary, he says it does not matter that his political experience is limited to working for a few campaigns in his native Buffalo in the 1970's. Voters, he says, want people uncorrupted by the process he is trying so hard to master.
Such faith is common to unknowns running for high office, as is the perplexed reaction that Mr. Rogers, who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, generally gets as he campaigns. "They don't know who I am," he acknowledged. "But when I talk to them, their whole hearts light up. 'Here's someone that I can vote for.' "
The response was a little different on Wednesday a week ago as Mr. Rogers shook hands at the Central Brooklyn Coordinating Council, a coalition of social-service groups based in Bedford-Stuyvesant. "You're going against my man Sharpton?" asked a security guard, echoing the response from a number of black voters Mr. Rogers approached.
Asked after meeting with Mr. Rogers if he would endorse him, Charles Joshua, the Coordinating Council president, said, "I think he's a bright young person," and left it at that.
A reception for Mr. Rogers that night at 26 Hudson, a restaurant alongside the Hudson River in Manhattan, drew a few dozen people, including some who said they were friends of friends and knew nothing about Mr. Rogers, and some who said they intended to vote for Mr. Giuliani.
Mr. Rogers chafes at being lumped with Mr. Ruano-Melendez, whom he dismisses as "not a serious candidate," or with Mr. Sharpton, whom he calls divisive and unelectable.
And despite his usually brave face, a bit of desperation sometimes creeps into Mr. Rogers's talk, as when he berates newspaper and television reporters for ignoring him. His campaign is so hungry for attention that his campaign manager repeatedly tried to persuade a reporter to travel to Buffalo to cover Mr. Rogers's high school reunion.
"I can't win if I can't get the message out," Mr. Rogers said. During an interview, he told a reporter: "You can make a difference. You can make this happen. You could be my press secretary when I'm mayor."
If Mr. Rogers, as the sober novice, offers one paradigm of the shoestring candidate, Mr. Ruano-Melendez offers another: the perennial candidate who takes himself altogether less seriously.
Mr. Ruano-Melendez, a native of Guatemala who lives in Jackson Heights, Queens, ran for Congress in 1992 and 1994, and for mayor in 1993, when he got 7 percent of the Democratic primary vote against Mayor David N. Dinkins, a performance even he attributes to being the only Hispanic candidate on the ballot.
He gives a number of reasons for running again, none of them having to do with policy: "I like it." "There has to be someone Hispanic in the race." And "I feel like I'm an example for immigrants."
Mr. Ruano-Melendez, who moved to New York at age 19 and has been an engineer in the city's Environmental Protection Department for the last 20 years, goes on to say, "In Peru, Fujimori, he was an engineer, too, and he was a minority and nobody thought he could win, but he did, so why shouldn't I run?"
Buttonholing people on Queens sidewalks while a friend follows along, holding a large, badly copied picture of him, Mr. Ruano-Melendez outlines some unusual ideas about the city's problems. Drugs? Either legalize them or execute the dealers, he says. Homelessness? Set up vast fields of mobile homes. Crime? Bring in the National Guard.
"I have military experience," he said, noting that he has served in the Army. "None of the other candidates have it. That's why I'm qualified to request the National Guard."
He clearly enjoys himself more than any of his opponents, laughing frequently as he chats with prospective voters, and poking gentle fun not only at the other candidates but also at himself. When a Hispanic man looks confused by Mr. Ruano-Melendez's appeal for votes, the candidate says, "Must be my accent."
But like Mr. Rogers, he turns serious when lamenting his inability to break into the nightly television news or the morning papers. "Without that, it's very hard to get anywhere," he said. "Four years ago, I was the surprise candidate, but this time, I guess I'm old news."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK SCHOOLS OPEN WITH NEW AID AND OLD TROUBLES

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG

 BODY:
New York City's 1.1 million public-school children begin returning to their classrooms today to find a system that received an election-year infusion of new computers, textbooks, art classes and reading teachers over the summer vacation. But the system remains plagued by severe overcrowding and chronically low performance in one-third of its districts.
For the 510,000 middle school and high school students who are scheduled to take their seats today, and the more than 550,000 elementary school students who are to arrive tomorrow, this is a school opening that has drawn unusually intense attention from the adults who oversee and observe the system. 
 Much of that attention has been political -- with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican seeking re-election in November, and Ruth W. Messinger, who is seeking the Democratic nomination in next week's primary, squabbling over whether the Mayor's attention to the system has been too little too late. Mr. Giuliani has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the schools in recent months, but only after three consecutive years in which he cut the average amount spent on each student.
But such arguments are likely to be lost on those students who will get their first look at their new classrooms today.
If they are in a middle school, they will probably find four new computers and a printer in many classrooms, and teachers who got as many as 30 hours of training over the summer -- all results of the Mayor's $123 million program to enhance technology education. If they are in an elementary school that performed among the lowest quarter on the city's reading test, they will find new reading teachers and newly stocked libraries -- a result of the Mayor's $125 million reading program.
And many students in the high schools will find teachers hired specifically to help them prepare for tougher Regents standards in mathematics and other subjects -- a result of a $40 million allocation from the State Legislature.
For all that largesse, though, there is likely to be a fair share of disruption and discomfort.
Out of the roughly 66,000 teachers in the city's 1,100 public schools, nearly 4,000 are new -- 400 of them hired only in the last week. Both the new teachers and their principals complain that cumbersome, centrally administered, random assignments have left them little opportunity to get to know if they are right for each other. [Page B4.]
As the new teachers are getting used to their classrooms, 2,500 senior teachers are still awaiting word on whether Gov. George E. Pataki will sign a bill now on his desk. It would permit them to retire this fall at age 55, rather than 62, without jeopardizing their pensions. The Governor has signaled that he is likely to veto the bill by tomorrow's deadline.
In the cafeterias, more than 1,000 newly hired school aides will be learning on the job how to supervise students when they can be at their rowdiest. The aides were hired to replace the teachers who have been relieved of that duty under the city's contract with the teachers' union.
And more than 80,000 students, especially in the Bronx and Queens, will be assigned to overcrowded classrooms, some of which will spill out into hallways and converted bathrooms, just as they did in the past. While the system, the nation's largest, has created new space for 23,000 students this year through the construction of new schools, the renovation of dozens of other schools and the installation of portable trailers, enrollment is expected to have grown by more than 18,000 students since last year.
A report released yesterday by the Citizens' Budget Commission, an independent, business-financed watchdog group, said the overcrowding was a result of a rapid rise in enrollment, fueled mainly by immigration. The system grew by 117,706 students from 1990 to 1996, compared with just 21,254 from 1983 to 1990.
But the commission faulted the Board of Education, the Giuliani administration and that of David N. Dinkins before him, for not responding adequately to the crisis. When adjusted for inflation, spending per pupil fell by 10 percent from 1990 to 1996, the commission found.
"The outlook for the future is bleak," the authors concluded.
At yesterday's dedication of a new elementary school, Public School 24 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, the Mayor dismissed what he called the commission's "excessive entry into politics," and hinted that it was seeking to assist Ms. Messinger.
Charles Brecher, executive vice president of the commission, said that "candidate Giuliani applauded many of our ideas" four years ago.
Although it may not be apparent to the students, the system has undergone a fundamental shift in power on the neighborhood level: a sweeping new state law took effect over the summer vacation that stripped the city's 32 elected school boards of the responsibilities of hiring teachers and principals and spending money in the elementary and middle schools, transferring those powers to district superintendents. The superintendents -- a third of them new this school year -- now report to Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew, who has the enhanced authority to dismiss them if a district's performance is poor.
The Chancellor had lobbied hard for the changes as a way to hold schools accountable -- especially in 13 districts where fewer than 40 percent of students scored at grade level on last year's reading test.
But parents, teachers and principals have expressed concerns that the new law may make it harder for their voices to be heard by the empowered Chancellor, who is appointed by the Board of Education and thus not responsible to voters.
"We're just concerned that the new law will make Rudy Crew the czar of education," said Donald Singer, the president of the Council of Supervisors and Administrators, which represents the city's principals. "There's got to be checks and balances."
"Are the superintendents going to live in fear of the Chancellor?" he asked. "And if there is a problem with a reading or a math score, are they going to feel pressured to say it's the principal's fault?"
In the schools yesterday, as teachers set up their classrooms and parents registered their children, the concerns were more immediate.
Rupinder Kaur, 14, a native of India who has been in the United States for only two months, was patiently standing in line outside Newcomers High School in Long Island City, Queens, a three-year-old school intended to ease the transition of immigrants into the school system.
"My daughter doesn't speak English yet," said her father, Malkiat Singh, who was eager to secure her a spot. "She is very happy to learn."
At Louis D. Brandeis High School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, a new teacher, Randy Abdallah, 40, was wondering what his students would be like in a school that he said he knew "absolutely nothing" about.
Mr. Abdallah taught art in Massachusetts public schools for 15 years and got a job in New York as a result of good timing: After years of whittling away art and music programs, the city is expected to spend $25 million to restore such courses this school year and the next two years.
"My fiancee lives in the city," Mr. Abdallah said, "and now that I got a job here we can get married."
But perhaps the person with the most at stake is the Chancellor himself, who, in his first full year in the system last year, saw reading test scores rise in every district in the city. For him, the challenge is to build on those gains, and he has once again focused on the third grade, in which fewer than half of the students were found to be reading at grade level last year.
At a breakfast at Gracie Mansion yesterday for several dozen elementary-school students who had taken part in a summer reading program, Dr. Crew signed autographs for nearly a half hour. When Keisha Hunt, age 7, told the Chancellor that she was entering the third grade at P.S. 114 in Canarsie, Brooklyn, Dr. Crew brightened.
"Going into third grade?" he repeated. "You and I are going to have fun this year."
He then signed her book, writing: "To Keisha. We think you are just too special for words. Keep the faith! The third grade is great! Always, Dr. Crew, Chancellor."

HEADLINE: A Resurgent California Finds All That Glitters Is Its Future

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Sept. 2

 BODY:
When demographers at the California Department of Finance finished their annual analysis of drivers' licenses last month, they found a shining nugget of good news for the Golden State: for the first time since 1991, more Americans moved to California than left it to live in other states.
Last week, the California Association of Realtors turned up another cheery statistic: sales of existing homes rose 11.2 percent in July compared with the same month last year, the highest year-to-year increase since 1989 and five times the national increase for July. 
 It is not hard to find good news these days in California, the place that once helped define national notions of the American dream but that for most of the 1990's seemed to suffer nothing but problems, from the worst recession since the Depression to riots, a devastating earthquake and the convulsive stigma of the O. J. Simpson case.
"In the 50's, 60's and 70's, people looked to see the future in California, and while that was a kind of metaphor, it's coming back again," said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto. "It's hard to name a growth industry in the world that California doesn't have a strong position in. The question should no longer be can California manage the recession, but can California manage the growth?"
That topic is so much on the public mind that last week, when The Los Angeles Times published a front-page article on expected population growth, Mr. Levy's phone was ringing off the hook with calls from news outlets around the state.
Those figures, from October 1996 projections by the Census Bureau, said California's population was expected to grow by nearly 18 million people -- the current population of the entire State of New York -- by the year 2025.
"There was nothing new in those figures," Mr. Levy said. But they touched a nerve.
The growth projections are sobering, driven by the expectation that California will continue to grow faster than any other state, with about half the expected growth coming from international immigration. By 2025, the total population is expected to reach 49.3 million, a nearly 60 percent increase from the estimated 31.6 million now.
The state's own projections call for even more growth. They are based on a slightly different methodology and include data, like drivers' license renewals, that are not used by the Census Bureau. The state's predictions do not extend as far into the future, but they estimate that by 2020 the population will be 45.5 million, about 2 million more than the bureau's estimate for the same year.
Mary Heim, a demographer with the State Department of Finance, which compiles the estimates, said: "The big difference between our projection and theirs is that they assume domestic outmigration to other states will continue to increase, and we don't. We have data that show those trends have reversed this year."
Even the state's estimated growth rates would be well below the postwar economic explosion, in which the state's population doubled from 1950 to 1970. And some experts are skeptical, cautioning about the vagaries inherent in any such predictions.
"Population projections can be so wrong," said Joel Kotkin, a fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy in Malibu. "It depends what happens, and there are constraints. I don't think this economy is going to generate a lot of jobs for less-educated people. I don't think immigration will be as great. I don't think the migration of working people from other states will be as great. Also, the number of desirable places to live, where people want or can afford to live, will go down."
Still, Mr. Kotkin and many others agree that after its period of epochal economic and natural disasters, California is at last squarely on a solid upswing, with an annual job growth rate running at nearly 3 percent, compared with about 2.3 percent nationally and 1.4 percent in the Middle Atlantic States.
The recovery is uneven, with the computer-driven economy of Silicon Valley and San Francisco Bay still doing far better than the Los Angeles area, which lost 70 percent of all the jobs lost in the state when the aerospace industry collapsed in the early 1990's.
Over all, California now has nearly half a million more jobs than it did before the recession began, many of them in high-paying fields like computers, film production and biotechnology.
What is more, the local psychological preoccupation with bad news, especially in Southern California, seems to have dissipated.
"I think people felt their personal lives were stabilizing, their personal financial situation was improving and that made itself felt on a psychological level," said G. U. Krueger, deputy chief economist for the state realtors' association. "I also think that people just got bored with gloom and it was time for a change."
Statewide, Mr. Krueger noted, the median price for sales of existing homes rose 5.7 percent last month from July 1996, to $192,810, the largest such increase since January 1990.
Not every index is splendid. Unemployment statewide is running about 6 percent, a little more than a percentage point above the national level, but well below the nearly 10 percent unemployment rate in New York City, for example.
Los Angeles County has lagged behind Northern California, still claiming about 200,000 fewer jobs than it did before the recession despite strong growth in entertainment, international trade and a garment center that for the last three years or so has surpassed New York City's in employment. In the 1980's, greater Los Angeles accounted for about one-third of the state's overall economy. Today, with California's total economy surpassing $1 trillion a year for the first time, that figure is closer to one-quarter.
"For the last couple of years the state has started to step out smartly," said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation, a private organization that tries to foster economic growth and jobs in the region. "Los Angeles County is more like a 747 fully loaded and ready to rumble down the runway."
The state's politics reflect the turnaround. A seven-week standoff over the budget this summer was largely driven not by apportioning pain but by dividing spoils, in the form of a projected $1.3 billion surplus in tax revenue. In the end, because legislative Democrats would not agree to Gov. Pete Wilson's proposals, including a tax cut, the Governor ended the fight by unilaterally deciding to use the surplus to repay a debt owed to the state pension fund, leaving little to fight over.
Mr. Wilson is barred from seeking a third term next year, but the latest statewide Field Poll, made public last week, showed that the economy had given him a political bounce. It found that 32 percent of the 500 adults surveyed rated his job performance as good or very good, an increase from 27 percent earlier this year and the Governor's highest rating since February 1991, just after he took office. The bad news: 38 percent still rated Mr. Wilson's performance as poor or very poor. The poll's margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points.
How Mr. Wilson's successor will cope with the state's expected growth is another matter. Under Gov. Edmund G. Brown in the late 1950's and 60's, the state built a network of public education institutions that was the envy of the nation, and miles of freeways and public works. But since the passage of Proposition 13, the 1978 ballot measure that capped property taxes, that legacy has crumbled substantially.
"Does the state have the will to lay down the public investment and planning that will need to take place so this growth doesn't cause a degradation in public services and the quality of life?" asked Mr. Levy, of the economic study center. "That's what we did in the 60's. Some things will be harder now -- the air and water, for example. But we'll have to build fewer schools than we did in that period.
"If the candidates are serious," Mr. Levy added, "that's what the 1998 governor's race should be about."

HEADLINE: Federal Appeals Panel Overturns Loan-Sharking Conspiracy Conviction

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER

 BODY:
A Federal appeals court in Manhattan last week overturned the conviction of a man accused in a loan-sharking conspiracy, saying that prosecutors introduced evidence at trial that they knew was false.
Legal experts yesterday described the court's action as unusual. 
 The defendant, Charles A. Urrego, who is in a Federal prison in Otisville, N.Y., has already served about five years of an eight-year sentence for his 1995 conviction on two counts in the loan-sharking conspiracy, as well as on two lesser counts that were not overturned by the court, said his lawyer, Gerald J. DiChiara.
Mr. DiChiara said he would ask the Federal judge who presided at Mr. Urrego's trial to release his client while the Government decides whether it will retry Mr. Urrego.
"It is clear that the Government knowingly presented false evidence," Chief Judge Ralph K. Winter wrote for a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in reversing the conviction and ordering the case sent back for a new trial.
The decision, which was released on Friday, also said that other evidence was introduced at trial that was "otherwise so misleading as to amount to falsity."
A spokesman for Zachary W. Carter, the chief Federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, whose office prosecuted the case, said that office would have no comment on the matter until it had more time to review the decision. But in legal briefs to the court of appeals, prosecutors denied that they had knowingly presented false testimony, and said the evidence in question was "relatively minor when compared with the overall record."
The court did not recommend any disciplinary actions against prosecutors in Mr. Carter's office.
In briefs before the appeals court, prosecutors described Mr. Urrego as a 240-pound bodybuilder known as Charlie Arms, who charged interest of up to 253 percent and used the threat of physical violence to insure timely payment of his loans. During his trial, prosecutors contended that Mr. Urrego was involved in a conspiracy in which he lent money to associates, who in turn lent it again. At the time of his arrest in 1992, prosecutors said, Mr. Urrego had $500,000 "out on the street" in loans.
The appeals court said that important evidence in the Government's case against Mr. Urrego was records seized from Anthony Pietrosanti, who was accused of being an accomplice. The records purportedly contained lists of names, loan amounts and interest rates that prosecutors said proved a conspiracy.
But the appeals court said that prosecutors had been told by Mr. Pietrosanti that "the records seized from him were entirely fictitious and that the money he borrowed from Urrego was strictly for his personal use as a compulsive gambler."
Prosecutors checked some of the information in the records and determined that it was false, the court said. The Government later dropped similar conspiracy charges that it had brought against Mr. Pietrosanti, the appeals court said, but used the same records against Mr. Urrego, without disclosing to his lawyer what Mr. Pietrosanti had said about the material. Prosecutors in their briefs later conceded that they should have turned over the disputed material to the defense but also suggested that they did not believe they were improperly withholding evidence.
In his trial, Mr. Urrego's defense centered on his contention that there was no loan-sharking conspiracy. His lawyer argued that while Mr. Urrego did lend money at usurious rates, there were no threats of violence or harm and those who received the money did not lend it again, but rather used it for gambling and other personal expenses.
Judge Winter said that the Government, "having been told by the author of the records that they were bogus, having verified that unwelcome fact as to two names," stopped checking the rest of the information.
The court's action was joined by Appellate Judge James L. Oakes and Federal District Judge Leonard B. Sand (who was sitting by special designation).
Legal experts said the move was unusual. While defense lawyers frequently assert that prosecutors are using false evidence in a trial, "the claim is raised much more often than it succeeds," said Eric M. Freedman, professor of law at Hofstra University. When it does succeed, he said, "then one very appropriately asks the U.S. Attorney: 'What are your systems and procedures that led to this?' "
The court did not overturn two separate counts -- filing a false tax return and filing a false bank loan application -- for which Mr. Urrego was convicted.

HEADLINE: Libertarian Nominee Seeks Public Campaign Funds

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
Murray Sabrin, a college finance professor who is the Libertarian Party candidate for New Jersey governor, said today that he has raised enough money to qualify for matching taxpayer dollars under the state program that publicly finances the gubernatorial contest.
Mr. Sabrin, 50, of Leonia, would be the first third-party candidate to qualify for matching campaign funds in a general election since New Jersey imposed strict limits on campaign spending and contributions and began publicly financing the governor's race in 1977. 
 He would also be allowed to participate in two televised debates this fall with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and State Senator James E. McGreevey, the Democratic Party's nominee. State law requires gubernatorial candidates who receive taxpayer dollars for their campaigns to appear in at least two televised debates. The state's Election Enforcement Commission is now reviewing Mr. Sabrin's request, which it is likely to approve.
To qualify for matching funds, a candidate must raise and spend a minimum of $210,000. Mr. Sabrin, who teaches at Ramapo College in Mahwah, said he had raised $236,050 for his campaign in the last few months from supporters in New Jersey and from members of the Libertarian Party across the nation. Under state law, he would qualify for $334,100 in matching funds.
The first $69,000 that a candidate raises is not matched. But each dollar a candidate raises after $69,000 is matched with two taxpayer dollars under the state program. To qualify for the maximum of $4.6 million in public matching funds, a candidate must raise $2.3 million and agree to limit individual contributions to $2,100 and to hold total spending to $6.9 million.
For the general election, Governor Whitman has raised more than $2 million and is eligible to receive $4 million in matching funds. Mr. McGreevey is lagging behind in fund-raising, but he said that he is confident that he will be able to qualify for full matching funds. So far, he has raised about $1.1 million and has applied for about $2 million in matching funds.
It is unclear what impact Mr. Sabrin will have on the gubernatorial race. Aides to Mr. McGreevey said they believed that Mr. Sabrin's candidacy could pull support by some conservative voters from Governor Whitman. But aides to Governor Whitman said that Mr. Sabrin could also take away votes from Mr. McGreevey. There are least a half-dozen other third-party candidates running for governor, but Mr. Sabrin is the first to apply for public funds and possibly to participate in the two televised debates.
"I welcome him into the fray," Mr. McGreevey said.
Governor Whitman echoed those sentiments. "I welcome him into the race," she said.
Mr. Sabrin, who earned a doctorate in economics from Rutgers University and has taught at Ramapo College for 12 years, said the gubernatorial contest was his first bid for public office. "I am not entering this to spoil anyone's chances," he said. "I'm running this to win."
Mr. Sabrin said that Libertarian Party leaders approached him about the candidacy last spring. He said he became a member of the Libertarian Party almost two decades ago because he believes in its antigovernment philosophy. "If government has done such a good job, why do we have so many problems?" he said.
Mr. Sabrin said he opposes gun control and believes that individuals should be allowed to carry concealed weapons. He also supports the legalization of drugs. In addition, he said that, if elected, he would dismantle the state agency that oversees the protection of abused and neglected children, and give their responsibilities to nonprofit agencies. Eventually, he said, he would like to turn over the entire state social services system to nonprofit agencies. He said, however, that he would not give any state money to such agencies.
He also objected to the current public education system, saying that parents should be able to use public dollars to send their children to private schools. He also said that he would abolish the State Department of Education and leave all decisions about education up to local officials. And he promised to cut taxes and reduce the size of government.
On automobile insurance, which has emerged as the most contentious issue in this race, Mr. Sabrin said that he would support deregulation of the insurance industry. He said that rates would come down because of increased competition among insurance companies. The state's regulation of the industry, he said, has reduced competition and driven up the cost of auto insurance.

HEADLINE: Korean-Americans Assist an Ailing Envoy From the North

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 2

 BODY:
North Korea's representative at the United Nations, who has been hospitalized in New York since Aug. 12 without medical insurance or financial help from his impoverished Government, has received pledges of aid from Korean-Americans, according to Korean-language newspapers. The prospective donors, who are believed to be of varying political views, apparently fear that the envoy, Kim Hyong U, could be recalled by Pyongyang and sent home without treatment.
Mr. Kim, 62, is a patient at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan, where he is undergoing tests, hospital officials said today. They said they could not give more details about his health without his consent. 
 Korean-American newspapers first reported on Friday that the envoy, whom they described as a diabetic, had developed lung problems and had been admitted to the hospital with the help of a Korean-American clergyman and Korean-speaking American doctors.
North Korea has no hard currency to support its missions abroad, and North Korean diplomats do not have health insurance, diplomats from other countries said. Most other missions subsidize or sometimes pay fully the medical insurance of diplomats and their families, who usually face far higher health costs in New York than in their home countries.
The Korea Times, a Korean-language paper published in New York, reported on Aug. 29 that there were also concerns but no evidence that Mr. Kim was considering defection and thus was under suspicion after two other North Korean envoys -- Chang Sung Gil, Ambassador in Cairo, and his brother, Chang Sung Ho, a trade mission official in Paris -- were given asylum in the United States a week ago.
The Korea Central Daily News, another local Korean-language paper, reported on the same day that Ambassador Kim faced medical bills that could range as high as $40,000 to $50,000. The paper said that although Mr. Kim had no hope of government help, hospital officials had been told that there would be local sources of support, apparently from a number of anonymous donors who rallied to the envoy's cause.
American diplomats dealing with problems arising between foreign missions and institutions of all kinds in the United States said today that they were not aware of Mr. Kim's plight. The United States does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, whose radical Communist Covernment is considered by Washington to have committed acts of international terrorism like assassinating South Korean Cabinet members and blowing up a passenger aircraft.
The Clinton Administration says that Pyongyang is also selling weapons to enemies of Washington, most recently missiles to Iran. Talks between the United States and North Korea on missile exports were broken off last week after the Cairo and Paris defections.
Washington, however, has been contributing to an international fund to send food to the North Koreans, who are facing severe famine after two years of floods and now a summer-long drought. The country's economy has been steadily deteriorating for decades under a nationalistic "self-reliance" system that turned its back on the outside world and left the country's farmland depleted and its treasury bare.
A diplomat at the North Korean mission who was not identified denied today that Mr. Kim was still in the hospital. "He is at home and he is fine," he said, demanding to know why a newspaper was asking questions about the envoy.
North Korea is one of the world's most secretive countries. Various people involved with Mr. Kim's case, in and out of the hospital, say that it has been very difficult to communicate with the mission to discuss the diplomat's treatment.
A Korean-speaking doctor treating Mr. Kim said that he could not disclose details of the envoy's condition because of hospital rules protecting the privacy of patients unless the envoy agreed to make the nature of his illness public. Hospital staff members say the ambassador is visited frequently by his wife and now and then by another member of the North Korean mission staff but is otherwise alone.

HEADLINE: Stocks Roar Into September, With the Dow Surging 257.36

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
After suffering through a turbulent August selloff, the stock market roared back to life yesterday, posting some of the biggest gains of the decade.
The Dow Jones industrial average soared 257.36 points, or 3.38 percent, to 7,879.78 -- its largest single-day point gain ever and its biggest percentage rise in nearly six years. 
 Investors returned from the Labor Day weekend with a vengeance, snatching up many recently battered blue chips and generally doing what they have done throughout the length of this bull market: buying when stock prices fall. Analysts called it another sign that the market remains resilient.
"This tells me that there's still a lot of healthy optimism about stocks out there," said Hugh Johnson, a market analyst at the First Albany Corporation. "There's still a lot of buying power."
Broader measures also rose sharply. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index surged 28.11 points, or 3.13 percent, to close at 927.58, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 30.77 points, or 1.94 percent, to 1,618.09.
Shares of smaller companies, which easily outperformed the blue chips last month, also rose, if not as sharply. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks gained 4.62 points, or 1.09 percent, to 428.05, a closing high.
While the stock market has been on course for one of its best years ever, the journey has been rocky. A sharp 9.8 percent selloff in the Dow during March and April was followed by one of its strongest rallies ever through July, only to be hit by a staggering late-summer dive.
But, with yesterday's gains, the Dow halted, at least for now, a nasty downturn that saw it fall 7.7 percent from the closing high of 8,259.31 it set on Aug. 6.
No matter what happens from here on, the market is likely to remain volatile. Already this year, 30 percent of trading sessions have ended with the Dow rising or falling 1 percent or more.
Market sentiment turned optimistic early yesterday, as European markets gained and several Asian stock indexes stabilized after sharp selloffs. In addition, the dollar rose strongly against the German mark and Japanese yen, suggesting robust demand for dollars, which could translate into greater interest in American equities.
As a result, buying pushed the Dow and other indexes higher from the opening bell, even though bond prices drifted lower. Then, at 10 A.M., the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that manufacturing activity had been slower than expected in August, easing fears of inflation. Bond prices rebounded on the news, and stock prices soared even higher.
Another engine driving the rally, analysts said, was the fact that prices had been deeply depressed during the last few weeks, and on low trading volume. That created what market analysts call an "oversold" condition.
"We had a bond-friendly manufacturing number, and many people thought the market was oversold in an exaggerated way last week, and so you got a bounce," said Charles Pradilla, a market strategist at Cowen & Company.
For blue-chip issues, such as General Electric, it was the first time in weeks that they had outperformed smaller-company issues. Analysts said that the shares of many multinational corporations had been beaten down by growing concerns that they had become too expensive.
But some market watchers said that despite the sharp selloff in blue-chip stocks last month investors were quietly buying small quantities of them and positioning for more.
"This is the equivalent of playing poker with someone who complains about the stale cigars and the warm beer and then raises you 10 bucks," said Laszlo Birinyi, head of Birinyi Associates, a market research firm in Greenwich, Conn.
Mr. Birinyi said that even while the Dow was plummeting in August, money flows into Dow stocks were rising -- meaning that the losses were masking investor interest.
"Money flows look at every single trade; they don't assume that where a stock closed is how things are," he said.
"And the money flows tell you buyers never went away. What happened today is not that buyers came in, it's that they showed their hands."
Yesterday, though, a good deal of the buying appeared to be the work of institutional investors. Birinyi tracked eight large computer-generated program trades, and traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange talked about an orderly march higher that had been carried along by big trades.
"There was a lot of program trading going on," Joseph Yurman, a managing director at Robertson Stephens, said from the floor of the exchange. "The boys were very active. All the stuff today is being done by machines."
Despite yesterday's enormous gains, Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company, said that the market was still headed for a sharp decline later this year.
"I don't think this is the beginning of a new bull leg," he said. "The economy is going to pick up and interest rates are going to go higher. And the market can't handle that."
Still, for the session, the attitude was "Buy 'em," as Alfred Goldman, a market strategist at A. G. Edwards Inc. in St. Louis, headlined a fax sent out yesterday.
And buy they did. Of the Dow's 30 component stocks, 29 gained yesterday, led by Procter & Gamble, up 4 7/8 a share, to 138; J. P. Morgan, up 4 5/16, to 111 13/16; Merck, up 3 7/8, to 95 11/16, and G.E., up 3 5/8, to 66 3/16.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Growth Eased In August, Purchasers Report

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
An important measure of manufacturing activity grew at a slower rate in August as factories contended with bulging inventories and the strike against United Parcel Service.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday that its factory index fell to 56.8 last month from 58.6 in July, reflecting a drop in orders and production. Analysts had expected an August reading of 58.3. A reading of 50 or more means manufacturing is expanding, while a reading below 50 signals a contraction. 
 Stocks and bonds rose after the release of the index, which market participants viewed as a signal that the Federal Reserve was less likely to raise interest rates to cool down the economy. Indeed, the August decline suggests that a buildup in business inventories during the second quarter has been "restraining growth in the industrial sector" during the current quarter, said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Barnett Banks in Jacksonville, Fla.
Moreover, the purchasing association said that almost all of the businesses in the survey reported they had experienced difficulty getting goods from their suppliers. More than half said the strike affected deliveries to customers.
The purchasing managers reported that the rate of inventory liquidation increased during August, while the backlog of unfilled orders also remained at a high level. That, plus slower delivery times, suggested demand might remain high in the months ahead -- if the numbers were not distorted by the parcel strike.
David Wyss, an economist with DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass., said, "If there's a worry, it's that delivery times are getting longer, and that's a sign it's time for people to think about charging higher prices."
That concern is not shared by all analysts, however. For the Fed, which is particularly interested in delivery times, the strike "is a very important consideration," said Lyle Gramley, a former governor of the central bank and now an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
Norbert Ore, chairman of the purchasing association's business survey committee and director of purchasing at the Sonoco Products Company, a paper maker, said that over the long haul, the effects of the strike would be short-lived.
Today's report also showed that the association's prices-paid index, considered by some an indication of the inflation rate, rose to 53.8 in August from 53.6 in July.
The employment index pointed to the sixth consecutive monthly increase in factory hiring, climbing to 52 in August from 50.7 in July. That suggests the Government's August employment report, set for release Friday, could point to a gain of 185,000 jobs, excluding the effects of the strike, said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in New York.
The indexes do not gauge how much factories produced or how much prices rose or fell. Instead, they measure the number of manufacturers surveyed that reported increased production or higher prices for raw materials.

HEADLINE: U.S. Budget Analysis Predicts Shift to Big Surpluses in 2002

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 2

 BODY:
In the first authoritative analysis of the new tax and spending bills signed by President Clinton, the Congressional Budget Office said today that the measures would not only balance the Federal budget, but also generate substantial surpluses after 2001.
The report will set the tone for Congressional debate on Federal spending for the next six months, at least. The projected surpluses are likely to whet the appetites of members of Congress who want to spend more, or to cut taxes further. 
 The Congressional Budget Office predicts that the Federal deficit will exceed its current level in each of the next four years, but will disappear after 2001. Then, it says, the surpluses will begin, starting with $32 billion in 2002 and $13 billion in 2003, rising to $86 billion in 2007.
June E. O'Neill, director of the Congressional Budget Office, described the strong performance of the economy this year as surprising. She predicted that economic growth would continue, though at a slower rate, as inflation and unemployment crept up in coming years.
An unexpected surge of new revenue will cut the deficit for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, to $34 billion, the lowest since 1974, the budget office said. The deficit last year was $107 billion, and in January the budget office was predicting that it would be $124 billion this year, while the White House was saying it would be $126 billion.
The economy has performed beyond the wildest expectations of most forecasters for a couple of years. The White House Office of Management and Budget has had marginally more optimistic economic forecasts than the Congressional Budget Office. But both substantially overestimated what the deficit would be for the current fiscal year.
The Congressional Budget Office offered a couple of remarkable statistics to explain the Government's strong fiscal condition.
Federal revenue this year will be equivalent to 19.8 percent of the nation's total economic output, or gross domestic product -- the highest level since the end of World War II. Federal outlays, by contrast, will be equivalent to 20.3 percent of economic output, the lowest level since 1979.
Another statistic shows how the just-completed budget deal may lighten the burden of Federal debt and Federal interest costs, one of the Government's few truly irrevocable commitments.
Federal debt held by the public, in the form of Treasury securities, is now close to 50 percent of the gross domestic product. But it will shrink to 40 percent in 2002 and 30 percent in 2007 under the latest projections by the Congressional Budget Office.
Under these estimates, Federal debt held by the public, which represents the accumulated total of all borrowing over the years, will peak at $4 trillion in 2001. Then it will decline, assuming that the Government posts surpluses in later years, the budget office said.
Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said the projected surpluses would pose a political temptation to many lawmakers. "Surpluses burn a hole in politicians' pockets," Mr. Reischauer said. "It's never too soon to start spending money that you aren't sure you will have."
Mr. Reischauer said, for example, that revenue from auctioning the privilege of using the airwaves for commercial purposes, like broadcasting and cellular telephone service, "could prove to be pie in the sky."
The budget office said that weakness in the economy or a failure to abide by the spending limits of the budget deal could jeopardize the projected surpluses.
"In particular," it said, "the onset of a recession could push the deficit above current projections by $100 billion or more for several years."
Today's report from the Congressional Budget Office also made these points:
*The Federal deficit will rise to $57 billion next year, up $23 billion from this year's figure. It will decline in each subsequent year, to $36 billion in 2001.
*Taken together, the budget and tax bills signed by President Clinton on Aug. 5 will cut projected Federal spending by a total of $198 billion in the next five years. But the laws give away $80 billion in tax cuts, so the net savings are $118 billion.
*The loss of revenue under the new laws is "twice as big in the second five years as in the first five" -- $162 billion versus $80 billion.
But the report may ease the concerns of Democrats who predicted that the tax law would, as Mr. Clinton said, "explode the deficit" after 2007. While the revenue losses will continue beyond 2007, they will grow more slowly than the economy as a whole, the budget office said.

HEADLINE: HOSPITALS OF LAST RESORT A special report.;
Hospitals Serving the Poor Struggle to Retain Patients

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

DATELINE: EL PASO

 BODY:
On a cloudy Saturday this summer, two teen-agers gave birth in this West Texas border town.
One, a 17-year old impoverished Mexican girl, slipped across the border to have her baby boy delivered by a lay midwife here, making him an American citizen. The child, born with devastating birth defects, was sent for immediate surgery to R. E. Thomason General Hospital, the local public hospital charged with caring for the sick, regardless of their ability to pay. The surgery, plus weeks of intensive care, saved the baby's life, but it cost Thomason and taxpayers some $40,000, not a penny of which is likely to be reimbursed. 
 The other teen-ager, an 18-year-old El Pasoan, was also poor. In the past, she, too, as a Medicaid patient, would probably have used Thomason, in one of the city's grittiest neighborhoods. But these days, pregnant women on Medicaid are welcome at any hospital in town, so she chose the upscale, private Providence Hospital, where she had a trouble-free delivery.
Therein lies a profound change in the nation's health-care system. With the advent of managed care and lower fees for doctors and medical services, patients with private insurance are not as lucrative as they once were. This has pushed private hospitals and doctors to court the Medicaid patients they once shunned, mindful of the government dollars such patients bring with them.
At the same time, as Medicaid recipients turn to private care, public hospitals like Thomason are increasingly left with few patients but those nobody wants -- the uninsured, AIDS patients, drug addicts and illegal immigrants.
"Everyone wants low-risk OB cases, but no one's competing for the drug-addicted H.I.V. patient," said Christine Burch, executive director of the National Association of Public Hospitals.
For patients on Medicaid, the nation's health insurance program for the poor, this shift has created a wealth of possibilities -- including, some say, access to more comfortable hospitals and more respectful treatment. But for hospitals like Thomason, the change poses vexing problems: They must not only compete harder for the Medicaid recipients who make up the bulk of their paying patients but also fight the perception that they offer second-class care.
The change highlights the great unfinished business of the American health-care revolution: In the increasingly competitive hospital market, who will care for the poorest of the poor, and the uninsured?
The nightmare scenario, health experts say, is a downward spiral in which the desirable patients -- and then the desirable doctors -- forsake public hospitals as sinkholes of medicine. The erosion of the nation's public hospitals, exacerbated by cost-cutting by cities and states, raises special concern about the future of the uninsured, whose numbers now top 43 million.
Five years ago, President Clinton went to Washington promising to revamp the nation's health-care system, deflate medical inflation and extend coverage to the uninsured. While his Government-based plan went down in flames, the system has nonetheless been utterly reordered, mostly by the private sector. Costs are under control; that has been the why and wherefore of the managed-care revolution. But in the fury of cost-cutting and competition, the goal of caring for the uninsured has become more remote, even as their numbers increase.
According to a 1994 study by the Project Hope Center for Health Affairs, a research group based in Bethesda, Md., 33 percent of poor, uninsured people had no regular source of medical care. In the 1982 version of the study, 23 percent lacked such care.
"Everyone's moving in the direction of managed care, but the uninsured don't fit in with that," said Dennis Andrulis, president of the National Public Health and Hospital Institute, a nonprofit policy group based in Washington. "No one seems to be stepping back and saying, 'Whoa, there's more than 40 million uninsured; how do we integrate them if they're not supported by some managed-care system?' So they're increasingly marginalized as the system changes."
But public hospitals do more than just care for the uninsured. They also protect community health overall, offering important but money-losing services like trauma centers and burn units, treating public health threats like AIDS or drug-resistant tuberculosis, and creating outreach programs for high-risk pregnancies, violence prevention or immigrant health.
Across the country, from New York City, which has the nation's most ambitious network of municipal hospitals, to California, where several public hospitals have been sold, there is increasing debate about the role and financing of those that remain.
"The mood in the whole country right now is that nobody wants to increase taxes," Ms. Burch, of the public hospital association, said. "There's been a strong sentiment that business does things better than government does, and that spills over to people's attitudes toward public hospitals. Also, with low occupancy rates, because the country has too many hospitals, I think people are questioning how much we need public hospitals."
The number of public hospitals declined by more than 25 percent from 1981 to 1993, although most did not close, but simply went private, sometimes retaining their mission to the poor.
New York City's municipal hospitals are struggling to hold on to their Medicaid patients, even as the prestigious private hospitals that once shunned such patients are busily building primary care centers to compete directly with the city's 11 public hospitals and their outpatient clinics.
Across the country, many public hospitals that have so far been able to maintain their level of services, like Thomason, are increasingly hard-pressed to keep up.
And there is evidence that the private hospitals are not likely to do much to pick up the charity-care load. In a report last year, the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, a Federal advisory panel that examines Medicare policy for Congress, cited research showing that as managed-care companies and insurers tightened their payments to hospitals, most cut back on free care. According to the report, the ones that typically provided the least free care have cut back the most.
But given current trends, health experts say, the safety-net hospitals, like Thomason, will be forced to scale back, too.
"Even hospitals with missions have limited resources, and when those resources are constrained, they do less," said Judith Feder, a professor of public policy at Georgetown University and an architect of the Clinton Administration's failed health plan.
 
The Mission
Hospital Care For the Poor
It is impossible to forget even for a moment that El Paso is a border town, with two big downtown bridges to Ciudad Juarez in Mexico, immigration officials spaced closely along the barbed wire fence that follows the Rio Grande, and a population that is 70 percent Hispanic.
If Mexico is always present in the hot dry air, so, too, is a grinding poverty. Thomason hospital serves an area where the median per capita income is just $11,300, making it the nation's third poorest community of its size. One in three El Paso residents has no health insurance, far higher than the national average.
Both the border and the poverty present special challenges for Thomason, which serves the people of El Paso, and others from West Texas, southern New Mexico and Mexico.
Since 1915, care for the needy has been the mission of Thomason. The hospital is the dominating presence in its neighborhood. Its emergency room serves 52,000 people a year, many of them lacking any other source of medical care. Its obstetric department delivers more than a third of the babies in El Paso. And its trauma center, the only one in town, cares for horrific injuries from car crashes and gunshots.
Legally, Thomason is required to care for residents of the county -- or, in a loophole wider than the Rio Grande, those who intend to become residents. In the last fiscal year, Thomason provided $40 million in charity care to the indigent; hundreds of people were billed but did not pay for an additional $37 million in care.
Many of Thomason's patients are El Paso's working people. They earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but are too stretched financially to afford private insurance. Others, like the newborn who needed extensive surgery this summer, or the woman who was hit by a car on a highway near the border and needed thousands of dollars worth of surgery and hardware to repair her leg, have just crossed from Mexico.
Thomason gets about $37 million of its $100 million operating budget from Medicaid. Another $31 million comes from local taxes, and only $3 million -- just four cents on each dollar billed -- from uninsured patients who pay out of pocket.
But as Medicaid patients abandon Thomason for other hospitals, the uninsured are coming to represent an increasing share of the patients. Medicaid patients made up 39 percent of the hospital's patients, and uninsured people 40 percent, in fiscal 1994; two years later, the Medicaid share was down to 34, and the uninsured up to 47 percent.
Another looming threat is the downsizing of the Federal aid program for hospitals that care for a disproportionate share of indigent patients, a reduction that will probably trickle down to Thomason as a multimillion-dollar cut in the $26 million the program pays.
Pete Duarte, the chief executive of Thomason, said his hospital faced a special burden for charity care after private investors had taken over all the other hospitals in El Paso -- the birthplace of Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, the nation's largest for-profit health-care chain.
Under Federal law, every hospital must stabilize any patient who shows up at the emergency room in critical condition. But they need not provide non-emergency care, and Mr. Duarte, like executives at other safety-net hospitals nationwide, said he believes that for-profit hospitals are especially quick to pass on uninsured patients.
"Providence was the last private not-for-profit hospital here, and when it was sold to Tenet, we saw a 10 percent increase in our charity care cost," he said.
Mr. Duarte identifies strongly with the patients who depend on his hospital.
"I was born in a public hospital in California," he said. "When I was 13, I had my first operation, eye surgery, in a public hospital. Two years later, I had leg reconstruction after a football injury, in a public hospital. And both my parents spent the last days of their lives in public hospitals."
When Mr. Duarte came to Thomason five years ago, he did not look like the typical hospital administrator -- and the initial reception he got was anything but executive treatment.
"I had a mohawk and an ear clip," said Mr. Duarte, who has traded the mohawk for a ponytail. "And a lot of the employees, when I said hello, they would look past me; they wouldn't respond. I was amazed at the coldness of the reception. And of course, if people don't treat the C.E.O. respectfully, you know they're not treating patients respectfully. So I started an R & D program that I hope will be my legacy -- Respect and Dignity."
Mr. Duarte argues that medically, Thomason is the best hospital in El Paso, the only one in town to be included, for the second year in a row, among the nation's top 100 hospitals, as compiled by Mercer Health Care Provider Consulting. But that is not enough.
"My frustration is that in this country, people think public hospitals are for the homeless, the people on welfare, the drug dealers and all those crazies," Mr. Duarte said. "Everybody knows the best medical care is at teaching hospitals, and in El Paso, this is it. But people who have a choice will not come here unless they are treated with respect and dignity."
 
The Competition
An Effort to Woo The Medicaid Mom
Last year, on Mother's Day, the El Paso Herald-Post ran a large advertisement listing the names, addresses and telephone numbers of 28 local obstetricians.
"Your Doctor, Your Choice," it said. "The following obstetricians in El Paso also welcome pregnant patients with Medicaid insurance to their private practice."
In the battle for Medicaid patients, obstetrics is the front line, and advertising has been the weapon of choice.
Maternity care has long been Thomason's one reliable money-maker, a cash cow that supported less profitable departments. In 1993, more than 7,000 of the 17,000 babies born in El Paso were delivered at Thomason, most paid for by Medicaid.
"Four years ago, no question, almost anyone on Medicaid having a baby would do it at Thomason," said Lydia Ramos, nurse-manager of the obstetric/gynecology clinic.
But now that the $2,002 that Medicaid pays a hospital for a delivery holds up nicely against managed-care rates, El Paso's private hospitals -- like hospitals nationwide -- are eager to appeal to Medicaid moms.
"They've got the Jacuzzi, the customized bedspread, the soft lights," Mr. Duarte said. "We have the lowest C-section rate, and great care, but Thomason can't spend public money to buy car seats to give away."
The private obstetricians, and the women choosing them over Thomason, said the amenities are beside the point.
Maria Leyva vowed four years ago never to return to Thomason after losing a six-month pregnancy there.
"They ignore you. It's crazy with so many people running around, and you never know who's going to deliver your baby," said Ms. Leyva, a Medicaid patient whose third child was born recently at Providence. "They're inhuman. The doctor didn't even talk to us when the baby died; just left it to the nurse."
"This time I knew I was high risk, and I wanted a private doctor who would take care of me through the whole pregnancy," she said. "It's been very different. I went to Providence for a test, and the nurses really talked to me, like a person. The car seat's nice, but what's important is how the doctors and nurses treat you."
Dr. Franz Theard, Ms. Leyva's doctor, said Medicaid patients make up 40 percent of his practice, compared with about 5 percent five years ago.
Thomason is feeling the change. On many days, the hospital gets fewer than half of El Paso's Medicaid-covered deliveries on a given day. Last year, the hospital delivered 5,890 babies, a 16 percent drop since 1993.
That decline has been alarming both to the hospital and to Texas Tech, the medical school that provides the hospital's doctors and runs the outpatient clinics, including the huge obstetric/gynecology clinic.
"We had 1,000 patient visits a week," Ms. Ramos, the nurse-manager, said. "Then we began dropping, down to 700-800. Women were coming here to get their lab work, and the initial Medicaid paperwork, and then going somewhere else. And we were getting paid zip."
Watching the Medicaid moms, and reimbursements, drain away to other hospitals, Texas Tech took drastic action, which has stirred tension both at Thomason and throughout the El Paso medical community.
"Last fall, we decided that if we were going to be able to keep up our patient numbers, and serve our patients, our faculty had to go out and deliver at other hospitals when women asked them to," Ms. Ramos said. "So now we're back up to 1,000 patients a week -- but 20 to 25 percent of our deliveries are at other hospitals."
Many private obstetricians are annoyed by the competition -- and by Texas Tech's extensive marketing campaign, complete with a Super Bowl advertisement and billboards recommending its doctors.
"It bothers me no end," Dr. Theard said. " If you want to chase patients, go into private practice."
But Ms. Ramos is infuriated when private doctors who welcomed women as obstetric patients send them back to the clinic if they need further gynecologic care but are no longer eligible for Medicaid.
"I've gotten so mad I've called the doctors," she said. "I say I understand you're sending me so-and-so. You delivered her baby, and now she has an abnormal Pap smear, and you won't treat her because she's not on Medicaid? And I hear the click when they hang up."
Some Texas Tech obstetricians will deliver babies only at Thomason. But others see their willingness to go elsewhere as a way both to give women on Medicaid more choices, and to keep up a high enough patient load, and revenues, to continue their care for the indigent.
Many at Thomason, though, see it simply as betrayal.
"It's bothersome, to see them abandoning ship like this," said Lisa Fisher, Thomason's post-partum nurse-manager. "I think they're trying to get their foot in the door at other hospitals, in case something happens here."
Ms. Fisher estimates, and interviews on the maternity ward confirm, that about half of Thomason's maternity patients actively chose the hospital, while the rest did not know they had a choice. Thomason is renovating its obstetric ward to impress maternity patients, moving from Pepto-Bismol pink walls to a softer peach, from double rooms to singles, and from the old system of separate rooms for labor, delivery and recovery to a setup that keeps women in the same room for all three.
Still, what began with obstetrics is spreading to other specialties. Kent Giles, the hospital's chief financial officer, said deliveries were the only major hospital service that dropped sharply last year. But in this fiscal year, there are declines in every major department: the obstetric patient count is down 21 percent compared with the same period last year, and general medicine, oncology, pulmonary medicine, general surgery, nephrology and orthopedics have all dropped more than 10 percent.
"I don't think there's less need out there," Mr. Giles said. "I think it's fewer Medicaid patients coming here. We're concerned. We haven't had cutbacks yet, but we've gotten very careful about who we replace."
 
The Future
A New Emphasis On Marketing
Thomason may already be reeling from the rapid changes in the hospital market, but the really big change -- the one by which it will live or die -- is still to come.
And soon.
Medicaid managed care will hit Texas next year. And when it does, Thomason will have to go head-to-head with other providers to get the opportunity to care for Medicaid patients.
State by state, the nation is moving toward a new system of managing Medicaid, one in which people on Medicaid will join managed-care plans that receive a set fee for each person they enroll, and take on responsibility for providing all of their care.
It is not yet clear how many providers will offer Medicaid managed-care plans in El Paso, but it is likely that Thomason and Texas Tech will put together their own offering for Medicaid recipients.
Mr. Duarte has already found out that Thomason is in an awkward position to compete, not just because of its bare-bones decor and hardscrabble neighborhood, but because of politics.
A few years ago, when it was clear that the nation was shifting to managed care, Mr. Duarte tried to put Thomason in the running for those contracts.
"We decided our best hope for the future was a hospital H.M.O., and at first everybody was very enthusiastic and supportive," he said. "But then the person developing the idea came back and said we needed to come up with another alternative because it would not be acceptable to the commissioners. We were told that the function of the hospital is not to compete."
That is political reality, Mr. Duarte said: Thomason is governed by a board of managers appointed by the County Commissioners, elected officials sensitive to the wishes of the medical community at large.
And the commissioners have not always been convinced that El Paso voters should have to pay taxes to support the hospital. Last fall, there were widespread rumors that the commissioners were looking to sell Thomason -- rumors that were denied, but not without leaving open the possibility that a sale might someday be considered.
"If we were to go out and market our services forcefully, in competition with the other hospitals, there would immediately be a political backlash," Mr. Duarte said. "Columbia and Tenet, the companies that run the for-profit hospitals, can buy tables at their fund-raisers, but we can't."
Just last year, Mr. Duarte said, he was told he could not have a marketing person in the public affairs office.
Health experts say that is a common problem in public hospitals.
"At community hospitals, nobody balks at the marketing budget, but at a public hospital, they'll question spending money on a slick brochure," said Ms. Burch, of the public hospital association. "There's not yet the understanding that this country's built on marketing, and you have to spend that money if you want to compete."
Henry Ornelas, Thomason's chief operating officer, said the commissioners were coming around as they recognized that Thomason must compete to protect its Medicaid patient base.
"We just had a meeting," he said, "and the word 'competition' has begun to flow from their mouths."
But how far that goes is still an open question. And the internal politics of any managed-care plan will be tricky.
While Thomason and Texas Tech are negotiating a closer affiliation, something akin to a merger, Mr. Duarte wants a promise that Texas Tech doctors will practice exclusively at Thomason. But Texas Tech officials see their mission more as insuring high-quality medical education than protecting Thomason's patient base, something that may mean partnerships with other hospitals as well as Thomason.
And because of Texas Tech's different mission and status, it has been able to advertise and market itself, and even to open clinics in affluent neighborhoods for patients with private insurance.
"It's tough right now," Mr. Ornelas said. "Our relationship is strained."
Whatever their differences, both institutions agree that Medicaid managed care is the key to their survival.
"We've always seen Medicaid as our market," said Dr. Jose Manuel de la Rosa, the dean of Texas Tech. "We've been good at it, and efficient enough to cost-shift from it. If we don't get into the Medicaid managed-care business successfully, we might as well just put a for-sale sign on the lawn."

HEADLINE: Padding The Empty Nest;
Couples Build Bigger as Their Children Leave Home

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE 

 BODY:
LYNN KORDA and Jules Kroll raised four children in a 5,900-square-foot home in Rye, N.Y. But now that their children are grown, they have decided to upsize, as builders say, and are planning a new house of at least 8,000 square feet.
While Charles and Elaine Evans's three children were growing up, their country house in East Hampton, N.Y., had only one bathroom in its 980 square feet. Now that the youngest is 26 and on his own, the Evanses have more than doubled the house's size -- adding 1,000 square feet, including a second story and two bathrooms. "Our means finally caught up with our past desires," Mrs. Evans said. 
 The two couples are joining the growing ranks of empty-nesters who are rejecting the traditional image of mature homeowners as people intent on cutting back and gearing down. With the last tuition check canceled and the pounding music just a ghostly echo, more couples past the breeding age are finally asking themselves how they really want to live. And surprisingly the answer often is: big.
The building industry is feeling the effects of these expansive feathered nesters. While it is a trend primarily affecting the high end, most of the more than 40 builders and developers interviewed across the country said that these clients had altered the complexion of their businesses.
"We're beginning to see the impact of baby boomers as they enter their 50's," said Boyce Thompson, the editor in chief of Builder magazine, which devoted a special section to the housing patterns of older buyers in July. "These people have a desire for larger houses and more luxuries. It has nothing to do with the needs of their children."
Thomas Bowman, a builder in Huntington, N.Y., said that half of his business is from couples with adult or nearly adult children. "One might think that the older buyers would be thinking of consolidating and making life simpler, but no, they aren't," he said. "These are people who gave up a lot for a lot of years, and now they are looking for quality of life."
The National Association of Home Builders estimates that in the year 2000, the average American house will have 2,500 square feet, up significantly from 1,900 square feet in 1977. "Everybody wants four bedrooms when they only use two for sleeping," said Gopal Ahluwalia, the association's director of research. "And in California, every house has to have three fireplaces that never get used."
At the same time, the average number of occupants per house is dropping. "It is now at 2.6," he said.
But increasingly, occupancy is a relative term, in more ways than one. Inspiration for these big houses frequently is the hope that the family -- especially grandchildren -- will like the new surroundings enough to want to visit. Often.
Mrs. Evans said that even though her children had to make do with sharing the bathroom, she hoped that the new expanded house would "pay off with the grandchildren."
Builders of custom houses speak of being asked frequently to design special features calculated to impress youngsters, including sunken ball courts, built-in bunk beds, small video arcades and pinball parlors.
"We tell people how they can design a house to be attractive to kids," said Orren Pickell, a home builder in Chicago. "First, we suggest finishing the lower level and then putting in all the things the parents won't let them do at their own home, like video games, pool and Ping-Pong tables. It's a bribe, but so what? It works."
Builders call the houses they are designing for this powerful new market "entertainment houses," "homesteads," "quarterly houses" or "transitional homes" -- anything, it seems, but "empty nests."
"I could easily plan the perfect house for the past 26 years," said Ms. Korda, 53, who is interviewing architects. The new house will be next door to the one where she and her husband, the founder of Kroll Associates, the business investigations firm, now live. "I can only begin to think about how to plan for the next 26 years."
She is already dreaming of a larger kitchen with more counter space ("I used to need lots of floor when the kids were underfoot," she said. "Now, I need counter space for all the helping hands I'll have").
Ms. Korda said she would also like a proper library for those books that she will now have the time to read, a private sitting room, a billiards room and perhaps quarters for a live-in housekeeper. And the dining room will have to be very large for family reunions ("God willing, I hope there will be lots of people someday," she said).
David Schless, the executive director of the American Seniors Housing Association, a trade group in Washington, said: "It's a trend affecting a thin segment of the population at the well-to-do end of the market. Most people stay in the same home for as long as they possibly can."
Changes in capital-gains tax laws that took effect on July 28 (raising the exemption for selling a permanent residence to $500,000 for married homeowners and $250,000 for individual taxpayers) have meant that there should soon be more large houses on the market. Previously, older people who had bought their houses relatively cheaply decades ago were discouraged from selling at a profit because of the large tax bite.
"The tax change will definitely enable many seniors to be more inclined to move," Mr. Schless said.
The current empty-nest generation is also the first one to have so many two-career, two-income families. Furthermore, it is not a foregone conclusion that earning stops with retirement, as many older people are starting second careers late in life.
"People are beginning to catch on to the possibility of a second adulthood," said Gail Sheehy, the author of "New Passages: Mapping Your Life Across Time" (Random House, 1995). "They are retiring earlier and earlier and living longer. It used to be as life contracted, so did the living space. Now, life is opening up after 50, so why not open up your surroundings?"
Adrienne Tindall describes herself and her husband, Jack, as "barely in our 60's." The Tindalls spent 28 years raising their four daughters in what she calls "a regular 3,500-square-foot house," near Chicago. "I always thought we'd just move into a condo from there," said Mrs. Tindall, who has her own home-based sacred-music publishing business.
But Mr. Tindall, an engineer, had always nursed a dream of building his own house. When their youngest daughter reached her mid-20's, they found that the value of their old house had appreciated enough that they could afford to build a new 6,000-square-foot homestead nearby: about as far from a generic condominium as imaginable, it is a timber-framed, lodge-style affair with fieldstone walls.
Since the new house was completed eight years ago, all of their four grown daughters have lived there at various times, some with husbands and children while their own new homes were being finished. As in so many contemporary houses, the living room and dining room, fast becoming as obsolete as the vestigial appendix, have been replaced by a Great Room. This one truly fits the bill, at more than 1,100 square feet.
Need and desire have never been forced bunkmates when it comes to the high end of the housing market. And one of the enviable tasks for these affluent older buyers is to figure out what their desires are.
As a builder with a keen marketing sense, Mr. Pickell understands the whims and wants of couples who are just waking up to their newfound freedom, and he has built elaborate concept houses to whet their appetites.
"I sit them down and say, 'There's no one living with you now, so why should you live the same way?' " he said. "And they always look at me as if the thought had never occurred to them."
Mr. Pickell thinks about it plenty and has suggestions for those who, he says, have "forgotten how to live on their own."
For instance, families with children need lots of doors that can be shut to cut out noise and insure privacy. With just a spouse around, he tells them, why not dispense with a few?
Then there are quarterly rooms.
"People tell us they only use the living and dining rooms on holidays," Mr. Pickell said. "So, we call them quarterly rooms," meaning that they are used only about four times a year. "And we treat them like art on the walls -- just to be looked at," he added. There might even be two master suites, one downstairs for the owners and one upstairs for visiting children with grandchildren, possibly with a separate entrance.
For some, padding the empty nest, like empire building, starts modestly enough and then expands uncontrollably. Stephanie and Sam Lebowitz, who have a house in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, started renovating the kitchen when their third child turned 20. ("As soon as we did it, I stopped cooking," Mrs. Lebowitz said.)
Within a year, the Lebowitzes had turned their attentions to their 2,500-square-foot country house on Shelter Island, where they are planning to add 1,200 square feet. They hope to put in an additional bedroom, double the living room size and turn another room into a home gym for what Mrs. Lebowitz calls an "older, fitter me."
"It is sort of weird that our house got bigger as soon as the kids were gone," she said. "The reason is part economics and part finally having the time. The fact is that our needs are shrinking and expanding at the same time. Our children are much bigger physically than they used to be, and when they visit they bring other big adults with them."
But as houses get bigger, isn't there a danger that even two full-size adults might find themselves rattling around?
Mrs. Tindall, of Illinois, said that she worried about just this. "I didn't want to feel like a lodge keeper in my own home," she said of her new 10-room house. So, she and her husband placed the master suite with a study on the ground floor. Since the Great Room is adjacent to the kitchen and since Mrs. Tindall keeps her grand piano and small pipe organ there, it is in constant use.
The Tindalls, who have eight grandchildren and are expecting one more, concentrated the guest rooms on the second floor, out of sight when out of use. They admit that they live in only the four or five rooms that cluster around the kitchen.
Tom Lewis, a custom builder in Florida, calls this type of floor plan "a home within a home."
"These houses aren't exactly built in separate pods," Mr. Lewis said, "but they are organized so that a couple can live in a reduced amount of it most of the time and not feel as if they are living in a mausoleum."
Sometimes, not using a space can be half the fun. Ken Alexander, a builder in Scottsdale, Ariz., recalled one couple who wanted to celebrate their liberation from years of happy if demanding servitude to their young.
"The main thing they wanted was a magnificent kitchen," Mr. Alexander said. "And they wanted it just so they could hang a sign on the door saying, KITCHEN CLOSED ."

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Faces a Suit By Writers

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
The Hollywood screenwriters union says it will take the City of Los Angeles to Federal court on Monday to overturn an ordinance requiring writers and artists to get city permits before they can work out of their homes.
Two smaller writers groups said yesterday that they would file briefs supporting the suit by the Writers Guild of America, which represents movie and television screenwriters. 
 Marvin J. Wolf, a freelance journalist who is president of one of the smaller groups, the Independent Writers of Southern California, said the ordinance "is a clearly unconstitutional attempt to license journalists."
"It is very clear to us," he added, "that once the city has the power to license writers, if they write something City Hall doesn't want to hear, there is the potential for city officials to deny your license or to say: 'We'll make you pay for that. Let's audit you.' "
The Writers Guild said the ordinance recalled the "tyrannical and repressive" registration system used by the former Soviet Union and other Communist countries to regulate writers.
The ordinance does not mention writers and artists. It requires all people operating businesses out of their homes to get permits and to pay either a minimum tax or a gross receipts tax of less than one-half of 1 percent on all revenues, including reimbursed expenses.
The ordinance also provides that "the City Clerk and all of his deputies shall have the power and authority to enter, free of charge, during business hours any place of business required to be registered and taxed" and makes failure to comply a misdemeanor.
Allowing inspections in the homes of writers and artists is an unconstitutional intrusion, Mr. Wolf said.
Ramona Ripston, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, said that the gross receipts tax "inevitably embroils city taxing authorities in investigations into the creative process that are at odds with First Amendment freedoms."
Ms. Ripston and others said that disputes were sure to arise over whether a check sent to the home of a writer or artist was for work performed at home and subject to the city tax or for work outside the city.
Deputy Mayor Stephanie Bradfield said Los Angeles was seriously considering the issues raised "by the writers, especially the screenwriters, because movies and television are such an important part of the economy of Los Angeles."
She added that the "suggestion that the city could regulate the content of what people write in their homes is ludicrous," and that in issuing permits to writers the city would never consider what they wrote.
The ordinance, passed last fall, allows office-type businesses to operate out of homes in Los Angeles provided they have little impact on the neighborhood. Businesses with a steady stream of clients and those receiving more than three deliveries a day are prohibited, as is what the law vaguely describes as "adult entertainment."
Mark Ryavec of Delphi Associates, the Writers Guild lobbyist, said the "adult entertainment" category was so broad that the city could deny permits to a writer of such works as "The English Patient," the novel and the movie, because of its erotic themes. The film won the Oscar for best picture this year.
Ms. Bradfield said that before the ordinance was adopted, it was technically illegal in Los Angeles to write in your home for money unless you did so as an employee. Thus a staff writer for a television series could write at home, but a writer working on contract for the same show could not.
"In this city, until this ordinance passed, you couldn't get a business license if you used your home address as a place of business because you couldn't do business in residential areas," she said. "If you are a tax preparer, an architect, an engineer, a business consultant, a legal researcher or a writer and if you want to do business legitimately in this city, you need a business license."
Ms. Bradfield said that "theoretically if you have been writing out of your home and making money on it you have owed city taxes all along."
The ordinance requires a permit, which costs $25 annually, to conduct business from a home and it imposes a gross receipts tax at various rates for various businesses. For a print writer making $30,000, the permit and the tax would total about $200 annually.
The Writers Guild said that a gross receipts tax on writers was an unconstitutional intrusion but that even if it were allowed the city could not tax writers at different rates depending on whether they worked in films, television or print.
Mr. Wolf said the tax would inevitably result in audits in which the city would seek documents identifying confidential sources, like a police officer who had lunch with a freelance journalist and told about corruption at City Hall with the understanding that his name would never be revealed.
The business license offices of three cities neighboring Los Angeles -- Long Beach, Pasadena and Santa Monica -- said that their ordinances required writers and artists to get licenses or permits to work from their homes. But senior officials in each city said they were unaware of any enforcement of the requirement.
West Hollywood, which is surrounded by Los Angeles, exempts "creative enterprises" like writing, painting and making handicrafts from its permit requirements, and Mr. Ryavec has asked Los Angeles to do the same.
New York City does not require writers to get permits or licenses to work in their homes. Shonna Keoghan, the spokeswoman for the City Consumer Affairs Department, said she could not imagine the city trying to license activity protected by the First Amendment.
Under an amnesty program, Los Angeles has given operators of the estimated 20,000 home businesses until tomorrow to file for a permit, after which the city says it will seek back taxes and a 40 percent penalty plus interest on those who fail to comply.
Gary Bostwick, a lawyer in Santa Monica, Calif., who was hired by the Writers Guild to sue the city, said that when the amnesty expired the guild would have a basis to take the city to court. He said he would file a lawsuit when the Federal Courthouse in downtown Los Angeles opened on Monday morning.
Mr. Wolf said the Independent Writers would file a "friend of the court" brief supporting the lawsuit. The Southern California chapter of the American Society of Journalists and Authors will also file a brief, its president, Carey Simon, said.
Martin Garbus, a New York lawyer who specializes in literary litigation, predicted that a Federal judge would strike down the ordinance.
"Writers don't have to have permits, period," Mr. Garbus said. "This is unconstitutional on its face. You cannot put any burden on creative expression even if all you have to do is get a permit that is free."

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most major currencies yesterday as fresh economic news from Germany and comments from the nation's central bank chief stoked fears of higher German interest rates.
Hans Tietmeyer, the president of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, warned in a newspaper interview that the bank could not ignore signs of rising prices, but stressed that it was premature to speak of a general inflationary threat. 
 He also said he welcomed the mark's recent rebound against the dollar. The dollar's decline yesterday accelerated when the German economics ministry reported that German industrial production had jumped a stronger-than-expected 3.5 percent in July.
"The industrial production number was the main reason pushing the dollar lower today," said Bob Steiner, vice president and corporate trader at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
While the majority of traders and economists predicted that the inflation-conscious Bundesbank would leave rates steady at its policy meeting today, many said that resilient growth could tip the scales toward a rate increase before the end of the year. Higher German rates would make dollar-denominated investments less attractive compared with those denominated in marks.
"There is now more focus on Germany again than we have seen in recent months," said John McCarthy, senior vice president at ING Barings Capital Markets, predicting that the mark would remain relatively strong in coming weeks.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.8203 German marks, down from 1.8335 late on Tuesday. The dollar also eased to 120.85 Japanese yen from 121.47 yen.
The dollar was bolstered by late stock market gains, but dealers called the move a "hiccup." American economic news, they added, had been largely neutral for the dollar.
A small recovery in Japanese Government bond yields and a strong showing by Tokyo stocks, following the stock rally in the United States on Tuesday, helped buoy the yen against the dollar in early trading.
The dollar had risen sharply against the yen in recent weeks, passing 120 yen on Friday, amid mounting concern about Japan's faltering economy.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Coffee Hits a 3-Month High And El Nino Gets the Blame

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Coffee futures prices jumped to a three-month high yesterday on concern that dry weather in Colombia and Central America would reduce the size and quality of the coming harvests.
"The coffee market is a weather market and everyone is trading on what may happen to the crops," said Stephen Smith, president of South Futures Ltd., a coffee trading firm in Miami. 
 July and August brought little rain to Latin America as El Nino altered normal wind and rainfall patterns, meteorologists said. The lack of rainfall came as crops matured, with harvest set to begin later this month.
As a result, Colombia's coffee crop is expected to drop to a 20-year low while output in other Latin American countries, including Costa Rica, Honduras and Guatemala, could be smaller than last year, traders said.
Coffee for December delivery rose 4.55 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $1.895 a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the contract's highest price since June 9.
On other markets, wheat slid after Egypt canceled an order and copper advanced. Wheat fell after Egypt canceled a tender for American wheat, raising speculation that the country, one of the world's largest importers, may have fulfilled its immediate needs.
Egypt sought 50,000 metric tons overnight only to cancel the order a few hours later, traders said. Egypt earlier this week purchased 100,000 tons of American wheat, the Department of Agriculture said.
Wheat for December delivery fell 4 cents, or 1.0 percent, to $3.90 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Despite yesterday's decline, wheat futures are up 18 percent since July 1 on strong export demand and concern that hot, dry weather could damage the spring wheat crop, to be harvested in coming weeks.
Copper rose as reports signaling a healthy American economy -- particularly in the construction industry, the largest user of copper -- suggested that copper demand would be strong in the coming months. Strong American demand could help copper rebound from a 20 percent drop since June 16.
Yesterday, December copper rose 1.8 cents, or 1.9 percent, to 98 cents a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Japan without a trade surplus may not be such a great idea.

BYLINE: Peter Passell 

 BODY:
HARDLY anything is going right for the Japanese economy. After a burst of growth in the first quarter, Japan is once again teetering on the brink of recession. Meanwhile, protectionist noises are beginning to emanate from America as Japan's trade surplus grows. And the Japanese economy's near-term prospects for exports of capital goods to Southeast Asia have dimmed with the collapse of the Thai baht and other regional currencies.
Japan, it seems, is trapped between the need to grow richer to pay for the retirement of its aging population and the rest of the world's ambivalence about buying the flood of Japanese goods and services needed for Japan to accumulate the necessary wealth. 
 But some economists would happily turn this conventional wisdom on its head. Without Japanese exports of capital, asks Gary Saxonhouse, who would provide the savings to develop Eastern Europe and Latin America -- or, for that matter, the capital needed to keep interest rates relatively low in the United States? "Japan is doing the world a favor," he argued.
After expanding at a phenomenal 6.6 percent rate in the first three months of the year, the Japanese economy has settled back into tepid growth -- or worse. It is hard to tell because statistics for the first half were muddled by a surge of consumption ahead of a big tax increase and then a sharp fall in retail sales as the tax increase went into effect.
What is clear is Tokyo's determination to balance the Government budget over the next few years. Mr. Saxonhouse forecasts a doubling of the national consumption tax (to 10 percent) by early in the next century. That is likely to make the road to an enduring economic recovery quite bumpy. Equally troubling, with factory capacity in Southeast Asia temporarily overbuilt, there will be more pressure on Japanese capital goods exporters to shift their sights toward American consumers.
The economically enlightened (but politically sensitive) prescription for what ails Japan from this side of the Pacific is to divert savings into domestic investment and consumption. "There's lots Japan could do to help itself" without increasing its trade surplus, argued John Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute.
Specifically, deregulating agriculture would open suburban land to a building boom. Deregulating distribution and retailing would increase efficiency and spur consumption. Deregulating financial services would allow Tokyo to capture profits that now flow to New York and London.
Some of this is likely to happen. While land-use reform remains the third rail of Japanese politics, financial services and the economy's archaic distribution system are already changing for the better.
But Mr. Saxonhouse notes that Japanese labor will grow increasingly scarce as the population ages, making it ever more difficult to complement new capital formation. Hence Japan's best investment opportunities will still be overseas.
In the middle term, he estimates, 3 percent domestic economic growth in Japan is consistent with a 2 percent surplus on foreign accounts -- not very different from the current-account surplus Japan has been averaging for the last two decades. "I don't see Japan having many options," he concluded.
Is that bad? If you happen to be an employee or major shareholder in General Motors or Chrysler, probably. Among other things, Japan is very accomplished at making cars (and car factories) for export. And any world in which Japan runs a large current-account surplus is likely to be a world in which competitors to the Japanese car companies will never be allowed to relax.
But it certainly isn't bad for American consumers, who are still enjoying the fruits of the shake-up in traditional industries forced by Japanese exporters in the 1980's. More to the immediate point, Japan is the only large, rich economy around to generate savings for others.
While America and Europe supply technology to the rest of the world, they collectively import capital. And though China and India may be able to develop without net inflows of capital -- South Korea and Taiwan managed it -- Latin America and Africa are unlikely to meet their potential without vast infusions of foreign savings.
America got a whiff of life without Japanese capital a few months ago when, in a fit of pique, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto suggested that Japan might find a repository other than dollars for its surplus, and the bond market shuddered.
The sort of "hard landing" outcome feared in the mid-1980's, in which foreign capital flees Wall Street, no longer seems plausible. By the same token, though, fat and happy Americans seem all too ready to forget that dependence on the Japanese trade surplus is mutual. We need it almost as much as they do.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices Lower On Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities turned lower yesterday after the General Motors Corporation reported stronger car sales for August than expected, raising fears among investors that the economy might be expanding fast enough to cause inflation to heat up. G.M. said car sales and light-truck sales rose 7.4 percent.
Investors were also moving to consolidate the previous day's gains ahead of more economic data this week and a glut of corporate debt issuance. The 30-year bond dropped 17/32, to a price of 97 4/32 to yield 6.60 percent, up from 6.55 percent on Tuesday. 
 Meanwhile, a large number of issuers lined up to sell debt in the public sector led by the Ford Motor Credit Company, which priced $1 billion of five-year global bonds through underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company yesterday at a price to yield 6.596 percent, or about 42 basis points more than a comparable Treasury with a similar maturity. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Traders said the heavy supply of corporate debt expected over the near term put government securities under selling pressure. Jack Ablin, executive vice president and head of fixed income for Barnett Capital Advisors Inc., said: "There is a lot of corporate supply coming, with about $40 billion already slated for sale this month. That's about double the normal amount for September, normally a heavy month for corporate issuance." Mr. Ablin said about $24 billion of corporate debt would be normal for the month.
Market participants see shorting of intermediate-term Treasury securities like 10-year notes as a result of the hedging. "I'd expect near-term pressure on rates and spreads as a result," Mr. Ablin said. Other billion- dollar sales in the days ahead are being planned by Argentina and Venezuela.
In the municipal sector, the New York State Thruway Authority tentatively priced $456 million of local highway and bridge service contract revenue bonds with a maximum yield of 5.60 percent through underwriters led by Lehman Brothers.
Sylvan G. Feldstein, municipal bond analyst at the Guardian Life Insurance Company, said the issue drew good investor interest. It was the first muni deal by New York since ratings were upgraded by Standard & Poor's last week. The general obligation debt rating of New York State was lifted to A from A- and lease obligation debt to BBB+ from BBB.
Looking ahead, Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said: "Looming on the statistical horizon is the recent August surge in gasoline prices at both the producer and consumer level. This will likely be felt in both the P.P.I. and C.P.I., and while this may disturb some market participants, it will not be a factor in the core indices.
"There are few signs that this is the beginning of a trend, or that any increases will be permanent. Nevertheless, it will give the bond market a target to set its sight on following the labor market data."
Traders expect the market to weaken further ahead of the payroll number tomorrow, as investors demand more compensation for the risk of an unfriendly number. Besides, some investors have been looking for opportunities to move out of current positions, and every piece of good news affords them that opportunity.
Yesterday the Commerce Department reported that construction spending rose five-tenths of 1 percent in July. It was the second consecutive month to show a gain. The Conference Board's index of leading indicators, which is meant to predict growth over the next half year, rose three-tenths of 1 percent in July -- the best showing since February. It increased a revised one-tenth of 1 percent in June and two-tenths of 1 percent in May. Previously, a decline of 1.1 percent was reported for June.

HEADLINE: Clinton Presses Plan to Test Pupils on Federal Standards

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: OAK BLUFFS, Mass., Sept. 3

 BODY:
Eager to press for political advantage in a legislative fight awaiting him in Washington, President Clinton interrupted his vacation to appear at an elementary school here today, promoting his plan for voluntary tests to measure pupils' performance against new national standards in reading and math.
In a 20-minute talk to about 50 teachers and staff in the library of the Oak Bluffs School on Martha's Vineyard, Mr. Clinton was at pains to justify his plan, in an effort, his aides said, to set the terms of the brewing debate on school standards. 
 "We're living increasingly in a global society as well as a global economy," Mr. Clinton said, noting that a child on Martha's Vineyard, using the Internet, could dig into Australian libraries. "Educational excellence at world-class standards is now more important than ever."
But in Washington, Republicans tried today to frame the argument differently.
"Don't be fooled," said Christina Martin, a spokeswoman for Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia. "This isn't a debate about standards, it's about who sets them. Republicans believe parents and teachers should have a say in their children's education, while Democrats prefer bureaucrats."
Mr. Clinton hopes that by 1999, there will be tests based on the national standards for all fourth graders in reading, and all eighth graders in math. Over the last five years, the curriculum standards have been written by academic panels, in math, science, geography and history.
As he has repeatedly done in the past, Mr. Clinton emphasized today that the tests would be voluntary, not imposed by the Federal Government. Since he announced his testing proposal in his State of the Union Message in February, six states, including Massachusetts, have pledged to use it. Fifteen big-city school districts, including New York's, have also embraced the plan.
Representative Bill Goodling, the Pennsylvania Republican who is chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee, is seeking to block the Department of Education from spending money on Mr. Clinton's tests. Perhaps as soon as Thursday, Mr. Goodling plans to introduce legislation that would do so by amending the appropriations bill that finances the Department of Education.
Mr. Clinton's senior aides have urged him to veto that spending bill if Mr. Goodling is successful. But the President has not made a veto decision, a White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said.
Mr. Goodling argues that the Federal Government would be intruding on state and local authority by creating the tests. Further, he says, children already must take enough tests to measure their skills.
"House Republicans and many Democrats would rather send Federal dollars to the classroom, bolster basic academics and seek ways to increase parental involvement," Mr. Goodling said today in a statement.
As they geared up today for what Mr. Clinton predicted would be "one of the major debating points of the next few weeks," White House and Congressional aides said that, after the summer recess, they were uncertain how broad Mr. Goodling's support was. But the Congressman appears to be assembling a paradoxical coalition that includes conservatives who reject an increased Federal role in education and Democrats who fervently support it.
Representative Major R. Owens, Democrat of Brooklyn, said he would support Mr. Goodling's legislation because, unless the Federal Government spends more money to supply books, build classrooms and patch leaky roofs, children in poor areas are doomed to test poorly, and then to bear the stigma of failure.
"We should not be stampeded into testing because it looks good in the headlines," Mr. Owens said. "For the White House and Administration, I'm afraid it's become, 'Let's do something and get the credit for it,' without thinking about the consequences of what they're going, or the morality."
White House aides prefer to emphasize their Republican opposition, citing public polls showing that the public trusts Mr. Clinton more than the Republicans on education issues.
"This is the party that two years ago chose to close the Department of Education," said Rahm Emanuel, senior adviser to Mr. Clinton, recalling past unpopular Republican budget-cutting maneuvers.
The Department of Education is spending $15 million developing the tests this year, and Mr. Clinton has asked for another $16 million for the tests next year.
In his remarks today, the President rejected the idea that children were already subject to enough tests, saying that many existing state tests do not measure against national standards.
"I think it would be a terrible mistake," Mr. Clinton said, "for people who are afraid our children can't measure up or who have a misguided notion that somehow the Federal Government is trying to take over the direction of education in America to persuade members of Congress not to fund the tests."

HEADLINE: Leading Index Rose at a Fast Clip in July

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 3

 BODY:
The index of leading economic indicators rose at the fastest rate in five months during July, and construction spending advanced -- evidence that economic growth may accelerate in the year's second half.
Investors, who had already seen evidence of strength in other economic data, did not appear overly troubled by today's reports: Stocks rose slightly and bonds fell. Some analysts said the statistics kept alive the possibility that Federal Reserve policy makers could raise interest rates later this year to prevent the growing economy from causing an acceleration in inflation. 
 "The economy is robust; leading indicators tell us it will continue on that path," said Patrick Retzer, a bond manager at Heartland Advisors in Milwaukee. "If the strong data continues, I think they'll have to raise rates later this year."
The Conference Board reported that its index of leading indicators, which is meant to predict growth over the next half year, rose three-tenths of 1 percent in July -- the best showing since February, when the economy was running at full throttle -- after having increased a revised one-tenth of 1 percent in June and two-tenths of 1 percent in May.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said spending on new construction rose in July for the second consecutive month, increasing half a percent, to a $598.7 billion annual rate. That was the largest monthly gain since February.
The Conference Board's index of leading indicators has risen in eight of the last nine months; not since April and May 1995 have there been two consecutive months without an increase. July's increase of three-tenths of 1 percent was slightly above analysts' expectations.
The index monitors a variety of previously released economic data, including the spread between the yield on the 10-year Treasury note and the Federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge one another for loans overnight. A widening spread between long- and short-term interest rates is viewed as an indicator that the Fed may push borrowing costs higher.
Of the 10 indicators in the index, six made a positive contribution during July. They were led by a decline in jobless claims, to a monthly average of 304,900 -- one of the lowest levels in 20 years -- from June's average of 338,900, and by an increase in stock prices, with the Dow Jones industrial average topping 8,000 for the first time during the month. The other positive contributors were increased consumer confidence; a larger money supply; slower deliveries, which is a sign of pent-up demand, and an increase in building permits.
Three components made a negative contribution, led by a narrower interest rate spread between the 10-year Treasury note and the overnight bank lending rate -- an indication that investors expected slower economic growth and, as a result, did not expect a rate rise by the Fed. The other two negative components were a drop in the manufacturing workweek, to 41.7 hours in July from 41.8 hours in June, and weaker factory orders for consumer goods. One item, factory orders for non-military capital goods, was unchanged.
The index of coincident indicators, a gauge of current economic activity like industrial production, increased two-tenths of 1 percent during July. The index of lagging indicators, including the unemployment rate, decreased four-tenths of 1 percent.
July's increase in construction spending followed a revision to June's figures that in turn pushedJuly construction to a record that exceeded analysts' expectations. June's construction spending rose a revised one-tenth of 1 percent instead of declining 1.1 percent, as the Government previously reported.
"The outlook is good for overall construction," said Evelina Tainer, chief economist at IndoSuez Carr Futures in Chicago. "Low interest rates are helping the residential and nonresidential sectors, office vacancy rates are low and the housing numbers we're seeing suggest the residential sector will at least maintain itself at a high level."
In July, spending on residential construction rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, to a $259.9 billion annual rate. Housing and other residential construction amounts to about half of all construction spending.
Spending on commercial projects like factories and warehouses increased 1.2 percent, to a $163.9 billion rate. Spending on public projects fell eight-tenths of 1 percent in July, to a $136.5 billion rate.

HEADLINE: Right to Build Over Terminal Is Up for Sale

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, hoping to cash in on the resurgence of the Times Square area, plans to sell the development rights above its Manhattan bus terminal, at 42d Street and Eighth Avenue, for a 35-story commercial building, officials said yesterday.
The plan, announced jointly by the Port Authority and the top economic adviser to Gov. George E. Pataki, could generate as much as $100 million from a developer who would purchase unused air rights above the 37-year-old bus terminal, real estate executives said. 
 The Port Authority said that six of New York City's largest developers have expressed interest in the proposal since it was quietly circulated late last year. The developers have now been asked to submit their bids and final building plans by Jan. 15.
The new building would include one million square feet of space -- about half the amount of space in the Pan Am building above Grand Central Terminal. It would rise over the six stories of the passenger terminal and bus lanes in the northern section of the bus depot, bounded by 41st and 42d Streets.
The authority has not put any restrictions on the type of building that could be erected, whether a hotel or apartments.
But Charles Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation and vice chairman of the Port Authority, who has championed the bus terminal proposal, said an office tower would be the most logical use of the site, with an entertainment-industry complex, perhaps including a television studio, on its lower floors.
Although the development plan comes at a time of growing interest in several sites west of Times Square -- an area long considered one of Manhattan's most forlorn urban backwaters -- it could provoke tensions with City Hall.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has repeatedly criticized the Port Authority, saying it allocates its investments in a way that shortchanges the city. One concern is that part of whatever money is raised through the bus terminal development could be used in New Jersey.
But Mr. Gargano said he had pressed for the project with the intention of benefiting the city.
"We will be keenly aware that this is a New York property, and make sure that the resources are allocated appropriately," he said.
But other questions remain. It was unclear, for example, whether a developer would have to pay property taxes on the new high rise over the terminal, since the Port Authority itself is tax exempt. Instead of property taxes, the Port Authority pays fees to the city on a schedule negotiated in the 1970's.
At City Hall, Bernadette O'Leary, a spokeswoman for the Mayor, declined comment yesterday. A spokeswoman for Mr. Gargano, Caroline Quardararo, said the question of how much tax, if any, would be paid on the new building was "something to be resolved down the road."
Proponents of the Port Authority plan said it would benefit the city by heightening the momentum of development around Times Square and by giving the bus terminal a new, safer and more attractive identity.
Other projects at the bus terminal have been announced by the Port Authority in recent months. They include a plan to put up large neon signs along the exterior of the terminal's stark, industrial-looking bus ramps, and to install a golf driving range on the roof of the terminal's southern section, bounded by 40th and 41st Streets between Eighth and Ninth Avenues.
"The proposal we are now exploring can insure that the bus terminal continues to be a catalyst for the rebirth of 42d Street," said Robert E. Boyle, the executive director of the Port Authority.
In addition to the new 35-story tower, the plan calls for turning over to the developer about one-third of the existing interior space of the north passenger terminal. The space would be used for an entrance to the new building and for retail space.
Although construction would cause disruption for many of the thousands of people who use the bus terminal each day, Port Authority officials said it could be held to a manageable level, because the bus ramps would not be moved. Alan Morrison, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said the developer would be required to plan construction in phases to reduce disruptions.
The agency said the bus terminal, built in stages beginning in 1960, was designed to support a high-rise development. The potential pitfall of bus fumes rising into the new high rise was eliminated, they said, in the terminal's original design: exhaust fans blow the fumes out over the surrounding streets, instead of straight up.
Development companies that have expressed interest in the project include Silverstein Properties, Forest City Ratner Companies, the Related Companies and Tishman Realty and Construction Company.
Those who responded to inquiries yesterday said their interest in the bus terminal was tentative. "We submitted something sketchy, just saying let us have a look," said Joyce Baumgarten, a spokeswoman for Forest City.
The plan provoked sharply divided reactions in the real estate industry. At Cushman & Wakefield, a large commercial brokerage, Bill Shanahan, the firm's senior director, said the plan would benefit from the terminal's link to commuter bus lines and its location directly above several subway lines. He estimated that developers would bid up to $100 million for the building's air rights.
But at another company, Insignia/ Edward S. Gordon, Mary Ann Tighe, the executive managing director, said the bus terminal retained a sufficiently seedy image that would discourage developers from offering top dollar.
"The fact that someone would have to say his building is the one above the bus terminal does not conform to my definition of something that will command high rents," she said, adding that her estimate of what developers would pay was $35 million to $40 million.

HEADLINE: Cheered by Wall Street, Some Asia Stock Markets Revive

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Share prices jumped 7.1 percent in Hong Kong yesterday, with the benchmark index recording its biggest one-day gain ever in terms of points, as investors drew strength from Wall Street's surge on Tuesday and snapped up shares that had plunged in the last few days, the steepest part of the Hong Kong market's worst slump since 1989.
Tuesday's sharp rally in the United States, which sent the Dow Jones industrial average up 3.38 percent, or 257.36 points, helped lift stocks in some other Asian markets, as well, although local factors played the chief role. 
 In Indonesia, for instance, shares surged 7 percent after the Government announced its intention to increase exports and abolish the 49 percent limit on foreign ownership of shares sold in initial public offerings. The day before, the central bank in Jakarta moved to stabilize the value of the currency, limiting large foreign futures and options transactions against the rupiah.
Stocks rose in the Philippines for the first time in nine sessions after the central bank moved to allow banks to increase lending.
In Malaysia, however, the benchmark index fell for the ninth consecutive session, dropping 5.7 percent, as the currency continued to weaken and Government efforts to prop up the market continued to fail.
Southeast Asian stock markets have been on a wild ride in recent weeks as regional currencies have tumbled and interest rates have risen. Hong Kong's market -- Asia's second largest, after Tokyo -- has been hurt further by sharp swings in speculative China-related shares.
Earlier this week, the benchmark Hang Seng index fell below its level at the start of the year. Yesterday, though, it regained a big piece of lost ground, jumping 978.66 points, or 7.1 percent, to 14,713.99.
Despite the battering the region's markets have been taking, Andrew Look, an investment manager at Prudential Portfolio Managers Asia Ltd., said: "There is nothing, absolutely nothing, structurally wrong with Asia. It's selective buying during the downfall."
In Indonesia, the Jakarta Stock Market Composite Index rose 33.57 points, or 7 percent, to 512.59.
Shares were lifted by a statement from the Government that it would take "credible proactive measures" to restore stability to the currency and economy. In addition to increasing exports, it promised to cut spending and reduce interest rates.
Yet it announced little in the way of a specific program, and the 49 percent limit on foreign ownership of initial stock offerings will remain with companies that are already publicly traded. "We've heard all this before," said Agnes Safford, president-director of ABN Amro Hoare Govett Asia Indonesia. "It's like there's nothing really there."
But Felix Otto D'Souza, head of research at Peregrine Securities, said that the change in the foreign-ownership limit "can only be seen as a precursor to total deregulation." He said local investors believed that the Government measures would be good for the economy, while foreign investors were "desperately waiting" for a drop in interest rates.
Philippine stocks rose after the central bank said it would cut to 6 percent from 8 percent the portion of their total funds that commercial banks must keep on deposit with it. The central bank had tightened the requirement a week earlier, acting to push up interest rates in an effort to support the Philippine peso. But commercial banks and Government officials had called for relief from the resulting cash shortage.
Share prices rose for the first time in nine sessions, with the Philippines Composite Index increasing 43.72 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,994.13.
In Malaysia, though, the benchmark Kuala Lumpur Composite Index fell 44.97 points, or 5.7 percent, to 750.76. "It's all about confidence," said David Yong, a trader at Arab-Malaysian Securities. "The foreign investors are the main sellers. I don't see any rebound in the near term."
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called last week for local investment funds to buy shares, and regulators have imposed trading restrictions, but stocks have declined for nine sessions nonetheless. One reason has been the weak Malaysian currency, the ringgit, which traded yesterday at its lowest level against the dollar in 26 years.
The Prime Minister said yesterday that the Government planned to raise a total of 60 billion ringgit, or $20.4 billion, some of it through a bond sale, and to use the money to buy stocks.
Elsewhere in Asia yesterday, shares rose 1.3 percent in Singapore and fell three-tenths of 1 percent in Thailand. The baht continued to fall, sliding as much as 7 percent to another record low against the dollar.

HEADLINE: From the Top of the Barrel;
Gallo Powers Its Way Into the Premium Wine Market

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL 

DATELINE: HEALDSBURG, Calif.

 BODY:
Over lunch recently at Bistro Ralph, a wine makers' hangout here in the heart of the California wine country, somebody mentioned that E.& J. Gallo Winery Inc., the mass producer of inexpensive jug brands like Carlo Rossi and Gallo Hearty Burgundy and street fortifiers like Thunderbird, had placed in the top 10 in a rating competition with one of its new Sonoma wines. But the remark only exasperated Gina Gallo, a third-generation marketing executive with the company.
"First would have been better," Ms. Gallo said, pausing between bites of her lamb burger. "Second is O.K., too. But just being in the top 10 is unacceptable." 
 Gallo has always wanted to be No. 1 at everything it does. And it mostly has. Since it was founded in 1933 by the brothers Ernest and Julio Gallo, it has grown into the biggest winery in the world, with production of nearly 900 million bottles last year and revenue approaching an estimated $1 billion. (The privately held company does not release its financial results.) Sales representatives like to quote a line by Ernest Gallo, the 88-year-old family patriarch: "We don't want most of the business; we want it all."
One market segment always eluded Gallo, though. That was premium fine wines, those cabernet sauvignons, chardonnays and pinot noirs aged in wooden barrels and corked in 750-milliliter bottles. So, after several false starts in the marketplace, the company is trying once again to conquer that territory. And finally, despite its reputation as a mass rather than a class wine maker, Gallo has managed to make a name for itself in the midpriced and premium categories, too.
The name, though, is not just Gallo. They are Turning Leaf, Gossamer Bay, Indigo Hills, Zabaco and Marcelina, all new wine labels owned by Gallo that sell anywhere from about $7 a bottle to as much as $20. Not only is the Gallo name never mentioned on those labels, they usually say "Made in Healdsburg," rather than Modesto, where the Gallos got their start and which has become almost synonymous their name.
Other new lines rely on the Gallo name, though the labels vary from the traditional one, often displaying simply the signatures of the founders. These include the Single Vineyard varietals -- chardonnays, cabernets and the like with price tags of $14 to $18 -- and the top-of-the-line Sonoma Estate wines, including a chardonnay that retails for $30 and a cabernet sauvignon that goes for more than $40.
A $40 bottle of Gallo wine? Yes, and to the consternation of Gallo's competitors, some of the wines are winning raves among customers and critics. Chez Panisse, the Berkeley restaurant owned by Alice Waters that is in the vanguard of the best in California cuisine, recently bought its first cases of Gallo Sonoma wines.
"They said it couldn't be done," said Ed Everett, an importer and wine consultant based in San Francisco. "Everyone in the industry said Gallo could never shake off its jug-wine image. Which is just the kind of challenge the Gallos love. And they've done it."
There is a good reason, of course, why Gallo is so determined to remake its image. Consumption of the blended table wines on which Gallo feasted for years has stagnated while varietals, named for the predominant grape used to make them, have taken off. Last year, for example, the volume of varietals shipped by California wineries was up nearly 10 percent, to 76.7 million cases, according to Impact, an industry trade journal, while table wine was up only 1.7 percent, to 52.9 million cases. In 1985, generic table wine accounted for 81 percent of all California wine shipments; last year, it was down to about 40 percent.
Responding to this shift in taste, Gallo has moved production of its premium wines to Sonoma County, where it has been buying up land for years. And to give the Gallo designation more panache, the family began removing its name from some of the cheaper wines and shrinking it on others, selling them with alternative labels, including Sheffield and Livingston Cellars. They abandoned the three- and four-liter bottles for Hearty Burgundy, once the country's best-known jug wine, confining it to standard 750-millimeter and 1.5-liter bottles with corks, low-key labels and a price of $4 for the smaller bottles.
"It's not inconceivable that one day the Gallo name will be associated only with top-of-the-line varietals," said Mr. Everett, the wine consultant.
But that day is a long way off. To capture more consumers with highbrow tastes, the Gallos swallowed their pride and excised the Gallo name from most of the new Sonoma brands, as well as from the two big Modesto sellers, Turning Leaf, begun in 1995 with a price of about $7, and Gossamer Bay, introduced last year for around $8.
Marking many of its labels "Made in Healdsburg" is worth "many millions of dollars to the Gallos," according to the wine consultant Jon Fredriksen, because it avoids the Modesto identification that is a Gallo give-away. In fact, a recently introduced Turning Leaf Reserve line is made at Sonoma instead of Modesto, benefiting from the cachet of the Healdsburg address.
Gallo had little choice. It had largely missed out on the seismic shift of America's wine drinkers from jug wines to varietals.
Gallo, slow to tap into the varietal boom, had come out with some uninspiring brands in the 1980's. It let other big names grab a big slice of that market -- particularly the Benziger family with its Glen Ellen line, which it sold to Grand Metropolitan P.L.C.'s Heublein unit in 1993.
But now Gallo is in a hurry to make up for lost time. To help meet demand for its new brands, the recently completed winery in Sonoma just west of Healdsburg is operating 24 hours a day, producing an estimated two million bottles a month. Gallo expects to increase its capacity by 30 percent within the next couple of years in addition to opening three more wineries on the California coast.
The Sonoma winery property, known as the Frei Ranch, is unmarked and surrounded by high fences and guarded gates, as are the immense Gallo wineries in the Central Valley. No tours or tastings, those staples of the California wine business, are offered. The scene is bucolic but a turn in the road reveals a multimillion-dollar plant, probably the most technically advanced in the world, that presses and processes the grapes from Gallo land in Sonoma.
At Frei Ranch, the company has embraced an ancient tool of the trade that it shunned at Modesto -- great wooden barrels for aging the wines -- building an underground cellar the size of a football field with room for 60,000 of the casks, A second cellar of the same size is on the drawing board. Gallo buys about 20,000 of the barrels a year for Sonoma, importing most of them from master builders in France at a cost of around $600 each.
"We buy two-dozen barrels from a cooper and test them before we buy in quantity," said a senior wine maker, Marcello Monticelli. At any time, he said, hundreds of tests involving different wine and barrel combinations are under way.
At least one competitor believes Gallo stepped over the ethical line in pursuit of its marketing ambitions. Last year, Kendall-Jackson Winery Ltd. sued the company for trademark infringement, contending that Gallo's new Turning Leaf label replicated the autumn-leaf logo on its huge-selling Vintner's Reserve line. A jury decided against Kendall Jackson in March, but the winery is appealing the decision.
In its marketing effort, the company has deployed a small army of third-generation Gallos -- 15 in all, out of 20 grandchildren of the founders. Gina, 30, started out in sales, studied wine making at the University of California at Davis and now oversees all wine production at Sonoma. Her brother Matt, 34, is operations manager at the Sonoma properties, and their cousin, Caroline Coleman Bailey, handles marketing. Both Gina and Matt play dual roles. They have become the attractive and highly visible new faces of a company long known for its secretiveness and suspicion of the outside world. Both spend time on the road meeting with sales representatives, wine writers and customers.
Meanwhile, the center of power has shifted to the second generation, who were long overshadowed by Ernest and Julio. Julio was killed in a car accident four years ago at the age of 83, and Ernest, still stricken by the loss, has removed himself from daily operations. He continues to deal with long-range planning, though, and remains an intimidating presence. "He's into every aspect of the business," a Gallo manager said, "and God help you if you can't answer one of his questions."
Now running the show are three second-generation co-presidents: Julio's son Robert, in charge of viniculture and wine making; his son-in-law James Coleman, in charge of production, and Ernest's son Joseph, in charge of sales. A fourth co-president, Ernest's older son, David, died in March of a heart attack at the age of 57.
There was a time when wine makers in Sonoma County and over the mountain in the Napa Valley shrugged off the threat from the Gallos. Now it gives them sleepless nights.
"The Gallos are laying down a challenge with these wines and anyone around who's not up to that challenge would be wise to consider another line of work," said Rodney Strong, the founder of Rodney Strong Vineyards in the Sonoma County town of Windsor, who sold out and retired two years ago.
Gallo has moved into the premium segment while maintaining its dominant position in the twist-off-cap category. The Sonoma winery's annual output of 26.5 million bottles a year is dwarfed by the 388 million bottles of its bread-and-butter Carlo Rossi, Livingston Cellars and the Wine Cellars of Ernest & Julio Gallo labels.
Still, it is the lure of luxury that pumps up the family these days. And they are jumping in in typical Gallo fashion -- all out.
Gallo's buying spree in Sonoma has given it eight different properties covering 6,000 acres in one of the most fertile wine growing regions of the country. Among others, it has acquired the old Italian Swiss Colony Asti vineyards for $11 million and a 1,700-acre cattle ranch once owned by the late actor Fred MacMurray for $7 million. There, it plans to cultivate about 500 acres of once hilly terrain that it has reshaped to wine-making specifications with immense land-moving machines previously used to build the Alaska pipeline.
"Gallo was slow to get into premium wines, but that's their style," said Mr. Fredriksen of Gomberg Fredriksen, the wine consulting firm in San Francisco. "They watch, they wait, then they jump in and take over. They have no stockholders and they put everything back in the business. They take advantage of their massive economies of scale, and they are very, very aggressive."

Ernest and Julio Gallo became the biggest winery in the world by mass producing inexpensive table wines, like Carlo Rossi and Hearty Burgundy. Today, Gallo is also producing premium, fine wines in its latest attempt to capture the higher end of the market. The Gallo name is not on the labels or is reduced only to the signatures of its founders. Here's how Gallo describes their traditional wines and its newest labels.
 
ERNEST & JULIO GALLO SAUVIGNON BLANC

HEADLINE: New Type of Bond Sold by City Gets Higher Credit Rating

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
A new type of bond being sold by the New York City government received a favorable reception from Wall Street credit-rating agencies yesterday, which should allow the city to save hundreds of millions of dollars in interest payments over the next few decades.
The Wall Street agencies gave higher ratings to the new bonds than those for the city's regular bonds, which have remained relatively low since the municipal finances were battered by the recession in the early 1990's. 
 The new bonds are being issued by the New York City Transitional Finance Authority, which Gov. George E. Pataki and the State Legislature established earlier this year to help the city get around a cap on its outstanding debt that is set by the State Constitution.
The limit prevents the city from selling more bonds, which in the past have financed billions of dollars in spending on schools, bridges and other projects.
Under the new arrangement, $7.5 billion in bonds will be sold not by the city but by the authority, which is quasi-independent from the city government and not subject to the debt ceiling. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's budget director, Joseph J. Lhota, is overseeing the sale.
Moody's Investors Service, one of the rating firms, rated the authority's debt at A2, which is two notches above its rating for the city's regular debt, Baa1. Standard & Poor's Corporation and Fitch Investors Service have also told the city that they are planning to give the finance authority's bonds higher ratings than the bonds of the general municipal debt.
"This is really very good news for the city," Mr. Giuliani said.
While the city's economy and finances have improved in the last year, largely because of the boom on Wall Street, the credit agencies said they were giving good ratings to the finance authority's bonds largely because of the way they are structured.
The higher ratings should allow the city to pay less in interest to bondholders than it does for its regular debt.
The agencies said the finance authority's bonds are more secure than the regular debt because they are more insulated from the municipal finances.
The city has also pledged the receipts from its personal income tax as backing for the finance authority's debt.
"This rating is not an indication of the city's basic fiscal health," said Renee Boicourt, a managing director at Moody's Investors Service. "The rating is an indication of the security of these bonds, which have a lot of technical features that make them better than the city's general obligation debt."

HEADLINE: Arizona Governor Convicted Of Fraud and Will Step Down

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Sept. 3

 BODY:
A Federal jury today convicted Gov. Fife Symington of Arizona of seven felony counts of defrauding his lenders as a commercial real estate developer, forcing his resignation and leaving him facing the prospect of prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines.
"I have never been one to linger, and I don't intend to start now," a solemn but composed Mr. Symington told supporters in a farewell announcement at the Capitol about 90 minutes after the verdict. "My lot is to offer best wishes and full support, to say thank you and move on." 
 The jury was deadlocked on 11 of the 21 counts over all, and acquitted Mr. Symington on 3 charges. But under state law, Mr. Symington, a Republican, had to leave office if convicted of even a single felony count.
Mr. Symington's lawyer said the 52-year-old Governor's resignation would take effect at 5 P.M. on Friday. Since the state has no lieutenant governor, Secretary of State Jane Dee Hull, a fellow Republican, will serve as governor until the regular statewide election next year.
After a 17-week trial that involved more than 1,400 pieces of evidence assembled in a five-year investigation, the jury convicted Mr. Symington, who took office in 1991 and was once a rising star in national Republican circles, of filing false financial statements in an effort to shore up his crumbling real estate business in the late 1980's and early 90's.
Of the three counts on which Mr. Symington was acquitted, one of the most serious was that he used his power as Governor to threaten to steer state tenants away from a troubled downtown development if the union pension fund that financed it listed him in default. Judge Roger G. Strand of Federal District Court here declared a mistrial on the 11 deadlocked counts, and prosecutors said they would consider whether to seek a new trial on those counts.
In all, Mr. Symington faced 21 counts accusing him of lying to lenders about his true financial condition, of extorting the pension fund and of perjuring himself in a bankruptcy hearing.
It was the second time in a decade that an Arizona Governor faced felony charges. Gov. Evan Mecham, also a Republican, was eventually acquitted of accepting illegal campaign contributions, but not before being impeached in 1988.
Mr. Symington is the third Governor in the 1990's to be forced from office because of a conviction. Last year Gov. Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas, a Democrat, resigned after his conviction on fraud and conspiracy charges in Whitewater-related business dealings. In 1993 Gov. Guy Hunt of Alabama, a Republican, was convicted and forced from office for looting his 1987 inaugural fund.
Today's verdict was a stunning blow for Mr. Symington, a great-grandson of Henry Clay Frick, the turn-of-the-century coal and steel magnate, and a cousin of Stuart Symington, a Democratic Senator from Missouri.
Fife Symington, an Air Force veteran of the Vietnam War era, parlayed his real estate career into state politics, before being forced to declare bankruptcy after taking office.
In office, he quickly established a reputation as a fiscal conservative and an aggressive free-marketeer, cutting taxes, reigning in spending, helping Republicans gain control of both houses of the Legislature and leading a move to require a two-thirds legislative majority to raise taxes. But for the last five years he has been dogged by the criminal investigation.
Today, prosecutors pronounced themselves pleased with the outcome of the trial.
"We're always pleased when justice is done," the lead prosecutor, David Schindler, said in an impromptu news conference after the verdict.
Mr. Symington's lawyers, who had argued that the errors in his financial statements were the inadvertent mistakes of a beleaguered entrepreneur, said they would try to have the verdict set aside, and then to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
"If this was a football game, we'd be home and one," the chief defense lawyer, John Dowd, said.
"We've won 16 of them and we're not done. We'll move to have the verdict set aside and then appeal," Mr. Dowd said, referring to the 11 deadlocked charges, 3 acquittals and 2 counts that were dropped from the case before the jury got the case.
Had he been convicted on all counts, Mr. Symington would have faced maximum penalties of 300 years in prison and $14 million in fines, but prosecutors have said it would be difficult to estimate any realistic sentence because sentencing guidelines were different during the various periods covered by the charges.
Mr. Dowd said today that the guidelines were "enough to make your eyes cross."
But prosecutors said Mr. Symington appeared likely to serve some prison time, and Nora M. Manella, the United States Attorney in Los Angeles who supervised the case, said the guidelines prohibited a sentence of probation for some of the charges on which the Governor was convicted.
In a news conference after the verdict, Ms. Manella said the verdict showed that "no amount of pedigree" can excuse anyone "from playing by the rules."
The heart of the Government's case was that Mr. Symington falsely inflated his true net worth in efforts to get more loans by making himself appear wealthy, and then painting himself as poorer than he was to have loans forgiven.
In his closing argument to the jury, Mr. Schindler said that what Mr. Symington did was "no different from any other con artist."
But, in a week on the stand in his own defense, the Governor repeatedly contended that the mistakes in his statements were innocent errors.
In his instructions to the jury, Judge Strand told the panel that in determining whether Mr. Symington made "material" false statements to his lenders, it was not important whether the information he gave actually had an impact on the banks' decisions, only that the information was "capable of influencing" the lenders' decisions.
The convictions centered on two of Mr. Symington's biggest projects, the Camelback Esplanade hotel and shopping complex that is home to the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Phoenix, and the Mercado, a turreted Mexican-style shopping complex in downtown Phoenix.
In the Esplanade case, the jury found that Mr. Symington inflated his net worth in false statements in the early 1990's to the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank of Japan, which made nearly $130 million in loans for the project, to avoid being declared in default.
At one point, prosecutors said, Mr. Symington sent the bank a letter falsely claiming a net worth of $5.3 million when another statement showed him to be $4.1 million in the red. In interviews on the courthouse steps afterward, jurors said the multiple statements had helped convince them that Mr. Symington intended to lie, but several described the process of reaching their verdicts as very difficult.
On the Mercado project, the jury found that in the late 1980's Mr. Symington repeatedly filed false financial statements to win loans from a group of Arizona pension funds.
The verdicts capped a tumultuous trial and long deliberations. At 10:30 this morning, the jurors told Judge Strand that they had reached unanimous conclusions on some counts but were deadlocked on others. Despite a plea from Mr. Schindler to send them back for further deliberations on the unresolved counts, the judge agreed to declare a mistrial on the deadlocked counts.
It was the 18th day of deliberations over all, and the 10th since deliberations were forced to begin again after an alternate joined the panel. On Aug. 19, Judge Strand dismissed Mary Jane Cotey, a 74-year-old juror, after her fellow jurors complained that she was unable to focus on the issues, and needed help filling out her lunch requests.
Mr. Symington was released on his own recognizance, with the only requirement that he check in with Mr. Dowd once a week. Judge Strand set sentencing for Nov. 10.

Homeowners Call for Help

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: ASBURY PARK

 BODY:
In a plea to state officials to bail out their beach community, an Asbury Park homeowners association has prepared a thick report on the city's financial crisis, rising crime and decaying neighborhoods.
The report, which accuses the city government and the Board of Education of corruption, was based on a six-week investigation, the treasurer of the Asbury Park Homeowners Association, Kate Mellina, said yesterday. "We are begging everybody, from the Governor to the Attorney General to the State Board of Education, to help us down here," she said. "This is way too big for us to handle." 
 The tax base in Asbury Park, which has a population of 15,600, declined $14.4 million last year, according to Ms. Mellina. But Kenneth Saunders, who has been the Mayor since June, said his administration did not cause the city's problems and complained that the report was politically motivated.

HEADLINE: For Welfare Recipients, Employment Is Elusive

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The implicit point in your Aug. 28 front-page article on welfare-to-work incentives is that earnings in the low-wage labor market will typically be insufficient to support a family. We can argue all day about the extent to which "earnings disregards" -- which allow working welfare recipients to keep a portion of their benefits -- encourage work, but we're still stuck with the fact that many former recipients are likely to be economically worse off once they leave the rolls. 
 So what is the most effective way to raise the incomes of families that depend on the low-wage labor market? Minimum wage increases, training programs, expanded wage subsidies and child care subsidies may all play a role. Most important, however, is for the Federal Reserve to continue accommodating low unemployment until real wages of low-wage workers start to rise.

HEADLINE: For Welfare Recipients, Employment Is Elusive;
How Employers See It

 BODY:

To the Editor:
While economic incentives may impel welfare recipients in the direction of what is deemed desirable behavior (front page, Aug. 28), if the transition from welfare to work is to succeed, then the welfare recipient must become someone else: a worker. This is not simply a matter of being on a payroll; it is a cultural matter, entailing the transformation of people's perceptions, values and posture. 
 Surveys show that employers' reluctance to hire inner-city applicants is based less on the applicants' lack of skills than on the perception that they did not have the necessary professional posture. In a society where a chronically unemployed underclass has been institutionalized, the culture of unemployment must give way if the transition from welfare to work is going be successful.
The Industrial Revolution was as much a cultural as an economic phenomenon. Millions of people in England and Western Europe who had never seen a machine or earned a wage -- and lacked role models who had -- underwent a profound cultural transformation in becoming the first industrial working class in history. We must create conditions in which the millions of Americans who have yet to undergo a comparable transformation are supported to perform their parts in the culture of work.

Homeowners' Group Pleads for Help for City

DATELINE: ASBURY PARK

 BODY:
In a plea for state and Federal officials to bail out their beach community, members of an Asbury Park homeowners' association have prepared a thick report on the city's financial crisis, rising crime and decaying neighborhoods.
The report, which also contends that the city government and the Board of Education are corrupt, was based on a six-week investigation, Kate Mellina, the treasurer of the Asbury Park Homeowners Association, said yesterday. 
 The tax base in Asbury Park, which has a population of 15,600, declined by $14.4 million last year, Ms. Mellina said.
Kenneth Saunders, who has been Mayor since June, said that his administration was not to blame for the city's problems and that the report was politically motivated.

Re "Only Employment for Many in Europe Is Part-Time Work" (front page, Sept. 1): While you mention that most Western European employers extend benefits to part-time workers, you do not stress the different philosophy in Europe from that of the United States: Part-time work in Europe is not seen as a way for employers to escape from paying benefits but as the most effective weapon to fight unemployment in an age of automatization.

Natural Gas Prices Plummet On Strong Inventory Report

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Natural gas prices plunged 4.6 percent yesterday, their biggest loss in three months, after an unexpectedly large gain in inventories eased concerns about supplies for this winter.
American natural gas inventories rose 84 billion cubic feet last week, to 2.212 trillion cubic feet, the American Gas Association said after trading on Wednesday. The nation's inventories are 4.3 percent above levels a year ago as mild, cool weather holds down demand from utilities. 
 "The market will be in good shape if there are a few more weeks of milder weather like this," said Todd Speiser, a trader at the Enserch Corporation in Houston.
Natural gas for October delivery fell 13 cents, to $2.677 for 1,000 cubic feet on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the largest one-day drop for gas since June 2. Prices are down 2.9 percent so far this year.
In other markets, gasoline fell to a seven-week low, while coffee rose for the eighth consecutive day.
Gasoline fell amid expectations that the end of the summer travel season would erode demand for motor fuels when refinery output is close to record levels.
The American Petroleum Institute said after the markets closed on Wednesday that American gasoline inventories fell 1.97 million barrels last week, to 187.53 million barrels. While that drop was close to expectations, traders said a more substantial decline, as retailers stocked up for the Labor Day holiday travel weekend, was needed to justify current high prices.
"We needed more to sustain the rally," said John Kilduff, vice president of energy risk management at the ABN Amro Chicago Corporation.
Gasoline for October delivery fell 2.63 cents, or 4.2 percent, to 59.92 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the first time the active gasoline contract has been below 60 cents a gallon since July 15. October crude oil dropped 21 cents, or 1 percent, to $19.40 a barrel.
Coffee rose for an eighth day, reaching a three-month high amid concern that dry summer weather had hurt crops in Latin America.
Coffee for December delivery rose 5.5 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $1.95 a pound on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the highest closing price for the contract since June 3.

Dollar Eases Against Mark On German Rate Comments

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the mark yesterday on mixed signals from the Bundesbank over the direction of German interest rates. In late trading in New York, the dollar settled at 1.8153 marks, down from 1.8203 marks on Wednesday.
It eased a bit against the British pound, which rose to $1.5843 yesterday from $1.5841. 
 Traders were hesitant to buy dollars before today's August employment report for signs on whether the United States economy is growing fast enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. While higher rates would make the dollar more attractive, they could also spur selling of stocks and bonds, dragging the dollar down with them.
In European trading yesterday, the dollar got brief help against the mark after the Bundesbank left interest rates steady. But it gave up the gains amid concern that the bank might not stand pat for long.
Its president, Hans Tietmeyer, said earlier this week that a recent rise in Germany's inflation rate was "thoroughly occupying" central bankers. Though the bank left two important interest rates unchanged yesterday, signs that the economy was accelerating prompted speculation that it might raise other rates as soon as next week.
Mr. Tietmeyer, interviewed in the magazine Die Woche, also said that a well-timed move on interest rates would help stabilize or even bring down bond yields, which he said was crucial for economic growth.
Dieter Bluhm of Wells Fargo Bank observed, "Bundesbank officials are raising a cautious finger, suggesting that because of recent economic figures, they might manipulate interest rates."
Higher German rates would presumably spur the value of the mark, which is down about 15 percent against the dollar this year, by making mark assets more attractive. They might also help fight inflation by making imports less costly. Still, higher rates could choke Germany's fragile economic recovery.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was slightly higher, settling in New York at 120.87 yen, up from 120.85 Wednesday. Early gains were bolstered when C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, said that the yen could fall as low as 127 to the dollar.

HEADLINE: August Auto Sales Kept Up Strong Pace

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 4

 BODY:
For the second consecutive month, buyers flocked to car dealerships in August, giving the auto industry stronger-than-expected summer sales.
The Ford Motor Company said today that its sales in August rose 3.6 percent, helping the industry as a whole register a sales increase of 5 percent from a year earlier. On Wednesday, the General Motors Corporation reported strong sales, while other auto makers posted mixed results. 
 Wall Street analysts said that over all, August's results were among the strongest this year. Last month's auto sales "have put the second half of 1997 on a stronger pace than we saw during the first half of 1997," said David M. Garrity, an auto analyst at Smith Barney.
But the stronger sales are unlikely to lead to worries that the economy is overheating, causing higher inflation, because auto prices have been falling, analysts said. Many auto makers are offering buyers substantial rebates, and most have held prices steady or even dropped prices for their new, 1998 models.
"Mostly, there are people out there looking for deals," said Wendy Beale Needham, an auto analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin, & Jenrette.
For the industry as a whole, August sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.6 million. In July, the rate was even stronger, at 15.9 million, according to Commerce Department statistics. That is far higher than during the second quarter, when the annual rate averaged just 14.9 million. Perhaps heartened by the strength of the industry's sales in the last two months, Ford announced today that it would build 25,000 more cars and trucks in the third quarter than it had previously planned.
"We continue to be optimistic about the sales outlook for the remainder of this year and into next year," said Robert L. Rewey, Ford's group vice president for marketing, sales and service. "After consumers paused to catch their breath in the second quarter, they are back in the market."
Still, the strength for a number of Ford's models last month was driven by rebates and discounted lease deals. Sales increased for the Mercury Grand Marquis and Ford Crown Victoria, which carry $1,500 rebates, and for the Lincoln Town Car, which carries a rebate of up to $5,000 in some markets. But sales of Ford's mainstay family sedan, the Taurus, dropped 1.4 percent, despite the company's offers of $1,500 rebates and interest rates as low as 4.8 percent on car loans. Ford's overall car sales dropped 3.5 percent from a year earlier, but the company made up the difference and then some with strong truck sales. Ford's sales of pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and vans rose 9.6 percent.
Many auto makers have watched their truck sales grow as their car sales have slipped. In the latest sign of car market weakness, G.M.'s Saturn division said today that for the rest of this year, it planned to stop making cars during the day shifts on Monday and Friday. The workers on those shifts will undergo additional training and perform extra maintenance tasks instead of being laid off.
Still, on Wednesday, G.M. reported a 7.5 percent gain in its sales for August. Other auto makers had mixed results. Honda's sales jumped 38.2 percent and Subaru sales rose 29 percent. All percentage calculations are based on a daily selling rate because there were 26 selling days last month, but 27 in August of 1996. The Chrysler Corporation's sales rose 0.5 percent, but Toyota dropped 4.4 percent, Nissan sales fell 12.5 percent and Mazda fell 3.3 percent.

The Economist wants readers to see it as bold, not bland.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE ECONOMIST magazine is embarking on an ambitious effort to help change a perception -- surprisingly widespread among potential readers -- that a typical issue features articles like "Monetary Policy Made Murkier," "A Yen for Yen: Favorite Foreign Currencies" and "Alan Greenspan: Legend or Icon?"
A campaign that will begin on Monday by Weiss, Whitten, Stagliano in New York, the magazine's agency since April, seeks to redefine The Economist in North America, which accounts for almost 45 percent of the magazine's circulation. The intent is to establish The Economist as an international weekly focusing on topics far broader than matters that matter only to economists, including general business, politics, science, technology and the arts. 
 That idea is underscored by the theme of the campaign, "Subscribe to a global point of view," which is infused with low-key humor. For instance, one print advertisement proclaims: "Many people find international business and politics frustrating, arbitrary and unnecessarily complicated. What an opportunity."
The budget for the campaign, which also includes TV ads and airport and transit posters, is estimated at more than $2 million. The campaign represents a departure for The Economist beyond being the magazine's initial foray onto TV to bolster North American subscriptions.
Usually, the North American ads for Economist Newspaper Ltd. -- the British company half owned by Pearson Group P.L.C. that publishes The Economist and calls itself Economist Group -- have been based on or been evocative of a popular, successful campaign in its home market. That campaign, centered on the signature red color of The Economist, was created by Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO in London, which is minority owned by Omnicom Group.
Research by Economist Group and Weiss, Whitten discovered that "there's a lack of perception in North America among people who should know and understand what The Economist is but don't," said Beth O'Rorke, chief operating officer of the Economist Newspaper North America unit of Economist Group in New York.
"People who wear blinders to avoid global business are simply not people who would enjoy reading The Economist and are not the people we're after," she added. "What we're looking for are people who ought to be subscribers, who realize The Economist is a read that is not for the faint of heart."
But the research, conducted in what ought to be fertile ground for The Economist -- professional-managerial households with annual incomes of more than $100,000 -- showed significant difficulties.
"In each of the last four years, we've done a representative benchmark study primarily on awareness and comprehension," said John Lizars, corporate marketing director at the Economist Newspaper North America. "The bottom line was that we realized we had to do a much more intensive job."
"Our comprehension scores moved only slightly," he added, and many respondents "had no awareness of us at all or thought we were a journal of economics. That left us in not an enviable position."
The Economist, founded in 1843, is of course not the only venerable magazine bearing a name that may puzzle contemporary readers. The New Yorker's purview extends well beyond New York, Harper's Bazaar covers fashion rather than fairs and Redbook is neither red nor a book.
Enter Weiss, Whitten, an agency known for stylish campaigns for premium-priced, imported products like Guerlain fragrances and Bass ale -- an appropriate shop for a British magazine with a basic subscription rate of $125 annually.
"We had no intent of compromising the magazine's editorial integrity," said Nat Whitten, partner and co-creative director at Weiss, Whitten, "or turning off its existing constituency, which is sizable." His reference was to North American circulation of 278,176 for the first six months of 1997 -- up 26.7 percent from the corresponding period five years ago -- out of estimated worldwide circulation of 630,000.
"The challenge was to maintain The Economist's reputation but be more aggressive in courting readers," Mr. Whitten said. To do that, he added, the agency chose to present The Economist as "the only news and business magazine with the kind of international coverage it has."
So "we wanted every ad for The Economist to be The Economist," Mr. Whitten said, "using visuals from the magazine and taking its tone of voice."
For example, one television commercial, titled "Wake-Up," features the magazine's logo snoring like a sleeping person until an alarm sounds. As articles from The Economist appear on screen, an announcer says: "If you've never subscribed to The Economist, perhaps you've taken the name literally. One might guess it's about money supply theory, that sort of thing. In fact, it's the only weekly international business and news magazine with global insights and opinion."
And a print ad with a photograph from The Economist of soldiers in gas masks declares: "You think international politics are ugly? You should read our science section."
The commercials will run on broadcast stations in Atlanta and Washington and on the Arts and Entertainment, Bravo, CNBC and CNN Headline News national cable networks. There will also be spots promoting underwriting of "The Lehrer News Hour" on PBS. The posters will appear in large markets like Chicago and New York.
In addition to the Weiss, Whitten campaign, Economist Group will continue a trade campaign meant to increase sales of advertising pages. That campaign is created by Mad Dogs and Englishmen in New York.

Investors Get Easier Access To Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 4

 BODY:
The Treasury announced several measures today to make it easier and less expensive for small investors to buy and sell Government securities.
Most significantly, the Treasury said that its bills, bonds and notes could now be bought simply by debiting a bank account and could be sold without going through a bank or broker. 
 In upgrading its 11-year-old system called Treasury Direct, which holds the accounts of 825,000 investors, the department said it was adding to the appeal of the Government's securities while paring costs of administration.
"It is a breakthrough," John D. Hawke Jr., Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance, said in an interview. The new measures, which take effect immediately, "relieve some of the inconvenience and hassle in the present program" and, he said, avoid the need for those selling securities before they mature to maintain a brokerage account.
Treasury Direct customers, 85 percent of whom are individuals 55 or older, now may pay for new securities by authorizing the department to debit their bank account for the exact amount on the day the security is issued. Until now investors had to pay for their securities when ordering them several days before issue. The new system means they will not lose interest and can eliminate a trip to the bank for a certified or cashier's check.
It also means the Government will not have to provide refund checks for the many investors who must now, in advance of a sale of the securities, send in more money than proves necessary when the bidding for that issue ends.
Also, investors will now be able to sell securities in their Treasury accounts without first transferring them out -- typically by wire -- to a bank or broker. The Treasury will charge a flat $34 for each security, regardless of the amount of money involved, less than would be charged by nearly any bank or Wall Street firm.
In disposing of securities for customers, the Treasury will operate through the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, which is to obtain three market quotations, accept the highest and transfer the proceeds directly into the customer's bank account. The $34 charge covers only the Government's costs, officials said.
Although today's action may mean less commission business for banks and brokers, there was no outcry from Wall Street or banks since bond commissions are typically modest, infrequent and involve relatively high costs. Indeed, one specialist described such transactions as mostly a "nuisance" for the industry.
Still, some brokers fretted about being cut out as middlemen as sales proceeds flow directly from the Treasury to the investor's bank account. This deprives the broker of the chance to guide reinvestment of the money.
Rather than lost commissions, "I'm more concerned about the retention of assets," said Tony Burns, manager of the downtown Washington branch of Quick & Reilly, a large discount brokerage house.
He predicted that the Treasury, "by making it much more convenient, is going to bolster their business" in marketing securities. Some $83 billion is now held in Treasury Direct accounts, somewhat less than the level a year ago.
A third element in today's package allows Treasury Direct customers to reinvest maturing securities by telephone at any hour of the day or night.
After receiving a notice in the mail, investors need only dial 1-800-943-6864 and follow the step-by-step instructions.
The Treasury hopes to make Treasury Direct nearly all electronic during 1998. Mr. Hawke said the plan was to provide forms on the Internet to conduct transactions. By the end of this year, he added, the savings bond program is also to be largely electronic.
The Government is also replacing the six different forms used to buy various securities with a single tender form.
Investors can get more information about the Treasury Direct program from the Bureau of the Public Debt site on the World Wide Web: www.publicdebt.treas.gov.

Bonds Mark Time
 (By Dow Jones) -- Treasury prices traded in a narrow range yesterday as investors were content to play a waiting game ahead of the report today on unemployment in August.
The price of the 30-year bond fell slightly, ending the day at 97 1/32 , down 3/32 , leaving the yield at 6.60, unchanged from Wednesday.
Though there was an array of economic reports yesterday, from August chain-store sales and July factory orders to weekly jobless claims, they did not prompt much of a response from the market.

HEADLINE: H & R Block Shares Up on Report of Compuserve Sale Talks

BYLINE: By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
Shares of H & R Block and Compuserve rose yesterday following a report that the New York-based investment firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe was in talks to buy a majority stake in Compuserve, Block's faltering on-line service.
Block shares rose 68.75 cents, to $40.75, while Compuserve gained 25 cents, to $12.875. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Block and Welsh Carson were close to a deal in which Welsh Carson would purchase a controlling stake from Block and seek to acquire the 20 percent of Compuserve that is publicly traded. Block would retain a minority stake. Since selling 20 percent of its shares to the public in April 1996, Compuserve's stock price has fallen nearly 60 percent. 
 Officials at both Block and Welsh Carson declined to comment on the report. But two of Welsh Carson's general partners, Anthony DeNicola and Thomas McInerney, were in meetings with Block executives yesterday, Block employees said.
Welsh Carson, a leveraged buyout firm that has acquired several electronic information companies in recent years, could use Compuserve to augment its presence in that arena, or it could divide the company up and sell off its parts.
" I see Compuserve as a real distressed property, so if you're bottom-feeding it might make sense to pick it up," said Adam Schoenfeld, a senior analyst for Jupiter Communications Inc. in New York. "It was a cash cow for H & R Block for a long time, but they didn't look forward and now it's fallen by the wayside. It's kind of sad."
Block, the tax-preparation company, has been trying to rid itself of Compuserve, the nation's oldest on-line service, since last September, when it was forced to cancel plans to spin off its remaining 80 percent of the service because of financial losses and fading interest on Wall Street in proprietary on-line services as the Internet gained popularity.
America Online, a relative newcomer to the on-line service market that has far outstripped the venerable Compuserve in recent years emerged as an early prospective buyer, but Block reportedly turned down the bid because it involved too much stock.
The company declined to comment on reports that Bertelsmann A.G., the German media giant, had joined America Online in making a more cash-rich offer earlier this summer. Another suitor is said to be Worldcom Inc., a telecommunications company.
When Block bought Compuserve in 1980 and started an early incarnation of the current service it quickly became the only choice for businesses, professionals and early high-tech aficionados experimenting in the new world of on-line information.
But by the early 1990's, when America Online came along with its easy, friendly design and the graphical World Wide Web suddenly drew on-line users' interest, the explosion in the consumer market passed Compuserve by. The service has lost nearly half a million United States subscribers since last summer, bringing its total subscriber base to about three million, compared with America Online's nine million subscribers worldwide.
Indeed, one of the company's most valuable assets now is its subscriber lists -- which could be sold or folded into a buyer's own subscriber base. Its network services division, which provides Internet access and private networks to businesses, is also very healthy, and could be spun off at a premium, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Rose in July; Analysts Had Expected Drop

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Orders placed with factories unexpectedly increased in July to a record level, a sign that manufacturing could be poised for faster growth.
The Commerce Department said today that factory orders rose two-tenths of 1 percent in July, to a record seasonally adjusted $330.28 billion, after a revised gain of 1.7 percent in June. Analysts had expected the July report to show a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent. 
 In a separate report, the Labor Department said the number of workers filing for unemployment benefits rose by 2,000 in the week ended last Saturday, to a seasonally adjusted 326,000. The increase was close to analysts' expectations.
Stronger demand for vehicles and parts, metals, food, textiles and plastics led July's gain in orders. Orders for aircraft, electronics and communications gear declined.
Factory inventories increased half a percent in July after having risen three-tenths of 1 percent in June. Analysts have warned that a buildup in inventories could lead to slower factory orders as companies attempt to empty their warehouses and stores of merchandise.
In the months ahead, strength in manufacturing will come from auto makers, said Kevin Flanagan, an economist at Dean Witter Securities in New York. They will be stepping up output because strikes hampered production of cars and trucks earlier this year, he said. The Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation this week reported vehicle sales for August that were stronger than expected.
Aerospace, too, will be a source of strength. This week, the Boeing Company announced it had won a $4.5 billion order to build 61 jetliners for the aviation-leasing arm of the American International Group. Additionally, consumer spending remains healthy, with major retail chains reporting today that August sales met or topped expectations.
Many economists caution that it is difficult to discern trends from month-to-month shifts in factory orders, which are heavily influenced by large changes in orders for commercial jetliners and military weapons.
Excluding aircraft and other transportation equipment, factory orders rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in July. Excluding the military industry, orders increased three-tenths of 1 percent.
Orders for durable goods, which are made to last three or more years, fell three-tenths of 1 percent in July. In an advance report on Aug. 26, the Commerce Department said durable goods orders unexpectedly declined six-tenths of 1 percent in July.
Orders for nondurable goods, including food and clothing, increased nine-tenths of 1 percent.
Factory shipments, a gauge of current demand, rose 1.4 percent during July. Unfilled factory orders, a measure of pent-up demand, decreased half a percent.
The jobless claims data for last week were distorted by the effects of retooling of auto assembly lines and by the strike against United Parcel Service, David Shabelman, an economist at MMS International in Belmont, Calif., said.
The four-week average for new jobless claims, a less volatile measure of employment conditions, rose to 326,500 in the latest week from 321,000 in the previous week.

HEADLINE: Once Again in Arizona, Secretary of State Is Suddenly Thrust Into the Job of Governor

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Sept. 4

 BODY:
She is a fiscally conservative former schoolteacher with a broad streak of social moderation. She is a veteran legislator and the first woman to be Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives. And for most of the last year, she has been quietly waiting for the day she might suddenly become Arizona's 20th governor.
For Jane Dee Hull, the Arizona Secretary of State, that day is Friday, when she will take the reins from Gov. Fife Symington, who was forced to resign on Wednesday after being convicted on Federal charges of defrauding his lenders as a commercial real estate developer. It is the second time in less than a decade that a woman in Ms. Hull's shoes has assumed the top job in a state that has no lieutenant governor. In 1988, Secretary of State Rose Mofford became the state's first female governor when she took over after the impeachment and ouster of Gov. Evan Mecham on charges of campaign finance irregularities. 
 Unlike Ms. Mofford, a 50-year state employee who took a caretaker approach and decided not to run for election in her own right, Ms. Hull, a 62-year-old Republican who moved to Arizona in 1962 after hearing a Barry Goldwater speech, is expected to plunge into what promises to be a rollicking campaign next year. It will decide who wins the right to run this prosperous, fast-growing state and redeem an image darkened by a legislative corruption scandal in the early 1990's and the five-year investigation into Mr. Symington's finances.
"It's a tough moment, no matter what, when your Governor's convicted on felony counts," said Lisa Graham Keegan, the state Superintendent of Public Instruction and a longtime Hull ally. "What Jane brings to that for the moment is a whole lot of class."
Since Mr. Symington was indicted last year, friends say, Ms. Hull has been determined to do all she can to be ready to take over if needed, without seeming to hover or gloat. Even today, she chose not to hold a news conference or make a public appearance, instead meeting privately with Mr. Symington about transition matters and giving individual interviews to local reporters. Her spokesman, Chris Herstam, declined an interview request from The New York Times.
In an interview today with KTVK-TV here, Ms. Hull said of her situation: "It's difficult, but you know you find yourself having been in that saddle for 15 years as a legislator, you find yourself thinking, 'Well, the issues haven't changed that much, they've gotten a little more complicated.' And it all comes back."
Ms. Hull will automatically assume the powers of office when Mr. Symington's resignation takes effect at 5 P.M. Friday, but she will not be officially sworn in until a public ceremony on Monday. She becomes the third female governor in the nation, joining Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire.
As Secretary of State for the past two years, Ms. Hull has overseen a largely ministerial office, responsible for running the state election system, keeping campaign finance and business records. But first as a state legislator and then as House Speaker, she established a take-charge reputation, heading committees on government operations, economic development and ethics.
"She had a reputation of being someone who was firm, and as someone who did a reasonable job of keeping factions generally moving in the same direction," said Sam Coppersmith, a former Congressman who until January headed the Arizona Democratic Party.
Nor did Ms. Hull hesitate to differ with Mr. Symington, a fellow Republican, when she saw fit.
"She's not afraid to differ with anybody," Ms. Keegan said. "And she does her own business. She doesn't send messengers to tell you she's upset with you. She comes and does it herself."
At the same time, Ms. Hull is widely expected to be more consensus-oriented than Mr. Symington, who brought a brusque businessman's style to the governorship. She was first elected to the Legislature in 1979 with a reputation as one of its most conservative members, and once suggested the state could save money and reduce its inmate population by letting air conditioners at a desert prison break down. But in recent years, she has taken increasingly moderate stands on social issues like education, juvenile justice and abortion rights.
"She's fiscally conservative and she will follow along in the direction Fife went: cutting taxes, trying to cut back the size of government," said Bruce Merrill, director of the Media Research Center at Arizona State University in Tempe and an informal Hull adviser since Ms. Hull took one of his graduate courses two decades ago. "Where there is a very clear difference, and where she is much more moderate, is on the social issues."
Ms. Hull is already facing sniping from her right flank.
State Senator Thomas Patterson of Phoenix and Tom Rawls, a former Maricopa County Supervisor, are expected to challenge Ms. Hull in the Republican primary next year.
Two of Mr. Symington's Democratic adversaries, Eddie Basha, a supermarket chain owner, and Paul Johnson, a former Phoenix Mayor, are expected to compete for the Democratic nomination.
Mr. Basha, who campaigned as a "chubby grocer," won the Democratic nomination for governor in 1994 and was leading Mr. Symington in the polls until just before the election, when he said he would be willing to sign legislation legalizing same-sex marriages.

Malaysia, in Crisis, Will Delay Projects

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Sept. 4

 BODY:
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said today that Malaysia would have to delay several big projects, including the 13.6 billion ringgit ($4.55 billion) Bakun hydro-electric project, because of its currency problems, the official news agency Bernama reported here.
Dr. Mahathir indicated that other projects might also be delayed: a northern regional airport in Kedah, the Linear City in Kuala Lumpur, and a road linking three highlands in the central range of the peninsula. 
 The Prime Minister also said that efforts would continue to cut costs by scaling down imports of goods that are already available in the country.
Dr. Mahathir said the Bakun project might cost at least 20 percent more if the Malaysian currency, the ringgit, stayed at its current low levels -- settling in New York today at 2.9830 to the dollar, a further loss from 2.9353 late Wednesday.
The Prime Minister conceded that "obviously, we can't build this dam without using some foreign imports." He said, however, that the Bakun project could not be scrapped, as more than 100 million ringgit had been spent to build diversion tunnels.
Shares of ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering company, fell today amid reports that its contract to build the Bakun dam was in jeopardy. The company's American depository receipts fell $6.125 to close at $143.50 in Nasdaq trading.

Financing Is Ready for 3 Mixed-Income Buildings

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
With the New York State Housing Finance Agency given the green light last month by the State Legislature to sell $350 million more in tax-exempt bonds, financing is in place for three mixed-income rental projects in Manhattan to move forward under New York City's 80-20 program.
Under this program, developers use the proceeds from the sale of the bonds to construct buildings in which 80 percent of the units are rented at market rates and 20 percent at reduced rates to tenants whose income is less than half the median income for New York City. 
 The buildings are also eligible for a 20-year city tax abatement.
The state finance agency approved two of the projects last month. One, a 42-story building with 340 units, is to be developed by the Rockrose Development Corporation of Manhattan using $70 million in bond financing on a site fronting the Hudson River in Battery Park City. The other, with up to 466 apartments in a 30-story structure, will be built by the Glenwood Management Corporation of New Hyde Park, N.Y. using $119 million in bond financing on a vacant site at 240 East 39th Street between Second and Third Avenues.
The third development, which the agency approved yesterday, will have 396 apartments in a 27-story building. It will be developed using $85 million in bond financing by the Related Companies of Manhattan on another riverfront parcel in Battery Park City.
While rents for the market-rate units at each of the projects have not been determined, those for the apartments reserved for low-income tenants will be capped at 30 percent of their income.
The developers say the program's incentives -- a lower interest rate than the rate on a conventional loan and a 20-year property tax reduction -- make rental projects feasible in Manhattan, where land and construction costs are high.
Stephen J. Hunt, president and chief executive officer of the state finance agency, said increased demand from developers in the 80-20 program prompted the agency to ask the Legislature for the additional bonding authority.
He said that the agency was currently reviewing applications from developers for loans totaling $900 million for projects throughout the state, most of which are 80-20 developments in Manhattan. That loan figure is up from $150 million in 1995.
Mr. Hunt said his agency expected to help finance eight affordable-rent projects in the state this year using about $450 million in loans. Five are 80-20 buildings in Manhattan, with a total of 2,000 units, which include the two Battery Park City projects and the one at 240 East 39th Street.
The other two Manhattan projects, which received state financing earlier, are a 240-unit building being developed by the Related Companies on the block bounded by 13th and 14th Streets, Fourth Avenue and Broadway, and a 550-unit building at 250 West 50th Street being developed by Jack Resnick & Sons of Manhattan.
Once a project is approved for inclusion in the 80-20 program the state, or city, sells the bonds to provide permanent financing to the builders, typically at rates that, because the bonds are tax exempt, are lower than would be obtained through other financing sources.
While the production of apartments in the city is creeping up, the 3,000 to 4,000 units, most of them rentals, being developed annually are much lower than the 10,000 a year level achieved in the late 1980's, said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a rental brokerage in Manhattan. Rents continue to rise, indicating demand still outpaces supply, Ms. Packes said.
"Given the current economy and the strength of the sales market, the amount of new rentals planned will not significantly lower rental prices," she said.
Average monthly rents on the Upper East and West Sides, for example, range from $1,300 for a studio to $3,000 for a two-bedroom apartment, she said.
Work on the Rockrose project at 401 Chambers Street in Battery Park City started this week. Called Tribeca Landing, it will be built over the next 14 months and have studio to three-bedroom units, with 550 to 1,323 square feet of space, said Kevin P. Singleton, vice president and general manager at Rockrose.
"Notwithstanding the number of rentals planned, there is a dearth of product and a constant demand," Mr. Singleton said.
David J. Wine, president of the Related Companies' management arm, Related Management Company, added, "The market is still strong enough to absorb the new supply."
He said his company expected to start construction on its Battery Park City project, Tribeca Park, by next month, with completion 18 months later. It will have studio to two-bedroom apartments, with 550 to 1,250 square feet of space. Hypo Bank and Marine Midland Bank are providing the letter of credit for the project.
At the Saxony, Glenwood Management's East 39th Street project, plans, which are still being made final, call for 466 one- and two-bedroom units in a 30-story building, said Gary Jacob, Glenwood's executive vice president. The apartments are expected to range in size from 600 to 1,400 square feet.
Mr. Jacob said construction would start when his company closed on the financing, which was expected by early next year. The project, which has secured a letter of credit from a bank Mr. Jacob would not identify, will take 18 months to complete.

HEADLINE: Panel Upholds Giuliani Offer On Police Pay

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
An arbitration panel announced yesterday that it was upholding Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's wage offer to the New York City police union, all but ending an unusually vitriolic dispute that had been fought from precinct station houses to the State Capitol.
The panel said the Mayor had presented a reasonable proposal to the powerful union, the 29,000-member Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, when he offered a salary increase of 13.3 percent over five years, roughly the same raise that unions representing other municipal workers have received. 
 The panel chastised the police union for seeking more money than other municipal workers had got, which the union said it deserved because its members were responsible for the sharp drop in crime in the city recently. It said that granting such a request would throw labor relations into turmoil because other unions would then contend that they should garner similar increases.
"It would create chaos," the panel wrote in its ruling. "Whipsawing efforts by every municipal union undoubtedly would follow. This would severely damage the city's financial stability."
The police union said it might appeal the ruling, which was handed down by a three-person panel appointed by the city's Office of Collective Bargaining, though labor experts said such appeals were difficult to win. If the union does not file an appeal, which it has up to a month to do, the new contract will go into effect immediately, retroactive to 1995, when the last contract expired.
The union president, Lou Matarazzo, said he would consult with senior union officials about whether to set up picket lines in front of police station houses, raising the possibility that officers might be demonstrating against the Mayor at the height of his re-election campaign.
The union mounted similar protests last January after it formally rejected the Mayor's last offer and the impasse went to arbitration.
During those protests, officers carried signs that said, "No zeroes for heroes," a reference to a wage freeze in the first two years of the contract.
Mr. Matarazzo also vowed to retaliate with one of the union's most effective weapons, the State Legislature.
The union wields strong influence in Albany, and in recent years the Legislature has repeatedly come to its aid by approving bills that change contract and workplace regulations in the union's favor -- usually over the objections of Mr. Giuliani and his predecessors.
The current conflict has lasted more than two years, in part because the union sought state legislation that would have moved arbitration proceedings from the city agency to a state one that the union believes would treat it more favorably. The Legislature approved the bill over Gov. George E. Pataki's veto, but the Mayor successfully challenged it in court.
Union officials said yesterday that any state legislation they obtained would probably not affect the basic terms of the new contract, but they said they would ask the Legislature for help in negotiating the next contract. They said they would submit new legislation to move arbitration proceedings to the state panel.
"I am extremely disappointed that we couldn't get a fair shake from the arbitrators," Mr. Matarazzo said. "We are now going to take it up to Albany."
Mr. Giuliani hailed the ruling by the arbitration panel, saying he hoped that it would convince rank-and-file officers that he was being fair. "This decision makes clear that the offer that the city made to them is a very generous one," he said.
But many officers said they were still upset with the Mayor, in what is perhaps one of the more unexpected hallmarks of his tenure: a chief executive who has prided himself on his success as a crime fighter is unpopular with many members of his police force.
Some officers also expressed anger toward the union, which has weathered a number of blows in the last year, including the indictment of its chief lawyer.
"I'm totally disgusted," said Officer Vincent Martinelli, a union delegate in the 108th Precinct in Queens. "I felt that the P.B.A. should have taken a hard line, an aggressive stance against Mayor Giuliani and the arbitration panel. We're working harder than we ever have and we've lowered the crime rate drastically. We deserve more. I feel we should have played hardball."
Officer Martinelli, who worked phone banks for the Mayor's 1993 campaign, added, "We were stabbed in the back by the Mayor."
Mr. Giuliani said police officers should blame the union leadership for employing a failed strategy for wresting more money from the city.
"I really feel very bad for them," he said, "because I think that they were not well served in the way in which this whole thing was handled by their leadership."
In the new contract, the Mayor had offered the union a five-year package that follows the pattern of the deals he negotiated with the other municipal unions: the two-year wage freeze, followed by annual increases of 3 percent, 3 percent and 6 percent. When the increases are compounded, the total raise under the package approved by the arbitration panel is 13.3 percent in salary alone, or 15.3 percent when all other benefits are included, officials said.
By the end of the old contract, an officer with 10 years' experience was receiving $50,400 in salary and other cash benefits, said James F. Hanley, the city's Labor Commissioner. By the end of the new contract, that officer will be earning $57,584, an increase of $7,184, or 14.25 percent, slightly more than the 13.3 percent because other cash benefits are included.
The P.B.A. had originally refused to accept the two-year wage freeze. Its leadership later relented, but said that in addition to the 13.3 percent, it wanted what it referred to as productivity bonuses of at least a few thousand dollars for each officer.
"They fail to recognize the type of work that our people do," Mr. Matarazzo, the union president, said yesterday after the panel rejected the productivity demand.
The Office of Collective Bargaining is independent and is governed by a board on which both unions and the city have representation.
Mr. Hanley and Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine advised Mr. Giuliani in his dealings with the police union. The three men said the ruling showed the wisdom of the labor strategy that the Mayor put in place in 1995, when he sought the two-year wage freeze, which was intended to help the city cope with a large budget gap.
Mr. Giuliani said that the panel agreed with his view that the unions could not seek big increases from the city by comparing their wages with those in nearby suburbs, where the salaries are typically higher.
He said the panel had demonstrated that police officers historically received raises that outpaced inflation.
"From the point of view of the fiscal integrity of the city and the ability of the city to deal with all of the unions," Mr. Giuliani said, "it is a vindication of the city's position."

HEADLINE: Raw Recruits Survive Lunchroom Wars as Aides Replace Teachers

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
Like rookie police officers setting off on their new beats, Irene Cuebas and Margarita Delgado rushed into the lunchroom at Public School 306 in Brooklyn at 10:40 yesterday morning.
Ms. Delgado headed for an accident scene: a kindergartner had dropped her plastic tray and dumped pizza and green beans onto her chair. Ms. Cuebas ran for the lunch line, where some of the school's 1,100 children were opening and spilling their milk cartons long before getting to their seats. 
 It was the first of four lunch periods on opening day at the city's 660 elementary schools, and Ms. Cuebas and Ms. Delgado are among the hundreds of new school aides assigned to supervise cafeterias and playgrounds this year. The task had been performed by teachers, but effective this fall City Hall relieved them of that duty under the new teachers' contract.
Though Ms. Cuebas and Ms. Delgado had received only a few hours of training for their new jobs and were replacing four teachers, the school in East New York, Brooklyn, fared better in some ways than many others yesterday: some principals reported that their aides did not show up at all, and if they did, they had no idea what to do.
If there was one change that principals were dreading over the summer, it was the replacement of the teachers with more than 1,000 inexperienced aides, most of them parents and few of them high school graduates. The change was intended to free teachers to spend more time tutoring children in small groups, but the school system spent little time planning how to replace them.
At Intermediate School 145 in Jackson Heights, Queens, only one of six newly-hired aides showed up for work yesterday for the second day in a row, said the principal, Perry Sandler. Mr. Sandler said he hired a second aide 15 minutes before lunch by calling the district office and recruiting someone off a waiting list. He then shifted two security guards from lobby duty to the lunchroom, along with an office aide, a physical education teacher, a home economics teacher and a volunteer.
A spokeswoman for the Council of Supervisors and Administrators, the union representing principals, said that the Board of Education had agreed yesterday to conduct a survey of the schools to determine whether the $70 million spent on new aides had been sufficient.
But the spokeswoman, Bonnie Impagliazzo, said that the overall picture yesterday had been much cheerier than on Wednesday, when the city's middle and high schools had opened for the year.
At P.S. 306, the school principal, Arthella Addei, had four aides returning from last year, as well as the two new aides for the cafeteria and two playgrounds. She said she still needed at least two more aides than she had received from the district office. That left her no choice but to assign both an assistant from her office and the coordinator of special education to pick up the slack.
Yesterday morning, the special education official called to say he had been hospitalized, so Mrs. Addei took over the cafeteria herself.
"With the little ones, teach them to open the milk themselves," Mrs. Addei yelled to Ms. Cuebas, a 57-year-old grandmother, as the chaos of the lunchroom swirled around them. "Don't just do it for them. I want them to learn."
To Mrs. Addei, the lunchroom is as much a teaching environment as the classroom. And Ms. Delgado, a 33-year-old mother of two who also works as a cashier at a Waldbaum's supermarket, seemed to take the instruction to heart yesterday, when she spied a 7-year-old boy curled up underneath a long white table.
As she brought the boy to his feet, he startled her by asking, "What would you do if you didn't have a father?"
After a short pause, Ms. Delgado responded: "I'd try to concentrate on my mother or my sisters. Do you have any sisters?"
"No," said the boy, adding that his father had left his mother three weeks ago.
"Then you've got to concentrate on who you are," she said, "and what you want out of life."
For the two new aides, the action was continuous. At one point, Ms. Delgado took a green windbreaker from a little boy as he tried to hold it and his tray in both hands while walking with his shoes untied.
The only problem was, when she tried to return it, she couldn't remember what he looked like.
But there was also the proud moment when she singlehandedly led 12 small students down the hallway, holding the hands of four in each of her own as if they were a bouquet of balloons.
"So far, so good," she said as the day wound down.

HEADLINE: The Aging of Japan May Aid Economy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A Sept. 2 Business Day article ably describes the challenge Japan faces in supporting its rapidly aging population, but it is less convincing when predicting possible solutions. Among the likeliest scenarios, you suggest much higher taxes and the dwindling of family savings. 
 Far more likely, the Government will chip away at social security. Japanese families not only will bear more of the burden of caring for aged relatives, but they also will choose to lower their living standards rather than deplete their savings.
Japan is not unique in facing the problem of an aging society. But it is distinctive in having dampened expectations of social programs for the elderly even before many received such benefits and before they developed a sense of entitlement. In a brilliant public relations campaign over the past two decades, officials and the cooperative media have trotted out the specter of Japan's "aging society crisis," cautioning families not to rely on the Government.
As a result, some 55 percent of Japanese aged 65 and older still live with their children -- a percentage that may rise as Government cuts back. And the household saving rate has hovered around an impressive 13 percent since 1989. Japan's future is hardly a bright one for families, but its economy may benefit as costs of entitlements are contained to a degree politically impossible in Western nations.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
A Big Case With Racial Overtones. Familiar?

BYLINE: By CARYN JAMES 

 BODY:
The political types in the Showtime film "Color of Justice" include a show-no-mercy Manhattan district attorney, a bleeding-heart civil rights lawyer and a black minister savvy in the ways of media manipulation. This story of a white woman from suburban New Jersey who dies after an encounter with four young black men in a stolen car hits every hot-button issue from police brutality and racial bigotry to Constitutional rights.
All of this would be too broad-stroked to be taken seriously, if it weren't also eerily and freshly familiar. The Abner Louima case, in which New York City police officers are charged with torturing a Haitian man in their custody, inadvertently adds a news element to the film, which was finished long before the Louima incident occurred. That accident of timing only makes "Color of Justice" seem more prescient. Its shrewd central theme depicts how quickly a crime, especially one with racial overtones, becomes political fodder. 
 "Color of Justice" is weak as drama. It is too bluntly provocative and full of bad dialogue in which characters announce their motives. Yet the film is so timely and probing that it becomes fascinating despite those major flaws.
When Betty Gainer (Lisa Pelikan) is forced to stop behind the stalled stolen car, she sees four black men approach her car, and she pulls out her mace. In the struggle that follows, she is thrown to the ground and killed, and the stage is set for a political media event.
F. Murray Abraham is the Manhattan District Attorney, ever mindful of his law-and-order image, who insists on trying the youths as adults. Because the crime took place on the George Washington Bridge, a liberal New Jersey district attorney tries to claim the case for his own political reasons, and eventually the female United States Attorney General gets into the act, too.
But this is essentially a New York story. Judd Hirsch plays the court-appointed lawyer for the young men; he believes the arresting officers denied his clients their rights. Gregory Hines plays the minister who believes their racial background and social disadvantages are to blame; his self-proclaimed motto is, "I'm on television, therefore I am." (The characters may not correspond in every detail to real people, but viewers are given everything but a secret decoder ring to prod them to think of names like Giuliani and Sharpton when watching the D.A. and the minister.) As the victim's angry husband, Bruce Davison carries the weakest part of the film.
In its hit-or-miss way, "Color of Justice" eventually makes a strong comment on how racial politics thrives, and how little room that allows for subtle moral distinctions.

'First-Time Felon'
HBO, tonight at 9
 The fact-based "First-Time Felon" offers a more restrained take on race and crime, and offers a richly realistic texture. It is the story of Greg Yance, a young black drug dealer from Chicago, who instead of prison opts for an experimental boot camp meant to reform first-time convicts. He helps flood victims in rural Illinois, and after his release decides to go straight, but nearly despairs when no one will give him a job.
Omar Epps, who plays Yance, is a strong screen presence (familiar as the medical student who committed suicide last season on "E.R."). And the actor Charles S. Dutton, directing his first film, creates some powerfully grim scenes. When Yance walks into a sleazy hotel, and when he first goes to jail, the hazy, disorienting feeling reflects his chaotic life. But "First-Time Felon" has more trouble with its uplifting scenes. Because the film never convincingly takes viewers inside Yance's mind, his character's positive turns seem murky, and this true story of heroic struggle carries the pat feel of a made-for-television melodrama.

Israelis Mourn in Jerusalem But 11 More Die in Lebanon
Thousands of Israelis converged in Jerusalem to mourn their four compatriots killed by a triple suicide bombing, and to show their resolve against terrorism. Their anguish was deepened by news that at least 11 commandos on a raid in southern Lebanon had been killed. 1 

The naval commandos who died in Lebanon were part of a small but legendary Israeli unit trained for covert missions behind enemy lines. Flotilla 13 accepts only soldiers who seek danger and hardship. 8
 
Emotional Queen Praises Diana
Speaking "from the heart," Queen Elizabeth praised Diana, Princess of Wales, in a personal address of a kind rarely seen in her 45 years as monarch. 1
 
Diana's mother and sisters have filed a civil suit in Paris that would allow them to seek damages based on the results of a trial to determine the cause of the car crash that killed the Princess and her companion, Emad Mohamed al-Fayed. A trial could potentially rule against photographers who pursued Diana's car, or against the Ritz Hotel, owned by the al-Fayed family, for providing a driver alleged to be drunk. 7
 
Defection in Japan's Parliament
A legislator from Japan's New Frontier party defected to the Liberal Democratic Party, giving the Liberal Democrats a controlling majority in Japan's 500-seat lower house of Parliament for the first time since 1993, when the long-dominant party was humiliated at the polls. 10
 
Bombs on Cuban Anniversary
Four bombs went off in Havana, one in a tourist restaurant and three at seafront hotels. The Cuban Foreign Ministry said the attacks were part of a campaign of terrorism organized by "ex-Batistas in the city of Miami." The bombings took place on the anniversary of a 1933 coup d'etat led by the dictator Fulgencio Batista, whom Fidel Castro overthrew in 1959. A State Department spokesman said the United States had no idea who was behind the bombings but would punish Americans responsible if evidence emerged. 4
 
Mir Space Walk Begins
Two astronauts, one Russian and one American, donned spacesuits and ambled out of the beleaguered Mir space station on a complex and potentially hazardous space walk. They hope to find the hole created in the Mir by a collision with a cargo craft in June. The walk was scheduled to last six hours, during which time Mir will circle the Earth four times. 3
 
Candidates Die in Algeria
Four candidates from the conservative Party for Algerian Renewal were assassinated by Islamic militants in eastern Algeria, the party said, without giving much more detail. Thousands have died in five years of civil war in the North African nation, but this was the first attack against candidates running for municipal elections scheduled for Oct. 23.

Reno Said to Consider Prosecutor for Inquiry
Attorney General Janet Reno and her inner circle have sharply changed their attitude and are seriously weighing whether to refer the inquiry into campaign fund-raising abuses to an independent prosecutor, law-enforcement officials said. The change follows news reports that some money raised by Vice President Al Gore in telephone calls from the White House were improperly funneled directly into President Clinton's campaign instead of to legal party-building activities. 1
 
Ford Faces Safety Lawsuit
Ford Motor withheld information from Federal regulators about an engineering defect that can cause its cars and light trucks to stall at high speeds, documents filed in a lawsuit suggest. The suit seeks the recall of at least two million vehicles produced between 1983 and 1995 and the replacement of a circuit. It also asks for damages that could run to more than $2 billion under California law, even if no punitive penalties are assessed. 11
 
Iraq Panel Criticizes Pentagon
A special White House panel said the Pentagon had lost so much credibility in its investigation of the release of Iraqi chemical weapons in the 1991 Persian Gulf war that oversight of the investigation must be taken away from the Defense Department. In its final public hearing after a two-year inquiry, the panel called on the White House or the National Security Council to draw up plans to transfer oversight to an agency other than the Defense Department -- possibly one with subpoena power, some panel members suggested. 11
 
Ramsey Evidence Reported
A broken piece of paintbrush found in Patsy Ramsey's art supplies matches the wooden section used to strangle her daughter, JonBenet Ramsey, two Denver newspapers reported. JonBenet, 6, was strangled with a garrote -- a stick with a cord attached, at her home in Boulder, Colo., according to the coroner's report. 13
 
Questions on Bail Deaths
The five men who broke into a Phoenix home and shot a couple to death, allegedly in search of a bail jumper, are all in custody, charged with second-degree murder. But the police said the case is becoming more complicated than first reported.

Thalidomide, the drug that was banned worldwide in the 1960's after it produced thousands of babies with missing and stunted limbs, took a step toward Government approval when a committee of scientific advisors recommended that the Food and Drug Administration make it available to leprosy patients, but with tight restrictions. 13

Private Group to Manage Central Park for City
The Giuliani Administration has decided to turn the management of Central Park over to a private group, though they are in effect formalizing a relationship that has been growing steadily for 17 years. The Central Park Conservancy, a nonprofit organization with a prestigious board of corporate and civic leaders, will receive a 10-year contract to continue the work they have been doing: maintaining and restoring the park. 25

Athens Regains Olympics
The Olympics returned to the country of their ancient beginnings and the city of their modern revival when Athens was selected by a surprisingly wide margin over co-favorite Rome to host the 2004 Summer Games. By a vote of 66 to 41, the members of the International Olympic Committee removed the sting of rejection that Athens felt seven years ago when Atlanta was chosen to host the 1996 centennial Olympics. It was in Olympia, Greece, that the ancient Games began in 776 B.C. and Athens revived the modern Olympics in 1896. South Africa, Sweden and Argentina had also sought the games. 33

The vigorous and exacting Hungarian-born conductor who shaped the Chicago Symphony Orchestra into a gleaming virtuoso instrument during his 22 years as its music director, and who won more Grammy Awards than any other performer, classical or pop, was 84. 1
 
BUSINESS DAY 38-51
 
Job Growth Slows Down
The economy created jobs at a slower pace in August, as the unemployment rate inched up one-tenth of a point, to 4.9 percent, from a 23-year low, the Government reported. While the strike at the United Parcel Service held payroll growth to its slimmest rise in nearly a year, other gauges of the labor market provided further evidence that economic growth continues to be robust. 39
 
France Privatizes by Degrees
The Socialist-led Government reached diametrically opposite decisions on privatizing the country's two most visible state-owned companies: Air France and France Telecom. In Paris, the chairman of Air France, Christian Blanc, announced plans to quit after Prime Minister Lionel Jospin firmly rejected his pleas to turn the country's flagship airline into a private company. But just a few hours later, Government officials sent out their formal recommendations to proceed with a much-delayed plan to sell off one-third of France Telecom, the national telephone monopoly, most likely in a public stock offering later this year.

HEADLINE: Reuters to Build 32-Story Headquarters in Times Sq.

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Rudin Organization, one of the oldest real estate families in New York, and Reuters are forming a joint venture to build a 32-story headquarters in Times Square for the British media company.
The partnership plans to build an 844,000-square-foot building at the northwest corner of 42d Street and Seventh Avenue, according to two people involved in the negotiations. The retail stores currently on the site, opposite Disney's New Amsterdam Theater, would be demolished. 
 Under the proposed venture, the Prudential Insurance Company, which controls the property, would sell the parcel to Reuters and the Rudin Organization. Prudential's Capital Group may also provide the partners with a $250 million construction loan.
Reuters executives in New York, who have been negotiating with Prudential for more than six months, are expecting officials at its London headquarters to approve a proposed letter of intent between the company and the Rudins, according to people involved in the negotiations. Reuters is also completing negotiations with both Prudential and city and state officials, who must approve the project.
"It's wonderful news that the Rudins are continuing to develop in Times Square," said Douglas Durst, a developer who is building a 1.6-million-square-foot tower on the opposite corner. "I can think of no one we'd rather have as a neighbor."
For the Rudin family, which has not put up a new building since 1989, the project represents a plunge into a neighborhood that until a short time ago was known mainly for its peep shows and prostitutes. Reuters had talked to other developers, but it was William Rudin, heir to an empire of 39 buildings worth an estimated $1.5 billion, who jumped at the chance to build in Times Square, said several people in the real estate business. Under the terms of the deal, Reuters would initially take about three-quarters of the office space and the Rudins would be responsible for leasing what remained.
Neither William Rudin nor his father, Lewis, returned calls requesting comment. Prudential declined comment, although one official said a deal was in the works.
Prudential has invested $467 million in Times Square since the company was selected by state officials in 1987 to redevelop the area around Times Square and 42d Street. But in recent years, the insurance giant has had no desire to build the four office towers called for in the redevelopment plan.
Prudential sold control of one parcel to Mr. Durst last year, and company officials say they plan to begin marketing two other properties later this month to a select group of developers, including Mr. Durst, the Tishman family and Vornado Realty Trust.
"We have nothing new to report on our search for a real estate site," said a spokesman for Reuters, Robert Crooke. "We continue to look at various sites within New York City and in Connecticut and New Jersey."
Reuters employs about 1,850 people in New York City, most of them at 1700 Broadway, 40 East 52d Street, 199 Water Street and 875 Third Avenue. Although the company has considered locations outside New York, Reuters began focusing on Times Square months ago.
Reuters has asked the city for special tax breaks for the project even though the site is within the borders of the 42d Street redevelopment project and therefore already has an unprecedented level of municipal subsidies. Civic activists have opposed granting companies additional tax breaks to move to Times Square because it is now one of the most desirable locations in the city.
But last year, the Giuliani administration granted the Conde Nast publishing company a $10.75 million tax break to move to Mr. Durst's building at what is known as 4 Times Square. City officials say Reuters wants a similar deal.
"The Mayor has long made it clear he would like to see development as soon as possible in Times Square, and, of course, we would like Reuters to stay in New York," said Charles Millard, president of the Economic Development Corporation. "But I cannot comment on whether we're in those kinds of discussions."
The design of the proposed tower could become a sticking point. State officials had previously approved a relatively staid, corporate design by the architect Philip Johnson that they now find out of harmony with the colorful, neon-infused atmosphere of Times Square. They have encouraged Reuters to design a building with flashing electronic signs and ground-floor retail space, but the company has yet to hire an architect.

HEADLINE: '97 Tax Bills Up About 3% In New Jersey

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
Property tax bills in New Jersey, already among the highest in the nation, went up an average of 3 percent this year, according to preliminary estimates released today by the Whitman administration.
The administration noted that the increase was the smallest since 1991. That year, property taxes rose only 1.4 percent, but it was also the year that an increase in the state income tax was adopted under Jim Florio, the former Governor. 
 "Because of Governor Whitman's leadership, we are seeing a greater commitment to accountability in municipal and county governments as well as school districts," said Jane M. Kenny, Commissioner of the State Department of Community Affairs. "More local leaders are paying attention to the bottom line and that's exactly what the taxpayers are demanding from all of us."
But the 3 percent statewide average increase masks the estimated double-digit increases in two dozen of New Jersey's 566 municipalities. Many of those towns are growing and struggling to keep up with rising school populations.
And the property tax numbers are only estimates. While officials of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's administration say they believe that the actual numbers will not be much different, they say that those numbers may not be available until after the gubernatorial election on Nov. 4.
Four years ago, when Governor Whitman began phasing in her 30 percent cut in state income tax rates, Democrats warned that local government officials would be forced to raise property taxes as the state sent less money to schools and towns.
But the Whitman administration said today's report was proof that that did not happen. The average annual rise in property taxes during Mrs. Whitman's four-year term -- 3.9 percent with today's new estimates for 1997 -- is indeed far less than the property tax increases of 12 and 13 percent in the latter half of the 1980's.
But Governor Whitman's Democratic opponent, James E. McGreevey, was quick to criticize the report.
"The official calculations now document what homeowners already know all too well -- that property taxes have grown to be a terrible financial burden for the residents of New Jersey," Mr. McGreevey said. "The Governor said earlier in her term that property taxes were not her problem, and she has proven it by pushing them upwards by $1.9 billion in only four years."
According to a recent study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, in Washington, the average young married couple owning a home in New Jersey paid $3,562 in property taxes in 1995, far more than in any other state. The next highest property tax bills were in Connecticut, where an average couple paid $2,573.
Some of the largest property tax increases this year were in rural counties, Hunterdon and Somerset, where farmland is turning into housing developments. In both counties, the average property tax bill rose about 6 percent -- double the average increase for the state as a whole.
In Bernards Township in Somerset County, for example, property tax bills rose an estimated 17 percent this year. Barbara Pence, the township's administrator, said that much of the increase was needed to pay for the rising number of public school students. She said that many young families had recently moved to town.

HEADLINE: Cubans Blame Exiles in U.S. for 4 Bombings in a Single Day

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
A bomb exploded in one of Havana's best-known tourist restaurants late Thursday night, following three bombs earlier in the day at three of the city's seafront hotels, in which an Italian businessman was killed.
Employees at the restaurant, the Bodeguita del Medio, made famous by Ernest Hemingway, said there were no injuries from the small bomb, which damaged furniture. 
 The Cuban Foreign Ministry said that bomb attacks were part of a campaign of terrorism organized by Cuban exiles living in the United States, with the intention of damaging the Cuban economy. There were two bombings in July in Cuban tourist offices.
A State Department spokesman here, James Foley, said the United States had no idea of who was behind the bombings, and that the Cuban Government "has not responded to our repeated requests for substantive information or evidence to support that contention" of American involvement.
"We reiterate our commitment to investigate if the Cuban Government provides substantive information or evidence, which they have not done to this date," Mr. Foley said.
Another American official said that Washington had told Havana that the United States was opposed to terrorism everywhere, and would act to punish Americans responsible if evidence was provided that proved Havana's assertions.
But the bombings "are hard to fathom in such a tightly controlled society," the official said, remarking that "it's odd that the Cubans haven't trotted anyone out" as responsible. Given the level of police and Interior Ministry control, violent crime is low in Cuba.
There were numerous theories about who was behind the bombings, the official said, including internal dissidents opposed to the Government, nationalist Cubans offended by the prostitution and glitz of the tourist trade and even the Cuban Government itself in an act of provocation to keep anti-American feeling and national solidarity at a high level.
The Cuban Foreign Ministry blamed Miami-based devotees of the ex-dictator of Cuba, Fulgencio Batista, who was supported by the United States but was overthrown by Fidel Castro in 1959.
The bombings took place on the anniversary of a 1933 coup that first brought Mr. Batista to power, the Foreign Ministry noted, but American officials said the dates could be purely coincidental.
Cuba's tourism industry has become its fastest-growing economic sector and has attracted foreign investment, overtaking sugar exports as the main source of hard-currency income. The bombs seemed aimed at damaging Cuba's efforts to promote tourism and show the island to be a safe place for foreigners.
In Havana, the Interior Ministry said it was "taking the necessary measures against these cowardly and repugnant acts," but provided no details. Pope John Paul II is due to visit Cuba in January.

HEADLINE: Small Stocks Up Again, While Dow Drops

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Investors continued their infatuation with the stocks of smaller companies yesterday, pushing a leading index of those companies to new highs. But concerns about Asian market turmoil and a strengthening dollar weighed on the stocks of larger multinational companies, which could see their earnings reduced by exposure in those countries.
Reflecting the Asian situation, the dollar inched up against the yen but declined against the German mark. The dollar was quoted in late New York trading at 121.06 yen, up from 120.87. The dollar finished at 1.8024 marks, down from 1.8153 late Thursday. 
 Large consumer product companies were major contributors to the decline in the Dow Jones industrial average as multinational members of that group -- like Procter & Gamble -- faltered. Some stocks in the consumer product sector, including P.& G., were downgraded by a Smith Barney analyst.
"One of the reasons the currencies really came to the fore now is the domestic economy really seems to be in cruise control," said Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan.
With the economy moving along at a moderate growth pace, investors are beginning to question the wisdom of paying hefty premiums for the blue-chip companies that have led the market rally this year, Mr. Cliggott said.
"The lack of concern about a big breakdown in earnings, coupled with the strength of the dollar is shifting investors' focus" toward smaller companies because now "it's desirable to be domestically oriented rather than global," he said.
Larger-company stocks also declined because Treasury bonds slumped despite a smaller-than-expected gain in August employment growth. Although shorter-term Treasury issues finished higher, longer issues declined amid continued investor concern that the economy would begin showing signs of inflation pressures, prompting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates before the end of the year, said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker.
The 30-year bond dropped 13/32, to a price of 96 20/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.64 percent, from 6.60 percent on Thursday.
The Dow Jones industrial average finished 44.83 points lower at 7,822.41, although the index posted a gain of 2.6 percent for the week.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks slipped 1.82, to 929.05, but was still up 3.3 percent this week.
The Nasdaq composite index gained 11.14 points, to 1,635.77, a new closing high. And the Russell index of 2,000 smaller companies moved up 3.33, to 433.04, a new high, marking the ninth consecutive session the index has posted a gain.
"The underperformance of the group has been ridiculous and that is simply unsustainable," said Audrey Snell, a senior vice president and portfolio manager at SunAmerica Asset Management, referring to the earlier neglect of small stocks by investors.
She said that the Russell 2000 index was up 20.6 percent this year, compared with a 26 percent gain in the S.& P. index. The Dow, up 21.4 percent this year, is doing slightly better than the small-company measure.
"The Dow has performed magnificently," she said. "It's gone as far as it can go in the near-term given the growth rate," explaining why investors have begun to focus on smaller companies.
"I think it's really the hunt for those sectors that have underperformed in a magnificent market," she said. "The sense is that the Dow is fully valued and the relative value is in the small-cap side."
But the shift in investor affections does not signal that the market rally is winding down, analysts said.
"It just means the market is broadening out and you're not going to get the pickup in the same places,"Mr. Cripps said.
"I find this extremely bullish," Ms. Snell of SunAmerica said. "Healthy markets broaden; they don't narrow."
In the bond market, even the smaller-than-expected gains in the August employment growth of 49,000 and the increase of four-tenths of 1 percent in workers' average hourly earnings were not weak enough to provide much comfort. Some traders took advantage of the bounce in the market when the data were released to sell at higher prices ahead of next week's report on retail sales and producer prices.
While the yen weakened against the dollar, most Asian markets finished higher yesterday, as investors reacted positively to moves of several governments in the region to shore up foreign investor confidence in those markets.
The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong closed up 2.6 percent. The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index in Malaysia leaped 12.4 percent. The Jakarta Composite Index in Indonesia rose 11 percent.
Among United States equities, Procter & Gamble, which led the Dow lower, fell 3 7/16, to 133.
Shares of several other companies faltered yesterday as they reported that third-quarter earnings would not meet expectations.
One was Boston Scientific, a medical device maker, which cited slipping sales growth and higher selling costs in Europe. Earnings for the company, however, will still be positive, analysts said. Boston Scientific closed at 62 5/8, down 13 1/4.
Tupperware shares fell 6 11/16, or about 19 percent, after the company warned that earnings would be significantly lower on declining Latin American sales. Tupperware closed at 28 7/16.

HEADLINE: Job Creation Slowed in August As U.P.S. Strike Curbed Hiring

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
The economy created jobs at a slower pace in August, as the unemployment rate inched up one-tenth of a point, to 4.9 percent, from a 23-year low, the Government reported today.
While the strike at the United Parcel Service held payroll growth to its slimmest rise in nearly a year, other gauges of the labor market provided further evidence that economic growth continues to be robust. 
 "The U.S. economic expansion continues to barrel along at an unsustainable pace," analysts at Salomon Brothers told clients today.
The expansion added 49,000 jobs to the nation's payrolls last month, less than expectations of a gain of 70,000. When the effects of the U.P.S. strike are discounted, the payroll increase would be between 190,000 and 200,000 jobs, Katharine G. Abraham, the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, estimated at a hearing of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
With unemployment at 5 percent or less for the fifth consecutive month, the White House again seized on the Labor Department's report -- the first comprehensive indicator of the economy's August performance -- to point, among other things, to the remarkable lack of wage and price pressures that traditionally have accompanied such a tight job market.
"Our economy continues to roll at a healthy pace," Janet Yellen, President Clinton's chief economic adviser, said in a statement. "Unemployment remains historically low and inflation is in check."
But while private analysts generally stuck to the widely held belief that the Federal Reserve would decide against raising interest rates at its Sept. 30 policy meeting, those ruling out increases at the following session in mid-November have become an ever-shrinking minority.
Paul L. Kasriel, an economist with the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, described today's report as "warm and fuzzy on the outside, threatening on the inside." In other words, figures that showed slower job growth and benign inflation were pointing to continued benign inflation, but were masking less obvious signs of danger.
One such sign, Mr. Kasriel and other economists said, was an accelerated surge in the proportion of the unemployed who quit their most recent job instead of being discharged, laid off or just entering the work force. The August jump -- reflecting increasing confidence of finding another, possibly better, job -- was to 13.7 percent of the unemployed from 12.6 percent in July and 12.2 percent in May and June.
Another surprisingly strong figure was the rise of 47,000 in factory jobs last month, a vigorous rebound from the decline of 17,000 in July, even when allowing for August's return of 10,000 strikers in the steel and automotive industries. Analysts also noted that this came despite a huge buildup in inventories during the first half of the year that many had assumed would force production cutbacks in the second half.
In addition, the length of the private-sector workweek expanded by 12 minutes in August, average hourly earnings climbed a solid 5 cents an hour and the key retail trade sector added 31,000 jobs.
"It still looks like a fairly strong economy," said Subhasis Das, senior economist at Barnett Banks in Jacksonville, Fla.
The payroll number was sharply affected, as expected, by the strike against U.P.S. Although the strike directly involved 185,000 teamsters, some crossed picket lines and there was substantial hiring elsewhere in the transportation business and at the Postal Service. Government jobs climbed by 72,000 last month, reflecting temporary postal workers and jobs in local school systems where the trend toward an earlier end to summer vacation has confounded the seasonal adjustment process and exaggerated recent job gains.
But analysts also noted that the bureau revised sharply higher, to 365,000, the payroll increase for July, which had initially been put at 316,000.
As for the department's survey of households, in which strikers are counted as employed, the job gain last month was a modest 96,000, not quite enough when combined with a 190,000 expansion of the labor force to prevent a slight rise in the unemployment rate, which, before rounding, moved to 4.89 percent from 4.83 percent. The Government regards as statistically insignificant any move of less than two-tenths of a point.
But analysts did consider noteworthy the improved job situation of blacks, whose overall unemployment rate edged down to 9.3 percent as the rate for black men 20 and older dropped to 7.5 percent, the lowest since the mid-1970's, from 8.2 percent in July.
"Declines of this magnitude can be taken as clear evidence of a significant improvement in the employment prospects of black males," said Dean Baker, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
Alexis Herman, the Secretary of Labor, cited a 4.3 percent jobless rate for blacks with a college degree as proof of the value of training. "You can see the gap narrowing" with whites, she said of black unemployment. The jobless rate for white college graduates is 2.4 percent.
Geographically, the Northeast fared best in August as its unemployment rate eased to 5.3 percent from 5.5. The South's rate was unchanged at 5 percent while the rate rose three-tenths of a point in the Midwest and West, to 3 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Voices Doubt On Statistics

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 5

 BODY:
With investors worldwide awaiting his every word, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, cast doubt again tonight on the reliability of key economic statistics but drew no firm conclusions on why the economy has remained inflation-free despite strong growth and low unemployment.
Mr. Greenspan also touched on what he called "the implications for financial and economic stability of the extraordinary rise in equity prices" and noted that asset prices had to be an integral factor in setting monetary policy. 
 But he suggested that the Fed would not seek to rein in stock prices, saying that "unless they are moving together, prices of assets and of goods and services cannot both be an objective of a particular monetary policy."
In his only direct reference to the possibility that the Fed might decide to raise rates later this year to insure against an outbreak of inflation, Mr. Greenspan said that "with labor resources currently stretched tight, we need to remain on alert."
Because Mr. Greenspan's speech was scheduled to be delivered to the Center for Economic Policy Research at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., late on a Friday night -- a time when nearly all financial markets around the world would be closed -- many analysts and investors had expected him to speak more freely than he normally might about stock prices and the changing nature of the economy.
Indeed, the speculation surrounding the speech became so intense that rumors circulated widely on Wall Street during the day that Mr. Greenspan would use the speech to announce his resignation. Mr. Greenspan issued a statement calling the rumors "nonsense."
In the end, his speech broke little new ground. But it continued a process in which Mr. Greenspan, long attacked by critics in Congress for being too secretive about the Fed's deliberations, has essentially thought out loud about some of the most vexing and sensitive issues facing the central bank.
The speech sought to put into historical context the Fed's current efforts to cope with economic conditions that seem to break many of the rules and assumptions that have long guided monetary policy.
Mr. Greenspan discussed how policy makers had abandoned as formal guideposts predictors of inflation like gold prices and money supply figures when it became clear that the changing nature of the economy had made them less meaningful. And he noted how specific conditions, like the stock market crash of 1987 or the credit squeeze among banks in the early 1990's, could force a reshaping of policy.
"Most recently, the economy has demonstrated a remarkable confluence of robust growth, high resource utilization and damped inflation," Mr. Greenspan said in a text of the speech that was released by the Fed. "Once again we have been faced with analyzing and reacting to a situation in which incoming data have not readily conformed to historical experience."
Mr. Greenspan did not explore in any detail the debate over the long-held belief among economists that strong growth at a time of low unemployment invariably pushes up wages and prices, causing inflation. By that rule, the economy now would be deep into a zone of inflationary danger, but there are almost no signs that price increases are actually accelerating.
Mr. Greenspan, however, repeated his long-held belief that the most likely explanation for the current puzzle is that the most widely used measures of productivity are not capturing the improved efficiency of American businesses.
"Nonetheless, the still open question is whether productivity growth is in the process of picking up," Mr. Greenspan said. "For it is the answer to this question that is material to the current debate between those who argue that the economy is entering a 'new era' of greatly enhanced sustainable growth and unusually high levels of resource utilization, and those who do not."
Mr. Greenspan said monetary policy currently focused on achieving stable product prices.
"But what about prices of claims on future goods and services, like equities, real estate or other earning assets?" Mr. Greenspan asked, and then pointed to the economic pain felt in Japan after the bursting of a real estate bubble in recent years as a partial answer.
"The prices of final goods and services were stable in Japan in the mid- to late 1980's, but soaring asset prices distorted resource allocation and ultimately undermined the performance of the macroeconomy," he said.
History, Mr. Greenspan said, "is somewhat ambiguous on the issue of whether central banks can safely ignore asset markets, except as they affect product prices."

UNCROWNED KING
 The Life of Prince Albert.
 By Stanley Weintraub.
 Illustrated. 478 pp. New York:
 The Free Press. $27.50. 
 Stanley Weintraub's sympathetic biography persuades us that Prince Albert "was one of his era's unsung great men." Some aspect of greatness is always elusive, and what is mysterious about Queen Victoria's husband is the source of his social imagination. He was born in a German backwater, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, attended the University of Bonn and toured Italy's art treasures. None of this seems adequate preparation for his role in Britain, the world's leading commercial and industrial power, with its expanding overseas empire. How did Albert know what needed doing and who needed encouraging in a foreign country that was in the midst of headlong transformation? That remains Albert's secret.
Weintraub's book is as fascinating as his subject, partly because of what Albert did and partly because of what Weintraub doesn't do. He never claims too much. His Albert is human: he overworks, grumbles and makes mistakes. And Weintraub does not sentimentalize the royal romance. The 20-year-olds who married in 1840 continued to need and love each other until Albert's untimely death in December 1861, but Weintraub candidly records their tiffs and misunderstandings.
Parliament designed the terms of the marriage to exclude the Queen's husband from government, but starting with Victoria's first pregnancy -- she bore nine children -- he became, in the words of his private secretary, "in fact, though not in name, Her Majesty's Private Secretary." Ministers who had dreaded an alien interloper appreciated his intelligence and efficiency. While Albert never gained popularity with the wider public, those who worked with him liked and respected him. The exception was Lord Palmerston, who, as Foreign Secretary, made policy without consulting the Queen. Yet even he, in time, came around. He was Prime Minister when the American Civil War broke out, and, like other members of his cabinet, hoped for the breakup of the Union. They took advantage of a naval incident in 1861 -- an American warship stopped a British packet on the high seas and took off two Confederate emissaries bound for Europe -- to compose an arrogant note that practically demanded a declaration of war. Palmerston showed the draft to Victoria, who showed it to Albert. He was on his deathbed but summoned the strength to modify the ultimatum to make it acceptable in Washington.
Without formal power, Albert nevertheless wielded immense authority. His innumerable projects outside politics ranged from encouraging "ancient" music to slum clearance.
Elected chancellor of Cambridge in 1847, he discovered that the university did not teach history, economics, law, psychology, chemistry, geography, art, astronomy, natural history or modern languages. Albert went to work, and in 1848 the university senate voted to teach them all. The "Industry of All Nations" exhibition, the famous Crystal Palace of 1851, was another of Albert's triumphs. It turned a profit, which Albert used to finance several institutions in South Kensington, including a museum of the decorative arts that was innovative because it was dedicated to teaching as well as display. Everywhere you find Albert grasping what a modern civilized society should offer its citizens and trying to supply it.
Weintraub is at home in the period (his previous books include biographies of Victoria and Disraeli) and conveys nuances as easily as facts. He allows readers to observe that England's free press could be as cruel to royalty in the 19th as it is in the 20th century: on the eve of the Crimean War, newspapers accused Albert of supporting Russia, and rumors circulated that he and Victoria had been imprisoned in the Tower for treason.
Candid about Albert's flaws, Weintraub can usually find a reason, if not an excuse. Albert's prudishness seems excessive, but unchastity had wrecked his parents' marriage and his brother's health. Victoria's habit of dramatizing her feelings has turned her admiration of her husband into a stale joke. Yet Weintraub, recording Albert's achievements without Victoria's italics, shows that, however irritating her style, her judgment was accurate: Albert was a marvel.

The Inflationary Universe
 The Quest for a New Theory of Cosmic Origins.
 By Alan H. Guth.
 Illustrated. 358 pp. Reading, Mass.: Helix Books/
 Addison-Wesley Publishing Company. $25. 
 Modern physicists have settled on a theory of the world's origin that would flunk almost any nonscientist's reality check. The entire universe, they insist, was once the size of a grapefruit. Rationalists may furtively wonder if supernatural versions of the world's creation are not rather easier to swallow.
For those willing to let the high priests of physics make their pitch, Alan H. Guth's new book, "The Inflationary Universe," is a user-friendly guide to getting one's mind round the big bang and, weirder yet, the events that preceded it. His explanations are probably as clear as can be, given that they are translated from their original language of mathematical physics. His book is also a significant document in the history of science, since it portrays an intellectual revolution of which Guth was the principal mover.
For readers who enjoy David-and-Goliath tales, Guth offers the real thing. As a young physicist with almost nothing on his resume, he conceived a radically new idea about the first critical instants in the birth of the universe. Establishments do not generally fold their hands easily, especially to obscure upstarts in a field. But so compelling was Guth's notion -- the astronomer Joseph Silk has called it "the only new idea in cosmology since Einstein" -- that it quickly succeeded.
One night in December 1979, while still an unknown 32-year-old physicist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, Guth had a remarkable insight that showed how to sweep away a bunch of embarrassing discordances between the big-bang theory and observed facts about the universe. "Spectacular realization," he wrote in his diary above a statement of his as yet unscrutinized idea.
Guth's great idea was that the universe, during its first instants of existence, expanded at an exponential rate (doubling at every unit of time) before assuming the steady expansion rate of the big-bang theory. This early phase of hyper-expansion, known as inflation, explained three highly puzzling features of the universe that the big-bang theorists could not account for. These are known as the flatness problem (having to do with the universe's mass), the horizon problem (its homogeneity) and the absence of magnetic monopoles. Magnetic monopoles, particles carrying a single north or south magnetic polarity, could and should exist in profusion, according to current theory, yet none have been found. It was in trying to figure out the strange absence of monopoles that Guth came up with the inflation scenario.
With amazing brashness Guth publicly tossed this firecracker into cosmology, a field he had to school himself in as he was overturning it. He describes hastily reading a semipopular account, the physicist Steven Weinberg's book "The First Three Minutes," to prepare for a critical presentation of his work at Stanford. The cram job sufficed. "HELL OF A GOOD DAY," Guth afterward confided to his diary. The usual fate of radical new ideas is to be ignored, suppressed or stolen, particularly when they come from someone without allies or standing in a field. Guth had been rejected for all the assistant professorship jobs he had applied for and was in essence an itinerant scholar. It says much for the brilliance of his idea, and the openness of the physics community, that within a few days of his Stanford lecture he had received job offers from Harvard, Princeton and six other universities.
Guth rejected all of them for a job at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One brilliant idea had propelled him from nowhere to the pinnacle of success. But then triple catastrophe struck. He had to undergo major surgery, the removal of his colon. His proposed mechanism for getting the early universe to work turned out not to shut off in the right way (creating what was known as "the graceful exit problem"). And as his idea became known it emerged that a Russian scientist, Aleksei A. Starobinsky, had conceived a form of the inflation theory several years before Guth. Another Russian, Andrei Linde, who is now at Stanford, subsequently found a solution to the graceful exit problem and developed what is now the current form of the theory, known as chaotic inflation. But it was Guth who sold the world on the idea and so deserves a large share of the credit.
Inflation, despite its drab name, is an idea of vast importance because it affords a glimpse of what may have happened before the big bang. Inflation suggests that there are many universes, continually being created and destroyed like bubbles on the ocean. The idea is not yet proved but most astronomers and physicists, it is probably fair to say, regard it as highly attractive. The language and concepts of inflation have not yet sunk into the public consciousness as deeply as has the big-bang theory, which inflation modifies, but will doubtless do so in time.
Evident from Guth's account are both his luck and his cleverness. He had the good fortune to be working on the monopole problem with an obliging fellow postdoctoral student, Henry Tye of Cornell. Tye made essential contributions to their monopole work but allowed Guth to write up the inflation hypothesis separately. Both were trained in the physics of subatomic particles, and were ignorant of some of the other fields into which their monopole pursuit led, such as plasma physics and cosmology. "There is a whole branch of physics associated with the complicated behavior of plasmas, and Henry and I knew none of it," Guth notes in his account of the monopole work. Like a couple of amateur adventurers, Guth and Tye kept discovering papers in the physics literature that had anticipated their conclusions, sometimes by decades. They cadged scraps of information from experts. Lunchtime conversations with colleagues would send them racing off in a different direction. Eventually they developed an idea worth publishing, and it was near their deadline, with Tye about to go on a long visit to China, that Guth conceived the idea of inflation. His cleverness lay in perceiving instantly how helpful inflation would be in cosmology, and in being quick enough on his feet to persuade other physicists he had a winner.
Alan Guth's book is written in a brisk, engaging style uncharacteristic of scientific autobiographies. His story tells much about how science sometimes works, how the universe may work and how on occasion one bright individual can cause an intellectual revolution.

He finds trouble around every corner. Dec. 31.

The New York Waterfront
 Evolution and Building Culture
 of the Port and Harbor.
 Edited by Kevin Bone.
 Illustrated. 280 pp. New York:
 The Monacelli Press. Paper, $35. 
 In 1870, a naval engineer, Ralph Aston, submitted a design to New York City's newly created Department of Docks. Executed in delicate pastel colors, it envisioned a Manhattan waterfront devoted equally to commerce and leisure. A dense, sawtooth arrangement of piers, drydocks and boatyards would wrap around the lower third of Manhattan, but spaced at regular intervals would be a chain of seven small parks, each with its own boathouse, baths and steamboat landing. The Aston plan was never adopted. Throughout the city's history, the demands of commerce and transport have been paramount, and as a result, the residents of New York, a city defined by rivers, wetlands and ocean, have a surprisingly distant relationship with their own waterfront.
The authors of the essays in "The New York Waterfront: Evolution and Building Culture of the Port and Harbor" want New Yorkers to take a close look at the city's "forgotten edge," a sorry fringe of derelict structures that, the authors say, represents one of the country's great opportunities in urban planning. "Today we are at a decisive point," Donald Squires and Kevin Bone write in the book's first essay. "Should the port facilities be restored in the hopes of reinvigorating commercial and industrial use of the harbor, or should we pursue a course that seeks to make the harbor into a useful natural resource suitable for a wide variety of civic purposes, like recreation?" The book does not answer the question. Instead, in six essays by architects, historians, teachers and students associated with Cooper Union, it offers a historical framework for debating the future of the waterfront and, in documenting the great engineering projects of the past, lays down a challenge to the city.
Before the Department of Docks, under Gen. George B. McClellan, adopted a plan in 1871 to encircle Manhattan with a masonry river wall and wooden piers, waterfront development moved in spasms. Peter Stuyvesant established the first pier at the foot of present-day Pearl and Broad Streets in the 1640's, and citizens were given land grants for carrying out waterfront improvements. By 1800, most of the tip of Manhattan was ringed with bulkhead and landfill. The arrival of steamships in 1807 and the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 turned New York into the country's leading port. By 1853, the waterfront bristled with 112 piers, but a welter of often conflicting agencies ruled it. By 1870, it consisted of "mean, rotten and dilapidated wooden wharves," The New York Times complained, "the abode of rats and the hiding places of river-thieves."
The creation of the Department of Docks ushered in the era of municipal planning, and the harbor became a laboratory for experimenting with new maritime techniques and materials: "At the peak of port activity, thousands of harbor structures were built. . . . Virtually every foot of shoreline was occupied by some kind of maritime building: basins, docks, piers, wharves and sea walls, as well as the headquarters of traders, haulers, shipbuilders, blacksmiths, rope makers, riggers, oyster merchants, brewers, carpenters and all other conceivable maritime support trades."
Decline set in in the 1930's, as the automobile eliminated ferry traffic and container ships bypassed New York for New Jersey. Today the waterfront has reverted to its condition before 1870. "One of the greatest urban planning opportunities in the world lies sterile, fallow and crumbling," the authors write.
Change is stirring. The book's final two essays review several waterfront projects, some of them already under way, notably Route 9A, the offspring of Westway, which will result in a five-mile boulevard along the Hudson, divided by a median and flanked by a walkway and bicycle paths. A companion project, the Hudson River Waterfront Park, will complement Route 9A with a 270-acre strip running for four miles between the river and the new road. Across the East River from the United Nations, ground has been broken for Queens West, a 74-acre mixed-use development. Future plans range from Donald Trump's proposed Riverside South development on the West Side to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's recent proposal to create a container-cargo superport in Brooklyn with a rail-freight tunnel to New Jersey.
But the only municipal blueprint for the waterfront is the Comprehensive Waterfront Plan, adopted in 1992. Tentatively and tellingly described as a "discussion document," it calls for a bit of everything: port revitalization, parks, open spaces, public access to the water, housing and commercial activity. A series of follow-up studies by the Parks Department envisions an "emerald necklace" of parks and bicycle paths ringing Manhattan.
Will any of this happen? The city's civic culture, riven by small, entrenched interest groups with a genius for spiking any project, affords small hope that the city could ever plan on a scale to equal the Department of Docks. In his introduction, Bone states that one purpose of "The New York Waterfront" is to "inspire a quest for the kind of greatness in public works that has distinguished New York City in the past." But in the late 20th century, the authors conclude, greatness may be too much to ask. We are well into the age of small steps rather than great leaps.

Show Me the Money

BYLINE: By John Tierney 

 BODY:
"The Millionaire Next Door" has created an unsettling mystery for New Yorkers. The book, which has been on the New York Times best-seller list for more than seven months, describes the results of the most comprehensive research ever done on America's wealthy. It reports that the typical millionaire is a self-made man who owns a small business, lives in a $320,000 home and has never spent more than $140 for a pair of shoes, $235 for a watch or $399 for a suit.
The mystery, of course, is, next door to whom? Manhattan is lousy with millionaires, but who has ever spotted one of these guys from the book? Last year it was reported that Si Newhouse, the chairman of Conde Nast Publications, had economized by buying a Ford Taurus, but the news seemed so aberrant that it triggered widespread panic about the future of the magazine industry (especially among the editors who submit expense accounts to Newhouse). 
 Are there hordes of rich tightwads hiding in Manhattan? Not according to the experts I consulted at a shrine of capitalism, the plaza of the World Financial Center, on a balmy evening when thousands of traders and investment bankers were drinking, counting their winnings and gazing lustfully at the large yachts moored along the Hudson River. They reacted incredulously when I described the typical attributes of the "Millionaire Next Door."
"Where is this guy from, Kansas?"
"He's not on my floor. Where in New York could you find a suit for $400?"
"Everyone in my office is a millionaire, and the worst they'll drive is a low-end BMW."
"Well, a lot of the millionaires on the trading floor do dress like slobs. But their watches start at $2,000."
"Maybe there are some millionaires like that. But remember, these days a million is, like, nothing."
Finally, though, I found a broker, Jeff White, who reported multiple sightings. "You won't see this type working on Wall Street," he explained, "and he may not live in Manhattan, but we do see him among our clients. I've been amazed to discover that multimillionaires will come to investment seminars just to get the free pens and legal pads."
This was the same surprising discovery that the book's authors, Thomas Stanley and William Danko, originally made in 1973 when they first interviewed a group of people worth more than $10 million apiece. Stanley and Danko, marketing researchers at the State University of New York in Albany, rented a penthouse on the Upper East Side and hired gourmet-food designers to supply four kinds of pate and a case of fine Bordeaux. When the first decamillionaire arrived, he turned down the Bordeaux by explaining that he drank two kinds of beer: "free and Budweiser." The other decamillionaires shared his gourmet instincts. Not one of them touched the pates.
Why is it surprising to discover that typical millionaires are so . . . typical? One reason is they keep a low profile -- with their budgets, they don't get out a lot. But it's also because the popular image of the millionaire comes from Manhattan, which is the last place most self-made millionaires want to live. They may make their fortunes in New York -- Stanley and Danko found an exceptional number of Russian and Hungarian immigrants who have become rich here in unglamorous businesses like janitorial services -- but they're still bridge and tunnel people at heart. They live in the other boroughs and the suburbs because they can't stand frittering away their hard-earned money here.
Scrimping may be the key to wealth elsewhere, but here the traditional secrets to the good life have been skimming and scamming: skimming a percentage of the riches flowing through Wall Street and corporate headquarters, scamming to put other people's money to your personal use. The city's great high rollers are the members of the expense-account class, who provide themselves with meals, box seats, corporate cars and apartments by spending the money of their shareholders -- many of whom are those tightwad millionaires living elsewhere in America.
It may seem unfair that these frugal souls end up subsidizing profligate Manhattanites, but they themselves often choose to do it directly, because many of them voluntarily send checks to their own children here. "These millionaires have money but no status," Stanley says, "so they'll pay for their children to get it by subsidizing them to live in Manhattan. A scrap-metal dealer in Cleveland will provide financial aid to a child who's working at a low-paying, prestigious job in Manhattan -- a writer, a medical researcher, an art historian, a lawyer at a nonprofit group. And that child is not going to be as frugal as his or her parent, because it's much easier to spend other people's money. We've found that people who inherit money spend much more on a car and a home than people who make it themselves."
This is a good deal for New York in some ways, because the infusions of cash support the creators of the city's culture and style. But sometimes these high-minded children are inspired to dabble in public policy, and their perspective on finance creates problems. Some of New York's greatest spending binges came at the hands of wealthy scions like Robert Moses and Nelson Rockefeller.
In practical matters, New York would be better off relying on the parents who created the wealth. I have long advocated requiring Manhattanites with trust funds to turn their voting privileges over to their parents, but until this is done (a few quibblers have raised constitutional objections) the quickest way to benefit from the parents' wisdom would be to invite them to move here.
We need a public-relations campaign -- "NY loves $$$$$$$" -- to lure these frugal millionaires here. It will be difficult to get them to splurge, but we can probably open a few wallets with the right message: "Millionaires, move next door to us. If you don't spend your money here, someone else will."

HEADLINE: Where Children Rule

 BODY:
I wanted to congratulate Nicholas D. Kristof for his article "Where Children Rule" (Aug. 17). I started primary school in Japan, came to the United States in the second grade and returned to Japan in the seventh grade. I personally never felt much difference in the level of academic content between the two systems. The emphasis definitely differed, and I learned more in the United States in some subjects and more in Japan in others. What I remember most vividly is the shock I felt when I saw a janitor, a grown man, cleaning up after us second graders for the first time. 
 When I started junior high school in the United States, I remember the pressure of suddenly growing up. Teachers stopped telling some students to work and try harder. In Japan, teachers continue to be paternalistic until the end of junior high, maybe even senior high. What a relief it was when I returned to Japan and was allowed to be a kid again.

HEADLINE: The Fall and Rise of Kilmer McCully

 BODY:
Michelle Stacey's article about Dr. McCully offered a profound and poignant commentary on a number of critical issues in scientific research ("The Fall and Rise of Kilmer McCully," Aug. 10). 
 When scientific issues are controlled by insiders with reputations and money issues at stake, there are severe consequences for both science and health. Publicly financed research support should not be a popularity contest or the result of economic forces or political dexterity at empire building. Peer review has significant limitations, and given the forces at work in science today, the press can play a vital role in assuring that important issues receive the attention they deserve. Hopefully, the issues raised in the McCully article will serve as a stimulus for sustained and extensive news coverage of controversial issues that affect the public welfare.

HEADLINE: Turning to 'Violence' to Kill Time

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
FOR THE GERMAN director Wim Wenders, "The End of Violence" -- a meditation about paranoia, computer-controlled gadgetry and government nefariousness in Los Angeles that opens on Friday -- began with an unexpected delay in the long-planned production schedule for "Billion-Dollar Hotel," a high-tech thriller Mr. Wenders had developed with his friend Bono, the lead singer in the rock band U2.
"Instead of sitting around waiting," said the director, "we figured we'd rather do something." 
 Bono departed for a tour with U2. Mr. Wenders and the screenwriter Nicholas Klein, who had also been working on "Billion-Dollar Hotel," began brainstorming what Mr. Wenders came to call "our little movie that didn't need to be anything." It was, first and foremost, a vehicle for killing some time. Until "The End of Violence" picked up two real stars, Bill Pullman and Andie MacDowell. And until Mr. Wenders was invited to have its premiere come as the centerpiece of the Cannes International Film Festival last May.
But that invitation did not arrive until later. Mr. Wenders's initial conversation with Mr. Klein turned to the notion that violence has become a fact of everyday life, cutting across social and economic lines, from inner-city neighborhoods that are dominated by drug gangs to expensive communities where the cocktail-party chatter is about security guards and carjackings carried out with military precision.
So they decided to write a screenplay about violence, with one ground rule: this would be a nonviolent film -- no blood and guts just for the sake of blood and guts. "We had nightlong discussions about how to represent it," Mr. Wenders said. "When we finally said, 'What do we do now?' it almost imposed itself: where else to put it if not Los Angeles?"
Three months is how long some directors take to shoot individual scenes, not whole movies. But Mr. Klein knows how to write fast; in the 1980's, he turned out scripts on tight deadlines for weekly television shows like "MacGyver." For "The End of Violence," he spent a month at his word processor. Then he spent another month polishing the script while Mr. Wenders handled preproduction details. That left 27 days for shooting on a budget of $5 million raised by Deepak Nayar, who produced the David Lynch film "Lost Highway."
"THE TIMING SEEMED fairly preposterous," Mr. Klein said, "but that was its allure. From conception to opening in Cannes was about nine months. From, 'Hey, let's make a movie' to 'Here we are,' it was pretty fast." Mr. Wenders, who is best known for haunting films that blend traditional Hollywood forms with an ambivalence about Western culture since World War II, added, "Very fast by Hollywood standards, and I guess by any other standards."
Still, all they had originally was a theme. "Normally, you come up with a story, and inside that story, certain characters get developed according to the needs of your plot," said Mr. Wenders, who won awards at Cannes for "Paris, Texas" in 1984 and for "Wings of Desire" in 1987. "We did the opposite. We had a theme -- violence -- and we agreed that we wanted it to remain the subject, not to become the device or texture."
He and Mr. Klein made what Mr. Wenders calls "Christmas lists" of potential characters. "When we compared our lists, we kept the ones we had in common and threw out the others," Mr. Wenders said. "He had a wonderful character that he had to give up that was a voyeur, and I had a character that was a fireman."
That left several characters to flesh out, plus a story that would tie them together. One character was a NASA-trained surveillance expert who had been hired to set up a network of remote-control video surveillance cameras that would record street crime as it occurred. The cameras -- hundreds of them, on rooftops, utility poles and apartment-house marquees, with unobstructed views of dingy flophouses and shady freeway underpasses and the ability to zoom in for tight close-ups -- were supposed to eliminate violence.
The idea was that muggers and murderers would stop committing mayhem once they realized that it would be captured in living color -- meaning they might be, too. Never mind the Orwellian overtones or the fact that large-scale surveillance cameras had already been installed in downtown Baltimore, where they were credited with bringing about a drop in crime, and in Miami Beach, where they were abandoned after one year as ineffective. New York City tried similar cameras in the early 70's and dropped them after almost no arrests resulted. "The most boring viewing material on earth" was how one police official described the tapes.
Clearly, Mr. Wenders and Mr. Klein could dream up something more interesting. But they were not that far along when they worked out the other main character, a Hollywood producer named Mike Max whose specialty is state-of-the-art thrillers. When he is carjacked in an incident that may or may not have been orchestrated by the shadowy agency installing the cameras, he makes an only-in-Hollywood plea to his captors: "I want to give you a million bucks," he says. "In points."
"We were, more than anything, playing with different genres -- to some degree Hitchcock, to some degree Tarantino," Mr. Klein said. "You always face the question of to what degree do you engage in the genre and to what degree do you spoof it. As we refined the script, we started getting more and more linear and more and more plot-driven."
But first they gave Mike Max a wife, Paige -- an unhappy, unfulfilled woman whom Mike had literally put on hold once too often -- and realized that the actress they saw in the role was Ms. MacDowell. Mr. Wenders remembered her from Steven Soderbergh's "Sex, Lies and Videotape"; he was the president of the jury that honored the film at Cannes in 1989. "She took us by surprise," he recalled. "We were all totally in love with her."
Mr. Wenders said that when he called to offer Ms. MacDowell the part, there was just one problem: "I never had a script to send to her." It was still in Mr. Klein's computer.
That did not matter. "It was an opportunity for me to get to do a character I had not been seen doing," said Ms. MacDowell, whose credits include "Green Card," "Groundhog Day" and "Four Weddings and a Funeral." "It's so funny how people sometimes can have a lack of imagination. They can't imagine that you can do something until you show them that you can. They see me as this romantic comedy person, I guess."
She even liked the costumes. In one underwater shot in "The End of Violence," she wears a swimsuit that is perhaps best described as minimalist. "That bathing suit was so cheap," Ms. MacDowell said. "The woman who did the wardrobe told me she went shopping where Heidi Fleiss shops."
To play Mike Max, the filmmakers eventually settled on Mr. Pullman, who had appeared in Mr. Lynch's "Lost Highway" and as the President in "Independence Day." By coincidence, Mr. Wenders saw both films the same week. "It hit me," said the director, "that a guy who could do these two characters convincingly could be this producer character in 'The End of Violence' who really has to stretch to go from this cocky, arrogant power player to a humble human being. Bill imposed himself by that double play."
Gabriel Byrne got the part of the surveillance expert after a strange encounter at the Hollywood nightclub the Viper Room. "In the darkness of the back room," Mr. Wenders said, "I was introduced to an actor whose face I couldn't see." And Mr. Wenders hired Loren Dean, a veteran of a number of Off Off Broadway productions who claimed to have seen Mr. Wenders's "Wings of Desire" 35 times, on the strength of an audition tape.
Almost before they knew it, it was time to start shooting, but off-camera action got in the way. "I'm superstitious," Mr. Wenders said. "Any movie where we have a bad start, in my own experience, will come to a good ending." In "Kings of the Road," in 1975, he said, "we shot for three days, three full days, then we got our first report, something with the shutter of the camera was wrong; we had to go back to square one."
But "The End of Violence" was, he said, "the worst start ever." The technicians had barely set up in what was to be Mike Max's house when sirens went off -- brush fires were heading toward the neighborhood. "We had to jump in our cars and leave the place," Mr. Wenders said, "and literally five minutes later, the fire was on the other side of the street." The production was shut down for three days. "We had no other set to go to," he said."
On such a low budget, Mr. Wenders had no leeway, and the actors had commitments at the end of the 27-day shoot.
THEY WERE SHOOTING so fast that Mr. Klein found himself writing one scene without realizing that Mr. Wenders was already shooting it. "I had written a few lines, and he says, 'Would you print those out?' He looks at them and says, 'This is good.' I said, 'Where are you going with this?' He just says, 'Keep going.' I think, 'Surely he's shooting another scene now and we'll talk about it.' Then I realize that he's just shot those three sentences."
As if the rushed schedule were not vexing enough, "The End of Violence" was Mr. Wenders's first film in Cinemascope -- and the first full-length film for his director of photography, Pascal Rabaud, whose credits included music videos and commercials. "Before I knew we were shooting it, we had made that decision," Mr. Wenders said, "and soon I was seeing rushes." The wide-angle format affected the way he worked. "Scope is not just a different format," he said. "It's an altogether different way of organizing what's happening inside the frame, how you resolve a scene. I really had to learn it. The first week, I made all the mistakes you can possibly make."
The film that moviegoers will see starting this month is not the same film that was shown at Cannes; Mr. Wenders spent $500,000 -- about 10 percent of his budget -- to re-edit and remix "The End of Violence" after the Cannes screening. "We pretty much rushed it to get ready for Cannes," he said. "You have to lock your picture cut in order to have a print that can be shown in Cannes. I had this slight uneasy feeling that we had locked it a little too early. That feeling persisted, and after the screening, I went back and incorporated some changes. The film became a little shorter and a little more linear. It had been a little complicated before, unnecessarily so. So I thinned it out."
The post-premiere re-editing was something he had done before, with "Paris, Texas." "It was exactly the same," the director recalled. "We had to go to Cannes, we made it with the print the day before, we subtitled it overnight, just like 'End of Violence.' I saw it sitting in the audience."
And for Ms. MacDowell, seeing it in the audience -- that particular, hypercritical audience, filled with past Palme d'Or winners -- was "pretty intimidating."
"It was just this little film we had made," she said, "and there in the audience were all these directors I was in awe of. Not that I don't feel good about the work -- it's a good film. But I wanted to applaud them."
Mr. Wenders maintains that "The End of Violence" is not a "message" film. "It doesn't have a message that you can sum up in the end and leave the theater with," he said. "Violence is too complex an issue to put into a handy formula, pro or con."

HEADLINE: Ever Earnest and Funny, Ever Relevant to Youth

 BODY:
AT 81, WITH A CAREER OF more than six decades in the theater, the eminent playwright Arthur Miller is in the midst of a renaissance, especially, it seems, among directors who are almost a half century younger.
At the Signature Theater Company in New York, Mr. Miller is the subject of a yearlong retrospective involving four of his plays. The season opens in October with a revival of "The American Clock," directed by James Houghton, 38, the founder and artistic head of the Signature. 
 The following month, the Roundabout Theater Company will present a revival of "A View From the Bridge," directed by Michael Mayer, 37, and starring Anthony LaPaglia.
A production of Mr. Miller's "All My Sons," directed by Barry Edelstein, 32, ran in June at the Roundabout to critical acclaim, where it had arrived from a stint at the Williamstown Theater Festival last summer.
Another Miller play staged that season at Williamstown, the American premiere of "The Ride Down Mount Morgan," directed by Scott Elliott, 34, the artistic director of the New Group, a young New York theater company, is expected to be presented at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in the 1998-99 season.
Mr. Edelstein, Mr. Elliott and Mr. Houghton talked recently at The New York Times about the reasons for the new interest in Mr. Miller's work, especially among younger theater people. Here are excerpts from their conversation.
 
Scott Elliott. There's a great deal about Arthur that is misunderstood in this country. I think that happens any time you have your biggest success in your 30's. Americans have come to expect "Death of a Salesman" after "Death of a Salesman." Arthur continues to evolve as an artist, to experiment with form, no matter what anybody thinks. That's really what art is about.
 
Barry Edelstein. When we did "All My Sons" at Willamstown, before it moved to the Roundabout, there were dozens of apprentices working all around the theater. They're in their late teens and early 20's and very few of them had seen or read the play. I would watch these kids walk out of that theater a mess, burbling with tears. That generation has no sense of how powerful theater can be. I don't think people at that age associate going to the theater with that kind of cathartic experience.
 
Elliott. It tells you something about our educational system here, as opposed to what happens in London. We don't encourage our youngsters to understand theater or go or anything. And it's scary.
 
James Houghton. That's rooted in the hit-or-miss ethic that exists in this country. Students probably have read "Death of a Salesman" and maybe "The Crucible." They've read "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" They're reading the hits. And they don't dig any deeper, which is really disturbing, especially if we're talking about theater students.
The consistent theme with all of our great writers is that they're constantly searching for a deeper understanding of themselves through their work and through the environment they live in. We'll go and see a whole exhibit of Picasso or Monet and appreciate each work for what it is in its part of the process, but we won't do that with the theater or writers in general.
 
Elliott. Last summer I worked at Williamstown with Jon Robin Baitz and Arthur Miller back to back on two plays that had been done elsewhere, which they were rewriting because of things they had learned from other productions. Working with Robbie and with Arthur, 50 years apart, it felt like they were both the same age.
 
Houghton. Their common bond is their passion. There's no other reason to be in the theater than for passion and a need to communicate in that form. You're not going to make money. Arthur and Robbie seem the same age because it's the same passion that feeds them both.
 
Elliott. You sit down to your lunch of pizza and beer with Arthur and you feel like you're talking to a contemporary because he has such a need to reach out to younger audiences. He wants people to come to the theater.
 
Edelstein. The thoughts he has about the world -- the way it is, the way it could be, the way it ought to be -- still agitate him as powerfully now as they did when he sat down at age 32 to write "All My Sons."
What's happening with this sudden resurgence of interest in his plays in New York is, I think, a response to the fundamental seriousness of Arthur's writing. His plays are characterized by an almost complete lack of glibness. They're very funny at times, but they're earnest. You sit in their presence and you feel there's a thoughtfulness and a gravity about them. That has, on the one hand I think, created this impression of, "Oh boy, we don't want to go there because we're going to be lectured to." But on the other hand it involves a genuineness that can be cathartic and refreshing to witness.
 
Houghton. It's why we can go back to the Greeks, why we can go back to classic drama and feel rooted to it, to something real.
 
Elliott. Arthur feels there is a relevance in his plays that can appeal to a younger audience. That is one of the reasons he's reached out to younger artists to direct his work -- he thinks that maybe they'll be able to tap into it. We're from the therapy generation. It's a very different one than the older generation of directors. But the themes he explores through all of his work are still pertinent and important today.
The beauty of what Arthur did is he said, "I'm going to do what I believe in, because it's all I know how to do, and if you like it, you don't like it, tough luck." It's what happens with every artist.
Who would have thought that Edward Albee would have a new resurgence after he went through a period where everybody was sort of turning their nose up at his writing? All of a sudden, people are saying it's brilliant again.
 
Edelstein. We're living now, I hope, at the end of a moment that's been so saturated with irony that you can't mean anything, you can't say anything without it being undercut or spun around into something glib and dripping with cynicism. I think people are hungry once again for something that actually means something.
 
Houghton. The odd turn of events in recent years is such that now it's almost hip to go back to our writers.
 
Elliott. You know why? Because the people who could be the playwrights of our next century are writing movies. You can't make a living in the theater. You have to do it in between. And you can be sure that in 50 years they're going to be doing "An American Daughter" by Wendy Wasserstein and "Sex and Longing" by Christopher Durang to great accolades. Because those plays are going to be representative of an era of theater that happened now, that our critical environment loathes to accept. That same thing seems to be happening today with people like Albee and Miller.
 
Houghton. If you're going to say, "O.K., I'll see Barry's production of 'All My Sons,' and it better be good," it puts an incredible amount of pressure, and the wrong kind, on all the artists involved. I think the overall theater audience tends to be defined by a very small percentage of the theater -- the Broadway theater-going audience. And this notion of having to see a hit comes about because Broadway is a theater of economics. All theater is, but hopefully, as you move along the scale, it becomes less about economics and more about balancing. It's true throughout our regional theater as well. We can't define our audience using just one aspect of the theater.
 
Edelstein. That's a very good point. It isn't productive to look at what's happening between 42d Street and 50th Street as in some way representative of the entire country's theater-going needs.
 
Houghton. It's an insult, not only to the audience but to all the artists who are working beyond 42d Street, across the country. Without those people there will be no new plays, there will be no rush of new talent bubbling to the surface. The theater that is not Broadway must absolutely be supported, or else we're going to lose our artists completely. They'll all move, because they economically must, to television and film.
 
Elliott. Unfortunately, I think the economics once again speak to it. It's very expensive to go to the theater. In the smaller theaters like our own, we try to keep ticket prices low for that reason, although we hurt ourselves in the meantime because we don't charge as much as we could. We set them low because one of the philosophies we have is to try to keep younger people in the theater. I don't think that they don't want to go or that they're not curious or don't want to explore it. But when it comes to laying down bucks like that, it's hard.
 
Edelstein. It's odd to be at the age we are and feel like dinosaurs. Which is why Arthur's passion is such an inspiration. When he started out, it was hugely different. To hear him tell stories about Boston tryouts and endless periods of development -- it's shocking how the landscape has changed.
 
Houghton. It's interesting though. When I worked with Horton Foote -- they're contemporaries -- Horton and I talked about that and this thriving time when Broadway was everything and plays were all over the place. And he sort of nipped that in the bud right away. He said, "Yeah, there were lots of plays, but there were lots of really bad plays." Still, there were more opportunities, that's for sure.
 
Elliott. But that's a good thing. What's bad and what's good? A lot of people tell me something's bad and I'll go see it and think it was great. It's all relative. There should be that choice.
 
Houghton. Absolutely. But my point is that it's all perspective. Our perspective on what was then is very different. They were living it and struggling with it and, frankly, people have complained about it for years. "Theater's about to die. Theater's dead." People have been saying that since it was created, since the guys in the cave were banging stones.
Yet everyone in the business knows there's nothing more special about a moment that works in the theater. It's never about the set or the auditorium. It's about the human element, people affecting one another. When it gets down to those bare bones, which is as bare as it gets, that is the theater. That's why it takes us to a place that's different from what happens with movies.
 
Elliott. Well, we're very vulnerable.
Houghton. We're extremely vulnerable, and it's a living, breathing moment, never to be repeated in the same way.
 
Edelstein. There is a sense of fragility in Arthur's plays that connects to what you both are saying about the vulnerability of the theater itself. In Arthur's plays, wonder is a very big idea. Willy Loman talks about how extraordinary certain things are. He keeps saying, "Isn't that remarkable? Isn't that remarkable?" There's a simple sense that human existence is a miraculous thing.
I think that Arthur, for all of his ferocious intellect, has a very childlike and awesome sense that a human being is a marvel. It's at the core of all of his plays and at the core of all great art -- a simple perception that life is a miraculous thing.
There was a big tribute to him not long ago at the Roundabout and one of those who spoke was the British director Nicholas Hytner, who said about Arthur, "In England we revere him as one step above God and one step below Shakespeare." The wonderful thing is that when you meet the man, he does not wear the mantle of Mosaic wisdom. He's a theater guy.
 
Houghton. If he did, his plays would not speak to us.

HEADLINE: Apartment Seller Picks a Different Approach

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
WANT to own your own home? Here's how! Send $100 and a statement convincing me that you are the owner of this dream home. The winner gets: a spacious, sunny 1 bedroom garden apartment in Hartsdale, w/private entrance, designer ELK, DR, terrace, pool, free parking, pets welcome, walk to shopping and train, quiet neighborhood, cozy retreat nestled amidst ample cultural and social events, 35 minutes from mid-town NYC.
"To be considered, please include certified check for $100 made payable to Big Dreamz, your name, address, tel. no. and a SASE, with your entry and mail to Big Dreamz -- Contest Web Site. 
 "You must demonstrate income to cover maintenance fees and pass board interview. Deadline to receive your entry is Sept. 20. Winner will be chosen on Sept. 27, 1997."
This is the text of a flier displayed at the 42d Street Deli at the Avenue of the Americas and 42d Street in Manhattan.
It was time to sell, but instead of listing her co-op apartment with an agent, Susan E. Cifelli, a marketing executive, came up with an unusual plan.
"Selling it in the conventional way was out," she said.
"I bought the co-op on Oct. 23, 1987, the height of the market, so I paid a top price, $98,500. Then came a big remodeling job, putting in a modern kitchen, redoing the floors, putting down new wall-to-wall carpeting and installing a brand new water heater to the tune of an additional $30,000. Now it's time for me to move on, but I know I can't get my money out today."
Observing that in 1988 prices for co-ops began to decline, Miss Cifelli said:
"And they continued the slide until this year. Although the market is now rebounding, it is still below 1987 levels, so I started exploring other ways to sell the place."
When she bought the apartment, she was 29, a newly transferred executive.
"I came from New England Telephone Company, a subsidiary of Nynex, in Boston," she said. "In college I majored in economics and Italian and from there I went into a very good management training program at New England Telephone. To my surprise, I found I had an affinity for computers and I was able to develop key technical skills on the job.
"Eventually, I was made responsible for planning, implementing a fully automated department. I grew up in Yorktown. And when Nynex offered me a promotion in the corporate internal auditing department in White Plains, as associate director of systems and technology, it was both a good career move and a good move personally."
She continued: "Nynex gave me all sorts of incentives in a generous relocation package, including moving expenses, closing costs and a special working-in-Westchester enhancement, because Westchester is more expensive than Boston."
She started her new job in June 1987 and lived in a hotel for several months before she found an apartment that suited her.
"The rooms are large and sunny," she said. "The building is only three stories high, set in nicely landscaped grounds. There's a pool, and I have a terrace. I've been very happy in it.
"The neighborhood is quiet, and the neighbors are nice, but now I can afford to buy a house. And that's my dream, to have a house with a huge garden. I love to garden."
By chance, while watching the movie "Spitfire Grill," she said she found the way to sell her apartment .
"It was one of those rare moments when I realized I had the right solution. The movie gave me the idea for a contest, which would not only raise the money for my house, but it would make someone else's dreams come true, someone who otherwise could never afford to own a home."
The first item on the agenda was obtaining legal advice. "I ran the concept by my attorney, and he agreed to research the legalities of the project," she said. "After contacting various state and municipal agencies regarding possible laws or regulations preventing such a contest, he gave me the go-ahead."
Initially, Miss Cifelli planned to use only print advertising. "I knew it would be very expensive to have a Web site developed, but my dad encouraged me to develop one myself."
She started researching the most logical place for her site and chose America Online.
"I wanted to build a commercial site, and when I called America Online, I got a very knowledgeable support engineer who told me about America Online Press, how it worked and how to find it on the Web. I was amazed at how straightforward and intuitive it was. Creating my first page was no more complicated than creating a text document. At first, I didn't think beyond having a Web page, but soon the idea grew into a site. I wanted to have other things besides the details of the contest, like music, art, poetry to attract people to my site."
Finally, after many failures to go on line and a period of frustration, Miss Cifelli had a successful launch of her Web site, named Big Dreamz. "I then filed a listing request with each of the major search engines, companies like Yahoo that supply technical information about Web sites, to make sure that someone looking for Big Dreamz could find me. I also had my contest fliers distributed in delis and places where lottery tickets are sold in Westchester and Manhattan. My goal is for 5,000 entries."
The launch took place on June 27. The winner is to be selected by lottery on Sept. 27. By Aug. 26, Miss Cifelli had received checks for $100 from 300 contestants.
Yet she remains optimistic, even buoyant. "I think there has been a very positive reaction," she said. "One of the things about lotteries is that the closer they get to the date, the more people line up to take a chance. The dynamics of my Big Dreamz contest are the same. I'm expecting activity to really heat up now."
For the drawing to take place, Miss Cifelli said she needs a minimum of 1,500 entries. "If I don't reach that number, I will be obligated to return all the money -- $100 to every contestant."
Now a product manager at Nynex, now Bell Atlantic, on the Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan, Miss Cifelli is in charge of developing and carrying out marketing initiatives to meet annual revenue commitments of $25 million.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
A Mixed-Housing Program to Stabilize Urban Areas

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
OVER the last year neat clusters of mixed-income one- and two-family homes have sprouted in cities across New Jersey, thanks to the state's $240 million Urban Homeownership Program.
The program pairs state subsidies with public and private construction financing to produce low- and moderate-income and market-rate housing on sites in city neighborhoods. By encouraging home ownership and a mix of housing to draw buyers, including the middle class, back into cities the program seeks to stabilize urban areas and spur more development, state housing officials said. 
 In the first year of the program a total of $130 million in public and private financing has been awarded to 45 developments. While most of the projects mix market-rate housing with lower-cost units, some contain only the latter.
The projects now in various stages of development will produce 1,342 mixed-income residences in 18 municipalities, including Lakewood, Newark and Long Branch. Of that total 486 homes will be sold at market rates and 856 will be sold to low- and moderate-income families -- those earning 50 to 80 percent of their area's median incomes. The total will also include 240 rental units in two-family houses.
Ultimately, the program -- the largest initiative under the Whitman administration's 1995 housing policy -- is expected to produce 2,250 homes over the next three years, according to data from the New Jersey Housing Mortgage Finance Agency, the semi-public arm of the Department of Community Affairs, which oversees the state's housing. The mortgage agency administers the program -- the state's first attempt at promoting home ownership in cities, where ownership rates are low.
"Home ownership is the critical piece in taking back these neighborhoods," said Timothy J. Touhey, executive director of the state mortgage agency. In providing construction incentives to builders to mix market-rate and lower-cost units the hope is that "a market can be created that can sustain private investment," Mr. Touhey added, noting that partnering with private lenders "evenly spreads the risk."
For banks, sharing in the financing of such projects helps them fulfill their obligation under the Federal Community Reinvestment Act, which requires lenders to meet the credit needs of the communities they serve.
Under the program the state mortgage agency provides half of the construction financing for each project from its administrative funds or, if necessary, through the sale of bonds. The other half comes from one of 14 private lenders participating in the program.
Moreover, the state provides $25,000 to $45,000, respectively, in subsidies for each low- and moderate-income home, keeping prices down. The state also provides up to $25,000 in subsidies for market-rate units in nine cities that are part of the administration's Urban Initiative, which channels resources to marginal neighborhoods in those municipalities.
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages, at a 5 percent interest rate with zero points and 3 to 5 percent down, are also being offered to qualified buyers by the state's mortgage finance agency through more than 75 lenders.
The lower-cost units must be reserved for low- and moderate-income buyers for 10 years. In some cases, in municipalities where the state has determined that there is a need to increase the amount of low- and moderate-income housing, the term has been extended to 30 years.
When the house is first sold profits from appreciation are shared equally with the state as a way for it to recoup its investment. The same is true for the subsidized market-rate units.
Most developers view the program favorably, saying it offers a kind of "one-stop shopping" since construction financing, subsidies to underwrite the lower-cost units and mortgages to buyers can be obtained in a single process. Some, however, would like to see the program modified so that, among other things, the profit-sharing provision on the sale of units is removed, making the units more marketable.
Affordable housing advocates also have some concerns. "Generally, there is an agreement that promoting a mix of affordable and market-rate housing will help revitalize urban areas," said Rick Sauer, associate director of the Affordable Housing Network, a Trenton-based organization that represents private and nonprofit developers of low- and moderate-income housing. "But we question the use of the state's limited pool of public funds to subsidize market-rate units that do not become a permanent part of the affordable housing stock."
MR. SAUER said that although members of his group were using the program because it is a key financing source, "there needs to be a multiprong strategy" to reviving the state's cities.
Among the larger projects financed under the program is Forest Park at Lakewood. Its developer received $13.6 million in construction financing and $2 million in state subsidies to build 120 mixed-income town houses, with three to five bedrooms each on Pine Street in an area of this Monmouth County community dotted with vacant land and older houses.
Once a chicken farm, the Pine Street site was approved three years ago for all market-rate town houses, which never got built "because the market was not there," said Christiana Foglio, president of Community Investment Strategies, a New Brunswick-based consulting and development company. Her concern is working with the developer, Pine Street Developers of Lakewood, on the Forest Park project.
Receiving the state subsidies "changed this from a nonworkable to a workable project," said Ms. Foglio. The idea was that once "we created a neighborhood we could attract buyers for the market-rate units," she added.
Forest Park ultimately will contain, 45 market-rate town houses, each with 2,000 square feet of space, and 75 low- and moderate-income units, each with 1,800 square feet of space. Prices range from $69,500 for the lower-income residences to $123,750 for the market-rate models.
So far 22 houses have been sold and contracts have been signed on 20 more, said Ms. Foglio. The project already has had an economic ripple effect, she added, pointing to it as proof renewed developer interest on nearby vacant parcels.
Ms. Foglio's firm together with Procida Realty and Construction Corporation of the Bronx was awarded $1.8 million in construction financing and $375,000 in state subsidies to develop 18 mixed-income homes on scattered sites in Long Branch. Construction on the three-bedroom homes, with space ranging from 1,400 to 1,500 square feet, is to start in the spring of 1998. Sale prices are to start at $55,000 for the lower-income units and range up to $100,000 for the market-rate units.
In Newark, $4.2 million in construction financing and $1.35 million in state subsidies are being used to build Hilltop Gardens, comprising 25 two-family homes and 9 single-family houses. The project also received a five-year abatement on property taxes from the city.
The homes are now rising on four long-dormant acres on 18th Avenue in the city's Central Ward, the site of the 1960's racial riots. Twenty percent are being sold at market rates, with the rest being made available to families with low and moderate incomes. United Metropolitan Ministries, a group of four local churches, is developing the project. It is being constructed by America's Dream Homes of West Paterson.
"Without this program," said Paul R. DeBellis, the company's president, "the nonprofit developer would not have been able to secure construction financing from a bank alone."
The two-family homes contain an 800-square-foot two-bedroom unit topped by a three-bedroom apartment with 1,000 square feet. The one-family houses have three bedrooms and 1,200 square feet of space. Sale prices range from $79,900 to $124,900. Average monthly rents for the apartments are $600.
So far, 23 of the houses at the project have been sold. Mr. DeBellis said the tax abatement together with the state subsidies and mortgage financing make the project attractive to buyers of all incomes.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/ Valley Stream, L.I.;
Family-Centered and Hugging Queens

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
WITH nearly 34,000 residents living along its tightly packed streets of one-family houses on small lots, Valley Stream is the third most populous village in New York State. It is also among the more affordable communities in Nassau County, one of the most expensive housing markets in the country.
For considerably under $200,000, a compact, detached, well-maintained Cape Cod, colonial or ranch-style house, typically built in the 50's or 60's, may be purchased in this middle-income, low-to-the-horizon area where public schools send about 90 percent of graduates on to higher education. 
 Local real estate brokers say good schools -- there are three high schools to choose from -- and a short commute to the city from the village's two Long Island Rail Road stations are key attractions. Young families, often from Queens and Brooklyn, are frequent buyers.
"The key selling point is proximity to Manhattan while still being on Long Island," said Robert R. Miller, broker-owner of Century 21 Miller and Miller in Valley Stream.
Villagers speak of amiable, family-centered neighborhoods where children are once more much in evidence, as they were during the village's suburban boom time 40 years ago.
But residents pay a price for living east of Queens, which abuts the village. Property taxes are more than twice those west of the border. "They feel suburban living is better for their families, so they are willing to pay higher taxes," said Dorothy L. Potter, broker-owner of Valley Stream Realty and a village resident for 33 years.
MAYOR JIM DARCY, a villager since the age of 2, said higher taxes must be weighed against the benefits of living in an intact hometown with a vivid history, where people care enough to contribute, as they did this summer, toward medical expenses for a native son with leukemia.
A large number of civic and service groups, village sports programs including midget football, two local papers -- The Valley Stream MAILeader and The Valley Stream Herald -- and a local chamber of commerce intent on revitalizing downtown areas add energy and texture to village life.
While single-family detached homes predominate, there are some other housing choices.
At the 89-unit Gibson Gardens Cooperative, a brick complex near the Valley Stream railroad station, the asking price for a two-bedroom co-op is $65,000, with monthly maintenance of $900.
One-bedroom units are $50,000, with maintenance of $780. Sponsor-owned units rent for $1,200 and $1,000, respectively.
The average cost of a three-bedroom unit in the smattering of condominium units in the village is about $155,000.
The main village-owned recreation area, the 36-acre Hendrickson Park, has three outdoor swimming pools, a fitness trail, tennis and handball courts and lakeside promenades. Seasonal pool passes are $125 for a family and $55 for single adults.
THE nine-acre Barrett Park is in the 1920's vintage Gibson neighborhood south of Sunrise Highway. (East of it is the North Woodmere section, which juts out into Woodmere in the shape of a musical note.)
The park has two baseball fields, a playground, a roller hockey ring and handball and basketball courts. The 13-acre Firemen's Memorial Park has baseball and football fields and is a center for local sports teams. These parks are free for village residents.
The 97-acre Valley Stream State Park, which is partially in the village, has basketball courts, softball fields, picnic tables, bike paths and walking trails. Admission is $4 a car or $39 for an annual pass.
The predominantly Republican village is in the Town of Hempstead, the home base of the powerful Nassau Republican Party. It has its own justice court but relies on the county's Fifth Precinct for police services. The police say it is a low crime area.
From May to June, street fairs are held downtown on the last Thursday of the month. A summer concert series, this year featuring the West Point band one week and the Great South Dixieland Jazz Band the next, is offered at the Village Green by Central Avenue and Sunrise Highway, where the Valley Stream Fire Department Carnival and Casino was held last month.
Small businesses and franchise outlets crowd Merrick Road, Central Avenue and Sunrise Highway.
But for serious shopping there is the 200-store Green Acres Shopping Center, at the village's southern boundary. Anchor stores include Macy's, Sears, Caldor and J. C. Penney.
Valley Stream's beginnings date to 1640, when the Dutch West India Company bought land the village now occupies from the Rockaway Indians.
In the 1840's, Robert Pagan, a local shopkeeper, led a successful effort to gain a local post office to spare residents the trip to Hempstead. Inspired by the village's valleys and streams, he coined the name Valley Stream, which was quickly adopted.
Carol C. McKenna, the president of the Valley Stream Historical Society, said the name was unique in the United States. "We are very proud of that fact," she said.
In the early 20th century, the village gained renown as a place for fast living. People called the downtown area Rum Junction. There was also Cookie Hill, a coy reference to another area's saucy reputation. And Merrick Road, which runs through the heart of the village, was dubbed the Great White Way of Nassau County.
The legendary nightclub entertainer Texas Guinan greeted customers at one of two well-known roadhouses with her trademark "Hello Sucker." Rudy Vallee and Guy Lombardo performed at the other.
The village incorporated in 1925, midway through a decade of early growth. By then, William R. Gibson, a builder of houses and apartments in the Ridgewood, Richmond Hill and Elmhurst sections of Queens, was already erecting homes for white-collar workers from the city in the neighborhood that still bears his name.
An architecturally matching Long Island Rail Road Station, paid for by Mr. Gibson in exchange for a guarantee of rail service, opened in 1929. It is also named for him.
By the mid-50's, village population was 36,000 and space was at a premium. Mayor Arthur J. Hendrickson, a titan in village history, negotiated purchase of 36 acres next to Valley Stream State Park for creation of the village park named in his honor.
Schools have always been a top priority for the village. But the organization of local public schools is a bit confusing. The Valley Stream Central High School District, one of only three high school districts on Long Island, is comprised of three high schools.
There are also three separate elementary school districts, Districts 13, 24 and 30, with a total of 10 schools.
MOST students in the village attend Valley Stream Central High School, not to be confused with the central school district. But students may now attend either of the other two high schools -- Valley Stream North and Valley Stream South -- with the permission of the district superintendent.
Combined enrollment for the elementary and secondary schools is about 8,400. The schools also serve North Valley Stream and parts of Elmont, Franklin Square, Malverne and Lynbrook.
Nearly 70 percent of the high schools' Class of 1997 graduates earned Regents diplomas.
A district program encourages students to take the most rigorous academic program appropriate for their abilities. School officials say this accounts for the high percentage of Regents diplomas. The high schools offer advanced placement programs in 16 subjects. Valley Stream Central High School teaches grades 10-12. A separate junior high school, Valley Stream Memorial, teaches grades 7-9. Valley Stream North and Valley Stream South are combined junior-senior high schools for grades 7 through 12. The district has no middle schools.
The central high school district and the three elementary districts are currently studying consolidation into a single school district or two districts for grades K-12.
"We are trying to decide the best path to take," said Martin G. Brooks, the interim superintendent of the Central High School District. He said tricky school tax questions were involved.
Overcrowding has become a problem in some elementary schools in the past four years, he said.
There are two Roman Catholic schools in the village. About 300 students attend Holy Name of Mary School.
Tuition ranges from $830 to $1,870 for nursery through pre-kindergarten, $1,870 to $3,720 for the higher grades, depending on grade and the number of students from one family attending. Outsiders in kindergarten through grade 8 pay $2,800 to $,4300.
Blessed Sacrament School has about 425 students in nursery classes through grade 8. The school has a new computer laboratory, and an extended-day program for students of working parents work is planned. Tuition for grades 1 through 8 is $2,190. Varied fees apply for nursery through kindergarten. Outsiders are charged $2,580 in kindergarten through grade 8.
Villagers always know which way the wind is blowing. When it is from the east, flight paths for John F. Kennedy International Airport shift, bringing jet noise. But east, some point out, is not the prevailing wind direction.

RESTORATION: The Pagan-Fletcher Restoration, a National Historic Site where Valley Stream history is preserved, is opened from 1 P.M. to 4 P.M. on Sundays and by arrangement. That the rambling white house, with its Greek Revival facade, has survived at all is a tribute to years of effort by local preservationists led by Theodore O. Libath who stepped in to save the rundown house. "I opened my mouth," said Mr. Libath, the chairman of building restoration for the Valley Stream Historical Society, which administers the site. "I got tired of seeing nothing done." In 1977, the village purchased the house from its developer owners. By 1992, after years of fund raising, the restoration was complete. Though altered and added to over the years, the house is on the site where Robert Pagan and his wife, Ellen, settled after arriving from Scotland in about 1837. It served, variously, as a farmhouse, general store and Methodist religious center, and was enlarged by subsequent owners. A Victorian era parlor and kitchen and historical documents are on display. Admission is free. Donations are accepted.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Linked to Weehawken, N.J., Ferry;
Plans for Waterfront

 BODY:
As development grows along New Jersey's Hudson River waterfront, plans are being made to turn part of Weehawken's shoreline into a commercial and residential enclave built around an expanded ferry terminal.
Plans for the 100-acre site are being advanced by a partnership between Arcorp Properties of Weehawken and Roseland Property of Roseland, N.J. Arcorp is owned by Arthur E. Imperatore, who owns New York Waterway, which runs the terminal. Roseland bought 150 adjacent acres in West New York from Mr. Imperatore in 1995 and is building a 4,080-unit residential community. 
 Mr. Imperatore's original plan was to build a Venetian-style city on the entire tract, but the recession and other problems intervened. On the Weehawken site he opened a marina and a restaurant and began the ferry service to Manhattan.
Up to 2,200 residences and 2 million square feet of commercial space could be built on the site, but "the likelihood is the density will be lower," said Arthur E. Imperatore Jr., president of Arcorp and New York Waterway. The partners intend to emphasize commercial development. "There is a greater opportunity for it," given the transportation improvements, said Carl J. Goldberg of Roseland. The expanded terminal is to be ready in 1999.

Beyond Retailing: Westbury Mall Aims to Entertain

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

DATELINE: WESTBURY

 BODY:
WITH the grand opening two days ago of the Source on a 38-acre site on Old Country Road, shoppers can experience what mall developers say is the newest approach to retailing: The 736,000-square-foot mall, which includes an existing 213,000-square-foot Fortunoff, has been designed to entertain.
Visitors can shop at one of 65 stores or kiosks (with more to come), while eating in a food court shaped like an airplane hangar or in one of four restaurants. The mall, whose architect is RTKL Associates of Baltimore, will also have a spa. 
 About two-thirds of the retailers are open for business; others are still finishing up their space. All but 40,000 of the 523,000 square feet of new retail space is leased.
"The idea is that you come to one place," said Alan Fortunoff, the president of Fortunoff. "That becomes a day's experience in an environment that's entertaining, without having to get in and out of a car." Parking for 4,000 cars is available.
The Fortunoff chain, started 75 years ago in Brooklyn, has had its flagship store in its Westbury location since 1964. The $145 million expansion was developed in a joint venture with the Simon DeBartolo Group of Indianapolis, which built the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn.
In 1989, Fortunoff signed a deal to sell its property to Westfield, an Australian shopping mall developer, which intended to develop it as a mall incorporating Fortunoff and drawing tenants like Neiman-Marcus. But Westfield pulled out of the deal in December 1990 after the downturn in the economy.
"After a thoughtful pause, we decided that demand was increasing for quality merchandise at a lower price than the conventional department store offered," Mr. Fortunoff said, explaining the shift in concept to a mall at which so-called off-price retailers are the anchor tenants.
Off-price means brand-name merchandise sold at a discount. At the Source, that category of retailers includes Off 5th -- Saks Fifth Avenue Outlet and Nordstrom Rack, which are newcomers to Long Island, along with a Loehmann's, an Old Navy store and Fortunoff itself.
Simon DeBartolo, a leading shopping center developer, has ownership interests in 187 properties around the country, of which 115 are regional malls, including the 1.4 million-square-foot Smith Haven Mall in Smithtown.
At the Source, the Indianapolis developer is continuing an approach that has been successful elsewhere : blending off-price retailers with restaurants and entertainment.
The mall will include a two-story Virgin megastore and a Rainforest Cafe, both newcomers to Long Island. The 375-seat restaurant, on the mall's second floor, surrounds patrons with steamy waterfalls, simulated thunder and lightning and jungle noises, along with animated figures of jungle animals such as elephants, monkeys and snakes, and live parrots and tropical fish in large aquariums. Giant fake butterflies flap around among artificial and real greenery.
Two other restaurants, a 172-seat Bertolini's and a 300-seat Cheesecake Factory, are also open. The 270-seat Brooklyn Diner is scheduled to open by the end of the year.
Stores also offer entertainment.
At the Fortunoff Watch Store, rear walls set up like garage doors roll up to display stock. Innovation Luggage has an imitation airport carousel, a giant compass and a big spinning globe.
At SegaGameworks, to open in the spring, patrons are to be able to play a broad spectrum of virtual-reality games and others in what is described as a fantasy atmosphere.
The Great Train Store allows customers to play with trains, and also has electric trains circling the store on trestles suspended from the ceiling.
ABC Home on the Road, a branch of ABC Carpet and Home in Manhattan, will sell its furniture, linens and antiques in what ABC's president, Evan Cole, called a "stage setting without the curtains and the sets," with a "show that changes all the time." The store, 50,000 square feet, opens in October.
Shoppers can indulge in some pampering, too. Cosmetics Plus, a cosmetics superstore, has a facial salon. The Pure Maximus Spa/ Salon, to open in November, will have a spa for both men and women, with massages and thermal baths. A Continental breakfast and snacks with Champagne will be served, and there will be a cappuccino bar. Special events will include fashion shows and lectures on health and beauty.
Long Island has become a magnet for developers and national retailers, because they view its demographics as among the best in the country.
A market study for Simon DeBartolo found that 1.5 million people with an average annual household income of $78,078 live within a 10-mile radius of the Source, and that the average annual income on Long Island as a whole is $58,118. Annual retail sales in Nassau and Suffolk have increased over 30 percent in the last five years and now total $33 billion. Fortunoff sales exceed $166 million annually.
Retail developers say there is room for more stores, even in the crowded environment of the Nassau Hub, which includes the Source, the 2.4 million-square-foot Roosevelt Field Shopping Center, where a 225,000-square-foot Nordstrom department store recently opened, and 600,000 square feet of retail space at Roosevelt Center, a 2.6 million-square-foot mixed-use development that adjoins the Fortunoff property.
"Every business has a point at which there are not enough dollars left to go around, but we haven't reached that point," said Louis L. Ceruzzi Jr., president of Ceruzzi Properties of Westport, Conn., which is developing Roosevelt Center, where hotels, offices and housing are still to be built, in partnership with Edward J. Minskoff and Allen Silverman of Manhattan. "Shoppers will now have more reason to come to this area because of the variety of choice and because of the competition," Mr. Ceruzzi said.
Wilbur F. Breslin, a Garden City developer, who recently broke ground for a 1.6-million-square-foot mall in Yaphank, has long maintained that Long Island is "undermalled."
"If you took a ring of 2.6 million people anywhere else in the United States, you'd find 20 to 25 regional malls servicing that amount of population," he said. "Long Island has seven regional malls, and ours will be the eighth."
Additional malls and so-called power centers, which are shopping centers with large national tenants, are on the way.
THE Taubman Company of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., in partnership with the Tribune Company of Chicago, is proposing a one-million-square-foot shopping center in Syosset near Exit 43 of the Long Island Expressway. Neiman-Marcus, Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom have expressed interest in locating there, said Tony Ness, Taubman's senior vice president of development.
The 40-acre site, owned by the Tribune Company -- which had planned to build a printing plant for The Daily News, but then sold that newspaper -- was once occupied by Cerro Wire and Cable. The developers need a special use permit from the Town of Oyster Bay before the project can proceed. "Right now there is no critical mass of better retailing anywhere else on Long Island," Mr. Ness said. "We would have a whole shopping center full of the kind of stores you find on Madison Avenue, with anchors like Neiman-Marcus, in an enclosed environment."
Closer to construction, with a spring start scheduled, is the 736,000-square-foot Airport Plaza Shopping Center in Farmingdale. There, 300,000 square feet will be occupied by a three-story sports complex called Sports Expo, featuring hockey rinks, basketball and tennis and a soccer field.
"To me, the formula for success is a top location and a good tenant mix of big advertising and power stores that offer value to the consumer," said Peter L. Levine, president of Levcom, a West Paterson, N.J., shopping center developer that is building Airport Plaza for the property owner, the Fairchild Corporation of Chantilly, Va.
"That success is more assured if you combine retailing with entertainment and the latest category, which is sports," Mr. Levine said. "I predict that in 10 years there won't be retailing power centers or malls, but destination points that offer themes and multiple attractions to families."

HEADLINE: Chasing a Goal on a String in the Satellite Tour

BYLINE: By CHUCK SLATER 

 BODY:
THE splendor and riches that are big-time professional tennis have been on display in Queens for the last two weeks. In today's finals of the United States Open, the winning man and woman will each receive a check for $650,000. Their opponents will have to be consoled with $350,000 apiece.
Even the losers in earlier rounds, some separated from the finalists by just a few strokes or a shot a half-inch wide, went home with large checks. The total purse for the competitors in this year's United States Open is $11.8 million, half of it going to women. 
 For the young professionals at the top of the Women's Tennis Association tour, the travel is first class, the hotels are first rate, the cities are the most glamorous, and appearance and endorsement fees often exceed the generous paychecks.
Perhaps 200 young women fit that description. About the same number make a living on the fringes of the main tour.
But a few more strokes and light years removed from that world, thousands more chase the dream in more modest circumstances.
The purse money may be $10,000 for the entire field. Travel is economy class. Hotel rooms are of the $50-a-night variety and usually shared. Tournament sites are dots on the map.
This is a world of long practice sessions, longer waiting periods and short paybacks. It is made palatable only by a love of tennis and because, for a very few, the main tour and a place among the elite 200 is the reward.
It is called the satellite tour. It is Barrie Bernstein's world.
Last Wednesday, as the field was sorting itself out for the big-money final rounds at the Open, Ms. Bernstein, who grew up in Scarsdale and divides her time between Briarcliff Manor and Manhattan, was on a plane to Romania. Ahead of her were three satellite tournaments in three weeks. In the fall, there will be others in Israel and Egypt.
She will keep her eye on the ball. And on expenses.
"Usually the hotel minimum is $50," she said, "so we share a room. In Europe, we save on breakfast since a Continental breakfast is provided. Bread and juice. I have lots of bread and juice.
"In most of these towns, the town is just a hotel and maybe three tennis courts. You practice and then you wait. If, say you're fourth up on court 3, you might get on at 10:30 at night, so you wait around, watch and read a lot. You spend a lot of time in the hotel, too.
"In Elvas, Portugal, on the Spanish border, there's nothing there but a tennis club."
Then there are the paychecks. If a player loses in a satellite qualifier, there is no check. Achieve the main draw and each victory brings a return of sorts.
Ms. Bernstein, whose knowledge of the game makes her a strong doubles player, has had virtually all of her limited success in doubles. That includes her first professional paycheck.
"My partner and I won a round in the main draw in Bossoneens, Switzerland, last September," she said. "We split $50. So my first check was for $25 -- no, $20 after taxes. It's the most exciting $20 I ever made in my life."
A satellite player has to love tennis. Barrie Bernstein, 24, does.
"She picked up a racquet when she was 2; my husband and I played," said Randee Bernstein of Briarcliff Manor, the mother and chief booster of the young professional. "She always had fantastic hand-eye coordination."
At Scarsdale High School and the University of Pennsylvania, Ms. Bernstein played first singles for four successful years. "I thought I'd had enough tennis," she said. "I didn't know if I could take it further. Little did I know how much I would miss it."
Less than a year after graduating and going to work, she asked her parents to support her efforts to make it in professional tennis.
"It wasn't an easy conversation," Ms. Bernstein recalled. "Dad was skeptical. But I told them that if I didn't do it now, I might well regret not giving myself a chance for the rest of my life."
Mrs. Bernstein said: "We said we would give her two years. And it costs us more now than a year of college. She needs a personal coach, but we can't afford it."
And Ms. Bernstein said: "I feel I'm just getting back to where I was when I stopped tennis for a year." She picked up two doubles medals at the Maccabiah Games in July during "the most exciting tennis experience I've had" and headed for Romania with racquets and hope.
"But if this tennis thing doesn't work out," she said, "I'm planning to go to graduate school."
For now, she is reaching for her star and loving it.
"I could not be happier," she said. "I'm in shape. I'm traveling the world. I'm doing something I love. I couldn't ask for much more."
Just that big breakthrough to the big time.

HEADLINE: Long Island Q&A: John J. Shalam;
With a Fine Eye for Trends in Electronics

BYLINE: By SUSAN KONIG 

 BODY:
IT began almost by accident 30 years ago. Problems with a buyer left John J. Shalam, a partner in a tiny Japanese import concern, with 2,000 car radios that he thought he would never sell.
But not only did he sell them. In a few months he had formed his own company, the Audiovox Corporation, to keep up with the growing demand. 
 Today, Audiovox, in Hauppauge, is a leading designer and supplier of sound and security systems for automobiles and cellular telephones. Last year the company, which is listed on the American Stock Exchange, recorded sales of just under $600 million. Cellular telephones account for most of its business, selling two million last year.
The company is a formidable factor in automobile electronics, domestically and worldwide. Its car-security systems hold the largest share of their market in the United States.
Audiovox also has a small home electronics division. And, of course, there are the car stereos, which changed Mr. Shalam's life.
Mr. Shalam, 63, came to the United States from Egypt in the 1950's to attend the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, from which he earned a bachelor's degree in economics. The Continental Grain Company in New York offered him a job that he turned down because he was not a citizen. He worked without pay until his visa was issued. Later he worked briefly for Custom Imports Inc., the Japanese business, before starting Audiovox in 1965.
An avid horseman, Mr. Shalam is president of the Old Westbury Horsemen's Foundation, which creates and maintains trails.
He and his wife, Jane, live in Old Westbury. They have three sons.
Q. How did you start in the import business?
A. As a bachelor in the 60's, I went to my sister's house several times a week for dinner. There I met a man named Caesar, who was also originally from Egypt. He operated a small trading company out of Japan and he asked if I'd go out and promote some business for him.
We struck an agreement. I'd solicit people in New York who wanted to buy any kind of product made in Japan, while Caesar, who was in Tokyo, would go to the factories, order them and ship them here. We built up a pretty nice business with pocket transistor radios, baseball gloves, binoculars -- many different sundry items.
Q. What was the turning point for you?
A. Caesar sent me a box with a sample car radio in it. My job was to find buyers. I found a guy in Brooklyn who wanted 3,000 of them. But when they arrived, he would only open a letter of credit for 1,000. Basically, I was left with 2,000 radios, which I had to sell pretty fast or we'd lose a lot of money.
I searched for distributors in the Yellow Pages. Not only did I find people to buy them, they liked the product so much that they asked me to ship more. I was reluctant to do it since the last deal had gone sour. But they kept calling me. So finally I agreed. The items became so popular that by 1965 I phased out all other products to focus exclusively on car radios. That was the start of Audiovox.
Q. Was growth rapid?
A. Yes. Auto electronics is a tremendous industry. It began with AM radios. Then FM became popular. There was FM stereo, four and eight-track tape players. Now it's cassette and CD players. Every few years there's a whole new product that comes along and restimulates this industry.
Q. What will be the next revolution?
A. Everyone is talking about automobile navigation systems, which are already in some rental cars. They let you find the best route, the least trafficked areas, etc. If you're in an unfamiliar area, they direct you to hotels and restaurants. They're somewhat expensive right now, around $2,500, but I think that, with time, as their production increases and it becomes more competitive, you're going to see a lot of this type of equipment in people's cars. It's something we are working on.
Q. Do you design and sell car security systems?
A. Yes, the little transmitters people walk around with on their key chains, where you push a button and the doors unlock, and the lights flash. We have probably the largest market share on this product in the U.S. today.
Q. Why do those items have to be "sexy" to sell well?
A. People in this country don't buy products strictly for security. Seat belts wouldn't sell if they weren't mandated. And if you had a car alarm which simply sounded when someone broke in, but there was no other evidence to suggest that you had it, people wouldn't buy it.
But if you combine the alarm with features that can make the door locks pop up and and the trunk pop open remotely, from the outside, then you've got something. The ability to start your engine remotely is also becoming very popular. You can stand up to 50 feet away from your car, push a button, and the engine starts itself. In the winter, when your car's outside, you can warm the engine for 10 or 15 minutes before you leave. The heater is left on, and the car is warm and comfortable when you get in. It's the same in the summer with air-conditioning. These features are all incorporated in alarm systems today.
Q. How did you enter the cellular telephone business?
A. Back in late 1983 people started talking about these new cellular telephones that were manufactured by Motorola. We were heavily involved in the auto-sound business, but we could see it was going to have a limited future because, increasingly, manufacturers were shipping cars with complete accessory packages.
We thought the cell-phone business was a natural for us, because in those days all of these phones were for the car. There were no portables until six or seven years ago. And who was best suited to install phones in cars? The guys who were installing the radios. They had facilities -- the garages, the installers.
I'd always thought cars and communications were the two things Americans were most in love with, and here was a perfect setup. So we went to Japan and established a relationship with Toshiba. In 1985 they started supplying phones under the Audiovox brand. Now we work with Toshiba and other overseas manufacturers.
Q. How many Americans own cell phones?
A. Right now there are 45 million subscribers, and that number is expected to reach or exceed 50 million by the end of this year. Ninety percent of cell phones sold today are portable, not car phones, though we still carry both products.
Q. How much do they cost?
A. In the very beginning cell phones sold for around $3,000. They came down quickly, to $1,500, then $1,200. Today we sell some mobile units for as low as $115. Cell phones are the only product in the world whose retail price is less than the manufacturing cost, because phone companies are willing to subsidize the price to get you to sign on for a one-year contract. So they will buy a phone for, let's say, $150 and they'll offer it to you for $49.99, provided you sign a contract.
Q. Don't owners pay for air time on outgoing and incoming calls?
A. Yes, although the average cell-phone bill is under $50 a month. We are trying to get the industry to change, however. In some countries in South America the caller now pays for the air time, and they've found that as a result the use of air time has become much greater. In this country, people are afraid to give out their cell phone numbers, because they don't want too many calls.
Right now I think it would be even more advantageous to eliminate roaming fees, the fees they charge when you use your phone outside your home area. Instead of paying just 50 cents a minute, you pay 50 cents a minute plus an additional $1-a-minute roaming fee. This becomes very expensive, and it discourages a lot of people from using their phones. But many companies are working to eliminate it. I think roaming fees will be gone within the next few years.
Q. Are you involved with the telephones on airplanes?
A. No, we're not.
Q. How small will cell phones become?
A. Technically, you could have the old Dick Tracy wristwatch as a two-way radio right now. We have the technology. But realistically the size of cell phones are limited by two factors. The keys must be large enough so that you don't press two numbers at once, and the battery, which is the heaviest component of these phones, has to support a reasonable amount of talk time.
Our smallest model, the MVX-800, weighs 5.4 ounces and is 5 inches high, 1.7 inches wide and 0.90 inches deep. It used to be the smallest phone in the world. But Motorola has come out with a slightly smaller one. Basically, I think the cell phones we have now are about the smallest you'll see. They're light and they fit right in your pocket or purse. And they have sufficient talk time, which surveys have shown is very important to people. I don't really think they need to be any smaller.
Q. How do you feel about links between car phones and increased automobile accidents?
A. If you're going to grab the phone and take your eyes off the road, then, yes, they can be dangerous. But if you have a phone with a car kit that allows for hands-free usage, that's a different story. I use one all the time and I consider it very safe. It should be mounted high up, as close to the dashboard as possible, so you don't have to deflect your eyes from the road. If they are mounted and installed correctly, they're safe. But you have to use them properly.
Q. Where is the communications industry going?
A. There are some interesting new products being developed in car security. Car tracking is very exciting. When a car is stolen the owner can simply contact a monitoring center which will pick up a signal via satellite, indicating where the car is. This is just being introduced now. And it has other functions. If you lock your keys in the car, you can call the monitoring station and ask them to pop up the door locks. It's all done through satellite.

HEADLINE: Complex Calcutta

 BODY:

To the Editor: Kate Wheeler aptly points out that hiring a rickshaw in Calcutta enables the man pulling it to eat. But paying him five times what he asks -- rather than bargaining and paying the going rate -- inflates costs beyond the means, potentially, of many local people, devalues the efforts it normally takes to earn prevailing rates, and sets up Ms. Wheeler and her fellow Westerners to be seen as cash cows. It would be more constructive to give money to reputable local charities and to use services like rickshaws more frequently while paying the going rates. 
 In four months of traveling from Vietnam to Nepal, I found that the differences between communities that had been exposed to Western tourism and those that had not were profound. The loss of integrity, dignity and appreciation of cultural heritage seemed far more the results of Western tourists' poorly informed good intentions in handing out money than of crude or boorish behavior.
 
ANDREW KAUFMAN
New York, N.Y.
 
Ms. Wheeler responds: I appreciate the outline of the tricky issues that enter informal transactions; it's not always easy to know what to do. My policy is to learn what price local people pay, talk to other travelers and then allow for variations. I do give to charities, too, but visiting places of strong economic suffering, I try to give away 10 percent of what I spend on myself each day. Each transaction is an attempt at a genuine relationship. It is a drag to be seen as a cash cow, but there is often room for visitors to pay more than local people do. Some Indian vendors have multitiered prices: Japanese tourists pay most, Americans and other "Western" tourists less, and Indians least of all. But if a rickshaw driver asks five times the going rate, I'll refuse to pay it, if possible. We all make mistakes. Yet our terror of inflicting damage bears examining, too. Perhaps it disguises a wish to see exotic people preserved in a "purity" that's really just cheaper and more exciting for visitors.

HEADLINE: Asians Are Making an Impact on L.I. Life

BYLINE: By RAMIN P. JALESHGARI 

 BODY:
WHEN Indu Jaiswal moved to Nassau County 20 years ago, her traditional Indian clothing often got second looks. During the 1960's Shi Ming Hu, who came to teach at Stony Brook University in the 1960's, had to travel to New York's Chinatown for basic Asian foodstuffs. Ten years ago, in Great Neck, Henry Pak, a Korean physician, could not get brokers to show him houses in the more "exclusive" parts of town.
Backlash against Asians had deep roots. In the early part of this century the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service placed stringent entry quotas on the amount of Asian immigrants allowed into the country. Those that did get in were denied naturalization and the right to own property. Americans who married Asian nationals lost their own citizenship. 
 Today, women in saris on the Island rarely raise an eyebrow, and Asian foods have become regular fare, gaining their own aisle in supermarkets. And, Asian home buyers have little problem finding houses in the neighborhoods of their choice.
Once unwelcome, those from the Far East are the fastest growing immigrant group in America. Long Island is high on the list of preferred residences, ccounting more than 50,000 people in the 1990 Census. A Census Department study also noted an almost 5 percent rise between 1990 and 1994. The projected rise through the year 2000 is 15 percent, with a steady increase of 15 to 18 percent through 2025.
Next to the Hispanic population, Asians are the quickest growing minority group in the country. The bulk of Asian immigrants to the Eastern seaboard arrived in the late 1960's, often settling in enclaves in Flushing, Queens, which changed from predominantly Eastern European to Korean and Indian.
The 1980's became a time for relocation, and many Asians began to look forward to "the better life" on Long Island.
"Asians have been, in many ways, very different kinds of immigrants," said S. N. Sridhar, a linguistics professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, whose efforts to start an India Studies Center at the school came to fruition this year. "Asians tend to come to America with specific job skills, or, once they arrive, voraciously seek out higher educational training. This affords them entry to well-paying, professional employment and they tend to move into areas of economic influence fairly quickly."
Census statistics prove this. A 1994 study indicates that educational attainment for Asians tends to be twice as high as that of Americans of other racial heritage. Consequently, the median income for Asian American families tends to be around 10 percent higher than that of white families, averaging near $45,000 annually in 1993.
The number of businesses owned by Asian-Americans increased 56 percent nationwide from 1987-1992 with revenues of hundreds of millions of dollars. Doing business with Asian entrepreneurs is high on the agenda for Marine Midland bank, whose Asian Business Unit, with permanently placed agents dedicated to cultivating the Long Island area, specializes in business loans to Asian-run establishments.
"A growing number of our Asian clientele is coming from Long Island," said Peter Boland, senior vice president in charge of trade finance at Marine Midland Bank. "We see Asian-American businesses as a dynamic ever-increasing group." The bank has paid careful attention to those business owners doing international trade with "home" countries in the East -- most notably India.
"India is the world's fifth largest economy -- it is increasingly an economic force to be recognized," said Ram Khanna, who heads Marine's Asian Business Unit. "American and Long Island business people need to tap into this fertile market by learning more about it -- one way to do that is to examine the Asian community all around them."
Marine's efforts to recognize the Asian society as a plentiful business resource have included providing personal finance seminars in Great Neck to Asian-American professionals like doctors and lawyers, and being host to cultural events as well.
In 1996 the bank was host of a festival in Manhattan in honor of the Hindu holiday Diwali, with an eye on a Long Island location for this year's celebration, in October. It was private donations from Long Islanders of Indian heritage, amounting to more than $100,000 that enabled the establishment of the state university's India Studies Center. And, over the last 20 years the Korean community has donated more than $700,000 for the school's Korean Studies program.
Also intended for Stony Brook University: an Asian-American Cultural Center, to be built through a $25 million donation by Charles Wang, whose Islandia-based company, Computer Associates International Inc., a global software giant, is one of the largest local employers.
Remembering his first days in the states when his family was denied home ownership in Queens because of their Chinese ancestry, Mr. Wang asserted his hope that "the Asian-American Cultural Center will serve as a catalyst for a host of cultural, academic, business and technology initiatives."
The mark made by Long Islanders of Asian heritage is apparent in ways outside the business forum as well. In Hicksville, the small hardware stores, butcher shop and dress makers lining Main Street (Route 107) are now East Indian grocers, sari palaces and Hindi language video emporiums. In Huntington, Oriental grocers cater to a wide variety of Asian and non-Asian clientele. "There was a time when we were practically the only Asian market on Long Island -- it was either us, or, travel into Queens," said Rajesh and Gita, owners of Modern Bazaar, an Indian food market in Hicksville. "Now, there are so many, we're really feeling the competition -- but the population is there to support it."
Restaurants are another indicator. While Chinese restaurants have long been popular on the Island, Japanese sushi bars, Thai and Indian eateries are becoming ubiquitous along the main roads of Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
"As little as five years ago," said Chani Singh, co-owner of the Curry Club, an Indian restaurant in Setauket, "I would never have dreamed that an Indian restaurant would do well in Suffolk County, especially the farther away you got from the city."
Opening last December to crowds of 250 people per night, the Curry Club expanded and also opened a Southold location. "Most of our clients are actually not Asian," Mr. Singh said. "They're American. Americans have become very familiar and comfortable with Indian culture and cuisine."
In other mainstream venues, Asian-Americans are making a mark as well. Jennifer Choi, a physician certified in physical medicine and rehabilitation, has built a practice based on acupuncture techniques. With offices in Huntington and Smithtown, the Korean-born physician noted that s the ancient Chinese art had become an acceptable method of treatment in traditional medical arenas.
"Ninety-eight percent of my patients are non-Asian and we see up to 60 patients a day -- some from as far away as the Hamptons," said Dr. Choi.
Officials in Suffolk and Nassau County have also been instrumental in addressing the concerns of Asians in their districts, and promoting Asian cultural programs. A concert series sponsored by Nassau County in Eisenhower Park included an Indian-American night in July and Korean and Chinese American nights in August.
Dr. William Keh, director of the Chinese Cultural Association in Great Neck, said, "Our local politicians, County Executive Tom Gulotta and Congressman Gary Ackerman have been very receptive to our community voice -- they really participate in organizing activities that include us."
Indu Jaiswal, president of the Indian Association of Long Island, agrees, noting that support in county government has made annual events like an India Day parade and yearly Diwali festivals in Long Beach possible. Despite the niche Asian-Americans have made for themselves on Long Island, and their increasing influence in various aspects of the area's daily life, being an Asian-American Long Islander is not always easy.
"Asians-Americans have always tried to hold on to their cultural heritage-in terms of rituals, religion, and language," said Kamal Sridhar, director of the English as a Second Language program at Stony Brook and co-founder of the India Center there. "This can be particularly hard on second-generation Asian-Americans who want to remain loyal to their families and culture but don't want to be different from their friends and classmates."
Shalin Bhatt, an 18-year-old college student from Hicksville, primarily speaks the Indian language Gujrati at home. He has observed the difficulty this sometimes presents to school-age youngsters in his family.
"My cousin entered school with a low attention span -- because English wasn't his primary language," he said, "The school didn't realize he came from a bilingual home and what the implications of that were, so they wanted to put him in a special education class.It took some time, but he eventually adapted and his teachers realized he was very bright -- that his whole problem had been the language."
Eriko Sato Zhu, a Japanese-born adjunct professor at Stony Brook, noted that "many Japanese who live here are very lonely and feel they don't fit in" with the mainstream culture.
"Friends from other Asian countries tell me they feel the same way. When they're outside their ethnic enclave they are disoriented and unhappy and many long to return to native lands." Ms. Zhu also said that while there may be more Asians on Long Island, they tend to live in tight-knit communities -- near colleges for example.
Valley Stream, for example, is home to a large number of Korean and Pakistani families. And, while many Asian-American students live directly at/or around Stony Brook University, the number of Asian families making their permanent home in the Three Village area surrounding the school are few.
Asian culture groups attempt to alleviate some of the problems that Asian-American Long Islanders face. Dr. Keh's organization sponsors five Chinese language schools in Nassau County -- mainly for the benefit of second-generation Chinese Americans. The group has also started a series of cultural awareness programs at New York Institute of Technology in Old Westbury, including this year's Long Island Chinese Festival. The India Association of Long Island, helps raise funds for the American Heart Association, North Shore University Hospital, and other local charities.
"In this way," said Mrs. Jaiswal, "we can become part of the community -- by showing the non-Indian, non-Asian population that we too are serious and dedicated to the area we live in."
For Drs. S. N. and Kamal Sridhar, efforts like these make the future of Asians on Long Island seem very hopeful. Standing proudly in the backyard of his Stony Brook home, by the 4-foot Japanese maple planted to commemorate the first talks of the India Studies Center that has now become a reality, Dr. Sridhar said, "That tree was a tiny thing when it was put here -- like the trickle of Asians to Long Island just 15 years ago.That tree has grown by leaps and bounds, and today, like the Asian community, it is firmly rooted in the Long Island landscape."

WOMEN ARTISTS
 
 An opening reception for "Between the Wars: Women Artists of the Whitney Studio Club and Museum" is scheduled on Thursday from 6 to 7:30 P.M. at the Whitney Museum of American Art in Stamford. The public is invited free of charge.
More than 100 prints and drawings by 35 artists, produced in the 1920's and 30's and drawn from the permanent collection of the Whitney in Manhattan, will be on view. Among them are Isabel Bishop's "Noon Hour," Marguerite Zorach's "Woman and Cat," Mabel Dwight's "Harlem Rent Party," and Peggy Bacon's "The Social Graces."
The collection was begun by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney in 1918, when she established the Whitney Studio Club to support women artists. Because there were so few opportunities for them to show their work in museums and galleries, she mounted exhibitions for them and bought many of their works. Many of the paintings and drawings became part of the permanent collection when she established the Whitney Museum in New York in 1930.
The exhibition will remain through Nov. 12. The museum's Connecticut branch is at the corner of Atlantic Street and Tresser Boulevard and is open Tuesday through Saturday from 11 to 5. Free illustrated brochures are available and free gallery talks are given on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays at 12:30. The number for more information is (203) 358-7652.

WORDS AND MUSIC
Calliope's Chamber is the name of the duo of Lois Swann, novelist, and Joyce Balint, string instrumentalist. They will combine their talents in a performance called "Masks," to be presented next Saturday at 5 P.M. in the Ridgefield Library, 472 Main Street.
Ms. Swann, will read from "Sippicon," the third book in a trilogy that she has written, set in 18th century Venice. After each reading Ms. Balint will illuminate the text with arias by Vivaldi, Corelli and Veracini, performed on the mandolin and violin.
Ms. Swann's books are published by Scribner's and include "Torn Covenants," 1981. Boston University has a collection of her work in its archives.
Ms. Balint is the mandolin soloist with the Metropolitan Opera Company Orchestra, and half of the Balint Duo with her husband Sandor Balint, a violinist with the Metropolitan orchestra. Admission is free.

FILMS BY SAYLES
The work of an independent filmmaker, John Sayles. will be screened from Monday through Friday at the Stratford Library, 2203 Main St., daily at 1 P.M. Recommended for mature audiences, the films will be shown free of charge and viewers may bring bag lunches.
Monday's offering will be "The Return of the Secaucus Seven" (1980), about a reunion of radical 60's college friends. "City of Hope" (1991) is on Wednesday's bill, (there is no film on Tuesday) with Angela Basset, Vincent Spano, Tony Lo Bianco and Joe Morton as urban denizens, and Sayles in a small role.
"Passion Fish" (1992), a comedy about a paralyzed soap opera queen and her domineering nurse, is Thursday's film, and "Lone Star" (1996), a drama of prejudice and corruption in a Texas town will be shown on Friday. The number for more information is (203) 385-4162.

PHOTOS BY SPENDER
The Yale Center for British Art in New Haven is the first museum in the United States to mount an exhibition of Humphrey Spender's photography. It opens tomorrow through Nov. 9 and is titled "Humphrey Spender's Humanist Landscapes: Photo-documents, 1932-1942."
Like his brother, the poet and author Stephen Spender, Humphrey recorded the sociology of depression-era and wartime Britain in the context of his art. More than 70 of his images of poverty and unemployment in England's industrial cities, and shots of people in pubs, parks, markets, factories, offices and locker rooms, testify to what he calls his "obsession that the truth would be revealed only when people were not aware of being photographed."
The exhibit is supplemented with copies of the magazines in which his narrative photos appeared, and drawings, prints and paintings by artists who were his contemporaries.
A conversation with Mr. Spender will take place on Wednesday, and a symposium on changes in the role of documentary photography is planned on Saturday. Other events related to the exhibition are a film series, exploring the British documentary movement of the 30's and 40's; dramatic readings by Yale School of Drama students; gallery talks and a children's photography program.
The center is at 1080 Chapel Street and viewing hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 10 to 5, Sunday from noon to 5. Admission is free. For more information and a schedule of events the number is (203) 432-2800. The center's web site is http://www.yale/edu/ycba.

SCHWEITZER FESTIVAL
"Words of Albert Schweitzer and the Music of Bach" by Thurston Moore, produced by Tennessee Players, Inc., will be presented free of charge this evening at 7:30 at the First Church of Christ, 250 Main Street in Wethersfield.
The program inaugurates what is scheduled to be an annual Albert Schweitzer Organ Festival that next year will begin once-a-year competitions for young organ students. Winners will receive awards to help pay for their musical education.
Today's program consists of a 90-minute slide presentation with organ music and three narrators of Schweitzer's writings: Dr. Gilbert Bond of the Yale School of Theology; Joanne Nesti, Channel 30 news anchor, and Donald Morgan, First Church minister emeritus.
Bach's music will be performed by several noted organists, including Ronald Ebrecht, Christa Rakich, and John Rose. David Spicer, minister of music at the church, will direct the choir in "He Comes to Us" by Jane Marshall, with text from Schweitzer's book, "The Quest of the Historical Jesus." On display from the Schweitzer archives is the small reed organ that he used in Africa. The number for more information (860) 563-7759.

HINDU FESTIVAL
Navarati, the Hindu festival in honor of the goddess Durga, will be celebrated for the 21st year at Wesleyan University in Middletown. It will begin on Thursday at 5:30 with a procession from the Connecticut Valley Hindu Temple Society at 11 Training Hill Road and will end at Crowell Concert Hall on the campus.
At 7 P.M. the first event in the festival, which continues until Sept. 20, will be a concert by the Krishnamurthi Nagaswaram Ensemble at the Center for the Arts on High Street. The nagaswaram is a double-reed oboe used in temple ceremonies and weddings, thought to be an instrument of good luck. Admission will be free.
Five concerts of Indian music and dance will begin on Friday at 8 P.M. in Crowell Concert Hall, when Birju Maharaj will present a program of North Indian classical dance. On Saturday at 8 P.M. T. Viswanathan, adjunct professor music at Wesleyan, will play South Indian flute music, accompanied by violin, percussion and a vocalist.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS;
When One Good Turn Deserves Another

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY; Brett Pulley reports from Trenton for The New York Times.

DATELINE: EAST ORANGE

 BODY:
It's not exactly 40 acres and a mule, but black Democrats in the state have just received their recompense for the extraordinary work they did last year in gathering votes for President Clinton and Senator Robert G. Torricelli.
The big pay back came last week when Mr. Clinton took a moment from his vacation on Martha's Vineyard to issue a statement saying he would nominate Cardell Cooper, the second-term Mayor of East Orange, to become an assistant administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency -- a high-ranking post that will require confirmation by the Senate. 
Now, to be sure, it is unfair to Mr. Cooper, a man of esteemed background and qualifications -- as well as political agility -- to suggest that he has been selected for such a lofty post simply as a matter of political indebtedness. Nevertheless, although he heads a city of 80,000 people, Mr. Cooper has not had a lot of direct experience with environmental issues, and the two people who most recently held the same E.P.A. post had extensive prior experience within the agency.
However, Mr. Clinton's environmental appointments and initiatives have typically been thoughtful and well-received by environmentalists, and apparently the President must feel confident that Mr. Cooper is aptly suited to head the agency's solid-waste and emergency-response offices, which oversee the cleanup of Superfund hazardous waste sites and the reclaiming and redevelopment of urban industrial tracts known as brownfields.
In its release to the news media, the White House cited Mr. Cooper's residential waste-recycling program and improvements to the city's drinking water as examples of his qualifications. The Environmental Protection Agency's top administrator, Carol M. Browner, said that Mr. Cooper's "years of leadership in protecting public health in real communities will serve this agency and the nation well."
But despite all those well-prepared statements, what clearly made the biggest impression on Mr. Clinton is the job the Mayor did last fall as chairman of the Clinton-Gore coordinated campaign in New Jersey. Leading the effort that combined the Presidential campaign with local races, Mr. Cooper received much of the credit for the overwhelming plurality received by the Clinton-Gore team in New Jersey, and the strong urban turnout that helped elect Mr. Torricelli to his first term in the Senate.
As a result, Mr. Torricelli, and the state's senior Senator, Frank R. Lautenberg, have been pushing for the past eight months to get the President to nominate Mr. Cooper to a top administration post, and for many weeks there was much speculation about which agency it would be. Mr. Clinton may not want environmentalists to think that he would play politics with such an important job, but in reality, that is often the way of the world.
Mr. Torricelli, after all, earlier this year cited his own efforts to get a White House nomination for Mr. Cooper as an example of what he has done in acknowledgment of the strong support he received from black voters. Under fire from activists who charged that he had not hired enough blacks to work in his Senate office, Mr. Torricelli pointed to the impending Cooper nomination as proof that he had not forgotten who buttered his bread last November.
Even though politics did indeed play a big part in the selection, there is no reason for Mr. Cooper to do anything but hold his head high over this appointment, one of the most important ones that the Clinton administration has bestowed upon a New Jersey resident.
During an interview in his office after the announcement, Mr. Cooper said he was certain he would "meet the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead." And for the 45-year-old mayor, the ticket to Washington comes just in time. After seeing his support wane in the city, Mr. Cooper decided not to seek re-election this year, and his $73,000-a-year mayoral job was thus ending on Dec. 31.
His nomination to the E.P.A. job, which pays $115,700, is not expected to receive much resistance in the Senate. Mr. Lautenberg, the ranking Democratic on the Environment and Public Works Committee, has said that he will personally shepherd the nomination through the committee.
Mr. Cooper, whose previous jobs have included Essex County Administrator, business administrator for the city of Irvington, and director of the East Orange Department of Human Services, was wistful when asked how he felt about leaving City Hall. "It's a reflective moment," he said, as he recalled how his two young daughters "came into the office to visit for special events and ran up and down the hallways."
It is not easy to keep everyone happy in a struggling patronage-hungry city, and Mr. Cooper acknowledged that there had been difficult times. "I have no regrets about the ups and downs of public life," he said. "That's the reality of the job." But, he added, "I will always be the city's son." Ever mindful not to forget whence he has come, Mr. Cooper said he wants his new job to "bode well for the citizens of New Jersey." He didn't offer any specifics, but for all others, perhaps there is hope that more rewards are on the way.

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: PARAMUS

 BODY:
CRYSTAL SCHIFFER was clad entirely in black except for the words on her T-shirt: Constantly Miserable. Jonathan Miller had shaggy hair, a tie-dyed shirt and shoelaces shockingly pink. Sitting on a curb outside Garden State Plaza last week, the couple enthusiastically explained why their high school classmates referred to them as freaks.
"Everyone else can walk through the hallways and nobody notices them," said Jonathan, a skinny 17-year-old who started his senior year at Lakeland Regional High School in Wanaque last week. "We come in wearing combat boots or black lipstick, whatever, and everyone is staring, nobody can believe it. We stand out. That's our point." 
 Whether they want to bare their souls or exude mystery, draw a crowd or blend into one, teen-agers define themselves by the clothes they wear. While there is some risk involved -- like the time Jonathan wore flowered pants to school and some jocks threatened to kill him -- it is safer, in the four-year drama that is high school, to make a statement through clothes than through words or deeds.
It is also easier, in an era when retailers are bombarding the teen-age population with mail-order catalogs, television advertisements and layouts in fashion magazines. Fashion trends set by movie stars and musicians spread faster than ever these days, in music videos and movies, on tabloid television shows and computer screens. And teen-agers, the most eager and impressionable consumers, take it all quite seriously.
"They are trying to identify themselves and tell people who they are," said Ruth Rubenstein, a professor of sociology at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. "So, yes, it makes sense that they are the ones most likely to buy. The marketers know that and they've gotten very clever in their merchandis ing. Marketing toward teens is stronger than ever before."
That means the choices are more dizzying than ever, which is why several teen-agers interviewed said that picking out clothes was more stressful than fun. Dozens of stores sell black T-shirts, for example, but only a few brands are considered universally cool. Baggy jeans are the rage, but the boy who wears them four times bigger than his size instead of three can expect to be heckled. It is enough to make Ricky Jones, who is switching from parochial to public school in Jersey City this fall, dread life without a uniform.
"Kids these days get judged on what they wear, no doubt," said Ricky, 15, who was shopping at Newport Centre Mall last Tuesday. "I would rather stick to a uniform because it's less pressure."
But even though some public schools have adopted dress codes in the hope of turning students' attention away from clothes, most still allow anything that is not too short or tight or full of holes. With so many options, most teen-agers gravitate toward styles that make them feel distinctive, but still part of a group, said Maurice Elias, a professor of psychology at Rutgers University.
"Their way of being different is not unique in the true meaning of the word," said Professor Elias, who specializes in adolescent psychology. "They might want to be significantly different from the mainstream, but it's the unusual kid who wants to be totally out there on their own."
Instead, as students return to the high schools of New Jersey this month, they are also returning to niches defined by boot-cut jeans (preferably faded) and flannel shirts (plaid only), track pants (Adidas, please) and clunky black shoes (Doc Martens, even though they make your feet look huge). There are preppys and jocks, hippies and homeys, ravers, skaters, and freaks.
While a teen-ager's look is partly a product of where he lives and how wealthy he is, some things -- beepers, boots and extra-large T-shirts, for example -- are coveted by everyone, everywhere. And increasingly, fashion statements are cutting across geographic and economic borders.
As difficult as they are to explain, clothing styles are a pet topic among high school students, who can discuss the subtleties of teen fashion with the authority of connoisseurs. Questioned about their wardrobes, teen-agers shopping at malls around the state last week expounded at length. Some even waxed philosophical.
"It's all about being yourself," said Seta Papazian, 16, a senior at Paramus Catholic High School who wears rings in her nose and lip, a tongue stud and a leather jacket with faux-fur insets. "Clothes are your creativity being manifested onto a physical plane."
 
The Hip-Hop Look: Big, Bold, Booted
 To understand why Randy Tiller dresses the way he does -- baggy black jeans with the waistline creeping toward his knees and a black baseball cap snug on his head -- look no further than the music videos of Wu-Tang Clan. The Wu, as Randy calls them, are the most popular rap group in the country, and probably the most commercial. Their CD's come with advertisements for their clothing line, known as Wu-Wear. And the hip-hop boys of Jersey City do not miss a detail.
"Whatever the Wu wear, I wear," said Randy, 17, a senior at Snyder High School. "See how big these jeans are? Even though nobody else is going to wear them, we will because the Wu started us off."
Sitting near the glass elevator at Newport Centre, Randy and three of his friends ticked off the staples of hip-hop fashion, which they said was dictated by rap stars and spread through videos, magazines and song lyrics. Sturdy hiking boots by Timberland, Mountain Gear or Lugz, embraced by rap stars and young inner-city dwellers since the early 1990's, topped their list.
"They last long, we like the quality and they're rugged," said Charles Townsend, 17, who was drowning in a navy T-shirt and baggy Nautica jeans, with tan suede boots by Lugz. "In cities you need rugged."
Both Charles and Randy said they spent more than $1,000 of their parents' money on clothes each year, and when Ricky said he spent $300, they howled. "He's lying, he's lying!" Randy said. "Got to spend almost that much on a pair of boots!"
Oversized rugby shirts like the one Amin Norris was wearing -- by Rigo Sport, with navy, gold and white stripes -- are essential to urban hip-hoppers. The most popular rugby shirts are made by Tommy Hilfiger, an upscale company whose logo was spotted on at least a dozen chests at Newport Centre last week.
"Tommy Hilfiger takes out of the African-American tradition with bold colors, but the cut of the clothes is preppy, which also appeals," said Professor Rubenstein of the Fashion Institute of Technology. "The whole look is bold, and it's very clever merchandising. What boy doesn't want to look bold?"
Randy Jones does, but he said that on the streets of Jersey City, bright shades are being replaced with black, the only color worn by members of Wu-Tang Clan.
Another trick is wearing sweatpants with one leg rolled up to the knee, a look Randy said was invented by drug dealers who stowed cash or marijuana in the rolled pant leg. "That's the hustling thing," he said. "But now people do it who don't even know what it means. They do it so people think they're hard."
Unlike preppys, freaks and hippies, who want their clothes to appear well-worn, hip-hoppers appreciate the fresh-off-the-shelf look. Charles frowned at his new-looking jeans, pronouncing them too faded.
"You've got to look presentable," he said, adding that he planned to wear khaki pants and a button-down shirt on his first day as a senior at Ferris High School. Randy agreed, saying that the handful of skaters, freaks and ravers were the subject of contempt.
"Some kid comes in with a disco shirt with crazy designs, all polyester, it's like he enjoys being cracked on," Randy said. "Those ones that dye their hair, chains hanging off their clothes, they cut holes in their pants like a fool, they know that's not presentable."
He added, "Those kids always transfer out."
 
Making a Statement By Understatement
 Dainty wool sweaters in navy and gray. White tennis shoes, moderately scuffed. Khakis, faded Levi's and Adidas track pants with neat stripes down the sides. If these staples of Lisa Puorro's wardrobe sound simple, that is precisely the point.
She is a preppy, after all, and preppy garb is the very definition of understated.
"I haven't worn bright colors probably since grammar school," Lisa, who lives in New Providence, said last Tuesday, sitting on a bench outside the Mall at Short Hills with seven shopping bags from Bloomingdale's, Armani, J.Crew and Banana Republic at her feet. "I think they're ugly."
Instead, Lisa, 16, and other preppy teen-agers stick to basics: beige, dusty pink, darkest green and lots of black. Anything patterned is too busy, too trendy. Preppies blend effortlessly into crowds with their muted colors and classic designs, and while some would accuse them of being too conventional, they say their style is the most natural one around.
"We don't map out every single thing we wear to school and obsess about how it's going to look," said a 16-year-old girl who would identify herself only as Rachel, saying she did not want to be retaliated against by more flamboyant dressers. "We don't give into lame trends and we don't dress outrageous just to freak people out."
Their detractors say that preppies are the least creative dressers, buying clothes for the designer labels and wearing subtle styles because they are afraid to stand out.
"They buy all this expensive, boring crap and you hear them at the food court," said Seta Papazian, the leather-jacketed Paramus Catholic student, who raised her voice half an octave to do an imitation. "They're like, 'Oh my God, can I use your cell phone for minute because I have to call Steve and tell him I got that Gucci dress'."
The teen-agers picking through merchandise at three of the preppiest stores at Short Hills -- J. Crew, the Gap and Banana Republic -- appeared to be taking some fashion risks. Tank tops were the most popular attire among girls, but bra straps -- all the rage in nightclubs and on catwalks this summer -- were prominently displayed. One wore combat boots beneath a flowing, flowered skirt.
But Lisa Puorro, who held up a demure, newly purchased gray cardigan from Armani before riding off in her mother's black Jeep, said the chicest clothes were the simplest ones. She does not even mind wearing a uniform -- wool skirt, white oxford shirt, navy sweater -- at Mount St. Mary Academy in Watchung, where she will be a junior. "It's a lot easier," she said, "when everyone looks the same."
 
Looking Freaky, And Proud of It
 Once a year, on the day school photographs are taken, Kerri Tamburro abandons her lace-trimmed slip skirts, steel-toed boots and studded leather bracelets for plain old pants and a sweater. There is a perfectly good explanation.
"My grandfather pays me $20 to $40 to look normal for the picture," said Kerri, a sophomore at Ridgefield Memorial High School who bears a slight resemblance to the grunge rock star Courtney Love and likes to point it out. "He hates what I wear with a passion, but what's he going to do, lock me out?"
It has not come to that, not yet, but Kerri and her friends, all self-described freaks, said family members, classmates and strangers criticized their clothes, hair and makeup at least once a day. They claimed not to mind the attention, which they said only confirmed that they were the most creative, nonconformist teen-agers in town. Jonathan Miller, the shaggy-haired Lakeland Regional student, said he dressed outrageously just to provoke his peers.
"Sometimes I wear black lipstick," said Jonathan, who lives in Ringwood and describes himself as "a freak by nature but a hippie at heart." "First I did it because it was fun, and then I realized how much it bothered people, how much they wanted to beat me up just for that. "
Jonathan's girlfriend, Crystal Schiffer of Wanaque, said she got a similar reaction after she painted "666" on her forehead for a Marilyn Manson concert at Giant Stadium. She got sunburned and the numbers were branded on her forehead for days.
"People stayed away," she said. "I didn't care. You become an impenetrable fortress of your own oddness."
But the attention is at least occasionally ego-bruising. Although dozens of teen-agers were loitering outside Garden State Plaza one recent afternoon, Crystal and Jonathan were the first to be reprimanded by security guards. And Seta Papazian, who wears punk attire wherever she goes, said she could not enjoy a recent visit to the Jersey Shore.
"I got called a Nazi and a satanist," said Seta, who was wearing black stockings she had shredded with a razor blade and an impossibly short plaid skirt held together with safety pins. "It's like, you small-minded idiots. My real friends are the ones who are going to get to know me before labeling me. You don't judge a person by their clothes."
But if that is true, why was Jonathan planning to wear a shredded Marilyn Manson T-shirt, black cutoffs, black combat boots and black lipstick on the first day of class? Did he really want his classmates to ignore his appearance?
"No way," he said, closing his eyes as if to imagine his arrival at school, a sea of conventionally dressed students parting to let him through. "I've got a whole new generation of freshmen I have to scare."

HEADLINE: In Russia, Dreams on Wheels

BYLINE: By MARINA LAKHMAN 

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH the third annual Moscow auto show lasted only a week, Kostya Bagaturov can forever treasure the images of the Mercedes-Benzes, Audis and BMW's on display: While many Russian car lovers spent hours making themselves comfortable behind the wheels of Volgas, Volvos and Volkswagens, Mr. Bagaturov was caressing the streamlined bodies with the lens of his camcorder, insuring that he could view over and over the finest offerings of the world's automobile industry.
"If I could, I would buy this one," said Mr. Bagaturov, a 19-year-old student, focusing on a BMW Z3 M roadster as it gently took its turns on a rotating platform with crowds watching its every move. "But in the meantime I will just look." 
 Like Mr. Bagaturov, many Russians love cars -- perhaps more than Americans do -- and their affection was on full display at the show, called Autosalon '97, that ended here last Sunday.
The fascination is generally seen as a product of long-repressed desires set free in a capitalist economy. And though many imported luxury cars have appeared in Russia since the fall of Communism, owning one remains a dream for most Russians. Still, the ability to chase such a goal has become as essential as life and liberty, and is often equated with the pursuit of happiness.
At a time when senior citizens receive a monthly pension of less than 300,000 rubles (about $52) some 420,000 adults from across Russia lined up to pay $7 each to enter the Autosalon. Like those who attend auto shows in the West, only a fraction were buying a car; most were just basking in the excitement reflected off gleaming fenders.
Near the displays of German cars, the gold standard in Russia as in most of the world, the cellular phones were abuzz. Well-dressed men adorned with gold chains and flashy rings ogled the Mercedes-Benzes, BMW's and Audis. Teen-agers stood in line to sit in cars they hope to afford someday.
"First and foremost, a car is for pleasure," said Igor Kolesnikov, 34, getting out of the driver's seat of a shiny Audi. "And secondly, it is useful for getting around."
Mr. Kolesnikov is an admirer of Audis who drives a 1991 model. "When I see a car like this I find it hard not to get in," he said.
Cars offer more than just pleasure for Russians who can afford the best. Particularly in the sometimes shady world of what is broadly called "business," a fine car serves as a symbol of acceptance into an elite club -- like being a Communist Party member in Soviet days. Some go so far as to sell their apartments and live in rented rooms so that they can buy a BMW.
The tally of officially sold imported cars does not begin to match the actual number on the streets. While Moscow is commonly said to be home to more Mercedes-Benzes than any other city in the world, there were only 724 official sales of Mercedes cars in Russia in 1996. Many of the cars cruising the increasingly crowded streets are bought used in Europe and brought here illegally, circumventing import duties that can approach 100 percent of the price.
But a foreign car -- particularly a new one -- has a special allure. Sergei Smirnov, an investment banker from Omsk who traveled 1,500 miles to the auto show, was checking out the Langanza, the latest luxury model from Daewoo, the South Korean car maker. He took a seat at the wheel at the invitation of the long-legged model standing guard over the glistening chrome.
"I like it because it looks like a Lexus," said Mr. Smirnov, 30, examining every curve of both the car and its protector. He said he had been driving a Daewoo Espero for two years and was ready for a change. He said the Langanza, at $25,000 to $28,000, would serve well until he could move up to something better.
Glancing at the splashy Avtovaz display, where blinking lights washed over new Ladas, and at the Gaz display, where a Volga 3110 was perched slanting downward over passers-by, he said he would not even look at Russian autos. "I can allow myself a better-quality car," he said. "I want air-conditioning and a good suspension."
Though the 3110 is said to be new, the angular front-wheel-drive Volga has not changed much since it served Communist functionaries. It is somewhat more aerodynamic, and while comfortable, it continues to be plagued with mechanical problems.
Indeed, Russians are turning to foreign cars for reliability as well as status. Last year, when Avtovaz came out with a new compact, the Vaz 2110, it had an average of 92 defects per vehicle. The Moscow Times has reported that of the 700 Volgas bought each year for the President's staff, 200 break down immediately and 300 need repairs within weeks.
To compete better with foreign companies in a market where sales may reach 3.5 to 4 million annually by the end of the century, Russian auto makers are beefing up their cars with many extras. But the souped-up versions often cost just as much as imports -- making it harder for Russians to justify buying a shoddy domestic model.
And some foreign companies are now building vehicles in Russia, including General Motors, which is making Chevrolet Blazers in Tatarstan and plans to make Opels in a joint venture with Avtovaz.
Patriotism may influence some Americans to buy American-made cars, but it has no such hold over most Russians. If they drive Russian-made cars, it is because they are cheaper to buy, cheaper to fix and can handle pervasively rough roads.
The bad roads are at least partly responsible for the popularity of sport utility vehicles, including the Blazer, Toyota Land Cruiser, Jeep Cherokee and Ford Expedition. And this is one category in which Russian manufacturers are keeping up. The Niva, reminiscent of a hardtop Jeep Wrangler, is popular at a price of $8,000.
Yet competition has taken its toll on the 11 Russian vehicle manufacturers, whose production has plunged by half in recent years, to about a million cars a year, though output did rise 13 percent in the first seven months of this year over the period a year earlier. Factories are antiquated and inefficient, taking up to 30 times as long to produce a car as the Japanese require. The overstaffed auto makers cannot afford the investments needed to develop new power trains and modern designs, and some are becoming the public charities of politicians.
At the auto show, Russians closely examined Avtovaz's latest models: the Lada 10; the Bohemia convertible with a modern 16-valve, four-cylinder engine, and the Consul mini-limousine, which comes with a television, stereo, wood-trim interior panels, folding tables, leather upholstery and a price of $30,000 to $35,000. But there were few takers.
The show was also a second birth for the struggling Moskvitch, which has a dreary reputation for being unreliable. Spinning on a platform, a blunt-looking new model, the Knyaz Vladimir, seemed to get the same reaction as the bearded lady at the circus. After a quick look, Roman Babikov, a 28-year-old grocery store manager, shook his head and said, "It's a car of a previous decade."
But one aspect of Russian life makes the ownership of a Russian car attractive: the roads. Poorly paved and pocked with potholes from severe winters, the roads are so bad they have become the subject of poetry and proverbs. And while foreign cars are prestigious, many Russians admit that the roads are best handled by sturdy Russian frames. Thus, Moskvich is installing Renault engines in its newest models, and Tekhnoservis, a company in Nizhny Novgorod, is retrofitting Volga cars with reliable Rover, Ford and Toyota engines. At the auto show, the sight of a powerful Rover V8 inside a black Volga body made Tekhnoservis's display a popular attraction.
While noting that the Volga's native engine is unsophisticated, inefficient and polluting, Mikhail Smirnov of Tekhnoservis praised its body. "For our Russian roads, our exterior is the best," he said. "If you have an accident it's still 10 times cheaper to fix a Volga than a Ford."

Someone Is Always Coming to The Rescue

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Even as they congratulated themselves on engineering the bailout of Mexico after the peso crisis a few years back, officials at the Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund fretted about one clear shortcoming of the plan.
By allocating huge sums of money to keep Mexico afloat and avert turmoil in global financial markets, the bailout effectively rescued investors who had made imprudent bets on Mexican Government securities. As a result, the markets were left with the impression that there was a safety net for such inherently risky investments, a belief that would only encourage further reckless capital flows, especially to emerging markets, and contribute to future financial crises. Not to mention that it looked as much like a bailout of the wealthy on Wall Street as of the poor in Chihuahua. 
 So when they faced Thailand's financial crisis this summer, policy makers, especially at the I.M.F., were eager to avoid the same mistake. But again, it seems like many of those who made the biggest gambles on a troubled emerging market economy -- in this case foreign institutions that lent heavily in dollars to Thai banks -- are largely going to be taken off the hook.
Despite continuing protests from I.M.F. officials, who still hold out hopes of a compromise, the Thai Government seems intent on insulating the owners of banks and other lenders from huge losses -- protecting their foreign creditors in the process -- even if it means raising taxes on its own population and putting the country through a deeper recession than might be necessary.
Economists call the problem moral hazard, and it was a big topic last weekend at the annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., for central bankers, government officials and economists from around the world.
"If the owners or managers of private financial institutions were to anticipate being propped up frequently by government support, it would only encourage reckless and irresponsible practices," said Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Undoubtedly Mr. Greenspan had in mind not only Mexico and Thailand, but also the savings and loan crisis in the United States. In that case, deregulation granted owners of the institutions license to gamble with depositors' money, knowing that failure would be almost completely covered by deposit insurance. Untold billions later, the savings and loan mess is still not fully resolved.
As experience suggests, it is difficult for any nation to summon the political will to anoint losers, especially when, as is usually the case when huge sums of money are on the line, those with the most at stake are politically powerful. Indeed, the entire business and investment culture these days, at home and abroad, often seems pervaded by a sense that risk and the penalties of failure, to the degree that they are recognized at all, should be ameliorated.
As the stock market in the United States feints alternately heavenward and earthward, it is worth asking whether individual investors are fully conscious of their exposure to loss. It was hard not to hear in one of Mr. Greenspan's trademark aphorisms at Jackson Hole another quiet warning.
"Risk-taking is indeed a necessary condition for the creation of wealth," Mr. Greenspan said. "The ultimate values of all assets rest on their ability to produce goods and services in the future. And the future as we all know is uncertain and hence all investments are risky."

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
Coming of Age in Consumer Land

BYLINE: By DEBORAH STEAD 

 BODY:
IF America is a nation of customers, market researchers are our cultural anthropologists -- studying the inhabitants as diligently as Margaret Mead studied the Samoans.
A case in point is "Rocking the Ages: The Yankelovich Report on Generational Marketing," by J. Walker Smith and Ann Clurman (Harper Business, $25). 
 The book, by two senior executives at Yankelovich Partners, urges marketers to de-emphasize the traditional demographics of income, education, race and sex when focusing on buyers. The idea, instead, is to learn about the mind-sets of specific "generational cohorts."
In the anthropology of consumption, and in the pages of this book, these generations are but three: Matures (those born from 1900 to 1945), Boomers (born 1946 to 1964) and Generation X'ers (1965 to 1978).
"Shared experiences in their formative years," the authors say, give the members of each group a specific mind-set and values that govern consumer behavior.
This isn't exactly new ground, despite the book's assertion that such an approach will "shake up" the marketing world. We've heard quite a bit about Boomers and Generation X by now, in part, to be fair, because of Yankelovich Partners. The book's conclusions are drawn from the firm's marketing surveys of the last 26 years, each a result of two-hour interviews with 2,500 respondents.
At times, "Rocking the Ages" feels a bit padded, and occasionally its insights are warmed over, its advice banal. (Do marketers really need to be told that Matures like to be portrayed as healthy and confident?)
Still, this report on America's generational clans is worth a read. Marketers may come away unconvinced that a consumer's date of birth, quite apart from education or income, represents a kind of consumption gene. But anyone with family and friends in all three groups will recognize the tendencies described here. And as the authors lay out the disparate markers and mind-sets, some intriguing details emerge.
Matures, molded by the Depression and World War II, are not just self-sacrificing, the book says. They're extremely self-sacrificing, especially when it comes to helping their grown Boomer children. "No older generation has ever shouldered such a burden for family extravagances," the authors say. A quarter of all toy sales are to Matures, who also regularly treat their offspring to vacations.
In fact, Boomers, raised in postwar prosperity in front of the TV, are still searching for fulfillment. They are twice as likely as Matures to say that raising children is a way to express "personal creativity." They think leisure time, too, should be used creatively, not just as an earned reward (Matures) or as simple relief (Generation X).
On-line marketers should aim at Boomers, the authors say, because they actually buy things when they cruise the World Wide Web. (Matures browse; X'ers play.) The book suggests cybersales of pharmaceuticals or investments, because these purchases can involve Web research. Boomers enjoy becoming mini-experts.
And here's a fact for senior-care marketers who have finally seen this huge generation hit the age of 50. When Boomers were asked to name an age they considered "old," the median response in the Yankelovich surveys was 79.
Generation X'ers, who grew up with divorce, a tight economy, AIDS and crack cocaine, are a more cautious crew than their parents, despite those pleasant memories of "Sesame Street" and a superiority with computers. These wary X'ers tend to marry somewhat later. But suspicious of any Boomer trend, they are having children earlier in those marriages.
The X'ers are the most diverse group when it comes to race, sexual preference and life style. But they don't see that diversity as controversial or unusual. Pragmatists, they judge people and products case by case. Unlike Boomers, they don't even like being linked to a special generation.
The media preferences of X'ers, as teachers and newspaper publishers lament, are "nontextual." They like music and images, particularly those that mix elements and eras. After all, the authors note, Nick at Nite and other rerun channels have exposed X'ers to the TV of previous generations. That's one reason the bell bottoms and platform shoes of the 70's are in half-mocking vogue. X'ers also like ads that make fun of other ads. They're into "retro-eclectic chic."
If that's not enough social science to guide a marketing campaign, how about this: Because many X'ers were latchkey kids in single-parent families, the authors say, retailers should focus on the after-sale, not the point of sale. Service guaranties are apparently welcomed as a security blanket. So it's come to this, here in consumer nation: Solace from a VCR service contract. Then again, it's cheaper than Prozac.
STUDENT LOAN SHOCK Marketers who want help in talking to Generation X'ers should look at "The Guerrilla Guide to Mastering Student Loan Debt," by Anne Stockwell (Harper Perennial, $14).
Written by a Boomer, this excellent guide is unhyped and nonjudgmental. It is also written with enough clarity and style to lure even the most print-averse young person. Ms. Stockwell, a journalist who financed her own education with loans, unjumbles with ease the confusing acronyms and arcane rules of lenders. She even sneaks in the political view that student borrowers -- mostly X'ers who have racked up $100 billion in debt since 1990 -- should get a better deal.
But the preaching stops there. Everything else in this information-rich book is practical and unusually accessible. And everything else includes, well, everything -- even an entertaining section on how lenders track down deadbeats.
Students entering college this fall will find much that is useful in this book. So will their Boomer parents; it's a mini-expert's dream. So, of course, will their grandparents, who may, after all, wind up footing the bills.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Finding Opportunity Where Disorder Recently Ruled

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
IT has often been said that those who invest in the so-called emerging markets around the world need a cool head and a steel-lined stomach.
Those attributes have been especially necessary recently, particularly in the Far East, where stock markets have been imploding or exploding with frightening regularity. 
 For some perspective on all the emerging markets, there may be no better person to turn to than J. Mark Mobius, the peripatetic manager of eight Franklin/Templeton emerging-market funds. One of the oldest, Templeton Developing Markets Trust, has risen more than 122 percent since its inception in October 1991, and now has $5 billion in assets.
Mr. Mobius, 62, is nominally based in Hong Kong and Singapore, but he is usually on the road, on average, he said, more than 250 days a year. He took a few minutes during a brief stay in Lisbon to talk by phone about the stock markets of what used to be called less-developed countries. KENNETH N. GILPIN
Q. As a veteran investor in smaller markets, you are no stranger to sharp price moves. Still, haven't recent drops in various Asian countries been out of the ordinary?
A. The volatility is incredible. Just this week, for example, Indonesia and the Philippines were both down 20 percent in dollar terms.
Q. What is causing these huge moves?
A. It varies from market to market. In Hong Kong, small retail traders were chasing the so-called red chip companies, and were playing them with tremendous leverage. Once the market turned down, they had to unload, which accentuated the fall. That infects other stocks in the market. But if you looked at individual issues, you discover that things are not as bad as they seem.
Q. What about Malaysia? The Government is getting involved in the market, and despite Friday's rebound, stocks are still down by more than 40 percent this year, in dollar terms.
A. What is going on in Malaysia really concerns me, because the Government there has been trying to prop up the market. If that kind of thing continues in Asia or spreads, then I will become very bearish on Asian markets, because it will ruin their credibility. If that happens, I am not going to go in and invest there. It is a very frightening development, one that would be very bad for us and for the countries themselves.
Q. Is what is going on there at all analogous to what happened in Mexico three years ago?
A. There is a parallel. Equity investors are getting blamed and taking it on the chin for what government officials, currency traders and bond traders are doing.
The unknown story, and it is fascinating, is the extent to which central banks in the region have been the cause of this through their dealings in currency futures and options. The Bank of Thailand recently sold $6 billion in futures because they were so overly confident the baht would not fluctuate that they decided to sell these things for a profit. That is amazing -- and in my view is not the function of a central bank.
Q. Thailand's stock market has been under severe pressure for a couple of years now. Is that market becoming more attractive to you?
A. You can't see a tremendous amount of downside there, and we have been increasing our exposure there, to about 6 percent of our portfolio, from about 1 percent, over the last few months. We look at things from the ground up and from a five-year viewpoint. We are not saying Thailand will have a great economic outlook this year or next. But we are saying it is going to be better.
Q. It is not an emerging market, but stock prices in Japan have been depressed for so long, and your experience in Asia is so deep, that it must pique your interest.
A. We just started a Japan fund, the first one Templeton has started in donkey's years, which I am running.
Midsized Japanese companies are interesting, because they are going through a restructuring process that is quite healthy. Also, some blue-chip companies, like Sony and Sanyo, have dropped so much in value that they are looking attractive. That is why we are cautiously optimistic about the Japanese situation, but again from a long-term point of view.
Q. Has there been a change in the character of the Hong Kong market since the Chinese took over?
A. It is becoming more active. Before the takeover, the Western influence, which was more analytical, was prevalent. The Chinese are risk-takers, and have a more short-term orientation. That creates volatility, which is very good for us, because we can apply our long-term logic.
Q. You have significant holdings outside of Asia. What are your thoughts on Latin America?
A. Market economics is really working there, and it is transforming these economies in a very dramatic way. When you move from state-run to privately owned businesses, efficiency goes way up, not only for the companies that are being privatized but for the country as a whole.
They have a long way to go, but you are now beginning to see the results. As I have often told people, the Asian countries have no monopoly on brains or the ability to save.
Q. Which countries in Latin America do you like?
A. About 12 percent of the fund's money is invested in Brazil; it's our biggest market. We also like Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela.
Q. What about Chile?
A. The Chilean market is up, but it went up in large part because they privatized the pension system, which created a boom in their own stock market. Chile has not really opened its capital market to foreign investors. That has been a big mistake and is an area where Argentina and Brazil deserve credit. Letting in foreign investors has helped those countries learn and adjust.
Q. You were recently in Africa. Which countries there look interesting to you?
A. I was in Egypt a few days ago, and lots of good things are happening there, but we are only beginning to get our feet wet.
South Africa is more interesting, and already represents about 3 percent of our portfolio. That percentage will grow, because stock prices are down and the currency has been devalued, and we think the black population is becoming an increasingly important part of the economy.
Zimbabwe is a very interesting market. Robert Mugabe, the Prime Minister, has allowed the private sector to exist, and the listed companies there are quite good. It is a very rich agricultural country, and their proximity to South Africa has helped as well.
Q. And Eastern Europe?
A. We are increasing our exposure in Poland, which has gotten high marks for privatization; in the Czech republic, and in Russia. Those are relatively small markets, but they give us lots of diversification.
Q. Do you worry about the effects a slowdown or recession in the United States might have on emerging markets?
A. I worry less about a slowdown now than I did 5 to 10 years ago.
These markets are becoming large in and of themselves. China, for example, depends on and has benefited enormously from the huge American market. But Chinese incomes have grown, and the people themselves represent a large, growing, almost insatiable market.
Economic interdependence means something, but continued growth in the United States, as big as it is, is not a requirement for continued growth in individual countries.
Q. What do you say to investors who are interested in emerging markets, but scared of their volatility?
A. I tell investors that if they can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen. They need to have a horizon of at least five years. And I remind them that the news coming out of these countries is often far worse than the reality. A good example of that is Hong Kong. According to the conventional wisdom before the handover to China, Hong Kong was going to be a disaster, and people were advised to get out.
The volatility in the Developing Markets Trust has gone down since it started, because the number of countries we can invest in has increased. At the beginning, in 1991, we could invest in about 15 countries. Now it is about 40 countries, and the number is going up all the time.

J. Mark Mobius, who manages eight funds for American investors, is one of the most experienced hands at investing in emerging markets, and one of the most successful. Despite the recent plunge in Asian markets, Templeton Developing Markets I, his $5 billion fund, is up 16 percent this year and more than 110 percent in the last five years. Since 1993, the fund's largest positions have been in Hong Kong and Brazil; weightings in other countries have shifted gradually.

HEADLINE: ON THE JOB;
We'll Be in Touch. But Not in This Lifetime.

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Full employment. Politicians promise it. But can it ever be more than a glorious mirage as long as there are job applicants who rearrange the interviewer's office furniture, change soiled diapers on the personnel manager's desk or fall asleep between questions? As the mail indicates, some job seekers are equipped with self-destruct buttons.
Fred Siegel, the president of an executive search and human resources consulting corporation in Manhattan, remembers one interviewee in particular. 
 "We were interviewing for a very senior banking position for perhaps the most conservative bank in the United States, and our prime candidate arrived with no shoes," he writes. "The strange thing was, she didn't seem to notice."
It happened this way: The candidate took an overnight flight from San Francisco to New York and was exhausted by the time her plane landed. Bound for the 9:30 A.M. interview, she got in a taxi, took off her shoes and fell asleep during the ride into the city. "She left her shoes in the taxi, and came immediately to the interview, without actually realizing she wasn't wearing them," Mr. Siegel writes.
But Mr. Siegel says his strangest interview was with a person he calls Pill Man. A candidate for an investment banking position, Pill Man arrived looking very dapper and carrying an alligator briefcase.
He sat down, and while Mr. Siegel was reviewing his resume, the man opened his briefcase, took out 15 bottles of pills and lined them up along the edge of Mr. Siegel's desk. Then he took out three cans of soda and placed them strategically in the line.
Mr. Siegel said nothing.
As the interview began, the candidate opened a soda and the first five pill containers and started taking his pills.
Mr. Siegel writes: "He never said a word to me about the pills, and I never said a word to him. Other than that, it was a good interview."
In 19 years of human-resources work, Ruth Dorter of Queens has met a number of memorable self-defeating applicants. There was the woman who washed her underwear in the restroom sink. (Ms. Dorter learned of the event when a colleague knocked on her door during the interview and asked that the sink be cleared for normal use.) Then there was the candidate who said he had heard about the job opening from the Shah of Iran. (At the time, the Shah had been dead about 10 years.) And there was the candidate whose cellular phone rang during the interview. He asked Ms. Dorter to excuse herself while he took the call.
People have all sorts of reasons for applying for jobs. Debra W. Haffner has fond memories of the Long Island woman she interviewed for the post of development director of a small nonprofit organization on 42d Street in Manhattan.
Asked why she was interested in changing jobs, the woman replied: "I really like to shop. And the shopping in midtown is much better than the shopping on Long Island."
Ms. Haffner writes, "I ended the interview in short order."
The man applying for a high-powered sales position had already indicated to Bette BonFleur of Orlando, Fla., that he was interested in working only about 30 or 35 hours a week. (She had expected him to say 55 or so.) Then Ms. BonFleur asked her next question: "How do you get past a secretary to her boss, the decision-maker?"
"You want the truth?" he said.
"Of course," replied Ms. BonFleur, who was then about 45 and working in the news syndication business.
After describing some secretaries with words like "battle-ax" or worse, he pointed to his handsome face: "Frankly," he said, "a guy like me doesn't have a problem with most women."
He finished the interview with his own question: "So, what do you think? Do I have a shot at this?"
Selby Drate of Sparks, Nev., outside Reno, remembers the young woman who answered an advertisement for a clerical position and was called for an interview. She arrived with her parents.
They asked and answered all the questions.
The job, Mr. Drate recalls, went to another candidate, who flew solo through the interview.
Deborah Hunter of Atlanta has indelible recollections of the days when she was a member of her law firm's hiring committee. A colleague had a habit of asking each law student who applied to describe one thing that was not on his resume of which he was proud. One young man neither paused nor blinked before replying: "Well, I'm particularly good in bed."
Then there was the applicant who had just completed his first year at a top-20 law school. Ms. Hunter asked, "So how did you do in your first year?"
He replied, "I'm the last person in my class."
Surprised that he didn't sugar-coat his answer by saying he was in the bottom half or quarter, Ms. Hunter asked, "How do you know that?"
He answered promptly, "Everyone who did worse than me dropped out."
Lorin Preston Gill, the president of a small filter-manufacturing business in Rochester, N.H., was interviewing a candidate for a job that combined driving and production work. The applicant explained that he had lost his license and wouldn't be able to drive.
Mr. Gill figured that he could shift some other employees around to handle the road chores, and he arranged for the candidate to have an interview a week later with the head of production. Mr. Gill shook hands with the prospect, and off he went.
"A few minutes later," Mr. Gill writes, "I saw him driving away."
Phyllis Sheerin Ross of Silver Spring, Md., has a colleague in the human resources department of a computer corporation who regales her with tales of less-than-ideal applicants.
One candidate arrived with a portable shopping cart filled with groceries and wore his motorcycle helmet throughout the interview. He said he was in a hurry to get home and put his groceries away.
He got his wish, but not a job.
Thomas J. Newman of Racine, Wis., says he has been interviewing candidates and teaching interviewing skills for more than 35 years.
One of his favorite applicants was the fellow who listed his mother as a reference. Mr. Newman called her.
She said, "I wouldn't hire him; he's not very dependable."
Mal Stevens of Freehold, N.J., a recruiter, was working for a personnel agency in Manhattan many years ago when a woman arrived and demanded a job that day. The office, however, was about to close early, for a religious holiday.
Informed by a job counselor of the early closing, she grabbed a pair of scissors from his desk and stabbed him in the arm. Then she ran up the stairs to another personnel office, where the manager went through the motions of setting up a 3 P.M. interview with a Fortune 500 corporation while he waited for the police to arrive.
As the woman was escorted out by the police, she called out, "Is this what you call a 3 P.M. interview?"
Mary Federico remembers the flamboyantly dressed, wild-haired, heavily made-up woman who applied for a saleswoman's job some years ago at a telecommunications company that was beset with financial problems. Given the company's precarious fiscal state, Ms. Federico felt obligated to ask the woman, as she had all job candidates, "How do you feel about risk?"
The woman replied, "Well, I ride a Harley." Then she paused and said. "But I've been clean for four years."

HEADLINE: Hunting 'The New Buffalo';
Now, a White Backlash Against Rich Indians

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
FOXWOODS Casino, run by the Mashantucket Pequots of Connecticut, is the envy of Donald Trump and the place where many a paycheck goes to die.
Less well known is a shuttered gambling hall in the far northwest corner of Washington state, run by the Lummi Indian Nation. Two weeks ago, the tribe closed this casino near the Canadian border, saying it had become a money loser. 
 For the 1.4 million American Indians who live on or near a reservation, gambling was supposed to be the "new buffalo." But in the nearly 10 years since Congress opened the door to widespread tribal gambling, it has proven to be a mixed blessing, bringing great wealth to a handful of well-located tribes and little else to most Indians.
 
Chipping at Mainstays
 Now, as the Senate takes up a series of measures designed to limit Indian sovereignty and cut funding to tribes that are doing well, the new buffalo is being used as an excuse to chip away at one of the few mainstays of Indian power, tribal leaders say.
"There is a notable white backlash going on," said Senator Ben Nighthorse Cambell at a recent conference on tribal enterprises in Reno, Nev. Mr. Campbell, a Republican from Colorado, is the only Indian in the Senate.
"Indians are at the bottom of almost every category for poverty or social ills, yet there's this perception now that we're all getting rich," said Ron Allen, president of the National Congress of American Indians. "The truth is that the majority of Indian casinos are really just marginal operations."
The Seven Cedars casino of Mr. Allen's tribe on Washington's Olympic Peninsula, the Jamestown S'Klallam, opened with much fanfare two years ago, complete with tall totems, art gallery and a parking lot that stretched over acres of former cow pasture. But it has since laid off more than half of its original 500 employees.
To Senator Slade Gorton, the Republican of Washington leading the campaign to overhaul Indian policy, the tribes are using their sovereignty not just to make tax-free profits but also as a shield against civil lawsuits.
A non-Indian finds it hard to get fair treatment in an Indian court, Mr. Gorton said. "The fundamental question is whether an American citizen should be without access to a neutral court to settle a difference," he said.
One of the riders Mr. Gorton inserted in the $13 billion Interior Appropriations bill that passed the Senate in July would force the tribes to waive their sovereign immunity from lawsuits or face the loss of up to $767 million in Federal funds designated for tribal operations -- nearly half the entire budget for basic operating funds for all the nation's 554 Indian tribes.
Another rider could put Indian reservations on an accounting system that would deny Federal funds for those making a certain amount of money.
Indians see these measures as a continuation of a long history of broken treaties and outright theft. Supreme Court decisions dating from 1832 have upheld Indian sovereignty. For the Senate to put sovereignty on the block as the price to receive basic tribal operating funds amounts to an abrogation of longheld treaty rights, the tribes say. Many legal scholars and some of Mr. Gorton's own Republican colleagues say the riders would not withstand a court challenge.
Indian reservations, by most measurements, remain among the poorest places in the nation. Unemployment for all adult Indians is about 15 percent -- roughly three times the national average. Nearly a third of those working earn less than $9,000 a year, according to the Interior Department.
Last spring, as Congress prepared to vote on a measure to tax profits from Indian casinos, the General Accounting Office conducted a widespread survey of Indian gaming operations and found that only a few tribes were making big profits. The tax measure was narrowly defeated.
Less than a third of the 554 recognized tribes had gambling operations, the G.A.O. found. And of those that did, just eight casinos generated 40 percent of all revenue from Indian gambling nationwide.
But there is big money in Indian gambling. Total revenue for last year was about $7 billion -- up from $121 million in 1988, the year that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act launched casino gambling. The Pequots earn more than $600 million a year in slot machines alone.
The picture is uneven. In Minnesota, the Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa has used its successful casino to all but eliminate unemployment and build new schools and a clinic. But on the sprawling Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, away from the kind of tourist traffic drawn to the lakes of Minnesota, the tribal casino has meant very little change to an area consistently ranked among the poorest counties in America.
Mr. Gorton says it may be time to redistribute Federal funds from the wealthier tribes to the poorer ones. The tribes oppose this, saying their reservation operating funds are something they are entitled to by treaty as a result of giving up their lands. They ask: since when are tax-cutting Republicans interested in redistributing wealth?
"If the state of Michigan generates extra money from its lottery, the Federal Government doesn't take money away from them in order to give it to Mississippi," Mr. Allen said.
 
Punishment?
 But whether the tribes are making any money or not, they say a pattern has developed in which Indians are attacked by opponents any time they make waves or assert political power.
"We have a casino, it's generating some good resources, and now a United States Senator wants to punish us for our success," said John Blackhawk, chairman of the Winnebago Tribe in Nebraska.

HEADLINE: No News;
In China, Better Unread Than Read

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
WHEN will the news media stop reporting so much about celebrities, sex and violence, all that silly stuff none of us should want to read? Wouldn't everyone be better off with a more serious view of the world?
In a phrase, not necessarily. 
 Consider China, one of the few nations where the sudden death of Diana, Princess of Wales, was not big news last week. The day after Diana died, China's most influential newspaper, People's Daily, ran a small item on page 7, giving it less prominence than an adjacent article about problems in the Malaysian economy and a piece on a Tibetan artistic troupe visiting Greece. Other Chinese media carried the news in a similarly understated way.
Although Chinese society is becoming more open each day, firm principles still guide what can and cannot be printed in newspapers. As a result, there is no real danger of the privacy of movie stars or other celebrities being invaded by the Chinese media, nor of anything offensive or distasteful being published. The state, not the market, still rules the media in China.
Having shed the ideology that once imbued all news coverage with a Communist slant, the Chinese media now report most international news straight, culled from news agencies and presented to readers in a fair manner.
In fact, China's international news offers precisely what many critics in the West are asking of their own media: non-sensational news reports with a strict limit on celebrity gossip and other frivolity.
 
Domestic Bliss
 For those who tire of all the violence and tragedy in the American media, domestic coverage in China might seem better at first, too; newspapers are dominated by good news. Of course, that ultimately means it cannot be balanced: reports are carefully filtered to praise the achievements of the authorities and, on some occasions, to point out problems that officials have decided should be addressed.
Which gets to the central issue: Who should decide what is news? Editors or government officials?
A government with the power to limit celebrity coverage is also one that can limit coverage of any issue or any person it chooses. In China, that generally means anything seen to question or to threaten the authority of officialdom.
When it came to Diana's death, the story was not threatening to any Chinese authority, but neither was it deemed significant enough to merit any newspaper's front page, and so coverage was limited.
"Our coverage was respectful," said Chen Jingfang, an official in the chief editor's office at the Xinimin Evening News, an afternoon newspaper in Shanghai. "We cannot give as much space to her death as newspapers in Britain and the United States, where Diana had a big influence."
 
What Readers Should Want
 In fact, a Chinese journalist later explained, editors knew that the Diana story would be one of the most closely read in the newspaper that day. But coverage was controlled, not because of what readers wanted, but because of what it was decided they should want.
There was no lack of interest in Diana's untimely end among Chinese consumers of news. It was a popular topic of talk on the street in Beijing; most fascinated were young women interested in fashion and glamor, who seem to have uniformly admired the princess.
At least initially, as in other countries accustomed to political conspiracies, some ordinary people asked whether Diana's death was really an accident, or whether it was a plot by the royal family, upset by Diana's romance with Emad Mohamed (Dodi) al-Fayed, the playboy son of an Egyptian billionaire. With a clear limit on news on the story from China's official sources, Chinese who wanted to know more had to tune in foreign radio broadcasts.
Everywhere in the world, consumers of news often say they would like to be their own editors, complaining that newspapers and the broadcast media do not give them what they want. Then they go home and read the newspapers and watch the broadcasts that are available. And it is a fair bet that many Americans complained week that the coverage of Diana's death was excessive, and then read and discussed the stories as carefully and thoroughly as those of any other news event of the year.
Similarly, the public sense of outrage over Diana's death will doubtless lead to efforts by politicians to improve the protection of celebrities' privacy and to somehow limit the mobility of aggressive photographers. But short of Draconian government restrictions, such moves are unlikely to alter a principal dynamic of the news media in recent years: the growing public interest in anyone as mysterious, glamorous and media-savvy as Diana.
For those unhappy with an independent, market-oriented news media, it may be reassuring to remember that there is always an alternative. Good news, happy celebrities, and tasteful coverage of tragedy; that is the way in China.

HEADLINE: Is Life Better In Bulgaria? It's a Matter Of Perspective

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 5

 BODY:
The appearance this week of another index ranking countries by their social conditions -- a study in which Bulgaria outranks the United States in quality of life -- raises new questions about how and why these surveys are conducted.
In recent years, reports attempting to measure human progress and to evaluate the conditions that might serve as indicators of whether a nation will enjoy economic and social growth have been compiled by a number of international organizations. Among the most widely noted are surveys from Unicef, the World Bank and the United Nations Development Program, which publishes an annual Human Development Index. 
 The latest report is by a scholar of social work, Richard J. Estes, chairman of the program in social and economic development at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Social Work. Mr. Estes's study, using much of the same data available to United Nations agencies, nevertheless arrives at very different conclusions.
Denmark ranks highest among nations in the ability "to provide for the basic social and material needs of their citizens" in Mr. Estes's survey, compared with 18th in the United Nations Human Development Index. Mr. Estes ranks the United States 27th out of 160 countries, whereas the Human Development Index places it 4th out of 175.
According to Mr. Estes -- who presented his findings this week at an international conference in Jakarta, Indonesia, and will publish them in a forthcoming book -- Singapore and Cuba are almost equal in rank, at 51st and 54th place respectively.
By contrast, the United Nations index ranks Singapore in 26th place and Cuba in 86th. The United Nations says that Singapore enjoys nearly seven times the per capita gross domestic product of Cuba and slightly higher rates of life expectancy and school attendance. Unicef -- the United Nations Children's Fund -- reports in its 1997 Progress of Nations study that Singapore's child mortality and maternal death rates are lower than Cuba's. In Singapore, public housing is available to all.
"Both Singapore and Cuba suffer from their failures in the political sector," Mr. Estes said in an E-mail exchange from Jakarta, explaining that both countries rate highly unfavorably on his political index. Cuba's economy lags, he said, "largely because of the economic boycott/blockade of the country by the U.S. and its allies."
"In any case, Singapore is a country that has experienced miraculous economic changes, but where large segments of the population -- mostly among the Malays -- have minimal opportunity to benefit from the country's wealth," Mr. Estes said. Disparities in wealth, he said, "result in a lower overall score for Singapore than one might otherwise expect."
At the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, Nicholas Eberstadt, who studies demographic surveys, is critical of most attempts to measure social conditions and human progress.
"Human development indices are black boxes and the people who put them together can use any criteria they choose, and thus they can get almost any results they wish," Mr. Eberstadt said in an interview on Thursday.
"For example, there was a time when some specialists on workers' rights suggested using the number of strikes per year as an index of labor freedom," he said. "The lower the number of strikes, the more satisfied the workers. Of course, Communist Czechoslovakia turned out to be the country with almost complete labor freedom. The workers were so satisfied they never struck.
"The scope for error, both inadvertent and agenda driven, is vast in constructing human development indexes because at the bottom they pivot on arbitrary evaluations about which there is no universal consensus," he said.
Mr. Estes, who more than 20 years ago created what he calls the Weighted Index of Social Progress and has issued his ratings periodically, explained the criteria he uses to rank the United States below Bulgaria.
"The present social situation in Bulgaria is miserable," he said. "But in terms of responding to basic human needs, Bulgaria enjoys the legacy of social provision that characterized all of the states and partners of the former Soviet Union, i.e., high literacy, high access to at least basic health care, guaranteed housing, guaranteed income support during old age and other periods of income loss, and so on."
By contrast, Mr. Estes said, the United States loses points because it has 37 million people in poverty and many others on the edge of poverty and without adequate social benefits. He said that the United States trails other industrial nations in life expectancy, infant and child mortality, childhood immunizations and school attendance.

HEADLINE: Power Quietly Shifts Hands After Arizona Governor's Conviction

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Sept. 6

 BODY:
The change at the top took place almost imperceptibly, as Fife Symington's resignation as Governor became official on Friday, and power passed to his Secretary of State, Jane Dee Hull.
The only sign of the transition was a pair of moving vans in a Capitol driveway. Mr. Symington had packed up his mementos and slipped out on Thursday night, the day after he was convicted of fraud. 
 On Friday, movers carted off furniture, paintings from his extensive art collection and dozens of boxes from his ninth-floor office.
His resignation became official at 5 P.M. Ms. Hull passed the hour without ceremony; she has scheduled her swearing in for Monday.
Ms. Hull, 62, a Republican like Mr. Symington, is the second woman to hold that office. Rose Mofford, a Democrat, completed the term of Gov. Evan Mecham, a Republican, after he was impeached and removed from office in 1988.
Mr. Symington was swept out of office after six and a half years as Governor by his conviction on seven Federal fraud charges.
A jury found on Wednesday that he had lied to get millions in loans to shore up his real estate empire.
Mr. Symington plans to ask a judge to set aside his conviction before he is sentenced on Nov. 10. He faces more than 100 years in prison and millions in fines but legal experts say it is more likely that he will serve at least 18 months in prison.
Mr. Symington won election in 1991 by portraying himself as a successful businessman who would run Arizona like his development empire. That venture failed -- Mr. Symington filed for personal bankruptcy in 1995, listing debts of nearly $25 million -- but the state's economy hummed during his tenure.
Mr. Symington pushed tax breaks for high-technology companies that added thousands of jobs. And he and the Legislature cut income and other state taxes.
Tim Lawless, vice president of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, said, "Symington the man had business and personal problems, but Symington the Governor was certainly very successful in moving the state forward in position for the next century. "As time goes forward, people will look back at the Symington administration as very good for all Arizonans," Mr. Lawless said.
But others say history will regard Mr. Symington, the great-grandson of the industrialist Henry Clay Frick, as an average governor at best.
"The economy is good in Arizona, but it's good all over," said Bruce Merrill, a political pollster and Arizona State University journalism professor. "I think you're going to see that he left the state in a pretty big mess in many areas."
Mr. Merrill cited a lingering court battle over financing for public schools, a crisis at the agency responsible for investigating reports of child abuse, unresolved American Indian gambling issues and environmental and transportation problems.
Ms. Hull, who spent 15 years in the Legislature and who is expected to seek a full term in 1998, is a conservative who says her views are not much different from Mr. Symington's.
"The differences will be in style rather than substance," she said.
Ms. Hull, a former teacher who once taught on an Arizona Indian reservation, said education would be a priority.
She said she also wanted "to continue the tax cutting.
"That's been great for the state of Arizona."
Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a former Arizona judge, will administer the oath of office to Ms. Hull on Monday.

HEADLINE: Law Proposed To Regulate Scrambling Of Data

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is circulating proposed legislation on Capitol Hill that would, for the first time, impose strict controls on the manufacture and use of technology that scrambles electronic data for privacy reasons.
The proposal would prohibit the manufacture, sale, import or distribution within the United States of any such technology unless it contained a feature to permit immediate decoding of any message by law-enforcement officials with a wiretap order from a court, known as a trap-door feature. 
 The law would also require telephone companies and Internet providers that offer data-scrambling technology, called encryption, to have that same feature.
Encryption technology has broad uses, including protecting information related to purchases made over the Internet, making possible private communication by telephone or computer and certifying the identity of an individual, as well as in the transmission of military and intelligence secrets. The Government maintains that it needs access to scrambled data for national security and law enforcement.
Currently, the only limitations on data-scrambling technology are regulations governing the export of hardware and software containing encryption features. That has allowed United States citizens and companies to develop and use any kind of encryption devices.
Under the Administration proposal, although data-scrambling technology would have to have the trap-door feature, the users would not be required to turn on the feature.
Critics of the proposal say the feature would simply be a first step toward making such a surveillance capability a legal requirement.
And in testimony last week before the Senate subcommittee dealing with the issue, Louis J. Freeh, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said that he would lobby to make the trap-door feature a legal requirement.
The new legislation represents a significant reversal for the Administration, which had until now insisted that it was opposed to domestic encryption controls. It also appears to contradict the Administration's support for unregulated development of commerce on the Internet.
The proposal comes at a time when encryption hardware and software are becoming increasingly crucial for the protection of electronic commerce and personal privacy on the Internet.
Civil libertarians say the legislation would be a significant move toward a complete ban on products that offer unbreakable communications privacy.
"This is not the first step toward the surveillance society -- it is the surveillance society," said Jerry Berman, executive director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington advocacy group.
But Government officials disputed the idea that requiring decoding technology would necessarily mean the technology would be used.
"There is nothing about putting this enabling technology into law that will inevitably lead to it being turned on," said Robert Litt, a Deputy Assistant United States Attorney.
In 1993, the Administration attempted to gain domestic adoption of encryption technology by proposing standards that it hoped would be adopted by industry, touching off a national debate. It announced plans at that time to use an electronic trap door known as the Clipper Chip. That system, which has been built into some secure Government telephones, installed an electronic trap door allowing law-enforcement officials to eavesdrop on telephone conversations if they obtained special mathematical keys needed to decrypt the encoded telephone signals.
The Government later introduced a second data-scrambling device, known as Fortezza, to be used for computer network communications. But the Government recently discontinued the manufacture of the personal computer cards that contain the scrambling system.
Current eavesdropping systems call for establishing certified third parties, known as escrow agents, that would maintain vast computer data bases of keys -- long strings of numbers -- that could be retrieved by law-enforcement officials with a court authorized wiretap order.
The Administration is now moving in an effort to block legislation that is to be considered this week by the House Intelligence and National Security Committees. That legislation would end Government control over cryptographic systems. The Administration proposal is being offered as an amendment to that bill.
American technology companies have generally opposed restrictions on the use of encryption technology. Moreover, they have complained that they are at a competitive disadvantage with companies in other nations that are not faced with the same restrictions imposed by United States export laws.

HEADLINE: Made in East Harlem: New Jobs and New Hope;
Manufacturers Line Up for Plant Sites

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
A tiny economic event is taking place in a corner of New York where the city's robust economy often fails to stir much notice. A new manufacturing plant will soon open in East Harlem, and if all goes as planned, there will be another, then another, then another, until the Park Avenue manufacturing zone will be difficult to ignore.
The fuse for all of this activity will be ignited in the next few months when the city expects to sell about three acres of derelict property scattered throughout East Harlem to dozens of small companies that would provide the kind of solid jobs that can lift whole neighborhoods. Using tax incentives, the city hopes to mold the first manufacturing zone ever to be created in Harlem and the first new one in upper Manhattan since 1961. 
 Already, companies are coming. New York Flooring, which installs hardwood floors, signed a deal in July and is expected to move into the zone next spring, double its work force to 53 jobs and expand its manufacturing. A-Porcel Inc., a distributor of building materials, is also coming next spring, creating a manufacturing division at the site with the expectation of doubling its work force of 15 employees.
Then there are the upholstery manufacturer, the cigar maker and the ice cream company that are all looking at lots in the zone. Eventually, the city hopes the zone will house 30 businesses and 300 employees.
"We're trying to get to a point where you have people walking every day with a lunch pail and going to a job with the hum of machinery, coming out bone tired and getting a paycheck," said Henry M. Calderon, president of the East Harlem Chamber of Commerce. "We want to say, 'Made in East Harlem.' "
As with any sizable endeavor, something that looks good on paper may get bogged down in details that conspire to abridge, or even stymie, an initiative. But if realized, the plan could go a long way toward shoring up East Harlem's image and serving as a reminder that manufacturing, far from being dead, can be nurtured in New York City.
The zone would be different from the eight industrial parks financed by the city's Economic Development Corporation. Those industrial parks, in locations like East Williamsburg, Hunts Point and Long Island City, were largely created in the 1980's as part of the city's effort to retain manufacturers. Instead, the East Harlem proposal is an attempt to start from scratch.
The existing industrial parks are also much bigger. While they typically cover several hundred acres each, the East Harlem zone, stretching from 117th to 124th Streets between Fifth and Park Avenues, may eventually total 8 to 10 acres in a jigsaw-like, noncontiguous fashion, said Eddie Baca, executive director of the Local Development Corporation Del Barrio, a state-financed agency in East Harlem that would help administer the zone.
"No one thinks the next Nissan plant will be here," said Thomas P. Knierim, executive director of the Long Island City Business Development Corporation. "The trend is smaller, niche manufacturers."
If successful, the zone -- dubbed by Mr. Baca the Park Avenue Manufacturing and Industrial Corridor -- would help resuscitate an area that has suffered extensive urban decay.
For the better part of a century, East Harlem was best known for its tenement housing for a succession of immigrants. But the area also had one of the biggest manufacturers in Manhattan, Washburn Wire. At its peak, the Washburn factory, which was founded around the turn of the century and produced industrial wire, employed 600.
But the factory closed in 1982, part of a slow but inexorable decline of manufacturing across the city in which the number of those jobs declined to 266,206 in 1996 from 541,100 in 1976, according to the New York State Department of Labor. Meanwhile, East Harlem's population dropped to 110,000 residents in 1990 from 205,000 in 1950.
Even so, Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University, who was the co-author of a 1996 university study on manufacturing in New York City, said the timing was right for East Harlem for several reasons: a strong labor pool, access to transportation and the unrealized entrepreneurial potential of the community.
Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said there was another important reason: Crime in East Harlem has fallen 36 percent since 1993.
In the next few months, the city plans to put up for sale, at prices ranging from $5 to $15 per square foot, the approximately three dozen lots that will make up the manufacturing zone. Eventually, Mr. Baca said, five more acres could be redeveloped underneath the Metro-North tracks from 119th to 124th Streets, and 126th to 132d Streets.
Some of the parcels in the zone have been vacant for 40 years, the byproduct of incomplete efforts since the 1940's to demolish, then rebuild, low-income housing in the area. In 1989, though, the city started to rezone much of that land to accommodate manufacturing and commercial uses.
Most of the land falls within the jurisdictions of the Federal Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone and the State Economic Development Zone. Companies that move into the manufacturing zone are exempt from city and state sales taxes on capital investments and are eligible for state and Federal tax credits and a 30 percent reduction in their utility bills.
In July, the city's Economic Development Corporation selected New York Flooring, an East Harlem company that supplies, installs and refinishes hardwood floors, to purchase and develop three lots, covering 10,500 square feet. The new location, on Park Avenue and 123d Street, will enable the company to build a showroom and manufacturing site, said Breda Cahill, the company's vice president.
And on Thursday, the Economic Development Corporation selected A-Porcel, which distributes doors, aluminum sheets and other building materials, to purchase and develop nine lots totaling 20,000 square feet at Park Avenue on 120th and 121st Streets. The new site will enable the company, now based on East 118th Street and Second Avenue, to start fabricating doors and plastics.
"Right now, everyone drives up and looks at the neighborhood because we're in a residential neighborhood," said Robert Newblatt, A-Porcel's president. "With this industrial area, people can look at all the industries and focus more on the business."
There are other suitors, too. Lore Upholstery, on East 120th Street and Third Avenue, needs more space to make its upholstery items, draperies and slip covers. The East Harlem Council for Community Improvement, a nonprofit organization, is interested in creating a car-maintenance site.
And Alfredo Rodriguez, president of the Associated Supermarket, which manages La Marqueta, a public marketplace in East Harlem, says he has been acting as an information broker for a Dominican Republic ice cream maker and cigar manufacturer intrigued by the East Harlem zone.
"If this industrial park were in place, you'd have a hub of activity which you can build upon," Mr. Baca said. "You'd create a consumer place with employees who need to shop, who need to eat, who need to find housing in the area."
In addition to the manufacturing zone, East Harlem has recently been abuzz over the planned Pathmark supermarket on East 125th Street, a Magic Johnson movie theater and a mall on the site of the defunct Washburn Wire factory. And yet, East Harlem has had its share of mirages: the Washburn Wire site alone has seen plans for a television production studio and a community college come and go.
Still, that has not stopped the city from voicing confidence. "You have the real beginning of a real solid infrastructure," Mr. Millard said. "Two years from now, lots of small businesses should be paying taxes and developing property on property that's dormant now. Harlem is hot."

HEADLINE: RACE FOR CITY HALL: In Uphill Battles, 3 Democrats Offer Visions to Challenge the Mayor's;
Albanese Sees a City Divided

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
At a center for the elderly in Harlem the other day, Sal F. Albanese described himself once again as the embodiment of "the New York experience" -- a garment worker's son who rose to city councilman and mayoral candidate thanks in part to the city's long tradition of generous social support.
But that tradition, he warned, has eroded under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
 "When I talk about the city, I talk about a city that elevates people, which is the strength of New York," said Mr. Albanese, a Brooklyn Democrat. "We always had the ability to do that. We had the services to do that: good schools, living-wage jobs. We're moving away from that toward a two-tiered system: a small group of very wealthy people and the rest of the city, poor and working poor."
The listeners at the A. Phillip Randolph Senior Center applauded politely when Mr. Albanese finished speaking and took his first -- and only -- question. After you lose the Democratic primary on Tuesday, an elderly man asked, will you endorse one of your two rivals?
Mr. Albanese appeared irritated -- as he did again later that day when a columnist for a Queens weekly posed a similar question -- and insisted that he was going to win.
Lacking the money of Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, or the prominence of the Rev. Al Sharpton, Mr. Albanese has nonetheless doggedly pushed his theme of an increasingly divided city throughout his campaign.
His rivals have also accused Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, of creating a similar climate. But Mr. Albanese has made that message his campaign's central theme, using his personal and political life as backdrops.
Although the message seemed to resonate well in the working-class neighborhoods he had visited throughout the city, Mr. Albanese's campaign faces more practical problems.
Despite a late burst of television advertising, Mr. Albanese can still step outside his campaign headquarters on Lexington Avenue and 41st Street without being recognized.
At the Pelham Parkway subway station in the Bronx last week, as Mr. Albanese greeted early-morning commuters, Kenneth Agosto, a registered Democrat, told him he would support him. But later Mr. Agosto said he was not hopeful about the Councilman's chances in Tuesday's primary.
"I'm not crazy about Messinger, and I think he's the best candidate," Mr. Agosto said. But he predicted a victory for Ms. Messinger. "I think the machine is too powerful."
Mr. Albanese -- a former public school teacher who, despite a liberal voting record, has served for 15 years in conservative Bay Ridge and Bensonhurst -- long ago earned a reputation as a maverick.
He voted repeatedly, for instance, against budget agreements worked out between Mayor Giuliani and Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, criticizing their effects as too severe on middle- and lower-income New Yorkers.
In keeping with those views, Mr. Albanese sponsored a so-called living wage bill that required some city contractors to pay higher minimum wages. The bill was enacted last year over Mr. Giuliani's objections. Mr. Albanese has also proposed another bill that would sharply reduce campaign contributions and curtail the influence of big donors.
"I want to be a Mayor that offers all the people the same opportunities I had when I was growing up in this town," said Mr. Albanese, who often points out that he attended York College, which is part of the City University of New York, when tuition at the university was free.
"You can bring people together around the issue of economic fairness," he said and, referring to the contrasting reactions Mr. Giuliani's appearances often elicit in the city, added: "I don't want to be a Mayor that goes into one neighborhood and gets jeered, and goes into another neighborhood and gets cheered."
At a voter's drive at Manhattan Community College, Reggie Mason, a former student and current member of the Independence Party, which has placed Mr. Albanese's name on its line in November, said he supported Mr. Albanese. More than Ms. Messinger or Mr. Sharpton, the Councilman could unify the city, Mr. Mason said.
A few minutes later, Mr. Albanese's low-key remarks were lost amid Mr. Sharpton's thunderous appeal to "rock the vote! rock the vote!" Mr. Mason could not help pumping his fists in the air, but quickly added that he thought Mr. Albanese's almost reserved style of politicking could work in his favor.
"Sal is a very humble man," Mr. Mason said. "I think people will respect that."

HEADLINE: RACE FOR CITY HALL: In Uphill Battles, 3 Democrats Offer Visions to Challenge the Mayor's;
Sharpton Woos a New Bloc

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY 

 BODY:
As candidate after candidate took the microphone to pitch for votes at a center for the elderly in Harlem the other day, the audience members, appearing largely unimpressed, sat chatting among themselves.
But they snapped to attention when the Rev. Al Sharpton strode to the podium, his trademark pompadour newly shorn, his voice hovering over the dingy room as he explained why he could and should be elected mayor. 
 "The only way Mayor Giuliani can be beat is get someone who can excite and energize people who normally ignore elections," Mr. Sharpton said.
"You have to get them out of the churches, out of the housing projects, out of the senior citizen homes and stir them up. You can't beat Giuliani with a regular race. The only one who can do that is Al Sharpton."
During his 20-minute message to the mostly black audience of more than 80 people, Mr. Sharpton hammered away at issues that have been the cornerstone of his campaign: police brutality, education, unemployment and, of course, race.
The themes drew vigorous applause from the audience, but highlighted the paradox of Mr. Sharpton's candidacy: while he has a devoted core of supporters, they represent just a portion of the Democratic vote, principally blacks and some Hispanic voters.
Mr. Sharpton nevertheless believes that his support is strong enough -- and his opponents' appeal weak enough -- that he will force a runoff of Tuesday's primary, and then put together a coalition to propel him into office.
"The pundits say, 'Well, Mr. Sharpton, what about the majority white vote?' No black person born can get the majority white vote in New York City," he said, driving the crowd to laughter. "David Dinkins didn't get a majority white vote. I can put together a coalition that can beat him."
Urging the audience to help him wrest the Democratic nomination from Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan and Sal F. Albanese, a City Councilman from Brooklyn, he then predicted: "There will be people coming from the four corners of the earth to watch the showdown between Rudy Giuliani and Al Sharpton."
As Mr. Sharpton left at the end of his speech, several people followed him to ask for autographs and to assure him that he had their votes.
Throughout his campaign, Mr. Sharpton has played largely to black and Hispanic audiences from Harlem to his neighborhood of Flatbush, Brooklyn to Jamaica, Queens. By concentrating on those voters, he believes he can surprise his opponents the way he did in the 1992 United States Senate race, in which he captured 160,000 votes.
But any effort to widen his appeal is obscured by controversial crusades from the past. In 1988, Mr. Sharpton served as an adviser to Tawana Brawley, a Dutchess County teen-ager whose claim that she had been abducted and raped by a band of white men was dismissed by a grand jury as a hoax.
Mr. Sharpton bristles angrily at the mention of the case. His latest defense of his role as a Brawley adviser came last week at his weekly rally in Harlem where he ridiculed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for appointing Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels, to a task force intended to break down barriers between the community and police officers in the wake of the 70th Precinct torture case. Several years ago, Mr. Sliwa admitted he made up incidents to increase the visibility of his organization.
"They're going to ask me about Brawley who they claim she lied," Mr. Sharpton said, his voice roaring. "What about Sliwa, who said he lied -- not that he believed somebody else. He lied. Hello!"
Mr. Sharpton has raised far less money than his opponents, but he is confident he can win. "Muhammed Ali had a strategy that worked," Mr. Sharpton told about 100 people at a weekly rally.
"You can sometimes go in and sting like a bee. But sometimes you back up and do what he used to call a rope-a-dope.
"So what I've done during this primary, I've stung when I wanted to," he said, referring to an endorsement by Representative Jose E. Serrano, one of the highest-ranking officials to endorse his campaign. "For the last half, I just back up and let the media be the dope and I let them rope themselves. I don't care what the newspapers say."
As for money, Mr. Sharpton said that where he comes from the $185,000 he has raised is a lot of money. Who needs commercials, he said, when you work the streets and have name recognition?
"If you grew up stretching welfare peanut butter across the bread, you know how to stretch $200,000," he said from his perch at the rally. "I grew up overweight on welfare food. I ain't never been skinny a day in my life."

HEADLINE: RACE FOR CITY HALL: In Uphill Battles, 3 Democrats Offer Visions to Challenge the Mayor's;
Messinger Sounds the Alarm

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
On the hot Sunday afternoon before Labor Day, Ruth W. Messinger stood on the deck around a swimming pool at the Skyview Apartments, a co-op complex in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, squinting as the sun glittered off the water, and came face to face with what may be the biggest obstacle in her quest to become mayor of New York.
Before her stood not the Rev. Al Sharpton or Councilman Sal F. Albanese of Brooklyn -- her two main opponents in Tuesday's Democratic primary -- nor Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the pugnacious Republican incumbent, but Cyndee Blauner, a schoolteacher and mother of two, a registered Democrat who will certainly cast a ballot in November. 
 "I think things in the city right now are better than they've been in a long time," Ms. Blauner said, making a point often repeated to Ms. Messinger at campaign stops around the city. It is not that Ms. Blauner is certain she will vote for Mr. Giuliani, as she did in 1993, but that she wonders whether there is reason not to.
On the long summer's march toward Primary Day, Ms. Messinger has sought to provide many reasons, particularly what she describes as Mr. Giuliani's dismal record on education. She has visited almost a public school a day, sometimes two, to talk about overcrowding, poor reading scores and what she calls inadequate spending on education.
"I am attacking Rudy Giuliani's record in education," Ms. Messinger said recently during a visit to Public School 19 in Corona, Queens. "I am telling you that on his watch, in Giuliani time, the budget of the schools has been cut, reading scores have gone down, schools have become increasingly overcrowded and education for a million children has deteriorated."
Ms. Messinger has also sought to blame the Mayor for incidents of police brutality. In her public comments, she frequently makes references to "Giuliani time," the words that Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant, says were uttered by police officers who have been charged with brutalizing him in the bathroom of a police precinct house in Brooklyn.
And she often makes the city's unemployment rate another mark against Mr. Giuliani. "Unemployment is hovering just under or just at 10 percent, more than twice the national average," she told Brooklyn business owners. "We rank highest among the 20 largest cities in this country in our unemployment numbers. We rank 19th out of 20 in job creation. That's bad for the future of the city."
But even after more than 20 years in public service that took her from a school board to City Council and on to Manhattan Borough President, and even as she has sought to present herself as the leading Democratic contender -- usually ignoring her primary opponents to focus on Mr. Giuliani -- Ms. Messinger is relatively unrecognized beyond her core constituents in Manhattan. At campaign stops, passers-by like Jose Olea, 24, who saw her in Washington Heights, often ask, "Who's Ruth?"
During a visit by Ms. Messinger to P.S. 69 in Jackson Heights, Queens, Migdalia Guzman, 42, a bookkeeper and mother of two, spoke to her last week about the struggles of working parents. After a few minutes, perhaps tipped by the television crews and campaign posters, she asked, "Are you Ruth Messinger?"
Ms. Messinger's focused attacks on the Mayor have come at a price. She has been attacked, in turn, by many of the Mayor's allies, including Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
It also led to early, direct comparisons to Mr. Giuliani, who remains popular. Alfreda Wilson, 41, a civilian police employee, saw Ms. Messinger outside P.S. 249 in Flatbush, Brooklyn. "I like what she's saying about education," Ms. Wilson said. "But what does she say about crime?"
Mr. Giuliani is not invincible, many voters on the street say. Ms. Blauner, at the Skyview Apartments, said that her concerns about police brutality had made her think twice about voting for the Mayor.
But the Messinger campaign so far has been unable to capitalize on any such weakness to energize large numbers of voters. Her campaign events do not generate large crowds. And at times, logistical missteps by her campaign, such as her late arrivals to Bushwick High School on the first day of school last week, have cost her opportunities to win more attention.
Some say they need to know more before voting for change. "I am not a big fan of Rudy Giuliani, but I am not quite sure how strong a candidate Ruth Messinger is," said Michelle Foster, who runs an employment agency and was at the Skyview pool. "I would like to see an alternative. I would like to see a strong alternative. I just don't know how good a leader she is."

HEADLINE: Ernst C. Stiefel Dies at 89; Lawyer Fled Hitler

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Ernst C. Stiefel, a German-born Jewish lawyer whose answer to Adolf Hitler was to become one of Germany's pre-eminent lawyers -- while practicing in New York -- died on Wednesday at a hospital in Baden-Baden. He was 89.
In a half-century of advising American corporate investors on the intricacies of German commercial laws and providing corresponding advice for German companies investing in the United States, Dr. Stiefel (pronounced STEE-ful) never forgot that he was one of the lucky ones. 
 As a lawyer, he felt the sting of Nazi anti-Semitism early enough to get out before things turned seriously ugly. He was a prime example of the unfathomable folly of Hitler's campaign against the Jews, which hounded thousands of Jewish lawyers and judges into exile and enriched dozens of other countries with exported talent. One bitter irony of the Holocaust is that the value of the millions of lives cut short and careers foreshortened is best measured by the accomplishments of those who survived.
A native of Mannheim, he demonstrated such an early and brilliant affinity for the law that a monograph on insurance law he wrote at the age of 17 is still being cited. Yet after receiving a law degree from the University of Heidelberg, he was able to practice in Mannheim for all of two weeks in 1933 before he and other Jewish lawyers were disbarred.
Lest anyone forget the magnitude of that wound, Dr. Steifel made it one of his life's missions to document and chronicle the contributions made to dozens of foreign legal systems by refugee Jewish lawyers. And as an adviser to the Allied military government in Germany after World War II, he helped lay the legal groundwork for a system of restitution and reparation that by the German Government's own account has sent more than $50 billion to Holocaust survivors living abroad.
Obtaining law degrees from the University of Paris and the Middle Temple in London, as well as an advanced degree from the University of Strasbourg, Dr. Stiefel practiced briefly in France and England before moving to New York in 1939, when he found that his multiple degrees qualified him for a position as a restaurant dishwasher: a job, he later recalled, whose meager salary and limited kitchen privileges left him hungry only some of the time.
He later became a chauffeur for a prominent lawyer and eventually found work as a clerk in a law office, where his duties included going out for sandwiches.
Along the way he impressed two Sullivan & Cromwell partners, John Foster Dulles and his brother Allen, who secured him a job with the wartime Office of Economic Warfare studying international insurance company records to identify strategic German industrial targets.
Dr. Stiefel, who became an American citizen, passed the New York State bar examination in 1944, making him what colleagues insist was the first and only lawyer licensed to practice in four countries.
An independent practitioner, he was first affiliated with Cleary, Gottlieb. Since 1971 he had been with Coudert Brothers.
As a New York lawyer with a practice focused largely on Germany, Dr. Stiefel, who maintained an office in Dusseldorf, made numerous trips to Germany, typically traveling with so much luggage that airline personnel must have taken him for something of a clotheshorse; they didn't know that 9 of his 10 suitcases were crammed with legal papers.
A short, energetic man whose idea of a relaxing vacation was to hike barefoot through the Swiss Alps, Dr. Stiefel had an enormous capacity for work. He wrote scores of books and papers on complex legal issues, taught at New York Law School, and never retired. On his final trip to Germany he was pressing a claim for a family he had represented for almost 50 years.
For all his regret over the Nazi era, Dr. Steifel, who was credited with rewriting the German traffic code after the war, made so many contributions to German commerce and German law that in 1995 he was decorated by the German Government.
Still, when it came to academic philanthropy, Dr. Steifel, whose legal work and shrewd investments made him a multimillionaire, focused his attention on New York Law School. Among other contributions, he endowed a $1.5 million chair in comparative law.
Dr. Stiefel, who was married briefly, is survived by a nephew, Eli Maor of Cleveland, and a niece, Shulamith Nathanson of Israel.

HEADLINE: RACE FOR CITY HALL: THE CANDIDATES;
Mayoral Candidates Court Voters In Last Days of Muted Campaign

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
From a labor parade up Fifth Avenue to a campaign caravan across the five boroughs, the Democratic candidates for New York City mayor vigorously tried to court voters yesterday in the final weekend of a primary campaign that has turned into one of the least contentious and most muted Democratic mayoral contests in a generation.
But even as the campaign played out its quiet final days, the Democrats -- attending a parade that has historically been closely identified with Democratic dominance in New York politics -- were reminded of the political stature of the man they were seeking to defeat. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani marched with union leaders near the front of the delayed Labor Day parade -- a privilege always given the incumbent and a reminder that the Republican Mayor had lined up the support of nearly 30 unions. 
 Two of the Democrats seeking to unseat him -- Sal F. Albanese, who has considerable organized union support, and Ruth W. Messinger, who does not -- walked farther back in the line of the parade, which drew relatively few spectators along most of the route. The Rev. Al Sharpton skipped the parade altogether, protesting that "the labor movement has turned to Giuliani." Mr. Sharpton instead appeared at a news conference with the family of Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant who prosecutors say was assaulted by the police last month.
The events yesterday provided some of the last opportunities the candidates will have for on-the-street campaigning before the primary on Tuesday. Their activities, under an intermittently slate-gray September sky, signaled the closing of a contest so subdued that several Democrats said the only real intrigue was how low the turnout would be, and whether there really might be a chance that Ms. Messinger, who has been viewed as the overwhelming front-runner, might receive fewer than than 40 percent of the votes and thus be forced into a runoff.
Between news conferences, parades, breakfasts and Mr. Sharpton's campaign caravan, the Democrats described themselves as satisfied with the campaigns they had run, asserting they had presented voters with a full portrait of their candidacies.
Mr. Albanese described his campaign as "picture perfect" as he stood outside a pre-parade breakfast of union leaders. "We have been subject to a media blackout," he said. "The media has anointed Ruth Messinger as the front-runner. We have overcome those odds. People are saying there will be a runoff."
As she waited a block from Fifth Avenue for the parade to begin, Ms. Messinger shrugged off her poor showing of union support, and instead beamed confidently about her prospects in Tuesday's primary. She said her campaign, with its repeated visits to overcrowded public schools, had set the tone for the general election against Mr. Giuliani.
"We have defined education as the single most important issue for voters this year," Ms. Messinger said.
Mr. Sharpton, who is hoping that few voters will turn out for Ms. Messinger, forcing a runoff between them, said that the campaign had ratified his standing as a political force in the city.
"When I entered this race, the reaction was a sort of tongue-in-cheek snicker: 'What can he do?' " Mr. Sharpton said. "Now, people are speculating about whether there will be a runoff. We have turned the critics and the cynics around."
Ms. Messinger walked the parade route and then went to Queens, where she campaigned among the bustle of back-to-school shoppers on Jamaica Avenue, drawing cheers and chants of encouragement at every step. "I'm not voting for Giuliani," said Tony Medy, 23, a United Parcel Service driver. Mr. Medy said he did not know whether he would vote for Ms. Messinger, either.
Mr. Albanese was greeted warmly during the parade. He walked the route twice, and then lingered to shake the hand of everybody who stopped by to say hello.
"I was going to vote for Messinger but she hasn't caught fire," said Katherine Avakian, 58, one of those who stopped. A secretary from the Upper East Side, she said that Mr. Albanese "comes across as a human being who doesn't change his ideas every minute."
Mr. Albanese and Ms. Messinger ended their public appearances to prepare for two debates today: an official Campaign Finance Board debate at 11:30 A.M., which will be broadcast on Channel 7, and a debate that is scheduled to begin at 5 P.M. on Channel 4. A debate that was taped on Friday will be televised on Channel 2 at 11 A.M.
Mr. Sharpton spent his afternoon and evening in an eight-car motorcade, on what he promised would be a 20-stop swing through the city.
"They're saying the city has gone to sleep," he told a small crowd in front of Fluffy Unisex hair salon in Queens. "Unemployment is higher than it's ever been. The case of Abner Louima has brought police brutality into the open. We can win this primary."
Besides Mr. Albanese, Mr. Sharpton and Ms. Messinger, the field includes two lesser-known candidates, Roland Rogers, a businessman, and Eric Ruano-Melendez, a civil engineer in the city's Environmental Protection Department. A potentially formidable candidate, Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, dropped out earlier in the year.
Several potentially strong challengers to Mr. Giuliani, like city Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, skipped this contest, in deference to what they saw as his strength this year and in recognition of the fact that he would, if re-elected, be barred from running again in four years by the city's term-limit law.
Indeed, as a political event, the Labor Day parade -- which was switched to Saturday from Labor Day in hopes of drawing more people -- was probably as much a portrait of the state of the political field today as it was a preview of the political candidacies to come. Among those probable future candidates in the parade were Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn and Public Advocate Mark Green, who are planning to challenge Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato next year, and Mr. Hevesi, who is almost certain to run for mayor in 2001.
If there was a politician at the center of things yesterday, it was Mr. Giuliani. By virtue of his office, he was allowed the prominence of marching at the front of the paradeand giving a speech at the union breakfast, at the Hotel Intercontinental on East 48th Street.
But notwithstanding the union support of Mr. Giuliani, there were signs yesterday that the support for the Mayor -- who cut 23,000 jobs from the city's work force through severance and attrition during his first three years -- is not particularly deep. Only half the room applauded when he rose to speak at the breakfast, and Sandra Feldman, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, which has not yet endorsed a mayoral candidate but will before the general election, pointedly credited "this being an election year" for the fact that Mr. Giuliani had supported more spending on schools.
In the parade, Mr. Giuliani marched beside Brian McLaughlin, president of the New York City Central Labor Council. There was occasional applause for the Mayor, and on every block or two, in a very organized fashion, three or four supporters of the Giuliani campaign carried signs that read, "Rudy." There were far fewer anti-Giuliani catcalls than during last year's parade, when members of several unions and leftist groups repeatedly heckled him.
Still, at the breakfast, Mr. Giuliani was better off than Mr. Albanese, who has won the support of 34 unions but, as a Councilman from Brooklyn, was not permitted to speak. Mr. Albanese stood at the side of the room with a single aide. Ms. Messinger, as Manhattan Borough President, was allowed only to present a brief proclamation at the breakfast.
Both Ms. Messinger and Mr. Albanese said later that they were neither surprised by nor concerned about the organized-labor support for Mr. Giuliani, and asserted that it would not figure in the campaign.
"I am the only candidate with real labor support," said Mr. Albanese, who marched first with a contingent of communications workers and then with auto workers. "I would argue that Giuliani's labor support is based on the fact that he's in charge and he's ruthless."
Ms. Messinger, who marched with members of the department store workers union, said she now had the support of about five unions. Ms. Messinger said that she would win Tuesday's primary, and after that would begin displaying the breadth of union support that customarily comes with being a Democratic nominee.
"We'll pick them up and we'll let you know," she said.
As the campaign closed down, the candidates continued to refrain from attacking each other. Mr. Albanese seemed perplexed when asked why he had refrained from criticizing Ms. Messinger, until his campaign manager, Don Crouch, intervened.
"You don't kick a candidate when they're going down," Mr. Crouch said.
"Yeah," Mr. Albanese said, lighting up. "You don't kick a candidate when they're going down."

PAYDAY
Unions Gather Strength, But So Do Executives
Organized labor had reason to celebrate last Monday: unions are at their strongest position in nearly a generation and are poised to gain membership after a two-decade decline, union leaders and many experts say. What's more, the 15-day United Parcel Service strike created a surge of sympathy for unions, and the A.F.L.-C.I.O., with 13 million members, is spending $20 million a year on organizing, an eightfold increase from the early 1990's. Still, union members' gains pale in comparison with those of executives. Data from the I.R.S. show that tax-deductible executive pay, before inflation, climbed 182 percent, to $307.6 billion in 1995 from $109 billion in 1980. In the same 15-year period, corporate revenues rose 129.5 percent, and corporate profits gained 127 percent. "Chief executives can pay themselves," said Robert Monks, a principal of Lens Inc., an investment fund, explaining the variance. But one group remains unhappy: 37 percent of working women say that making ends meet has become more difficult in the last five years, an A.F.L.-C.I.O. survey found, and 32 percent complain that their jobs do not provide equal pay for equal work. "Equal pay was women's No. 1 concern," said John Sweeney, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. 

THE MARKETS
A Day to Remember
Stocks have given investors a bumpy ride this year, but if the general direction is up, who can complain? On Tuesday, the Dow industrials roared back from the holiday weekend with the biggest one-day point gain on record -- 257.36 points -- only to settle down for a a peaceful couple of days before closing on Friday at 7,822.41, down 44.83 for the day but up 199.99 for the week. Big stocks like Procter & Gamble and Gillette slid, while selected technology issues like Compaq chalked up gains. The Nasdaq composite index rose 48.45 for the week, closing at 1,635.77, a record.
 
THE ECONOMY
Orders Fall but Sales Boom
The economy continued to throw out mixed signals. The National Association of Purchasing Management's factory index unexpectedly fell to 56.8 last month from 58.6 in July, reflecting a drop in orders and production. Traders took the decline as a signal that the Federal Reserve was less likely to raise interest rates to cool down the economy. Further, the economy added 49,000 jobs in August, fewer than the 72,000 that were expected, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.9 percent, from 4.8 percent in July. But August vehicle sales were up 5 percent, as Americans continued on a buying spree. The latest expensive truck models -- notably the new Mercedes-Benz sport utility vehicle and the Lincoln Navigator -- were among the most popular. G.M. said its sales rose a stronger-than-expected 7.6 percent in August; Chrysler reported a 0.5 percent gain and Ford, 3.6 percent. Retailers enjoyed similar gains, thanks to back-to-school shoppers. The Goldman, Sachs retail composite index rose 5.7 percent. The Gap, Kmart and Wal-Mart Stores were among those reporting gains.
 
CIGARETTES
7 Cents Higher
The nation's largest cigarette makers, taking Wall Street by surprise, raised wholesale prices an average of 7.6 percent, which will mean a climb of 7 cents a pack at retail. The increase, believed to be the industry's largest single such move, is expected to bring in nearly $1.6 billion over the next 12 months. The money could be used for payments on settlements of lawsuits with Florida and Mississippi and one expected with Texas. The suits seek to recover medical costs of smoke-related illnesses. Congressional leaders said that they had no plans to act on the proposed $368 billion tobacco settlement this year, but advocates of the proposal feared that such a delay could kill the deal.
 
GAS PRICES
An Expensive Thirst
With a summer surge in demand, the price of gasoline at the pump took one of its biggest monthly jumps ever in August -- as much as 15 cents a gallon for regular unleaded fuel at some New York stations, where the average price was $1.29 a gallon. Even running their refineries at a record 99.4 percent of capacity, oil companies have barely kept up with the nation's drivers, who increasingly favor hefty, less-efficient sport utility vehicles. Also, Americans have driven more this summer, some to escape rising air fares and others because a strong economy has given them the money to travel.
 
FRENCH PRIVATIZATION
Socialist or Capitalist?
France's Socialist-led Government reached diametrically opposite decisions on privatizing the country's two most visible state-owned companies. The chairman of Air France, Christian Blanc, announced plans to quit, after Prime Minister Lionel Jospin rejected his pleas to turn the country's flagship airline into a private company. But just a few hours later, Government officials formally recommended proceeding with a much-delayed plan to sell off one-third of the national telephone monopoly, France Telecom. That privatization would give the Government a $4 billion windfall, which would help lower its deficit enough to qualify for Europe's forthcoming single currency.
 
ACQUISITIONS
Hotels, Ships and Meat
Promus Hotel and the Doubletree Corporation agreed to a merger that would create one of the world's biggest hotel companies, with combined revenue of $5 billion from 1,136 hotels whose brands include Red Lion and Embassy Suites. The deal values Promus at about $2.1 billion and Doubletree at $1.8 billion. Hudson Foods agreed to be bought by Tyson Foods in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $681 million; a tainted-beef crisis at Hudson last month led to the largest recall of meat in the nation's history. In Frankfurt, Preussag A.G. agreed to buy Hapag-Lloyd A.G. for $1.5 billion, shifting its focus from coal and metals to shipping and the fast-growing tourism business. Beckman Instruments, which makes medical testing equipment, said it would pay $875 million for the Coulter Corporation, a privately held maker of machines that analyze blood cell counts, and assume $175 million of Coulter's debt.
 
SUPERCOMPUTERS
9,072 Pentium Pros at Work
Janus, the world's fastest supercomputer, at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., can perform a once-inconceivable trillion mathematical operations a second. Housed in 84 tall gray cabinets, it uses 9,072 Pentium Pro processors built by Intel to simulate complex events -- like explosions, nuclear fusion reactions, missile impacts or the crash of a comet into Earth -- with a fineness of detail that was hitherto impossible.
 
APPLE'S DEAL
$100 Million for a Clone Maker
Apple Computer agreed to buy the Macintosh business of its largest licensee, Power Computing of Austin, Tex., for $100 million. The move effectively ended the embattled personal computer maker's strategy of trying to grow through the cloning of its Macintosh computers. Apple will buy the technology, direct marketing and build-to-order capabilities of Power Computing, the largest and most aggressive of the handful of companies that have been selling computers that run the Macintosh operating system. It will also take on some employees.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Hiltons They Aren't: 2 Guys In a Hurry

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
J. WILLARD MARRIOTT built his food and lodging empire from a root beer stand opened with $500 in Washington, D.C. Conrad Hilton turned a $5,000 investment in a fleabag hotel in Cisco, Tex., into one of the world's best-known hotel companies. And two Harvard classmates, Ernest Henderson and Robert Moore, started the Sheraton chain by pooling their World War I veterans' bonuses to invest in real estate.
So much for humble beginnings. Today, after more than two decades in which the main action in the hotel industry revolved around conglomerates, investment banks and big property developers, the hotel moguls are back. But this time, they need more than just a dollar and a dream; they need financial acumen, deep-pocketed backers and, if they can swing it, control of a real estate investment trust -- better yet, a paired-share real estate investment trust. 
 Most people don't have a clue what that is, of course, and that is where two improbable magnates -- Barry S. Sternlicht, 36, a financial whiz from Connecticut who is the son of a Holocaust survivor from Poland, and Paul A. Nussbaum, 50, a lawyer from Brooklyn, himself no slouch at finance -- have a great advantage: They do.
Their understanding of how to capitalize on the REIT (rhymes with "heat") has helped them put together two of the fastest-growing hotel empires in the United States. It has also won them the admiration of real estate analysts and professionals. "They're both very competitive, very smart, good deal makers," said Barry Greenfield, the manager of Fidelity Investments' real estate fund, "and both have a vision for their company and know how to appeal to Barry Greenfield to buy their stock."
Others are buying their stock, too.
Mr. Sternlicht is chairman and chief executive of Starwood Lodging Trust, the nation's biggest hotel REIT, with a market capitalization of about $2.2 billion. Based in Phoenix, Starwood owns or controls about 100 hotels and is said to have the inside track to buy the 100 properties of Westin Hotels and Resorts for about $1.4 billion.
Starwood trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol HOT -- and it has lived up to the label. The stock almost doubled last year and so far this year has gained 31 percent, closing at $48.06 on Friday. Those gains outpaced the broader bull market and other hotel stocks, though the company certainly basks in the glow of the industry's remarkable recovery. Last year, hotels racked up $12.5 billion in pretax profits, their best year ever and 40 percent more than their cumulative $8.7 billion profits over the last 14 years, according to Smith Travel Research, the lodging industry's unofficial scorekeeper.
Riding close on Mr. Sternlicht's heels is Mr. Nussbaum, the chairman and chief executive of Patriot American Hospitality in Dallas, the second-biggest hotel REIT, with a market capitalization of about $1.6 billion. With 65 hotels and resorts, many of them acquired in the last year, its portfolio of owned or leased properties will rise to 105 late this year upon completion of several agreements, including the billion-dollar acquisition of the Wyndham Hotel Corporation. One of Patriot American's properties, the Aristocrat Hotel in downtown Dallas, was the first hotel built by Conrad Hilton, in 1925.
Patriot American's stock is also sizzling. Its price more than doubled last year and has done even better so far this year, closing on Friday at $24.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
NOT everyone is enthusiastic about REIT's, especially those analysts who have seen them rise and fall.
"Lost in the euphoria of mergers and acquisitions is the inevitability of the business cycle," said Stanley Turkel, a hotel consultant. "While REIT's are brilliant vehicles of acquisition, they are public corporations with stringent and constant earnings requirements. How will they survive a downturn in the marketplace? Not too well, I believe."
But for now, REIT's are riding high. Asked whether Patriot American or Starwood would be the better investment, Barry Vinocur, editor of the Realty Stock Review, said both were "terrific." Having to choose between them, he added, "is like having to choose between your children." But he said he would probably give a slight edge to Starwood if it acquired Westin and proceeded to put its other hotels under the Westin banner.
In contrast to their more colorful early 20th-century counterparts -- Mr. Hilton, for example, was briefly married to Zsa Zsa Gabor -- both Mr. Nussbaum and Mr. Sternlicht are content to pull the strings in relative obscurity. While they are workaholics -- perhaps because they are workaholics -- both are content to avoid the limelight.
"I don't need my name on my hotels," Mr. Sternlicht said. "I get my satisfaction from the share price performance."
Moreover, the new moguls have been content to buy, rather than to build, their hotel empires. Most of the early hotel pioneers put their chains together from scratch, at least until the Depression's devastating aftermath resulted in a glut of solid if rundown hotels that could be picked up for next to nothing. Mr. Hilton's goal in the early 1920's was to put up a new hotel each year; outpacing his objective, he had built eight before the crash of 1929.
"He was able to make the kind of deals that, because of the incredible competition, are just virtually impossible to make today," said his son Barron Hilton, the chairman of the Hilton Hotels Corporation, who succeeded his father at the company's helm in 1966. As the elder Hilton built hotels around the world, "in exchange for putting up the working capital, he would get one-third of the profits, and the owners would get two-thirds," Barron Hilton said of his father's practices. "Those kind of deals just don't get done anymore." (The elder Hilton died in 1979.)
But if neither Mr. Sternlicht nor Mr. Nussbaum is exactly another Conrad Hilton, that is not to say the two men have led humdrum lives.
Mr. Sternlicht, a graduate of Brown University and Harvard Business School, led JMB Realty's unsuccessful effort to buy the Hilton hotel chain in the late 1980's. He also headed a team at JMB that analyzed the finances of Randsworth Trust P.L.C, a British real estate company, before JMB, together with a partnership of American pension funds, bought it in 1989. Randsworth's collapse two years later left shareholders holding the bag for more than $425 million. Interviewed at his office in Greenwich, Conn., Mr. Sternlicht said of that fiasco, "You learn a lot more from your failures than your successes."
Mr. Nussbaum is perhaps an even more improbable hotel mogul. After covering high school sports as a stringer for The New York Journal-American, he had visions of becoming a writer -- until, as a student at the State University of New York at Buffalo, he took a course in creative writing from John Barth, whose novels abound in word play, allegory and metaphor. "That humbled me," Mr. Nussbaum remembered.
So he abandoned fiction for Georgetown Law School, where his entrepreneurial bent emerged. He held a one-seventh interest with other law students in a nearby bar and grill and, with two other classmates, provided legal research for law firms in the Washington area.
"If it was over our heads," he said with a laugh, "we hired our professors."
SOON after graduation he began a 20-year career practicing real estate law. But by 1991, certain that real estate would soon rebound along with the American economy, Mr. Nussbaum decided it was time once more to test his entrepreneurial talent, this time on a larger scale. He formed the Patriot American Group with New York and Canadian investors, including William Mack, senior managing partner of the Mack Company and president of Apollo Real Estate Management Inc., and John H. Daniels, a co-founder of the Cadillac Fairview Corporation in Toronto.
Patriot American initially went shopping for the cut-rate jewels that had fallen into the hands of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Government agency, now defunct, that handled the savings and loan bailout of the late 1980's and early 1990's. Patriot American bought 26 office buildings and the Bourbon Orleans Hotel in New Orleans from the R.T.C. in 1992.
Over the next few years, the company acquired more hotels at bargain prices as banks, savings institutions, insurance companies and other lenders delightedly left a business they had entered -- literally by default -- during the recession that began in the late 1980's.
In 1995, Patriot American Group put the hotels into Patriot American Hospitality, whose initial public offering that year sold at $24 a share (the stock has since split) and raised more than $300 million. Today, the company's holdings include luxurious properties like the Tutwiler in Birmingham, Ala., the Tremont House in Boston and the Union Station Hotel in Nashville.
Mr. Sternlicht had financial backing from his own set of big financial players, starting Starwood six years ago with a $10 million investment from the Ziff publishing family and an identical infusion from the Burden family of New York, descendants of Cornelius Vanderbilt. Both families have since increased their initial investments substantially, and the Pritzker family of Chicago, which owns the Hyatt hotel chain, has also put up money.
At first, Mr. Sternlicht's properties consisted largely of thousands of multifamily garden apartments, most of them in the Southwest, bought at deep discount from the R.T.C. But as competitors jumped in and his small staff could not manage the apartments, he sold them to Sam Zell, the Chicago real estate giant, and turned his attention to hotels.
WHY hotels? Mr. Sternlicht said that while hotels were then out of favor with investors, "they had the best demand profile of any asset class, and construction financing for upscale hotels was hard to obtain."
As for Mr. Nussbaum, he said simply that what sparked his interest was that "a lot of good hotels were selling for 25 cents on the dollar."
Mr. Sternlicht's company, Starwood, is named for a community near Aspen, Colo., where the company was put together. In 1993, it bought 15 hotels from the Westinghouse Electric Corporation for about $85 million and the assumption of $180 million in debt. Today, Starwood's portfolio includes Ritz-Carltons, Sheratons, Hiltons and Hyatts as well as Days Inns and Holiday Inns.
What they lack in the earlier generation's flamboyance, Mr. Sternlicht and Mr. Nussbaum more than make up for in their understanding of modern finance -- in particular, REIT's.
A REIT, basically, is an investment pool, a way to raise money for real estate investments and, likewise, for people to diversify their real estate investments across a number of properties. In their early days, in the 1960's, REIT's existed mostly as mortgage holders, but in the 1980's they began to own property outright, often focusing on specific sectors like office buildings, apartments, malls or nursing homes, as well as hotels.
Today, about 300 REIT's with a combined market value of $70 billion, are publicly traded. Investors like them because they do not pay corporate income tax, and instead are required to distribute at least 95 percent of net income to shareholders. In addition, because they trade as stocks, they are much easier to get into or out of than limited partnerships or the direct ownership of properties.
In the hotel industry, REIT's are clearly where the action is. In the first six months of 1997, hotel REIT's raised about $1 billion in public stock offerings, up from $732 million in the corresponding period of 1996, according to Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm. By contrast, the capital raised by non-REIT hotel companies slumped in the first half of this year, to $1.2 billion, from $2 billion in the first half of 1996.
The rise of the REIT's "marked the first time that investing in the real estate side of the lodging industry did not mean having to tie up lots of money in an illiquid asset," said Bjorn Hanson, the chairman of the hospitality unit at Coopers & Lybrand.
Moreover, while still accounting for just 5 percent of all hotels, REIT's have vastly increased their holdings in the last four years, from 39 properties to 562. And analysts expect that number to continue to grow indefinitely.
Mr. Sternlicht and Mr. Nussbaum are a big reason for that increase.
Each had the prescience to link up with REIT's that, through a grandfather clause in a 1984 Federal law, are allowed to do what no other REIT can: manage as well as own property.
These entities are known as "paired share" REIT's, because they are allowed to own separate real estate and management companies (the "pair") that are traded as a single unit (the "share"). And there are only four of them in the nation.
Last October, Patriot American obtained the special status by buying the California Jockey Club and Bay Meadows Operating Company for $195 million. (Bay Meadows operates the Bay Meadows horse racing track in the San Francisco suburbs and leases the land from California Jockey.) Starwood did the same two years ago by taking control of Hotel Investors Trust, which had piled up nearly $200 million in debt and whose stock had sunk from about $25 a share in 1986 to less than $1 in 1994.
Patriot American and Starwood thus became the only two paired-share hotel REIT's -- and if that is a mouthful, it is also a huge competitive advantage.
Other REIT's, prohibited from actively managing the properties they own, must lease the properties to third parties or to management companies established by the REIT's officers and directors. But Patriot American and Starwood do not have to pay those management fees, and they get to keep the after-tax profits of their management companies. In acquiring Wyndham and Westin, respectively, the two hotel REIT's could use those established brand names as the management companies for many of their hotels, without having to pay anyone for the privilege, and they would have direct control of pricing and capital spending on maintenance and renovations.
In the view of Thomas P. McConnell, a director of Arthur Andersen's hospitality consulting practice, the rest of the industry has not fully grasped the impact of the two companies' new structures.
"A lot of people have been paying lip service to paired-shares," he said, "but I don't think they've really understood their full power until recently." He tempered his enthusiasm, though, by noting the market risks of the REIT structure, which is so tied to the day-to-day profit of a company's portfolio "that there's inherent volatility."
Both Patriot American and Starwood Lodging still have a long way to go before ranking with the Marriott Corporation, the industry standard, whose Host Marriott owns 84 hotels and whose Marriott International manages or franchises 1,400. And the budding magnates surely lack the Horatio Alger heritage of the industry's pioneers.
J. Willard Marriott, for example, rode the Utah range as a teen-ager, pistol at his side, tending his father's flocks of sheep and cattle. He married his college sweetheart, did mission work for the Mormon church and then opened his root beer stand on the same day that Charles Lindbergh began his flight across the Atlantic.
Conrad Hilton did not ride the Utah range, but as a young man he drove mule trains through the Southwest, sleeping under the stars and stopping at haciendas during the day to buy, sell and trade cattle, mohair and hides. He also played the piano for hire, managed a trio of female musicians and served in the Army in France in World War I. Once he looked on horrified as a partner was shot dead in a Texas hotel lobby by a drunken former partner of theirs, who for years afterward threatened to do the same to Mr. Hilton.
NEITHER Mr. Nussbaum nor Mr. Sternlicht has to look over his shoulder for quite the same reason, but both are clearly aiming to join the ranks of the giants.
"Our goal is to build a world-class hotel company," Mr. Nussbaum declared, expressing special pride in his recent $47 million acquisition of the two hotels and management company of Grand Heritage Hotels of Annapolis, Md., which specializes in independent, often older hotels that have aged gracefully.
Mr. Sternlicht says Starwood has slowed the pace of its acquisitions, trying to be more strategic. "If I have four hotels in Chicago, do I need a fifth?" he said rhetorically.
But in the next breath, he said, "I'd buy anything I can get in New York and Boston at a reasonable price, and we're also missing Miami."
After all, he added, "We're the fifth-largest hotel company, and we're aiming for No. 1."
 The map erroneously included some hotels managed by Wyndham, with whom Patriot American is merging, that will be sold before the merger is completed. It incorrectly excluded a smaller number of other hotels that Patriot American is acquiring in another deal. Because of an editing error, a few of Patriot's current hotel properties were located incorrectly on the map.
This corrected map omits a handful of hotels outside the 48 contiguous United States and one whose location the company says is confidential.

Long Way To Go
 Black and White in America.
 By Jonathan Coleman.
 451 pp. New York:
 Atlantic Monthly Press. $26.50. 
 It has become possible, in the last few years, to glimpse the emerging outlines of a kind of guilt-free zone of racial conversation. Black scholars like Randall Kennedy and Glenn Loury, and black journalists like William Raspberry and Stanley Crouch -- none of them, save perhaps Loury, conservative -- have very consciously laid down the bludgeon of racial accusation. This act of unilateral disarmament offers an invitation to liberal white scholars and journalists, accustomed to treading ever so gingerly, to think and write about vexing issues like poverty and crime and academic standards without looking over their shoulders at the racial proprieties. This ought to be an exhilarating invitation. But the impulse to see practically everything as an expression of racism is very deeply ingrained, in whites as well as blacks. It's an impulse, or a need, that provides an unintended second meaning to the title of Jonathan Coleman's book, "Long Way to Go."
Coleman is a white journalist, formerly with CBS News, who spent time in the early 1990's in Milwaukee, one of the most segregated and impoverished cities in the country. The mission that he set himself was simply to talk to everyone -- leaders and led, white and black -- and thus come to understand how, despite the heroic gains of the civil rights struggle, the economic and psychic gulf between the races could remain so vast. It's a serious and important task, and Coleman is a very conscientious guide, a Christian Pilgrim of the inner city. He has no ideology to vindicate; he does, however, come equipped with a set of conventional liberal attitudes.
At the very outset of his journey, Coleman arranges to meet with Michael McGee, an alderman and self-described revolutionary, and Jerrel Jones, an entrepreneur who is McGee's pal. Coleman gives McGee a respectful hearing as he talks of taking up arms, and he's disturbed when Jones declares that, no matter what his achievements, whites will always view him simply as "a nigger." But then he reflects that he was viewing the problem "through my lens, not Jones's. It was a mistake I would have to keep in mind as time went on, a mistake that in large part had to do with the unconsciousness of being white."
Our pilgrim turns out to be afflicted with a rather severe case of liberal guilt. Coleman insists on seeing McGee as an authentic, if deeply troubling, tribune of black opinion, and at one point he taxes Milwaukee's Mayor, John Norquist, with failing to conduct a dialogue with the alderman. Yet McGee strikes the reader as the kind of dangerous huckster who makes a career out of exploiting racial anger, and it comes as not much of a shock to learn at the end of the book that he has formed a friendship with the head of the White Aryan Resistance. Coleman seems to lack the language of condemnation; he writes that it was "disappointing to hear him talk of sabotage."
Coleman is so persuaded of the salience of race and the ubiquity of racism that sometimes he fails to notice his own evidence to the contrary. One of McGee's constituents, Maron Alexander, a proud but hard-pressed member of the black working class, tells the author "that when he died, he wanted his headstone to reflect that he was an American, not a black American, that as far as he was concerned way too much was made of race." Coleman passes over this profession of faith in a non-racial identity without comment. But when, sadly, the Alexanders' daughter, Tennille, is arrested for bringing a gun to school to impress gang members, Coleman observes: "The same stuff went on in the suburbs, but . . . you simply didn't hear about it or read about it. . . . It was another form of inequity, another way in which white privilege quietly exerted itself." This is, of course, untrue, and the reader has to wonder if the Alexanders themselves would agree; perhaps they would say that Tennille had fallen in with a bad crowd. Coleman is so desperate not to blame Tennille that he practically denies her the power of individual agency -- a form of condescension that borders on what Jim Sleeper describes as "liberal racism" in his recent book of the same name.
At times, Coleman moves well beyond the platitudes. The most intriguing character in "Long Way to Go" is Howard Fuller, who became superintendent of Milwaukee's schools while Coleman was doing his research. A former black nationalist, Fuller opposes busing to achieve integration, and advocates an all-black school with an Afrocentric curriculum. He is a figure of stoical dignity and unshakable commitment -- a race man, as Coleman writes. And yet by accepting the superintendent's job, and by trying to enlist white businessmen in his campaign to reform a dismal school system, Fuller becomes a target for black leaders who hold the views that he himself once did. He's accused of selling out when he fires a black principal.
And there's an additional wrinkle: Fuller champions a referendum to increase funding for the schools, and he presents the issue as a test of moral resolve and transracial commitment. The referendum loses by a 3-to-1 margin, and Coleman finds both blacks and dedicated white educators who have voted against it, reasoning that the money will be wasted unless the system is reformed first. The loss of consensus on social spending, in other words, is not simply a matter of "racial fatigue," to use one of Coleman's favorite phrases.
Coleman seeks out both black and white dissenters from racial orthodoxy and gives them a fair hearing. And yet he is always pulled back to the view, or perhaps the preconception, that the solution to black poverty and isolation lies in the conversion of white hearts. This leads to several passages so painful that one almost yearns for the likes of Derrick Bell, who has proposed a "racism tax" as an alternative to futile hortatory efforts.
Coleman spends a good deal of time visiting a therapy group, Beyond Racism, in which whites sit in a circle and unpack "an invisible weightless knapsack" of the 44 "unearned assets" that come with their skin color. He identifies strongly with a social worker named John Fitzgerald, who becomes almost obsessed with the task of confronting his own unacknowledged racism. Finally the strain becomes too much, and Fitzgerald provides an unexpected lesson in one of the dangers of racial guilt. In his journal, he writes exhaustedly, "Do I want to be perceived as the person who challenges norms -- who reminds people always of their prejudices -- who challenges each and every system?" Our pilgrim, however, draws an entirely different moral. If even Fitzgerald finds that "his enjoyment of the status quo" outweighs the risk of changing hearts, Coleman writes, "then there was ample reason to despair that change would ever come."
Fitzgerald is almost a parody of the author himself: the awareness of purported racism ties him in such knots that he can neither trust his own reactions nor formulate new ones. But we understand the sense of taboo that governs both writer and character. Any reasonably sensitive white person who has written about, or even talked about, the situation of blacks is aware of this taboo; perhaps the same is true of any member of a dominant class writing about a group that that class has oppressed. One's hand is stayed by the knowledge of innumerable past hurts and misdeeds. The recognition of those wrongs, along with the acceptance of the sense of collective responsibility -- guilt -- that comes with recognition, is a precondition to entering the discussion.
But it is only a precondition; and over time racial guilt has produced intellectual paralysis, placing blacks, as Shelby Steele has argued, in the role of helpless victims and making liberal whites perform the intricate pirouettes of euphemism and tact to which Coleman is prone. We need to say that racism remains a powerful force in American life but that it may no longer be the principal cause of black immiseration.
Coleman admits to genuine bewilderment about the solution to persistent black poverty. Most of the admirable characters in his book feel the same way; only the charlatans have easy answers. What apparently has not occurred to Coleman, though, is that the obsessive focus on racism and injury, the vigilant patrolling of the borders of racial identity, is part of the problem rather than part of the solution. He is absolutely right in thinking that ordinary people need to break out of the shell of racial isolation and talk to one another. But perhaps they need to talk about something other than race.

America in Black
 and White
 One Nation, Indivisible.
 By Stephan Thernstrom and
 Abigail Thernstrom.
 704 pp. New York:
 Simon & Schuster. $32.50. 
 The baseline for this book is "An American Dilemma," by Gunnar Myrdal. Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom's very first and very last paragraphs are reverential recapitulations of Myrdal. Plainly their ambition is to produce a survey of race relations that is so large and authoritative that it changes the way the issue is understood, as Myrdal's did.
In one sense, the two books can't fairly be compared. "An American Dilemma," which was published in 1944, was based upon extensive firsthand field work, mostly in the Deep South, while "America in Black and White" is done from work in the library, from reading secondary sources. Politically, however, there is a parallel. "An American Dilemma" was underwritten by a liberal foundation (the Carnegie Corporation) and written by a scholar with a mission in mind: eliminating the Jim Crow system in the South. "America in Black and White" was financed by a congeries of conservative foundations (Bradley, Olin, Smith Richardson, Earhart, Carthage), and aims to bring down affirmative action and most other policies whose stated goal is to give special help to African-Americans.
Like Myrdal, the Thernstroms are whites with a history of engagement in issues of social justice. Abigail Thernstrom has long been one of the country's leading opponents of affirmative action, especially in the drawing of electoral districts. Stephan Thernstrom, a history professor at Harvard, became the object of black student protests in 1988 as a result of a remark he made about the black family in an ethnic history course he was teaching. He later complained that he was hung out to dry by the Harvard administration and stopped teaching the course. Since then the incident has been used, in Dinesh D'Souza's "Illiberal Education" and elsewhere, as a prime example of the depredations visited upon universities by the forces of political correctness.
To assume the Myrdal mantle means speaking in a calm, clear, generous voice, but "America in Black and White" does this only intermittently. It is irresistibly tempting to discern a split personality in a volume with two authors; whether or not that is the reason, this book veers back and forth between two sensibilities, one reasonable and large-spirited, the other pugnacious and angry to the point of occasional bitterness and sarcasm. The Thernstroms' treatment of Myrdal himself provides a small example: while they invoke him as a patron saint in some places, elsewhere they convincingly take him down a peg or two. Martin Luther King Jr. gets the same treatment: portrayed sometimes as a hero with a simple, magnificent dream of a color-blind society, other times as a savvy, borderline-cynical media politician.
"America in Black and White" does have a clear, consistent line of argument, although the variability of tone vitiates it somewhat. The Thernstroms begin with a long historical section, taking up a third of the book, about the South during the age of legal segregation. It is meant to remind us how almost unimaginably bad things were for most black Americans until not all that long ago.
The Thernstroms' main point, though, is that the civil rights movement and the Federal Government intervention it brought about deserve far less credit for African-American progress than they are ordinarily given. In the authors' view, World War II, not civil rights legislation, was what firmly set black America on a better course. The economy boomed, and millions of blacks left the realm of Jim Crow for a much better life in the North. The Thernstroms also use polling data (which they rely upon heavily throughout this book) to make a case that a wholesale improvement in white attitudes toward blacks was under way before the 1960's.
The main civil rights milestones -- the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954, the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act -- get the Thernstroms' wholehearted approval. But they present all the Government's efforts aimed specifically at improving conditions in black America -- as opposed to guaranteeing the basic rights of citizenship -- as a terrible mistake, producing no gains for blacks and great resentment (wholly justified, in their opinion) by whites. In area after area -- especially affirmative action -- the Thernstroms sketch a bombed-out landscape of liberal failure. If we would abandon these race- and results-conscious efforts, they say, we could resume our former progress toward a healthier black America and better race relations.
It seems to me that most books on race relations, by authors black and white, liberal and conservative, implicitly claim to be written from the black point of view -- that is, they present themselves as being concerned solely with what's good for blacks. "America in Black and White" has less than the usual complement of this quality. It insists throughout on a more benign view of white sentiments and behavior than is customary. In their conclusion the Thernstroms say that "too much remains" of white racism. But this is inconsistent with the tone of the rest of the book; not many pages earlier, they were declaring that white "haters have become a tiny remnant with no influence in any important sphere of American life" and that "few whites are now racists." To the extent that whites are race-conscious, they say, "that has been one of the regrettable results of public policies that stress racial identity."
The Thernstroms treat black racism, on the other hand, as a much more serious problem. Since the late 1960's, they maintain, "the balance of power in racial confrontations has shifted," and what now dominates is a dynamic of "black anger" and "white surrender." The voices in black America that they hear most loudly and quote from most often are those of the race-man camp, expressing the kind of sentiments that strike them as "tribalistic effusions." There is much Derrick Bell in the text, and little William Julius Wilson.
Whites who are liberal on race issues appear here in cartoon form as radical-chic types who find black rage appealing, or as cringing, guilty softies. White supporters of affirmative action embrace "policies built on deference to black victimization through which they can display their racial virtue." When the Thernstroms take the trouble to present calmly a specific counterargument to their position and then dismantle it, as they do with the 1968 report of the Kerner Commission on urban riots, the result is fresh and interesting. But usually they are content to give a version of the other side that makes it sound merely idiotic. For example, they summarize a statement about violence in schools from an official of the A.C.L.U. thus: "So when a student won't turn off his blaring boom box in class . . . and throws a chair at another student, it's the school's fault for not having provided him with 'meaningful education.' "
Some readers undoubtedly will find the Thernstroms' version of American race relations to ring true, and will feel that their frequent citations of poll results cinch the case. But limning racial attitudes is not hard science. I found myself consistently thinking that the Thernstroms were a few degrees away from a sure, comfortable sense of the state of racial sentiments. "The white supremacist South of old was rapidly dying by the 1960's," they write, but that doesn't call forth the place where I grew up. When President John F. Kennedy was shot, spontaneous cheering broke out among my fellow fourth graders in a New Orleans private school, which was a reflection of months of parental complaining about the proposed Civil Rights Act. With regard to contemporary America, I think they overplay the importance of the utter-bleakness strain in the public conversation about race. Is it really "one of the best-kept secrets of American life today" that "more than 4 out of 10 African-American citizens" along with two-thirds of whites, "consider themselves members of the middle class"?
Interviewing people in the opposition camp might have made the Thernstroms more empathetic, or at least better attuned to nuance. As it is, they are richly understanding about one side of the racial and political divide, and often dismissive or dense about the other. They describe the verdict of the black-majority jury in the O. J. Simpson case, angrily, as "in short, another instance in which a court was overwhelmed by the politics of racial grievance." Earlier in the book, though, in a discussion of the possible biases of white juries in Georgia, they treat the phenomenon of racial jury nullification in a strikingly more forgiving way: "It is certainly not implausible that white prosecutors, judges and jurors in Georgia found it easier to identify with white victims than with African-Americans, and viewed crimes with African-American victims differently from crimes whose victims were their fellow whites. The capacity to feel empathy across racial lines is in short supply today." Another example of their reductive treatment of positions they disagree with is their handling of black nationalism, a venerable, complicated, important aspect of African-American life that comes across in these pages as completely pernicious, and also marginal.
The Thernstroms' dislike of the other side in the race-relations debate is so strong that it regularly trumps the intellectual consistency of their argument. When they are criticizing aggressive, results-oriented enforcement of the Voting Rights Act, they present it as a betrayal of the simple ideals of the mid-1960's: "In 1965, access to the local restaurant, the local hospital and the polling booth was the aim that informed the whole civil rights movement." But elsewhere, when they are trying to reduce the credit the civil rights movement gets for America's racial progress, they paint quite a different (and more accurate) picture, observing that as early as 1964 the movement "was splintering." They heatedly deny that affirmative action has helped blacks economically ("manifestly absurd"), but also say that the number of blacks in affirmative action programs is much too high. Can none of these blacks be benefiting from their undeserved good fortune?
The same phenomenon is at work in a larger and more important way in the Thernstroms' attitude toward the state of black America. The sincerity of their desire for better race relations and better conditions for African-Americans can't be doubted. Although their overall stance is that things are much better in black America than the guilty liberals and self-appointed civil rights leaders want you to know, they also, when trying to show that Government programs haven't worked, haul out many, many alarming statistics about the racial gap. Black crime is much too high, black poverty is stuck where it was in the early 1970's, black educational performance continues to lag far behind white, most black children don't grow up with two parents at home. The Thernstroms remind us of all this when it serves their purposes.
A book that truly succeeded in putting forth a sweeping, inspiring new vision of how to solve the problem of race in America would, after making us aware of these terrible conditions, propose to do something about them. The Thernstroms, after insisting, lengthily, that past liberal remedies have been ineffective and, briefly, that "black poverty impoverishes us all," do not. They propose instead, with real eloquence, toughness and conviction, that "it is on the ground of individuality that blacks and whites can come together." That looks more like an argument against affirmative action than the second coming of Gunnar Myrdal.

HEADLINE: In Newport, the Many-Faceted Legacy of Doris Duke

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH ABBOTT 

DATELINE: NEWPORT, R.I.

 BODY:
IN her $1.2 billion will, Doris Duke left her 40-room oceanfront mansion here, Rough Point, to a nonprofit foundation with instructions that it become a museum.
That bequest alone has been hailed in Newport, a city whose economy depends on tourist attractions like the mansions that line its famous 10-mile Ocean Drive. 
 But Miss Duke's real estate legacy to Newport is far greater than Rough Point.
She also left two other museums -- the Samuel Whitehorne House in Newport, a restored circa 1811 Federal-style building that houses a collection of furniture by Newport craftsmen, and Prescott Farm, an assemblage of Colonial-era buildings, including a working windmill, on eight acres in neighboring Middletown, R.I.
There is more.
In 1968, when Newport was a somewhat grimy Navy town despite its famed Newport cottages, Miss Duke formed the nonprofit Newport Restoration Foundation. Its purpose was to recover the city's rich architectural heritage. Over the next 15 years or so, the foundation restored 83 properties, most of them houses dating back to Colonial times. Rents and contributions from the Duke estate support the foundation's work.
Among local residents the restorations are known simply as Duke houses and they are highly desirable rentals. Not only are they beautifully restored, but they are also impeccably maintained by workmen, who reproduce historic moldings and other woodwork in a Newport mill Miss Duke opened for that purpose.
Not insignificantly, rents in the Duke houses have traditionally been lower than Newport's rents, which are high for Rhode Island. They range from $750 for a one-bedroom house to $1,900 or so for houses with four and five bedrooms and several full baths.
By comparison, most decent one-bedroom houses in Newport start at $1,000 a month.
"We don't advertise," said Arthur Murphy, the foundation's lawyer. "We haven't had to." Only a few Duke houses become available every year and there is a waiting list, Mr. Murphy added.
The reclusive Miss Duke took her Newport restoration work seriously. Until her death in 1993, she personally supervised the smallest details. Her philosophy was to respect the historical integrity of a house, but make it livable, too. Thus, all the homes have modern plumbing and baths even though most of them were built in the 1800's. All of them have working fireplaces.
"Miss Duke called all the shots until she died," said Mr. Murphy. "She decided what houses would be redone over the years, what colors they would be."
On a recent drive through the city's Point section -- an area that Mr. Murphy said used to be a "slum," but thanks largely to Duke's effort is now mostly revived -- painters were touching up a Duke house using a vibrant blue. Mr. Murphy slowed the car, rolled down the window, and asked if the color was correct.
"Miss Duke's favorite," the painter called back. "She called it California blue."
Was such a blue used in Colonial times? Research shows it was, said Daniel Snydacker, executive director of the Newport Historical Society.
Miss Duke made some historical mistakes in her restoration, Mr. Snydacker said. For instance, some historians have questioned the fact that she moved many of the houses around the city and, in a few cases, even brought houses to Newport from as far away as New Jersey. "But overall she was very good," Mr. Snydacker said.
He credited Miss Duke with restoring much of Newport's streetscape to its original character without destroying anything of historic value in the process. "She took the preservation of Colonial houses in Newport to a heroic level," he said.
In the late 1960's, there were others working to preserve Newport's architectural heritage, notably Operation Clapboard, a grassroots organization, and the Preservation Society of Newport County, the group that now manages many of the city's opulent Gilded Age mansions. "But Miss Duke had the drive and the vision to take it the next level," Mr. Syndacker said.
NOT to mention the resources. As heiress to a tobacco and utilities fortune amassed by her father, James Buchanon Duke, Duke was considered one of the world's wealthiest women throughout her life.
"She made Newport what it is," said Kay Norton, who used to live in one Duke house and now rents another, where she and her husband, Aylward, run an Oriental art gallery.
It makes Mrs. Norton angry to hear tour guides note the more lurid aspects of Miss Duke's life, yet fail to mention her extraordinary architectural achievement in Newport. "If Doris Duke hadn't come in, we wouldn't have the tourism we have today," Mrs. Norton declared.
The tenants in the Duke houses are an eclectic group that has been handpicked over the years by Benjamin Reed, a close associate of Miss Duke's who ran the foundation until last April, when a stroke put him into a nursing home. Mr. Reed carefully screened tenants to insure they respected Miss Duke's restoration effort.
"They know more about us than our childen do," Mrs. Norton said with a laugh.
Tenants must abide by several esthetic restrictions. Among them are rules forbidding air-conditioning units in the front of a house or placing a barbecue grill too close to it. Pets are allowed on a case-by-case basis, partly because Miss Duke loved animals.
Indeed, Miss Duke was famous in Newport for keeping a llama and Alsatian hounds on the grounds at Rough Point.
"We very definitely want people who will care for the house," said Mr. Murphy, who is filling in for Mr. Reed until his successor is appointed.
"They want people who will treat them like antiques," said Timothy O'Shea, who rented a Duke house on Thames Street, with his wife, Beth, until a new job recently forced the couple to move to Boston.
"It's the best," Mr. O'Shea, said of renting a Duke house. "My wife is sick about the fact that we had to move."
"I still get calls from people asking if I can help them move up the waiting list," said Mr. Snydacker. The restored houses have attracted interesting and sophisticated people to Newport, who have helped to make the city more cosmopolitan, he said.
Miss Duke's legacy doesn't stop in Newport, of course. In addition to Rough Point, she left one of her other five estates, Shangri-La in Hawaii, to become a museum. And she left the bulk of her fortune to foundations charged with furthering her passionate interests in art, wildlife, historic restoration and other causes.
A battle over her will didn't negate Miss Duke's wishes, but it did keep the Duke property in limbo until May 1996, when her estate was finally settled. In Newport, things are still somewhat up in the air because of Mr. Reed's stroke, but Mr. Murphy outlined some plans for the future. These include raising the rents on many of the Duke houses.
"Some are fine, but some haven't been touched in years," Mr. Murphy said.
Some day in the future, although it is not clear when, tourists will be able to visit Rough Point, the estate Duke called home most summers.
Built in 1889, the mansion houses an extensive collection of Chinese porcelains, rugs, paintings and other art, which Miss Duke amassed over the years.
And the Newport Restoration Foundation hopes to continue Miss Duke's work in Newport by buying and restoring more houses, Mr. Murphy said. It also plans to enlarge Prescott Farm and make it more of a working enterprise. Why do that?, he was asked.
"I think it is one of the visions Miss Duke had for it," Mr. Murphy said.

Thousands Gather To Honor Mother Teresa
Thousands of Indians of all faiths and classes filed past the body of Mother Teresa in Calcutta. The glass-enclosed bier of the nun, who died on Friday, had been placed on public view in the quiet convent chapel where she entered religious service in India nearly 70 years ago. The demonstration of respect and homage to her memory was expected to last a week. A1
 
Grieving Continues for Diana
The day after Diana's funeral, it seemed as if Britain could not stop grieving. If anything, the lines of people waiting to pay their respects, write their thoughts in condolence books or light candles at the sites associated with the late Princess of Wales were longer than they were last week. A10 

Lawyers close to the case said investigators were searching for the driver of a car that might have been trying to slow down the Mercedes carrying Diana on the night she died so that the photographers pursuing her on motorcycles could take her picture. A10
 
Albright Prepares for Mideast
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright is to make her first official trip to the Middle East on Tuesday. Senior American officials said she would read the riot act to Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, about cracking down on terrorism. They said she would also press Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to take steps to restore mutual confidence with the Palestinians. A1
 
Debate Over Israelis in Lebanon
A simmering debate over whether Israel should keep troops in southern Lebanon gained new strength after 12 Israeli commandos were killed deep in Lebanese territory on Friday. Another Israeli soldier was killed yesterday in southern Lebanon, where Israel maintains what it describes as a buffer zone against attacks by guerilla groups. A7
 
China Dims Panama's Spotlight
China succeeded in drastically reducing the scope of a conference in Panama on the 20th anniversary of the Panama Canal treaties. Many business leaders and heads of state stayed away after Panama stumbled into the bitter dispute between China and Taiwan. The outcome was an embarrassing and politically costly setback for President Ernesto Perez Balladares. A3
 
Moscow Celebrates Itself
The City of Moscow began a three-day extravaganza to celebrate its 850th anniversary, hauling out circus animals, dancers, musicians, and pop stars. Millions of Russians attended the festival, which honored the city, but also served as a platform for the political ambitions of Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who climbed on stage and rang a giant golden bell.

The Tiniest Are Left Behind In AIDS Drug Revolution
Eighteen months ago, when a new class of drugs called protease inhibitors brought unprecedented improvements in treatment for people with H.I.V., a fresh sense of optimism swept over patients and doctors; for many, the new drugs, when used in combination with older antiviral medications, seemed to transform AIDS from a terminal illness into a chronic, treatable disease. Yet experts now agree that children are not receiving nearly the same benefit as adults. A1
 
Warning About Plutonium
A former emergency-preparedness operations officer at the Kennedy Space Center, who was involved in the launching of two spacecraft that carried plutonium, criticized NASA for its plan to launch the Cassini mission's spacecraft, which uses plutonium batteries. He said that an accident involving the craft, which is to study Saturn, could expose thousands or perhaps millions of people to plutonium, a potentially deadly radioactive element, and the risk of cancer. A12
 
Helms to Fight Back on Weld
A spokesman for Senator Jesse Helms said the Senator would publicly defend his refusal to grant a hearing on the nomination of a fellow Republican, William F. Weld, left, to be Ambassador to Mexico. The spokesman's comments came after Mr. Weld asserted on a television program that it was "not the American way" for a single senator to bar a hearing for an ambassadorial nominee. A17
 
A Deadly Link to the Past
Richard Keech, who is to go to trial today in Long Beach, Calif., on a charge of first-degree murder, plans to offer this defense: the aftereffects of his World War II experiences as a prisoner of the Japanese had a hand in his killing of his son-in-law. "I snapped," Mr. Keech said in an interview. "I was afraid for my life. I thought I was back in the prison camp, and I was about to be beaten to death." A12
 
Bay Area Railroad Strike
The San Francisco Bay Area's commuter railroad was shut down by a strike. With a breakdown in negotiations, both sides said a speedy resolution appeared unlikely. The strike could paralyze traffic on the already overburdened bridges and highways that link San Francisco, Oakland and the suburbs. A12

Auto-Insurance Premiums Stoke Anger in New Jersey
State Senator James E. McGreevey, the Democratic candidate for governor in New Jersey, has tapped into voters' anger over high auto insurance premiums and forced the re-election campaign of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman to recast its strategy and do battle. Until recent polls showed Mr. McGreevey making inroads against the Republican Governor, Mrs. Whitman's aides thought her campaign needed only to remind a complacent electorate of the state's strong economy and of her record of cutting taxes.

HEADLINE: ALBRIGHT PLANNING SOME TOUGH TALK TO ARAFAT ON TRIP

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Under pressure from Congress and domestic American politics, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright will head to the Middle East on Tuesday ready to read the riot act to Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, about cracking down on terrorism, senior American officials said today.
She must insure that Mr. Arafat commits himself wholly and publicly to the pursuit of peace with Israel "and stops trying to have it both ways," a senior official said. But she must also insure that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel "does not use security as a pretext" to avoid talking about Israel's own responsibility for the breakdown in mutual confidence with the Palestinians and the larger Arab world. 
 But Ms. Albright's first official trip to the Middle East also has raised regional concerns that a heavy-handed public defense of Mr. Netanyahu can only harm, the officials said.
With the negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel in tatters and the chance of a comprehensive Middle East peace fading, the United States is facing the prospect that the coalition it built after the Persian Gulf war to contain both Iraq and Iran is also fraying.
The Saudi Crown Prince, Abdullah, concerned about a rise in Islamic fundamentalist anger at home, has told the United States that Saudi Arabia, "under the current conditions," cannot possibly attend the American-sponsored Middle East economic summit meeting, to be held in mid-November in Doha, Qatar, the officials said.
The Syrians have already said they will not attend, and if the Saudis also boycott the meeting, so may many of the small, wealthy and moderate Persian Gulf states. The meeting, only in its fourth year, includes an Israeli delegation. The meetings symbolize the American vision of a peaceful, cooperative Middle East concentrating on trade and mutual interests rather than on recrimination and suicide bombers .
These concerns help explain why Ms. Albright will also travel to Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia and possibly Lebanon and has left her itinerary open-ended. "She has no intention of shuttling in the Middle East," a senior official said. "But she's got a lot to do out there."
For Ms. Albright, this trip presents her greatest public challenge so far as Secretary of State.
Success on this trip has not been precooked, and it will be hard even to define. Her aides are already saying she "is not a magician." But after months of hesitation about the right moment to make her first official trip to the Middle East, she finds herself condemned to plunge in now, when the temperature is hottest and the leaders on both sides seem least able to bend.
A senior Administration official acknowledges that it will bring an easy success in American political terms if she yells loudly at Mr. Arafat to arrest Palestinian extremists and to crack down on Hamas instead of kissing its leaders. Everyone from Mr. Netanyahu and House Speaker Newt Gingrich to the liberal Democratic Senator from Connecticut, Joseph Lieberman, have pressed her to do that. But that will not be sufficient, the senior official said.
Not only must she press Mr. Arafat, and Mr. Netanyahu as well, to meet their responsibilities toward peace but she must also bear in mind the concerns and interests of America's moderate Arab allies, as Jordan's King Hussein and Egypt's President, Hosni Mubarak, tried to enunciate them today in their meeting with Mr. Arafat in Cairo. In a statement, they urged Israel to refrain from actions alien to "the spirit of the peace" -- as Ms. Albright did in a policy address a month ago.
They urged Mr. Netanyahu to put into effect all the clauses of the interim Oslo accords, which he suspended on Friday, demanding Palestinian compliance with obligations for security cooperation first. Those accords include a troop withdrawal from the West Bank originally due today and another due within a year.
How Ms. Albright deals with Mr. Netanyahu's suspension of Israel's obligations under the accords, even if the suspension is presumably temporary, will be closely watched throughout the Middle East.
She must also try, as another senior official said, to get agreement from both Israelis and Palestinians on American ideas that could "clear a pathway to accelerated final-status talks" on a comprehensive peace settlement between them.
Despite the new carnage and the emphasis on Mr. Arafat's security obligations, "it is also a reality that she has to go out there and engage on both issues" -- security and peace, the official said.
Ms. Albright will reinforce Mr. Clinton's declaration in telephone conversations with Mr. Arafat last week that he must take "unilateral and direct action against Hamas," the official said, adding that "our message to Arafat is that there can be no more attempts at co-opting Hamas, and no more kisses" of its leaders.
While the Palestinians have been working with the Israelis, with an American C.I.A. officer as mediator and witness, to identify the key Hamas and Islamic Holy War members engaged in planning or carrying out terrorism, the official said, "Now we want the Palestinian Authority to arrest them."
But movement toward peace is vital to larger American interests, the official stressed, saying, "Progess on the peace process is important for us to do many things, and there's no question that it's more difficult to do other things without progress on peace."
Those "other things," he said, "are containing Iran and Iraq."
Another senior American official said, "There is a serious concern that our ability to confront the enemies of peace -- Iran and Iraq -- is underminded by weakness and stalemate in the peace process."
That concern is sharpened by the election of a more moderate Iranian President, Ayatollah Mohammed Khatami, though he does not control Iranian foreign policy. Mr. Khatami will be the host of this year's Islamic summit meeting, in Teheran in early December, just after the Doha meeting, and American officials do not want their moderate Arab allies to show up in Teheran after boycotting the meeting in Doha.
Administration officials have told the Saudis that their presence in Doha matters, and that "there's lots of time to change the atmosphere between now and November," a senior official said, adding, "But we have to start to change it now."
Edward P. Djerejian, former American Ambassador to Syria and Israel, says he thinks that some of the regional shifts are tactical and do not negate fundamental conflicts between Syria and Iraq or Iran and Iraq.
"But if this stagnation in the peace process worsens, we may see more of an anti-Israel realignment, with more of the pan-Arab and nationalistic rhetoric we thought we put behind us, as Arab countries move to stave off internal pressures from Islamic groups," Mr. Djerejian said.
American strategies must respond to those internal changes in Arab societies as well as to the deterioration in the peace negotiations that worsens them. "We can't just rely on military policies and deterrence," he said. "What good is the fleet if the threat comes from within?"

HEADLINE: Growth of Machine Tool Orders Slows on Pullback in Midwest

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Machine tool orders by American manufacturers rose 4.5 percent in July compared with a year earlier, a slowdown from the blistering growth rates of earlier months, according to an industry survey. Moreover, July's orders were down 13.4 percent from the preceding month.
The data showed a particularly strong pullback in the Midwest, home to the nation's big auto makers and other important industries. 
 Machine tools are used to make products ranging from home appliances to airplanes. A rise in orders suggests manufacturers are confident enough about the economy to expand or upgrade their factories.
Total orders in July were estimated at $666 million, compared with $637 million in July 1996 and down sharply from June's estimate of $769 million, the survey said.
The report is to be released today by the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association and the Association for Manufacturing Technology, two industry trade groups.
In the first half of 1997, orders were up 19.7 percent from the corresponding period a year earlier. After adding July's data, year-to-date spending rose 15.9 percent.
"Steady capital investment from the U.S. manufacturing sector has driven machine tool orders to exceed last year's impressive growth," Ralph Nappi, president of the Association for Manufacturing Technology, said in a statement yesterday. "One concern facing manufacturing, however, is the shortage of a technically skilled work force."
Orders in the Midwest fell 22 percent in July compared with a year earlier and were down 25 percent from June. For the seven months through July, orders rose just 2.2 percent, making it by far the weakest region.
The biggest growth in July was in the West, usually a quiet area for manufacturing, where spending rose 53 percent from a year earlier. The Northeast was next with 25 percent growth, followed by the South and Central regions at 23 percent.
Export data showed that foreign demand for American machine tools slipped 62 percent from July 1996, to $48.3 million. However, orders were still up 16 percent through the first seven months of 1997.

HEADLINE: An Idea Not Yet Born, But a Custody Fight

BYLINE: By GEANNE ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
Everywhere Evan Brown goes, he brings with him, nestled in the gray matter of his brain, an asset his former employer demands: the record of what may be a multimillion-dollar software system that could update old, outdated computer software, making it usable on modern computer systems.
Two questions about this piece of intellectual property are keeping lawyers busy. To whom do Mr. Brown's thoughts belong? And, if they do not belong to him, can the owner of Mr. Brown's thinking force him to hand it over? 
"In some ways it's quite intrusive," Mr. Brown observed dryly of his closely watched legal case.
The ranks of those staking claims in Mr. Brown's potential invention -- which he said could save companies billions of dollars -- are swelling. Among the parties: Mr. Brown; the DSC Communications Corporation, his former employer, which dismissed and sued him in April after he refused to divulge his ideas, and Lance Flores, a computer programmer who says he may be the original thinker of the thoughts at issue and is now seeking to intervene in the lawsuit.
Even Mr. Brown's lawyer, Richard A. Sayles, of Sayles & Lidji in Dallas, has a stake. He said he agreed to take the case -- which is scheduled for a jury trial in a Collin County, Tex., district court in November -- on a contingency basis with his fee tied to Mr. Brown's profits from the software solution. "Believe me, I've asked him if it works," Mr. Sayles said.
Mr. Brown's case would be a fairly typical trade-secret dispute -- except that his purported solution has apparently never been articulated. There are no notebooks, computer files or audio tapes to help establish whether it works or to whom it belongs.
Moreover, there is no way anyone can seize custody of the ideas without Mr. Brown's cooperation. Mr. Brown has already refused to comply with orders from two county court judges to disclose his ideas.
"There is no case like this," said Roger Milgrim, a partner at Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker, and a leading authority on trade-secret law. Mr. Brown's case, in Mr. Milgrim's view, "addresses the possible limits of judicial power."
If Mr. Brown is ordered to disclose and declines, "What can a court do?" Mr. Milgrim asked.
DSC has sought to have Mr. Brown held in contempt, but so far a Texas appeals court has declined to do so.
Mr. Brown, 45, a self-proclaimed "computer geek" who now lives in Plano, Tex., has been a software tinkerer for some time. In the late 1960's, while in high school, he wrote a program to calculate square roots at a time when calculators were not available, he said.
He majored in computer science at Texas A & M University and began working as a computer programmer during college. After years as an independent consultant, he joined DSC in April 1987.
About one week later, he said, he was told to sign a written agreement requiring that he communicate to DSC and grant the company rights to any "inventions" relating to the telecommunications computer company's business -- or suggested by his work for the company.
According to George Brunt, the general counsel of DSC: "Our technology is very valuable to us. We're under an obligation to our shareholders to protect our technology and not let it walk out the door."
Indeed, DSC takes a broad view of its ownership of employee inventions. "All of our employees sign that agreement," Mr. Brunt said. "It's a condition of employment."
Mr. Brown argues that his software-translation idea was 80 percent complete before he ever joined DSC. He also thought that his agreement with the company covered only telecommunications inventions, not the slowly coalescing idea he first conceived in El Paso in 1975, while visiting a friend who posed the software problem.
It was at a 1991 gathering of the Dallas-Fort Worth Unix Users Group, which Mr. Brown defined as "a bunch of computer geeks that get together," that he first met Lance Flores -- the man now trying to intervene in DSC's suit.
The two discussed the problems of trying to convert old software. Mr. Flores said he had an approach using artificial intelligence. Mr. Brown said he urged Mr. Flores to bring the idea to DSC, which was struggling with its own need to convert old software. But DSC rejected Mr. Flores's proposal.
DSC representatives said they had not verified that a meeting with Mr. Flores took place.
Mr. Brown said he periodically mentally revisited the problem of finding an algorithm for a software program that could convert old computer code into modern source codes. In March 1996, he said, while coming home from a long weekend, he envisioned the remaining 20 percent of the solution.
He approached DSC to ask for permission to develop his idea independently of DSC. Initially, Mr. Brown said, DSC executives were agreeable. But then a senior executive realized the idea could benefit DSC. In exchange for his developing the idea, the company offered Mr. Brown up to $2 million of any money that DSC and Motorola, a big customer, would save, as well as 50 percent of profits from sale of the software to third parties, according to Mr. Brown.
Mr. Brown said he asked for $5 million and 50 percent. In early 1997, according to Mr. Brown, DSC stopped the discussions, informed Mr. Brown that DSC owned his ideas outright, demanded that he disclose them, and when he refused, dismissed him on the spot. DSC then sued him for breach of contract.
According to Mr. Brunt, the general counsel, discussions about increasing Mr. Brown's compensation fell apart because of a threat by Mr. Brown that he would try to sell his idea to other companies.
Mr. Brunt said, "If a janitor came up with a method of cleaning a hardwood floor suggested to him by his work in cleaning a DSC hardwood floor, technically the idea belongs to DSC."
For Mr. Sayles, Mr. Brown's lawyer, DSC's position is an assault on individual rights. "Does the company own your thoughts 24 hours a day?" he asked. "That's what they're claiming."
Trade-secret scholars say that there are limits to employer ownership of employee inventions, particularly where an agreement signing over inventions is too broad or not related to an employee's work assignment.
But generally speaking, "the deal's the deal," Mr. Milgrim said.
Roger Schechter, a law professor at George Washington University Law School, said: "The larger question is if someone comes up with a really brilliant idea while he's an employee, one that's worth tens of millions of dollars, should that person be entitled to a share in the economic windfall regardless of what the contract says? The traditional answer in the United States has always been 'no.' "
Mr. Brown's lawyer has argued that the contract failed because DSC did not offer anything beyond the salary Mr. Brown was already receiving in exchange for his promise to turn over his inventions.
But so far, county court decisions have not gone Mr. Brown's way. Two judges have ordered him to spend his days at DSC disclosing his ideas to the company -- in an initial May 1997 order for zero pay, and in an order issued last June that he is currently violating, for $45 an hour. Also, Mr. Brown's motion to dismiss DSC's claims was denied.
These early rulings are making Mr. Flores nervous. If it turns out that he, not Mr. Brown, is the owner of the ideas at issue, Mr. Flores is concerned that his ideas could "fall into the hands of DSC through the state courts" and that he would be precluded from using them.
So far there have been no settlement talks, Mr. Sayles said. "Once this lawsuit was filed, it's been an absolute declaration of war," he said.
DSC is continuing its litigation aggressively. "We don't even know if Brown's idea has any value at all," Mr. Brunt said. "That's the ironic thing."
As for Mr. Brown, he is liquidating assets, including his house, to pay expenses. Employers are skittish about hiring someone in violation of a court order, he said, and therefore, until this case is resolved, he does not expect to find employment.
But he says there has been a positive side to the litigation. "I would definitely say that it's very educational," Mr. Brown said. "I learned more about the law than I ever intended."

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton Deserves 'Fast Track'

 BODY:
President Clinton begins an important battle with Congress this week for renewal of "fast track" authority, the right to submit trade agreements to Congress for a speedy vote without amendments. Without fast-track protection, countries will not negotiate trade accords with Washington for fear of endless revision. Not surprisingly, protectionist forces within both parties would be happy to block the no-amendment rule, even though every President over the past 20 years has used the rule to open up foreign markets and also bring down prices for American consumers.
The Administration needs fast track to complete negotiations within the World Trade Organization on opening markets to foreign-provided services, tightening copyright protections and prying open government contracts to bids by foreign companies. Fast track is also needed to negotiate trade agreements with Chile and other South American countries. They are already negotiating deals with Europe, Mexico and Canada that would give exports from those countries favored access. 
 Opponents ranging from isolationists to pro-union liberals indict trade pacts with environmentally lax and low-wage countries. The claim is that these countries steal American jobs and drive down living standards of American workers. But trade itself does not create or destroy jobs. The American economy will operate near full employment as long as Federal Reserve and budgetary policies remain sensible. Trade does shift jobs from apparel and other low-paying industries into high-paying export industries. The transition can be rough, but the long-term benefits are substantial.
Nor are low foreign wages the scourge that the forces led by the House majority leader, Richard Gephardt, proclaim. Low wages largely reflect low productivity, providing no net benefit to foreign manufacturers. Nor would higher foreign wages help American companies. Rising production costs would be offset by a falling exchange rate, leaving the net cost of imports to American buyers largely unchanged.
That said, the Administration goes too far in claiming that trade helps everyone. The influx into the United States of clothing and other goods produced with low-skilled labor has modestly pushed the wages of unskilled workers further behind the wages of skilled workers. But rising inequality should not be confused with falling living standards. After taking account of lower prices for imported goods and the availability of jobs in a fully employed economy, very few Americans actually lose.
Though labor and environmental conditions are rarely related directly to trade, the United States should condition trade pacts on a country's willingness to adopt agreements that provide basic international protections, like prohibitions on child labor and rights for union organizers. As in the trade accord with Mexico, Washington ought to insist that countries, like Chile, strictly enforce their own environmental laws.
Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposes a reasonable compromise that would allow the Administration to incorporate into the text of a fast-track accord labor and environmental conditions that directly affect trade in specific products. The details remain to be worked out, but the Archer plan offers an opportunity to fashion a sensible fast-track plan that can be made acceptable to Democrats.

HEADLINE: Many Tenants Are Struggling To Pay Rent

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Caught between rising rents and subsistence wages, more renters in New York State are unable to afford their apartments than in any other state in the country, according to a national study.
Mostly because of widespread affordability problems in New York City, the state was ranked worst for the second year in a row in the annual study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which represents a wide array of housing groups seeking to help the poor. 
 The study found that roughly half of the state's renters paid 30 percent or more of their income for their apartments, the Federal Government's benchmark for affordability. And many of the poorest paid much more than 30 percent, forcing difficult choices among necessities.
"Housing costs, for most people, represent the largest monthly expense," the report states. "Most families pay their rent first, buying food, clothing and health care with what remains."
The study found that 48 percent of renters in New York State were unable to afford the estimated fair market rent for a one-bedroom apartment, $687, and 54 percent were unable to afford a two-bedroom rent, $796. It calculated that New York renters would need to make at least $13.22 an hour to afford a one-bedroom apartment and $15.32 an hour to afford a two-bedroom. The minimum wage is $5.15 an hour.
Around the country, only Washington, D.C., Rhode Island and Hawaii had affordability problems approaching New York's. But in nearly every other state, more than 30 percent of renters paid more than they could afford for one-bedroom apartments and more than 40 percent did so for two-bedrooms.
The study, which is to be released in Washington tomorrow, theorizes that those numbers reflect the results of new welfare laws, which were intended to move recipients to work but may be moving them from one economic gap to another: workfare programs and jobs with incomes far too small to provide decent housing.
"For us, the most important message in the study is a debunking of the myth that only people on public assistance and not working have a housing problem," said Helen Dunlap, president of the coalition. "You can be working a great number of hours in a steady job and still not be able to afford a place to live."
Renters on welfare continue to be in the most precarious position. The study found that in New York State, the monthly grant provided by the new federally subsidized program known as Temporary Aid to Needy Families falls $219 short of helping a family meet the fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment.
Leslie Crockett, a mother of three in the South Bronx who lost her data-entry job in January, said her landlord had taken her to court because welfare pays only $143 toward rent, and she had yet to receive rental help under a state program.
"I understand that man needs his money," Ms. Crockett, 32, said of her landlord. "He's got a business to run as well. But this is the situation that I'm in. I don't have anyone to take up the slack for me."
The study used fair market rent levels -- locally adjusted cost estimates for decent but modest shelter -- determined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for fiscal year 1997 in cities around the country. It compared those rents with median renter incomes.
Advocates for the poor in New York, many of whom contend that the state is in a housing crisis, said the numbers painted only a rudimentary picture of the realities faced by the poor. Especially in New York City, rising rents have forced many people to live doubled and tripled up with other family members, often in dangerous or unhealthy conditions.
"What people fail to understand," said Billy Easton, executive director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, "is that if someone doesn't have a stable home, it has a terrible impact on every other area of their lives -- their ability to work, the ability of their children to stay in school."
Housing analysts said they can find no inherent reason why New York State should have ended up at the bottom of the list for two years. In 1991, New York was tied for eighth place. In 1989, it was 25th.
Michael Schill, director of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Studies at the New York University School of Law, said the numbers might be a result of New York's slow emergence from the recession.
Combined with other factors -- an increase in immigration and low rates of new construction -- the pattern was set, he said: "Rents were increasing faster than normal, and incomes were not catching up."

SAL F. ALBANESE
Speaking to reporters yesterday after a broadcast debate by Democratic mayoral candidates:
 
"I am the strongest Democrat against Rudy Giuliani in terms of my strong platform on law and order, my strong platform on education. I was a schoolteacher for 11 years. I teach criminal law at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. I've been an independent member of the City Council. I support political reforms. I think people in New York are looking for someone who can appeal to all New Yorkers and someone who's a strong Democrat, who appeals to working men and women in this city. I believe the city is moving toward a two-tiered city, a small group of very wealthy people and the rest poor and working poor. We need to have a working class and middle class in this city." 

RUTH W. MESSINGER
Speaking yesterday at a debate by Democratic mayoral candidates:
 
"This election is about the future. About your future, about your kids' futures, about our city's future. If you agree with Rudy Giuliani that this is as good as it gets, then vote for Rudy Giuliani and the status quo. But if you're troubled because more than half our kids don't read at grade level, the government is wasting your tax money, children are hungry, we have a much too high unemployment rate, then Rudy Giuliani is not the mayor for you. I am. I will be a mayor who sets high standards and meets them, who fixes problems instead of pointing fingers. I believe that every child in this city must learn to read and write, to compute and compete into the 21st century. If you think this is as good as it gets, let me tell you: You ain't seen nothing yet."
 
AL SHARPTON
Speaking yesterday at Calvary Baptist Church in Jamaica, Queens:
 
"I think of how our grandparents suffered to give us the right to vote. We on Primary and Election Day are the only ones who had to fight to go to the polls. Everybody else, all they had to do was get old enough to vote. People shed blood, people spent cold nights in jail, pregnant women marched in Birmingham and their stomachs were bitten out by police dogs, people suffered to give us the right to vote. Here we're now living in Queens, N.Y. Some of us with nice homes and nice cars. And some of us have to beg you to get up and do what others died to give you the right to do. It's an insult to hang Dr. King's picture on your wall and not use the things he died to make available to you."

HEADLINE: Panel Reviews U.S. 'Life-Support Systems'

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Government research money should be quadrupled by 2004 to prevent cascading failures of the nation's power, water, finance and emergency systems, which are increasingly connected, especially through the Internet, a Presidential commission says.
The panel is reviewing security for eight infrastructures: electric power distribution, telecommunication, banking and finance, water, transportation, oil and gas storage and transportation, emergency services and Government services. 
 "These are the life-support systems of the nation," said Gen. Robert T. Marsh, who is retired from the Air Force and is the chairman of the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection. "They're vital, not only for day-to-day discourse. They're vital to national security. They're vital to our economic competitiveness world wide. They're vital to our very way of life."
The commission's advisory committee, in its first official meeting, said on Friday that the $250 million budget for research and development to protect against threats to critical infrastructure should be doubled in 1999, and that $100 million should be added each year until the budget totals $1 billion by 2004.
The research and development money is mostly concentrated in the National Security Agency, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Commerce and Energy Departments, General Marsh said on Saturday.
Intentional or accidental damage to one aspect of the nation's infrastructure could spread and bring down other systems.
"We're not trying to alarm," the general said. "In fact, there haven't been any serious attacks on our infrastructures. What we're saying is, let's take prudent actions to forestall this kind of crisis happening to us in the future."
Because much of this infrastructure is in the hands of private business, the commission thinks the Government and private sector should work together to protect the system.
The Internet makes the systems vulnerable, he said.
"The Internet provides an access point into all these infrastructures," either through control systems directly on the Internet or indirectly, he said.
John T. Davis, the commission member representing the National Security Agency, said the Government should develop a secure "Next Generation Internet" for official use. And he said private industry should invest more in research for more secure information systems.
General Marsh said education was also important to Internet security.
"We see the need to make sure our youngsters in their early schooling are taught the rules of the road, there is such a thing as trespassing, it's not proper to break into someone else's system," he said.
Even industry leaders need a better understanding of security design, from fire walls to prevent access to vital systems to better discipline, like not introducing potentially contaminated disks from home.
"It's the first time in my experience the Federal Government has tried to take a major initiative in advance of some kind of problem," General Marsh said. "We're good at reacting, but we're not good at proacting."
The commission is to give its final report to the President on Oct. 13.

HEADLINE: Heavy Hand of Beijing Dampens a Panama Canal Fest

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PANAMA, Sept. 7

 BODY:
As originally envisioned, the "Universal Congress on the Panama Canal" was to be a grand gathering of world leaders here to discuss the future of the vital waterway. But that was before Panama stumbled into the bitter dispute between China and Taiwan, prompting the incensed authorities in Beijing to undertake a two-year campaign to sabotage the event.
Today, as the conference opened on the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Panama Canal treaties, the magnitude of Beijing's success became clear. Presidents Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan and Ernesto Perez Balladares were in attendance, but nearly all the other heads of state and business leaders who had been invited bowed to the Chinese offensive and stayed away, drastically reducing the scope and importance of the encounter. 
 For Mr. Perez Balladares, this outcome is an embarrassing and politically costly setback. The shipping industry and many foreign governments have been openly skeptical of Panama's ability to run the canal after the United States hands it over on Dec. 31, 1999, and his administration had hoped that the congress would demonstrate that Panama was up to the task.
"This was meant to be an important act of presentation to the international community, in which Panama would tell the world it knows how to manage and modernize a waterway that will soon be ours, and is ready to assume a more serious and responsible global role," said Ricardo Arias Calderon, a former Vice President and a leader of the Christian Democratic Party. "Instead, it is a major lost opportunity."
Although the United States remains the main user of the canal it constructed more than 80 years ago, China and Taiwan have growing commercial and political interests here. Measured by total tonnage shipped through the waterway, China is now the fifth-largest user, while Taiwan, which China regards as a breakaway province and therefore seeks to isolate diplomatically, is the ninth.
The rivalry between China and Taiwan dates back to 1949, when Nationalist Chinese forces retreated to the island after losing a civil war to the Communist army. In 1971, the United Nations seat held by the Republic of China on Taiwan was transferred to Beijing, and now few countries retain formal relations with Taiwan, mostly in Central America and the Caribbean.
Panama's plans for a grandiose global assembly began unraveling, it is now obvious, in 1995, when Taiwan's Embassy here learned of the congress, saw it as a rare chance for Mr. Lee to appear on the world stage and sought an invitation. According to diplomats here, Panama consented after Taiwan agreed to defray $800,000 of the costs of organizing the event.
Given the international importance of the canal's future, Panama had also sought assistance and representation from the United Nations. But once the conference's Taiwan connection became known, all United Nations agencies withdrew their support, and China began to press others who were invited either to stay at home or limit themselves to small, low-level delegations.
As a result, the only presidents attending the conference, other than Mr. Lee, are those of Honduras and Nicaragua, which also have warm relations with Taiwan. The American delegation, which arrived this afternoon, is led by Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater and Thomas F. McLarty, President Clinton's special envoy for Latin American and Caribbean affairs.
In remarks to reporters here after disembarking, Mr. McLarty said the United States was "fully confident that canal operations will remain solid after 1999" because "all parties involved are committed to a seamless transition."
He declined to criticize Mr. Perez Balladares' embrace of Taiwan, saying "the Panamanian Government appropriately chose who they would like to invite" to the conference.
Fearful of offending China and being denied business opportunities there, most major international shipping companies have also backed away from sending high-level delegations. Even Chang Yung-fa, who as head of the giant Evergreen Marine Corporation, Taiwan's largest shipping company, was being counted on by Panama to play a conspicuous role, ending up sending his regrets.
In recent years, Evergreen has become one of the most prominent investors in Panama, with projects that include a large container port, an industrial park and an airline. But Mr. Chang and his company also have substantial interests and ambitions on the Chinese mainland, which diplomats here said could be endangered unless he lowers his profile in Panama.
Stripped of its political dimension, the congress, which ends on Wednesday, will now be devoted largely to technical matters of interest only to transportation and shipping specialists. Conference organizers declined to provide reporters with a list of those attending, but have announced panels to discuss issues like "Long-Range Canal Traffic Projections" and "Locks Modernization."
Even after achieving its political objective, though, China has continued to threaten conference participants. On August 28, a Foreign Ministry spokesman in Beijing called on Panama to "change its erroneous decision to invite Lee Teng-hui to attend this meeting" and condemned Taiwan for conducting what he called "activities aimed at splitting the motherland."
A similar warning was also issued to the United States, which granted Mr. Lee a visa to stop over in Hawaii on his way to and from here.
"Don't let Lee Teng-hui use all kinds of opportunities to create two Chinas," the Chinese spokesman, Shen Guofang, cautioned Washington.
In addition, the head of China's new economic and trade mission here, Ju Yijie, has been trying to undermine support for Taiwan in the large and prosperous local Chinese community since arriving here six months ago, leaders of that community say.
Thanks to steady immigration and intermarriage, as much as 5 percent of Panama's population of 2.5 million people is estimated to have some degree of Chinese ancestry. Many of the new arrivals have stronger ties to the mainland than to Taiwan, and have challenged the traditional hostility of Chinese organizations here toward the Communists in Beijing. To prevent further erosion of its support, Taiwan has in recent months made generous donations to educational and other projects that benefit the local Chinese community.
For its part, a grateful Taiwan may seek to soften the blow Panama has suffered with promises of increased investment and aid. According to reports by newspapers in Taipei, Mr. Lee, who is accompanied by a delegation of more than 100 officials and businessmen and about 150 journalists, may announce while he is here that Taiwan is willing to contribute as much as $400 million to help modernize the canal.
But clearly the trip has already enhanced Taiwan's political and diplomatic capital in the region. Using his invitation here as a springboard, Mr. Lee will also visit Paraguay and El Salvador, where he is scheduled to meet with the Presidents of the six Central American nations that recognize his Government.
"Both China and Taiwan are happy, because they have ended up getting what they wanted," a Latin American diplomat here said. "The only real loser in all of this is Panama, which had the most at stake."

Elections Could Threaten Republicans' Control of Nassau County Legislature

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, N.Y., Sept. 7

 BODY:
When the first Nassau County Legislature was elected two years ago, there was a broad field of enthusiastic candidates in a total of 10 Democratic and Republican primaries, all hoping to become a part of history.
This year, there are only three primary contests -- one Democratic and two Republican. Nevertheless, the elections could threaten the Republicans' veto-proof control of the Legislature. 
 In the First District, which Democrats hope to wrench from Republican control, Seretta McKnight, a party rebel in 1995, won the support of Democratic leaders this year. Mrs. McKnight was the only successful primary challenger two years ago, when she defeated the party's choice, Frederick Brewington, a civil rights attorney.
Mr. Brewington stayed in the race as a third-party candidate in 1995, thwarting Democratic efforts to take the district, which was drawn to help elect the county's first minority legislator. The district's population is mostly black.
With the Democrats divided, the seat went to the Republican candidate, Darlene Harris, who is running for re-election this year.
Mrs. McKnight's 1995 campaign was also hurt by the state takeover of the troubled Roosevelt School District, where she was the school board president.
Mrs. McKnight, 39, the general manager of a family-owned home heating oil business, this year edged out Mr. Brewington as the party's choice by 54 votes. But she faces a primary challenge from Patrick Williams Sr., 49, a vice president of the Amerifirst Mortgage Corporation in Hempstead and a newcomer to Nassau politics.
Both candidates promise to fight to address problems that they say have long plagued the economically depressed district, including high property taxes and low economic development. Mr. Williams says he wants to see more affordable housing and a youth center in the district. Mrs. McKnight says she wants to increase health care coverage for poor people in the district.
The Democratic county chairman, Stephen Sabbeth, has staked out the First District as a battleground in his party's efforts to reduce the Republican control of the Legislature. He has long contended that there are more Democrats than Republicans in the district, compared with most of the county, where Republicans outnumber Democrats by a 3-to-2 ratio. With 13 of 19 seats, the Republicans in the Legislature now hold a veto-proof majority, which they would forfeit with the loss of one seat.
 In the two Republican primaries, Patricia Maher, 37, a substitute school teacher, is challenging the party's choice in the 13th Legislative District, Norma Gonsalves, 63, a retired New York City school teacher, and Richard Ahrens, 37, a conservative, is opposing the incumbent in the 15th Legislative District, Dennis Dunne.
Mrs. Gonsalves, a founder and president of the Council of East Meadow Community Organizations, which represents 31 civic, business, education, veterans and religious groups, lost the Republican primary in 1995 by 68 votes to Michael Fiechter, who went on to win the seat that November. He recently resigned, however, to become a Nassau County District Court judge. This time, the party rallied around Mrs. Gonsalves as its choice.
Mrs. Gonsalves and her challenger, Mrs. Maher, both advocate a cut in property taxes but differ on how they would do it. Mrs. Maher would transfer part of the county sales tax to school districts and eliminate most of the automobiles used by county government officials. Mrs. Gonsalves advocates closer scrutiny of county spending to trim costs and taxes. She says a redistribution of sales tax revenues as proposed by Mrs. Maher is not viable.
In the conservative Republican 15th District, Mr. Ahrens, a delegate for Patrick Buchanan in the New York Presidential primary last year, echoes Mr. Buchanan's conservative polices and campaign rhetoric, denouncing the incumbent as "Do Nothing Dunne."
"There are conservative Republican issues that are not being addressed by the current Republican leaders," said Mr. Ahrens, a vehicle maintenance worker at La Guardia Airport. He says the County Legislature should mandate that all county workers speak English on the job, penalize illegal immigrants who send their children to public schools and cut property taxes for older residents.
Mr. Dunne, 47, was the director of the county's Veterans Service Agency for 11 years before being elected to the new County Legislature. In defending his record, he noted that he was a co-sponsor of legislation to expand property tax exemptions for older residents and supported efforts to reduce the size of government.
"I'm a conservative, but I like to stay mainstream," Mr. Dunne said.

HEADLINE: Patents;
Software programs to help buyers make decisions about insurance and health care needs.

BYLINE: By Sabra Chartrand 

 BODY:
AS it has become easier in the last two years to win a patent for software, more computer programs for managing life have emerged with exclusive rights from the Patent and Trademark Office.
Among those are software inventions intended to make financial analyses for consumers and then generate a recommendation of the best product or service to buy. The advantage of having a computer program make the choice is that software can examine competitive data from hundreds or thousands of sources. In the market for a long-distance telephone service? Just try by yourself to uncover all the plans available, get their sales brochures, and then break down the pricing structures to determine which one is the most economical for your needs. 
 Computers can, at least theoretically, analyze the offerings or performance of any industry. Two recent patents were awarded for software programs that are intended to help a buyer get the best deals in insurance and health care.
One patent, awarded to Ryan Evalulife Systems Inc. in Stamford, Conn., covers a software program to help individuals choose a universal life insurance policy. The other patent, assigned to Health Share Technology Inc. in Acton, Mass., covers software that compares the quality and cost of health care at hospitals to determine which are the most competitive.
If the inventors have their way, a lot of middlemen could see their livelihoods disappear.
Evalulife's software is intended to enable consumers to bypass insurance agents and brokers. Already, many banks, dial-up data bases and on-line services offer price quotes for and even sell term life insurance, a basic form of insurance policy that provides a fixed death benefit for an annual premium. Universal life insurance is more like a savings account, with the premiums paid on the policy accumulating value while earning tax-free interest. Owners can borrow from a universal life insurance policy, and sometimes use the accumulated cash to pay premiums.
Evalulife says its patent is for the first and thus far only system that analyzes universal life insurance plans. The inventors, Ronald Ryan, an insurance and financial products developer from Wilton, Conn., and Ronald Gary Marquart, a computer scientist from Oakland, Calif., are negotiating with companies like Intuit and Microsoft to sell their patent.
"Suppose you want to know the best rate of return for triple-A coverage, and you only want to spend a certain amount of money per year," explained Peter K. Trzyna, the intellectual property lawyer who has shepherded the Evalulife patent. "That would produce a listing and ranking of policies. But included are all kinds of investment assumptions -- interest rates and things like that that fluctuate.
"It requires such complicated, intricate mathematical calculations to find the best life insurance investment that it's no surprise this has stumped the industry for a long time," he said. Seeking the information for inclusion in the patent "took a first-rate accounting firm $1.25 million worth of research."
Hardly an approach the average consumer would consider. But the days are over of having access to insurance only through an agent. Today, insurance price-quote services maintain data bases of different policies. Some sell policies; other merely provide information for a fee from the companies that sell the policies.
Customers using Evalulife's software provide traditional underwriting criteria like the applicant's age, gender and health status. They also say how much they are willing to pay in premiums and what size benefit is desired. The software considers factors like rates of return, probability of earning those rates and the reputation of the company offering the insurance.
Mr. Ryan and Mr. Marquart received patent 5,655,085.
The other patent, for the health care software program, was awarded to Richard Siegrist, Jr. and his brother, Donald Siegrist, both from outside Boston, who assigned it to Health Share. Their software is aimed at helping managed care organizations choose which hospitals and doctors to include in their networks and assist hospitals in selecting doctors and health care providers for their rosters.
"What we do is like the way that executives reach conclusions by asking advice from a consultant or specialist," Richard Siegrist explained. "We've automated that process."
Health Share's software considers 33 indicators of health care quality that were determined by a Federal agency, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. Some of those are rates of wound infection, obstetrics complications, urinary tract infection and pneumonia.
"It looks for hospitals with high- quality care at the lowest cost," Mr. Siegrist said. "The software then automatically writes a 15-page management report, with an executive summary, conclusion and next steps or solutions, and graphics and charts."
"Most people don't realize that this information is publicly available in about 30 states, with total patient confidentiality," he added. Not to mention that it would be time-consuming for an analyst at a managed care company to track down and evaluate. "That's where we come in," Mr. Siegrist said. "This software means the data is sitting on their PC on their desk,"
He said he and his brother had already sold the software to big teaching hospitals in New York, New York University Medical Center and several New York City hospitals. The brothers received patent 5,652,842.

HEADLINE: ROAD TO CITY HALL: THE CANDIDATES;
In Primary Debate Slugfest, Democrats Slug Only Giuliani

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
In a mini-marathon of debates that gave them more television exposure in seven hours than they had enjoyed on any other day in this race, the Democratic mayoral candidates repeatedly declined yesterday to draw contrasts between their credentials and ideologies, instead saving their attacks for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Sal F. Albanese, the Rev. Al Sharpton and Ruth W. Messinger ended their final joint appearance before Tuesday's primary on a deferential -- indeed, docile -- note as they turned away invitations to point out the shortcomings of their opponents. 
 "There's been this obsession in the media about wanting to see the Democratic contenders bloody each other," Mr. Sharpton said on WNBC-TV. "And frankly, I've resisted entertaining them with that. That's entertainment. We're all running based on our own views and saying we offer distinct opportunities to run against an incumbent Mayor. And what the media would like -- and what I think people would like -- are, I think, two different things."
Gabe Pressman, the WNBC host, who spent the first 15 minutes of the debate all but pleading for his guests to talk about one another, leaned toward Mr. Sharpton in exasperation. "I don't want it for entertainment," Mr. Pressman said. "I want to know what the difference is between you guys and gals."
It was to no avail. By the closing moment of the last of three debates that were broadcast yesterday, it was clear that the candidates were using their final moments to ask Democrats to base their selections not on any differences among them, but on the strengths of the cases they made against the Republican Mayor.
The decision by Ms. Messinger to stay essentially above the fray (assuming there had been a fray to stay above) was in keeping with her front-runner strategy of ignoring her primary opponents and focusing only on the general election and Mr. Giuliani. She even held back as Mr. Pressman urged his guests to talk about why they were not talking about each other, joining the conversation only when he insisted that she speak. "What I want the voters to do is to hear, from each of us, Gabe, what we see as the most serious problems and how we would fix them," she said.
But the strategy evidenced by Mr. Albanese and Mr. Sharpton was unusual, since the debates gave both underfinanced candidates an opportunity to try to take down Ms. Messinger, who is widely seen as the front-runner.
Ms. Messinger's political advisers had gone into the debates expecting her to be the center of repeated attacks, and afterward said they were pleasantly surprised -- though slightly mystified -- to learn she was not.
Mr. Giuliani was not so lucky. The Democrats sought throughout the day to one-up each other in their criticisms of Mr. Giuliani's personality and his performance. Mr. Sharpton said the Mayor did not deserve credit for the reduction in crime, saying it reflected national trends and policies put in place before Mr. Giuliani took office. Mr. Albanese, quoting Jim Dwyer, the Daily News columnist, called the Mayor a habitual liar. Ms. Messinger said the Mayor had abused campaign finance laws in paying for his campaign.
"The economy is not up," Mr. Albanese said. "We have the highest unemployment rate of any city across America."
Mr. Sharpton compared New Yorkers who considered the city to be in good shape to tenants who live on the 13th floor but call it the 14th.
"We're pretending we're doing better," Mr. Sharpton said. "The fact is, we're on the 13th floor. Unemployment is record-high. The schools are not working. We have serious problems with how we transfer people from welfare to work that ought to be working, but in real jobs. We have police brutality that's an international embarrassment for the city."
Ms. Messinger had a long list of what she described as the failures of Mr. Giuliani's administration, from a lack of classrooms to the number of hungry and homeless New Yorkers. "If you agree with Rudy Giuliani that this is as good as it gets, then vote for him and the status quo," she said, adding, "To those who say that this is as good as it gets, I say: You ain't seen nothing yet."
"We have a Mayor right now whose middle name is bully," she continued. "That's what has gotten people used to the notion that any political discussion is going to result in someone calling people names."
As the Democrats painted a bleak portrait of the state of New York City, Mr. Giuliani accused the candidates of engaging in "negative and personal campaigning." And then, hinting at his own tactical plans for the general election, the Mayor suggested that the barbs thrown at him by the Democrats had given him the political license to respond in kind against whoever emerges from Tuesday's primary as his opponent.
"I don't think there's anyone that can complain that we started it," the Mayor said.
But the last round of debates for the Democrats was not entirely cordial.
Eric Ruano-Melendez, a civil engineer who works for the city, was allowed to participate in a debate sponsored by the city's Campaign Finance Board because he was eligible for the campaign matching funds.
Mr. Ruano-Melendez repeatedly answered questions by decrying the influence of "corrupt lawyers," and accused Mr. Sharpton of being anti-Hispanic and belonging to organizations that were trying to overthrow the country.
"Like the Democratic Party?" Mr. Sharpton said, lifting his eyebrows. Mr. Sharpton took note of Mr. Ruano-Melendez's central campaign promise, to bring in the National Guard to patrol the city streets: "My only question, Mr. Melendez, is if you promise that on Tuesday night if I win, you will not attempt a military coup."
There were also some slight disagreements among the candidates. Ms. Messinger took issue with Mr. Albanese's proposal to restrict campaign contributions to $10 with the difference made up by the city, an idea that could cost the city $30 million.
"I don't want to say to taxpayers, 'Pay $25 or $30 million for an election,' " said Ms. Messinger, who was one of the authors of the city's current campaign finance law. "We can get 900 teachers for that. What we need is to stop those people who abuse the law, like Rudy Giuliani, who had to return over $400,000 in contributions because his collection of that money violated the principles of the law."
Ms. Messinger was referring to contributions Mr. Giuliani was forced to return this year by the Campaign Finance Board for violating statutory restrictions on who is allowed to contribute.
Both Mr. Albanese and Mr. Sharpton took issue with Ms. Messinger's proposal to cut spending with such measures as requiring employees to work longer hours.
Mr. Albanese, who enjoys extensive support from labor unions, denounced the plan, saying, "The workers of our city are bearing a tremendous burden to make this city viable and they get nothing in return for it."
Mr. Sharpton, alluding to his complaint that Ms. Messinger had moved too far to the political center, also argued that the only way to victory in November was for the party to return to its ideological roots.
"You need a candidate that can energize and excite a new base of voters," Mr. Sharpton said. "Young voters. Disaffected voters. Voters that did not come out in 1993. Clearly I think I'm the best candidate to do that."

HEADLINE: Whitman's Re-election Race Faces Pocketbook Backlash

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 7

 BODY:
Despite a strong economy and a record of cutting taxes, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman is battling for re-election against a little-known Democratic challenger who has put her on the defensive on the issue that is most important to New Jersey voters: auto insurance.
Only a few months ago, Governor Whitman's strategy for re-election was to remind voters that they are better off today than they were four years ago. At the time, her campaign aides said they believed their biggest challenge against State Senator James E. McGreevey, the Democratic nominee, would be exciting a complacent electorate. 
 But Mr. McGreevey, a 40-year-old former assistant prosecutor who has spent much of his career in politics as a legislator and as Mayor of Woodbridge Township, has tapped into voters' anger over paying the highest auto insurance premiums in the nation. Recent independent polls show that even though Mr. McGreevey remains unknown to most voters outside Middlesex County, he is making inroads against the Governor.
The majority of New Jersey voters, the polls show, are frustrated that Governor Whitman has not done more to reduce their auto insurance bills. And even though Governor Whitman kept her promise to cut the state income tax rate by 30 percent, a large number of voters say the tax cut increased their property tax bills.
It was Mrs. Whitman's promise to cut taxes that helped her win election in 1993, and keeping that promise helped make her a rising star in national Republican political circles.
But the pocketbook issue in this campaign is auto insurance. And New Jersey voters are known for deciding races on pocketbook issues. The electorate can be volatile because it does not vote along party lines. More than half the registered voters are unaffiliated with either the Republican or Democratic Party.
"At this point, there is a large enough group looking around for an alternative to the Governor, making it a competitive race," said Janice Ballou, a professor of political science at Rutgers University and director of its Eagleton Poll. "He is unknown, but people are taking a closer look."
Lyn Nofziger, a former aide to President Reagan and a friend of Governor Whitman's who is advising her campaign, said it should be no surprise that New Jersey is going to have a race. He pointed out that President Clinton won by 17 percentage points last November, and that the state's two United States Senators are Democrats.
The last Republican to win by a landslide in a statewide race was Tom Kean, who captured almost 70 percent of the vote during his gubernatorial re-election campaign in 1985.
"I expect her to win, but I don't expect her to win big," said Mr. Nofziger, who also advised Mrs. Whitman in her 1993 gubernatorial campaign and her unsuccessful race for the United States Senate in 1990. "We don't really care. What we want is that one vote to win, and beyond that it is gravy."
Instead of touting her administration's record of cutting taxes 14 times, creating 195,000 new jobs and reducing crime, Governor Whitman has found herself talking mostly about auto insurance.
Some of her own campaign advisers say the Governor's problems with auto insurance might have been avoided if she had not shone a spotlight on the issue earlier this year.
In January, she made auto insurance the centerpiece of her annual address to the Legislature and called it her top priority. She proposed lowering rates by allowing consumers to reduce their coverage, but her own party in the Republican-controlled Legislature rejected the proposal. Lawmakers did agree, however, to parts of her plan, removing unpopular surcharges for drivers who have received moving violations, and automatic annual rate increases for insurance companies.
Over the summer, Mrs. Whitman revived her plan. Only this time, she guaranteed up to a 25 percent reduction in rates. Her decision to refocus on the issue puzzled some of her political analysts, friends and advisers who wondered why she was leading with her opponent's issue.
"We don't have to work so hard to raise the issues, because she is raising them for us," one of Mr. McGreevey's top campaign aides said. "All we have to do is chime in and point the finger."
In an interview, Governor Whitman said she had ignored the advice of her own political consultants, who had urged her to back away from the issue. She said it would be a bigger mistake to ignore the voters. "I'm not going to lie to them," she said of the voters. "I'm not going to tell them it's O.K."
"Remember what almost happened to Bill Bradley," she said, referring to the former United States Senator whom she nearly toppled while making her first statewide election bid in 1990. "And that almost happened because he refused to talk about New Jersey taxes. He kept saying that it is not my problem. It's a state problem. And he ran ads that were feel-good ads, with his feet up on the desk, and said how wonderful everything was. And people were here saying, no, they are not wonderful."
Governor Whitman also said that she was faring better with the voters than recent polls suggested, but was not taking anyone's vote for granted. "All I know is what I see on the streets," she said. "Everything that I see, when I am out talking and walking, taking the people's poll, has been good."
The prospect of a competitive gubernatorial race in New Jersey, the only contest involving an incumbent governor in the nation, has attracted the attention of national Democratic and Republican Party officials who say they will pour money and resources into the state. President Clinton is scheduled to visit New Jersey in the coming weeks, and Hillary Rodham Clinton is to campaign with Mr. McGreevey on Friday. The state Republican Party has already begun broadcasting television commercials, blaming Democrats for the auto insurance problem.
Nonetheless, even Democrats concede that Governor Whitman will be tough to beat. She is a formidable campaigner who has delivered strong performances in televised debates in the past. And although polls show that voters disapprove of how the Governor has handled auto insurance, the same polls show that voters still like Governor Whitman personally.
New Jersey voters have also traditionally re-elected incumbent governors, which is why the discontent among voters during strong economic times in this race confounds veteran state politicians and pollsters. Even Jim Florio, who was strongly disliked by the voters for imposing $2.8 billion in new taxes and the only incumbent New Jersey governor to lose a general election, lost to Mrs. Whitman in 1993 by only 25,000 votes.
Mr. McGreevey, who is making his first statewide election bid, unveiled the details of his plan on auto insurance last week. He said it would guarantee customers a 10 percent cut in premiums without reducing coverage.
"Our campaign is presented with a substantial opportunity by virtue of the Governor's failures," Mr. McGreevey said. "Yet it is incumbent upon us to offer the public a striking contrast to demonstrate how our actions would measurably benefit day-to-day, middle-class life in New Jersey."
He said that in coming weeks he would present proposals on other issues, like lower property taxes, expanded economic development programs to create more jobs in the state's cities, and better schools.
Governor Whitman also said that she would talk more about her record over the next eight weeks, drawing comparisons with her achievements and Mr. McGreevey's. She dismissed his auto insurance proposal, describing it as his "quote, unquote plan, which isn't a plan."
"But the deciding factor when people are in the voting booths, as far as the No. 1 priority, it is not going to be tax cuts," she said. "It's going to be get this auto insurance stuff done. It is not going to go away."

HEADLINE: Retail Customers To Get Intel's New Chips First

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 7

 BODY:
When it introduces its newest generation of microprocessor chips on Monday, the Intel Corporation will be breaking with a long tradition in the computer industry by offering the fruits of its most advanced technology to retail customers shopping at outlets like CompUSA instead of to corporations like General Dynamics or Hewlett-Packard.
The new chip, the latest in the Pentium line, contains the smallest transistors Intel has ever made for commercial sale. As a result, it packs more of these transistors -- the switches that control the flow of electrical impulses in the circuitry -- into a smaller space than ever before. 
 The new technology provides computer users with twin benefits: Their machines can perform more functions faster while using less power. This makes the new chips especially useful in small, battery-powered portable computers -- the fastest-growing segment of the computer industry.
The fastest and most powerful chips are now appearing first in portable and inexpensive systems sold to consumers instead of in the mainframe or minicomputers that typically belong to corporations and research centers. Because the revenues of the consumer markets have outstripped those of the corporate market, tapping into the retail markets is the most effective way for companies like Intel to finance the soaring costs of developing technology.
It is a trend that has already become visible in markets for video games and portable and hand-held computers. "The distinctions between consumer and high-end computer markets are increasingly becoming obsolete," said Michael Borrus, the co-director of the Berkeley Roundtable on International Economics at the University of California at Berkeley.
The new processors, operating at 200 and 233 megahertz with the company's MMX multimedia technology, are the first products made using Intel's most advanced manufacturing technology. The circuit lines on the chip are 0.25 microns wide; more than 300 of them set side by side would barely equal the width of a human hair.
Because the new chips draw far less power than their predecessors, Intel said, they will significantly extend the battery life of portable computers. For example, Intel executives said it would be possible for travelers on a cross-country flight to view full-length movies using only a single battery if their machines played DVD-ROM's, the new disks used for viewing high-resolution video.
For the last three decades, computer engineers have been creating smaller and smaller circuits, as predicted by Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel. His statement that the number of transistors that can be put on the same-sized chip would double every 18 months has long been known as Moore's Law.
If the current curve continues, desktop computers will have one billion transistor memory chips and microprocessors that reach speeds of 1,000 MHz -- four times the power of today's machines -- by the beginning of the next century.
The Intel chips being introduced on Monday approach the processing speed of the company's most powerful Pentium II microprocessor -- now used mostly in large computer servers and high-end personal computers -- and will consume up to 50 percent less power than the chip maker's previous generation of portable-computer processors.
At the introduction of the new chips in Santa Clara, Calif., Intel will display portable systems from more than twenty different computer companies that use the faster, lower power chips.
"It's another big step toward the dream machine," said Stephen P. Nachtsheim, vice president and general manager of Intel's mobile and hand-held products division.
Indeed, the personal computer industry has been driven for the last 25 years by the so-called Dynabook, first envisioned by Alan Kay, a computer scientist, and a small group of colleagues at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in California.
Although that computer was intended to weigh about two pounds, none of the computers to be introduced at the Monday news conference will achieve that goal.
However, Intel executives said that the Hewlett-Packard Company and the Mitsubishi Corporation would show off an ultralight, ultrathin portable system that will weigh slightly more than three pounds and have a 12.1-inch display screen. Hewlett-Packard officials said on Friday that the machine was only a prototype and that the company had no immediate plans to mass-produce it.
Another company rushing to capitalize on the advances in processing power offered by Intel is the Power Computing Corporation of Austin, Tex., which withdrew from the Macintosh market last week after Apple Computer repurchased its manufacturing license.
Power Computing officials said they would begin shipping their first computers based on Intel's processors in two weeks. The new models, known as Powertrip, will offer only Intel-based systems. The models are expected to cost $3,300 to $5,500 and weigh 7.7 pounds.

HEADLINE: THE WARMING WORLD: Coping With Climate Change;
Experts on Climate Change Pondering: How Urgent Is It?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
WITH the nations of the world counting down to a Dec. 10 deadline for negotiating cuts in emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases that many scientists say are altering the earth's climate, a fundamental question continues to pervade the debate:
Just how urgent is the problem of climate change? 
 The problem has often been perceived as lying off in the dim future -- a century away, say, since that is the time scale on which most analysis of the question has been based. It can be very hard to get excited about something that seems so remote. "We see the train coming," President Clinton said not long ago, "but most ordinary Americans in their day-to-day lives can't hear the whistle blowing."
Mainstream scientists say that the whistle is getting louder all the time, that many signs of a changing climate are already evident. On the night of Aug. 20 and 21, for instance, a cloudburst poured up to nine inches of rain on New Jersey in three hours. No conclusions about climate change can be drawn from a single downpour. But it provided one more data point in what Government scientists say is a clear trend in the United States: heavy rainstorms have become more common, making damaging floods more likely, and over all it is raining more than it used to.
Other parts of the world have also experienced increases in precipitation in this century. And while the trend's association with global warming is not yet firmly nailed down, mainstream scientists say it is precisely, and unsurprisingly, what would be expected as the earth's atmosphere heats up.
The average surface temperature of the globe has risen by about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the 20th century, and about half a degree in the last 40 years -- with temperatures generally rising more the farther away one gets from the Equator. A warmer atmosphere sucks up more water from the oceans and in general makes more moisture available to developing storms. Observations show that atmospheric water vapor has increased. Therefore, the scientists say, global warming may well be revving up the planet's rainmaking machine.
A rainier world is just one of several climatic changes already observed that are associated with the warming, scientists say. Temperatures have risen more at night than in the day, portending milder winter evenings but also more deadly heat waves. Experts, for instance, attributed the record death toll in Chicago's 1995 heat wave mainly to a combination of unusually high nighttime temperature and humidity.
The area of the Northern Hemisphere covered by snow has generally declined in the last 25 years. Mountain glaciers have receded in many areas. Sea level has risen as warmth has caused the water to expand. Spring comes earlier and fall arrives later in Northern latitudes, which have become about 10 percent greener.
"The climate reality is that if you look out your window, part of what you see in terms of the weather is produced by ourselves," said Thomas R. Karl, senior scientist at the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C. "If you look out the window 50 years from now, we're going to be responsible for more of it."
Mr. Karl has not been known as a doomsayer on the question of global warming. It was he and his colleagues who analyzed 20th-century climatic data for the United States and southern Canada and found that both overall precipitation and the frequency of intense rainstorms and snowstorms had, on average, increased by about 10 percent over the century. Intense storms were defined as those in the top 10 percent, in terms of the amount of precipitation delivered, at the start of the century.
The trend, said Mr. Karl, is consistent with what would be expected in a world made warmer by greenhouse gases -- principally carbon dioxide, which is produced by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.
This is only the beginning, if a panel of more than 2,000 scientists advising the world's governments is right. While no one is predicting apocalypse any time soon, the scientists' best estimate is that the world will warm by more than another half degree in the next 20 years if greenhouse emissions are not reduced (although the underlying trend would surely be modified from time to time by natural climatic variations). With another half degree of warming, the average global temperature would approach the highest experienced in the 10,000 years since the last ice age, said Dr. Thomas J. Crowley, a paleoclimatologist at Texas A & M University.
A century from now, according to the scientific panel's best estimate, the earth's surface will be some 3.5 degrees warmer than in 1990. "You have to go back millions of years to find global temperatures like that," said Dr. Crowley. By way of comparison, it was 5 to 9 degrees colder in the depths of the last ice age.
The panel predicted that the warming would bring widespread climatic, environmental and economic dislocation. Some benefits are expected to result, including longer growing seasons in Northern Hemisphere breadbaskets and more robust plant growth stimulated by increased carbon dioxide. But many effects would be adverse, including intensified cycling of water through the ocean-atmosphere system that would result in both more frequent and severe floods and droughts; it would rain harder but things would dry out more and faster between storms. Sea level is expected to rise by about a foot and a half, inundating many low-lying coastlines. Climatic zones would shift away from the Equator, upsetting natural ecosystems. Entire forest types might disappear. Agriculture in some parts of the world, especially Africa, might be devastated. The geographical range of tropical diseases would expand.
Not all scientists agree with Mr. Karl and the international scientific panel, and the disagreement is symptomatic of a more general, nagging uncertainty that plagues all efforts to gauge the urgency of the climate problem. The uncertainty also complicates the task of negotiators from around the world as they struggle to determine how much and how rapidly greenhouse gas emissions should be cut. The negotiators' next session is in Bonn in late October, with a final session in Kyoto, Japan, in the first 10 days in December.
"Yes, there have been these big climate changes, but I think they're all natural," said Dr. William M. Gray, a climatologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins who has been skeptical that greenhouse gases are altering the climate. "I respect Tom Karl a lot, but I don't agree with his interpretation of his data." Another skeptic, Dr. Richard S. Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says that the natural system has built-in resilience -- "it has to wobble a bit" -- and that the observed changes are an expression of this. Since he believes that global warming is expected to amount to little, Dr. Lindzen believes there is little or no urgency.
The potential Achilles' heel in the mainstream scientists' projections of future climate is that they are based on computerized models of the atmosphere's response to estimates of future greenhouse gas emissions. Everyone agrees that the models are imperfect, and Dr. Lindzen goes so far as to liken them to Ouija boards, but many experts believe they are steadily improving and becoming more realistic. In any case, they say, there is no other way to even begin to cope with the atmosphere's complexities.
The international panel of scientists, which was established by the United Nations and is called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, relied heavily on the models in rendering its landmark judgment, two years ago, that "the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate." The cautiously phrased statement, a compromise product of intense discussions, was a watershed in the climate debate because until then the panel had always said the observed warming and attendant climate changes could have been a result of natural variability.
Since then, some opponents of action to cut greenhouse gases have seized on an article in the May 16 issue of the journal Science, which dealt with uncertainties surrounding the panel's conclusion that humans are probably altering the climate, to suggest that the uncertainty has grown.
But that is disputed by the chief author of the intergovernmental panel's chapter on detection of human influence on climate. The scientist, Dr. Benjamin D. Santer of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who was quoted in the Science article, said in a recent interview that further studies have not only reinforced the original conclusion, but might even strengthen it. And in a recent open letter, he said that despite large uncertainties, "the question is not whether, but rather to what extent" greenhouse gases are influencing the climate. The best evidence, he wrote, "suggests that the human component of climate change is not trivially small."
The size of that component remains, perhaps, the major uncertainty in gauging how urgent the climate change problem is.
But if the intergovernmental panel is right, the average global surface temperature will rise by about a third of a degree Fahrenheit per decade over the next century if greenhouse gases are not reduced.
Many scientists believe that no matter what action is taken in Kyoto, some substantial measure of future warming is already assured.
"We haven't seen the full ramifications" of the greenhouse gases already emitted, said Dr. Kevin Trenberth, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. The reason is that built-in inertia, mainly stemming from a drag on heating exerted by the oceans, prevents the climate system from reacting immediately to the emissions. Only about half the warming potential of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere has been realized, said Dr. James E. Hansen, a climatologist who directs the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.
What this means, he said, is that even if greenhouse gas emissions suddenly ceased today, "you'd get a few tenths of a degree" of global warming in the next quarter century.
But emissions are not going to cease now, since any policy adopted in Kyoto would require some time to have any appreciable effect. This means that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases would continue to grow. "You can't turn that off" right away, said Dr. Trenberth. He noted that even if emissions were reduced to 1990 levels -- a target that most industrialized nations are already failing to meet -- atmospheric concentrations would continue to rise indefinitely. This is because the 1990 levels were already so high.
Dr. Hansen says that "what we do now is not going to have much influence on climate change in the next couple of decades; the main impact of changes we make now will be 50 and 100 years downstream." Consequently, he believes, climatic change is going to become "more apparent over the next decade or so." Dr. Hansen has long been a firm adherent of the view that greenhouse gases are the major cause of the observed warming.
Some scientists, while convinced that humans are changing the climate in important ways and that greenhouse warming is a serious issue, believe that taking no action now would have little appreciable climatic effect. One is Dr. Tom Wigley of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who said, "Just from a pure climate point of view, another 20 years of doing nothing is unlikely to mess things up." He acknowledged that many experts would not agree, and quickly added, "I'm not saying we should do nothing for 20 years." For one thing, he said, "the longer we delay, then the more we have to do later."
How much to do now is the crux of the discussions that will culminate in Kyoto. The decision is complicated by the fact that while the intergovernmental panel estimated a 3.5-degree increase in average global temperature by 2100, it also said the increase could be as low as 2 degrees and as high as 6.
This poses a dilemma, in the view of Dr. Michael E. Schlesinger, a climatologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign: If the warming is on the low end of the panel's estimate and the Kyoto delegates decide to do too much, it will be too costly to the world economy. But if it is on the high end and they decide to do too little, climatic damage will be too high and it will still be too costly.
What should governments do? "We should not do nothing and hope for the best; that's crazy," Dr. Schlesinger said. "On the other hand, we shouldn't do everything, either; we don't want to squander resources on something that might turn out to be a nonproblem." He and others call for an adaptive strategy in which at least some action is taken now, and then both the climatic effects and the economic cost of acting are periodically reassessed. Mid-course corrections would be made as needed. This principle is, in fact, built into the 1992 Rio treaty on climate change, under which the present negotiations are proceeding.
But then a further difficulty arises, in Dr. Schlesinger's view. Since the effects of any emissions reductions undertaken now would not be apparent in the next two decades, it would be impossible to tell for some time whether the right thing was done. And if the reductions did subsequently succeed in mitigating the warming, that very fact would make it harder to know how serious the warming would otherwise have been, and therefore what further action might or might not be needed.
"That," said Dr. Schlesinger, "is what's so difficult about this cockamamie problem."

As governments negotiate cuts in emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, scientists look for signs of climate change. The map at right shows a trend toward more precipitation at higher latitudes and less in the tropics over the last century -- the kind of change computer models predict would occur in a warming world.
 
Further Signs of Change
 
GLOBAL MEAN TEMPERATURE
The atmosphere has warmed by about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the 20th century, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
 
SEA LEVEL RISE
The global sea level has risen by up to 10 inches in the last 100 years, and much of the rise may be related to the increase in global mean temperature.
 
PRECIPITATION PATTERNS
Intense rainstorms and snowstorms have become about 10 percent more frequent in the United States and southern Canada in the 20th century, Government scientists say.
 
FREQUENCY OF WINTER CYCLONES
The number of intense cyclone events per winter has been on the upswing in recent years.

HEADLINE: A Smart Aleck's Second Chance;
At 18, the 'Squirt TV' Guy Resumes His Pop-Scene Assault

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

 BODY:
At 14, Jake Fogelnest started his own public-access television show in Manhattan. At 16, he was the host of his own talk show on MTV. At 17, he was unemployed and in a drug rehabilitation clinic. Now, at 18, he is back, rebuilding his career as a radio host, producer, musician, record executive, comedian and more. In just four years, Jake Fogelnest has completed a career cycle that typically spans a lifetime. And he still lives with his mother.
"My dad has said once again I have the world by the neck," Mr. Fogelnest said over dinner recently at the Coffee Shop in Union Square. 
 Although Mr. Fogelnest is 18, he still looks 14. A scrawny guy in an oversize blue T-shirt with a thin growth of black hair that looks out of place on his baby face, Mr. Fogelnest has made a career out of being a smart aleck.
At a recent star-filled party in SoHo, he walked up to Russell Simmons, the rap mogul, and asked if he could be booked on his black-comic television show "Def Comedy Jam." It was not the first time he had asked Mr. Simmons the question. He later snuck up on the shock-rock star Marilyn Manson, petted his fur coat, grabbed a random male passer-by and announced that they were now engaged. Then, after being introduced to the rapper and executive Sean (Puffy) Combs, he said in deference, "It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Puff Daddy, sir." That was just the beginning of a night of flippancy.
Mr. Fogelnest's fearless, wisecracking city-kid demeanor is what made his public-access show, "Squirt TV," so appealing when it first appeared on Manhattan cable television in January 1994. The show's concept was basic: Mr. Fogelnest sitting on his bed talking to a stationary camera about music, the week's tabloid news and whatever else was on his mind. Occasionally he interviewed visiting musicians and passers-by outside, asking them challenging questions like "Have you seen Chris Farley naked?" and "If a kid had a lemon for a head, would it be fair to tease him?"
Before he had taped a dozen episodes of "Squirt TV," Mr. Fogelnest was phoned by a few new fans: Mike D. of the Beastie Boys, Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, John Flansburgh of They Might Be Giants and Eric Bogosian.
"I've tried to figure out what made my show so successful on public access and what made people like me and want to do stuff with me," Mr. Fogelnest said. "I think it was the fact that here's a 14-year-old kid who's not a big tough guy, talking trash about whatever he wants without fear of offending anyone. I didn't care. I had no friends. Everyone in seventh grade hated me."
Though Mr. Fogelnest had been monkeying around with his parents' video cameras since he was 6, the show was all his own idea and recorded with a camera he bought with money from summer jobs. He also credits his success to the creative background of his mother (a freelance art director who works with DC Comics) and his father (a criminal-defense lawyer who puts out a magazine, The Fogelnest Files, filled with the year's most bizarre news clippings), who separated when he was a toddler.
"After all that Jake has experienced, considering that his age is only 18," said his mother, Murphy Fogelnest, "staying focused on his ongoing desire to build an empire that satisfies his creative wit, financial independence and desire to sleep late in the morning seems to be a challenge he is more than capable of meeting on his own. But that's only Jake's mother's opinion, without prejudice, of course."
In early 1995, MTV, pop culture's quickest star-making machine, offered to pick up "Squirt TV." After making the grade as a host on MTV's spring break shows and creating an hour of "Squirt TV" for Comedy Central, Mr. Fogelnest began "Squirt TV on MTV," though not without a dispute: MTV wanted to record the show in a studio, and Mr. Fogelnest wanted to keep using his bedroom, near Little Italy.
In the end, youth and perseverance paid off, and the bedroom was beamed to millions of homes twice a week, with the Fugees, the Wu-Tang Clan, Adam Sandler, Sean Lennon and others stopping by and subjecting themselves to absurd questions.
In one memorable episode, he challenged the Hong Kong action-movie star Jackie Chan to a video game of Mortal Kombat and won. Though the show lost its homemade charm, it was still a success, and after a three-month trial run MTV renewed it for eight more episodes.
 
'I Didn't See It In Myself'
But trouble was building, from money disputes to Mr. Fogelnest's increasing disappearances. "I became so obsessed at MTV with the idea of making a million dollars and being successful and being independent and being on my own, that I completely lost sight of what I was doing," he now admits.
"I was also probably difficult to deal with because I was in the teen angst rebellion period, which I used to make fun of. But I didn't see it in myself when it happened."
When it came time for MTV to make a second run of "Squirt TV" episodes, Mr. Fogelnest was nowhere to be found. Days passed, weeks passed, a month passed. He had abandoned MTV, so MTV abandoned "Squirt TV." Suddenly, Mr. Fogelnest reappeared in the East Village, performing stand-up comedy at the Luna Lounge, showing old episodes of "Squirt TV" across the street at the Pink Pony cafe and talking about his recent dances with drug abuse.
"He went from being a fresh-faced little kid -- a squirt -- to going down this path I didn't like, where he was hanging out with a bunch of undesirables and dating this older woman," said Shelby Meade, who has handled his publicity, without charge, since 1994. "Then all of a sudden, he checked out. I heard from people he may have been using drugs, then I looked at his behavioral patterns and thought he probably was.
"But now that he's back, he's really becoming an adult. He has a really strong understanding of the entertainment business, and he's much more mature. I'm really proud of what he's done with his life."
Mr. Fogelnest said he did not like to dwell on his monthlong disappearance, during which he put himself back on track at a rehabilitation clinic. "That stuff finds you," he said. "I never got that bad. I could have gotten a lot worse. You're 16 years old, you're on MTV, you're out of your mind, and you lose sight of what's important. I'm glad to have that behind me as early as I did. When you're younger, you bounce back quicker."
Mr. Fogelnest lights a cigarette and attempts to clear up one more misconception: "I never slept with Courtney Love either."
Though the rumor (which Howard Stern asked him about on the air) may seem ludicrous, Mr. Fogelnest does like to befriend musicians 10 and 20 years his elder, he said, "because they know more."
In conversation, Mr. Fogelnest speaks about the goings-on at record labels and MTV like a seasoned industry player. And he constantly talks about such friends as Russell Simins of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, the MTV executive Amy Finnerty, the 18-year-old Australian rocker Ben Lee and Mike D., who, as a musician, record executive and magazine publisher, has been one of his idols.
"I relate to Jake in the sense that I was no different," Mike D. said. "I was going to clubs in Manhattan when I was 14. I kind of idolized older punk-rock and hip-hop bands, and I was like 15 when I started the Beastie Boys. And what business did we having doing that at that age? Jake could've been hanging out with us then."
Mr. Fogelnest's propensity for seeking the acceptance of his elders in the music industry has not always succeeded. Marilyn Manson and his group put him in a highchair at the fetish-theme restaurant La Nouvelle Justine in Chelsea and ordered him a spanking; the band Weezer dropped ice cubes down his shirt backstage at Roseland, and the singer Henry Rollins chastised him for 20 minutes during a radio interview, telling him to change his life and get pants that fit. But most of these have been good-humored gibes at one of the entertainment industry's more resilient figures.
He has already moved far beyond his experiences at MTV. He is the host of a radio show on the New York radio station known as K-Rock (WXRK, 92.3 FM) every Sunday at midnight, and he is one of the few disk jockeys with some control over the music he plays. He is producing an album for a rock band from Oklahoma called Epperley. He says he is days away from signing a contract to become a consultant and talent scout for a major record label. He is writing articles for Grand Royal, the magazine run by the Beastie Boys. He is preparing to make his debut as a human beatbox in a rock band. And he recently traveled to Scotland, where he met with television executives interested in discussing future "Squirt TV"-type projects.
 
'A Lot of Doors Open to Me'
Though Mr. Fogelnest has done a little of everything at an age when most teen-agers are worrying about S.A.T. results, he still is not sure what to do next or five years from now.
"There are a lot of doors open to me right now, and I just have to pick the right ones," he said. "I'm 18 years old, and Squirt TV happened really fast. It also ended really fast. So I'm into a slow build now, because I don't have to rush. All my friends keep telling me: 'Just relax. You don't have to hold yourself to the standards you've made for yourself in comparison to us, who are much older and have been doing this for years.' And that part of it has finally sunk in. Maybe I'll surprise everyone and go to college."
For Mr. Fogelnest, there are disadvantages to being a local celebrity so young. After dinner, he called his mother to check his messages and walked to the Beauty Bar on East 14th Street to meet some friends. As he waited in line outside, the bouncer recognized him: "Hey, you're from 'Squirt TV.' "
"Yeah, that's me," Mr. Fogelnest responded with a smile.
The bouncer smiled back and said, "Then you're definitely going to have to show me ID."

HEADLINE: California Is Big Enough

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The notion that population growth is good for California and, for that matter, for the United States, is ridiculous (front page, Sept. 3). Any benefits seen in California are short term and will hurt the state in the long haul. Most of the people who are moving into the state are unskilled, and many are illiterate. 
 In contrast, population growth due to the booming high-tech industry is relatively small. Yet this is responsible for the recent economic growth of the state.

HEADLINE: Debt Incurred By Consumers Soared in July

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Consumer installment credit climbed in July by $6.5 billion, or at a 6.4 percent annual rate, after a revised $800 million increase in June, or at a rate of eight-tenths of 1 percent, the Federal Reserve said today.
The July increase was well above the forecasts of Wall Street economists for a $4.3 billion rise and reflected a strong bounce in borrowing to buy new cars and in credit-card use. 
 Previously, the Fed said June consumer credit was unchanged from May.
The overall rise in July consumer credit was the strongest in three months, since it gained by $9.6 billion in April.
Total credit outstanding grew by $2.7 billion in May.
In July, auto credit outstanding shot up by $3.6 billion, or at a 10.9 percent annual rate, after a much smaller $900 million increase at a 2.8 percent rate in June.
Revolving, or credit-card, credit was up by $5.4 billion, or at a 12.5 percent annual rate in July -- the strongest monthly rise since last January, when it advanced $7.3 billion, or 13 percent, the Fed said. Credit-card debt had risen $2.4 billion, or at a 5.6 percent rate, in June.
Other credit, which includes consumer bank loans like those for mobile homes and to pay for education, but not real estate mortgages, fell $2.5 billion in July. That was the same as the $2.5 billion reduction in June.
Before seasonal adjustment, total consumer credit outstanding in July was $1.218 trillion, up from $1.158 trillion in July 1996.

HEADLINE: Ms. Albright's Daunting Agenda

 BODY:
Madeleine Albright could hardly have found a dicier time to make her first visit to the Middle East as Secretary of State. Not only has the peace effort between Israel and the Palestinians all but collapsed, but regional powers like Saudi Arabia and Iran are asserting themselves in ways that may undermine America's leadership in the area. As Ms. Albright works her way through the region this week, she will need all her vaunted bluntness and determination to keep instability at bay.
Washington's role in the Middle East has not been as problematic since before the Persian Gulf war in 1991. The war made the political and military landscape more favorable to peace by weakening Iraq and demonstrating the potential benefits of cooperation between the United States, Israel and leading Arab countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia. But the gulf war coalition, which indirectly opened the way to peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians though Israel itself was not a member, has lost cohesion in recent years. The dynamic works two ways. When the peace talks falter, strains in the coalition increase, and when the informal alliance is divided, as it is today, the pressure for peace diminishes. 
 Ms. Albright can address the first part of the equation by getting Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasir Arafat talking again. It will not be easy. The Israeli Prime Minister justifiably insists that negotiations cannot resume until the Palestinian leader cracks down on terrorists. Ms. Albright properly plans to make plain to Mr. Arafat that his indifference to terrorism has stunted the peace. She need not be tactful in delivering the message. Mr. Arafat must understand that any tolerance for terrorism is unacceptable and that his coy minuet with Palestinian terrorists will sink the peace effort.
Mr. Netanyahu should recognize that Israel, though understandably anxious about its security, can be more selective in its punishment of Palestinians and ought to avoid provocative actions like new construction projects on the West Bank and in Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem. While there is no equivalency between bombs and bulldozers, as Ms. Albright said earlier this summer, Israeli actions do influence the overall climate for peace.
A resumption of peace talks would help Ms. Albright hold together the American-led coalition. Arab leaders, disturbed by the lack of progress, skeptical of Mr. Netanyahu's intentions and doubtful that the economic benefits of regional cooperation will materialize, are drifting out of the American orbit. Saudi Arabia, for one, has threatened to boycott an annual Mideast economic conference supported by the United States and attended by Israeli representatives and instead may go to a meeting organized by Iran.
Some of this impatience is posturing. No country in the region is more dependent on American military protection than Saudi Arabia or more fearful of a resurgent Iraq. But the breakdown in peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, coupled with the election of a more moderate President in Iran, has created opportunity for mischief.
Ms. Albright cannot untangle the problems in one visit. But if she fails to budge anyone, the decline of the peace effort and erosion of American leadership in the Mideast could quickly get worse.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
For Asia, Austerity and Exports

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Now that nearly all the nations of Southeast Asia are reeling under a wave of currency losses, how will they extract themselves from their economic mess?
Probably the same way that Mexico did not so long after it was hit by a devastating currency collapse: exports. 
 Already, the economic crisis in Southeast Asia threatens growth there and raises questions about the sustainability of the success these nations have generally enjoyed over the last decade. And even under the best of circumstances, countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines are going to have to throttle back on their domestic growth to reinforce the advantage that a cheaper currency will provide them in selling goods abroad.
"A decade of boom is ending in a bust," said Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Primark Decision Economics in Boston. "There is a big question mark over the Asian region and a big risk for the world economy."
Indeed, almost any expected outcome will deliver at least a dose of bitter medicine to the rest of the Asian continent and the world. As austerity takes hold, Japan is expected to suffer the most, since Southeast Asia takes about a quarter of its exports.
But as the other countries adopt Indonesia's announced prescription last week of fostering export-led growth, renewed trade squabbles with the United States and the Europeans are likely to break out in certain industries.
These will probably be manageable, a number of analysts say, in part because the Southeast Asian economies are still not large enough to disrupt prevailing patterns of international trade. Together, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand -- three of those hardest hit -- account for only 3.2 percent of world exports. That compares with 2.8 percent for the United States, which has sustained an export boom despite increases in the value of the dollar.
And the United States is not the dominant market for these economies. It absorbs 17 percent of Malaysia's exports, 11 percent of Thailand's and 7 percent of those from Indonesia and the Philippines.
The biggest question facing the fast-growth nations of Southeast Asian is whether they will emerge from this crisis permanently damaged, or will use the opportunity to improve their ability to compete with China's giant economy.
Stock markets in the region, after repeated blows in recent weeks, improved sharply Friday and generally again yesterday. Indonesian stocks rose on hopes that last week's deregulation package might allow interest rates to come down faster than expected. Malaysia's benchmark index soared to a two-week high after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad ended the stock-trading restrictions that Malaysian officials had imposed late last month. And Thai stocks staged their biggest rally in more than a month.
Many economists argue that the region will recover from the current crisis in a relatively short time. "Experience elsewhere of falling currencies and higher interest rates points to slower growth," said Desmond Lachman, director of emerging-market research at Salomon Brothers. "But this could be beneficial if they take all the steps needed to restore competitiveness, especially against China."
C. Fred Bergsten of the Institute for International Economics in Washington agrees. "In the short run, they face retrenchment and belt-tightening to restore confidence," he said. "But in the longer run, they will see this crisis as a wake-up call for reform. These countries are smart and pragmatic."
At least one economist, Gary Hufbauer of the Council on Foreign Affairs, warns that the tendency of officials in Malaysia and Thailand to blame foreign speculators for their difficulties, and to intervene in their markets, suggests that they may turn their backs on the free-market approach urged by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank if their fortunes do not improve relatively quickly. "A lot is riding on an Asian recovery," he said, "because if these countries don't pull out of the downturn after two years or so, it will raise a huge cloud over the Washington consensus."
What is unclear is just how bad the domestic downturns will be and how low their currencies will have to go for strong growth to resume.
Mexico may provide a model. When it suffered from a 50 percent loss in the value of the peso against the dollar between November 1994 and March 1995, the deficit in Mexico's current account -- the overall balance of trade and investment -- shrank from 7 percent of national output in 1994 to a manageable three-tenths of 1 percent the following year. Mexico's exports to the United States and the rest of the world, by then much cheaper, surged.
But the cost of re-establishing confidence in the peso was recession -- a brutal turnaround in the economy from 4.5 growth in 1994 to a 6.2 percent contraction the following year. Only in 1996 did Mexico start growing again.
Few economists think that the Asian currency problems will wreak such havoc. And many say that Thailand is likely to take the brunt of the blow, with Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines emerging relatively unscathed. ING Barings, Merrill Lynch and J. P. Morgan all expect Indonesia and Malaysia to sustain growth rates of 6 to 8 percent this year and next. They forecast growth of 4 to 5 percent for the Philippines.
Still, J. P. Morgan warns in its latest Global Data Watch publication that because of the expected slump in capital investment and the need to increase exports, the region as a whole "will shift from being a net booster of demand in the rest of the world to being a net drag."
And some are even less sanguine. "The emerging nations of Southeast Asia -- not just Thailand -- will suffer longer and more difficult adjustments ahead than those forecast thus far by the major investment houses," said Lisa S. Kaess of Geoffrey Bell & Company, a New York financial adviser.
Even the pessimists agree, though, that investment in the region will pick up again to take advantage of more favorable exchange rates as soon as Southeast Asia takes steps to upgrade its mixture of products and reassure investors that the region can stay ahead of the threat from the vast new export capacity coming on stream in China.
The Chinese, according to the World Bank, received $52 billion of foreign direct investment last year, roughly one-fifth of all private capital flows to developing countries. And since 1994, they devalued their currency 35 percent against the dollar and gave exporters a 17 percent tax rebate. All in all, the price of China's exports has fallen by nearly 25 percent in the last three years. Ultimately, that is what Southeast Asia must respond to.

Dollar Up in Thin Trading
 By The Associated Press
 The dollar rose against leading currencies yesterday, helped by market rumors that August employment data for Germany would show further weakness and help keep interest rates there low.
Further helping the dollar was a modest rally in American financial markets, a Japanese monetary official's endorsement of low interest rates and a drop in the British pound on data that seemed to reduce prospects for higher interest rates there.
But dealings were thin, and traders were reluctant to draw long-term conclusions from the currency market's behavior. Many predicted little significant movement in dollar exchange rates pending release of data on United States producer prices and retail sales on Friday.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.8068 German marks, up from 1.8024 on Friday, and 121.17 Japanese yen, up from 121.06. The British pound cost $1.5820, down from $1.5939.

Bond Prices Rise a Bit After Last Week's Selloff

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities were higher yesterday, with selling on advances limiting the session's gains. Activity was thin, so movement was exaggerated. Many market participants came into the session believing that last week's selloff was a bit overdone.
The 30-year bond rose 11/32, to a price of 97. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.61 percent, from 6.64 percent on Friday. Traders largely expect the market to trade in a narrow range most of the week, until Friday, when retail sales and producer price numbers are to be released. 
 Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors, describes them as "the two blockbuster statistical economic releases this week, which should reveal that both consumer demand and pricing pressures appear to be accelerating as we proceed into the third quarter of 1997." That outlook was disconcerting to many market participants, he added.
Referring to a speech on Friday night by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who questioned the reliability of key economic statistics, Mr. Chan said, "Some people drew the conclusion that the chairman is concerned that we have had a lot of growth, but with little inflation." He added, "But now if we begin to add more growth and start showing early signs of inflation, the Fed's degree of complacency could change."
Also, market participants are wondering how more than $12 billion of corporate debt that is expected to be priced over the next few days will affect yields. Yesterday, Amresco Residential Capital Markets Inc. priced a multi-part asset-backed issue through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter. Yields ranged from 5.962 percent for securities with an average life of 0.51 year to 7.7945 percent for one with an average life of 6.98 years. There are also a number of securities priced from 19 basis points to 97 basis points over the one-month London interbank offered rate. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In addition, several borrowers from around the world are expected to price issues in the public market this week. Argentina, Venezuela and the Korean Development Bank are each expected to raise $1 billion.
Doug Burtnick, managing analyst for Technical Data in Boston, said, "The investment community has still not shown an interest in buying the market on rallies." These investors, he added, "buy dips and they may even sell rallies to make room for the new corporate issuance." He said, "This can only last as long as the economic data are mixed, and the prospects for a Sept. 30 tightening remains low."
Richard Medley, president of the Medley Investment Group, said that one result of Mr. Greenspan's speech was a squeeze on short positions in the Treasury market. Short- covering occurs when some market participants sell borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back later at lower prices, thereby pocketing the difference. However, if prices begin to rise instead of fall, as they did yesterday, these participants try to cover their short positions: that is, buying back the securities to limit their losses.
Interest rates at the regular weekly bill auction dropped yesterday in what traders said was a better-than-expected auction. The average rate for a three-month maturity was down 6 basis points, to 5.01 percent, from last week, while the six-month bill was awarded at an average rate of 5.14 percent, down 5 basis points.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:

Bills	Average Price	98.734	97.401	Discounted Rate	5.01%	5.14%	Coupon Yield	5.14%	5.35%	High Price	98.736	97.412	Discounted Rate	5.00%	5.12%	Coupon Yield	5.13%	5.33%	Low Price	98.731	97.401	Discounted Rate	5.02%	5.14%	Coupon Yield	5.16%	5.35%	Accepted at low price	14%	41%	Total applied for	$51,484,288	$49,199,974	Accepted	$11,648,438	$11,816,163	Noncompetitive	$1,174,664	$1,097,867

HEADLINE: Small-Company Stocks Continue to Gain

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
After meandering, major stock market indexes finished higher yesterday in moderate trading as investors looked for underpriced stocks and sectors.
Despite a seemingly tranquil session, the Russell index of 2,000 companies, a major index of small-company stocks, and the Nasdaq composite index again hit record highs, as airlines and technology stocks rose. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 12.77 points, to close at 7,835.18, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 companies finished at 931.20, up 2.15 points. Analysts said they expected stock prices to continue moving in a narrow range this week as investors awaited some initial indications of inflation in August. Several economic reports are scheduled for release on Friday.
"You don't have a malaise, but you don't have the makings of everybody having to go out and buy stocks right now," said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at Cowen & Company in New York.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who questioned the reliability of several economic statistics in a speech in California late Friday, did not roil markets yesterday, but investors are becoming increasingly worried that the Fed may feel it needs to curb economic growth by raising interest rates before the end of the year, Mr. Pradilla and other analysts said.
Investors continued to favor small-cap stocks by pushing the Russell index up 2.95 points, to 435.99, its eight consecutive high.
The Nasdaq composite index increased 9.58 points, to a new high of 1,645.35.
Two airline sector indexes were among the best performing yesterday, in response to a move by the major airlines to raise ticket prices by 5 percent, even though two carriers -- Delta Air Lines and AMR's American Airlines -- backed off the increase yesterday. The American Stock Exchange airline index, which includes the 10 largest airline companies, gained 5.4 percent, while the 12-company Philadelphia airline sector index rose 5.19 percent.
The fare increases, a sign of strong fall bookings and airlines' confidence about meeting third-quarter earnings forecasts "gave a whole bunch of investors a reason to jump" into the stocks, said Thomas S. Schreier, a director of equity research at Credit Suisse First Boston.
AMR climbed 4 3/16, to a new high of 110 7/16. Delta Air Lines gained 5 points, closing at 99 5/16. Northwest Airlines, which initiated the price increase last week, picked up 3 1/8, to 40 1/4.
In contrast to the market's roller-coaster ride in August, September seems to be opening somewhat sedately. In the first five trading sessions this month, the Dow closed more than 100 points higher or lower only once, on Sept. 2, when it advanced 257.36 points. But analysts believe the halt in volatility is just a brief respite.
"I think when you get to the end of this week, the market could be nervous," said Robert Froehlich chief investment strategist at Zurich Kemper Investments. "We've sort of convinced ourselves that the Goldilocks economy is alive and well. That will last until Wednesday."
By tomorrow, investor concerns about the Producer Price Index and retail sales reports, which are scheduled for Friday, should cause an increase in volatility, Mr. Froehlich said.
Meanwhile, announcements of expected third-quarter earnings shortfalls continued to hurt some companies.
Cymer fell almost 13 points yesterday after the company announced that third-quarter earnings might fall below expectations. It closed at 69 1/8, off 12 7/8.
Worldcom was the most actively traded issue yesterday as the company agreed to acquire Compuserve for $1.2 billion. As part of the transaction, Worldcom will also purchase an America Online communications network in exchange for Compuserve's on-line service and $175 million.
Worldcom closed at 33 3/4, up 2 1/4, while Compuserve slipped 3/16, to 13 5/16.
Shares of America Online jumped 6 1/8, to a new high, closing at 76 1/16, after the company announced that it would purchase Compuserve's on-line business.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong's Leader Heads for U.S. to Correct 'Misconceptions'

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Tung Chee-hwa, the man chosen by Beijing to run Hong Kong, left today for his first visit to the United States since Britain returned this territory to Chinese control on July 1. He said the visit was intended to correct American "misconceptions" about Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong that Mr. Tung will discuss with President Clinton, members of Congress and interested Americans is flourishing economically. But it has no democratic institutions, has undergone a sharp contraction of civil liberties and apparently has three times the number of people it did 25 years ago who are living in poverty, in part because of an aging population and the large number of immigrants from China who do not have the skills that enable them to work in an increasingly non-manufacturing ecnonomy. 
 "I'm looking forward to going to the U.S.," said Mr. Tung, a shipping tycoon. "Really to tell my friends in America what is happening in Hong Kong, not only about the transition, but what is going on."
Mr. Tung was dissuaded from visiting the United States in the months leading up to Chinese rule, in part because of criticism over his decision to roll back certain rights.
Now, however, with two months of calm behind him, Mr. Tung said he is ready to spread news of Hong Kong's success under Chinese rule to skeptics in the United States, particularly to members of Congress who have been critical of Beijing.
Mr. Tung said he expected to meet with President Clinton, who met last spring with Martin Lee of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, which opposed Beijing's move to disband the elected legislature. He also hopes to meet with other Administration officials and key members of Congress.
"The Government is functioning as normal," said Mr. Tung. "The financial market is moving. Demonstrations are continuing, arguments everywhere. The legislative body is just as assertive as before, challenging everything we want to do."
Still, many people here, including Mr. Tung himself, believe he will face a hostile audience in explaining why Hong Kong is considered not ready for democracy.
Mr. Tung has proposed an electoral system that would give Hong Kong's leading companies and banks a major say in the legislature's composition.
Under his proposal, seats would be distributed to parties according to their proportion of total votes. A third of the seats would be chosen by companies, banks and professional associations. This arrangement is likely to prevent the Democratic Party, which won the largest share of seats in the fully elected legislature of 1995, from winning a large number of seats in elections next May. Because even losers in the elections will gain legislative seats, as permitted under a proportional voting system, and because companies are dominated by conservative business people, the Democratic Party's share of seats is almost certain to fall sharply.
Mr. Tung's view of how things are going is not shared by legislators who were removed from office by China on July 1 and replaced with a body of lawmakers of its choosing.
"It is a step backward -- it's highly undemocratic," said Mr. Lee, describing Mr. Tung's proposal.
The rosy picture painted by Mr. Tung was clouded somewhat today by a report by a group of university academics, the Hong Kong Social Security Society, which found that 856,000 people, 14 percent of the territory's population, are living beneath the poverty line of $358 a month.

Latest Cyberdeal Seems to Have Room for Two Winners

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Follow the money in yesterday's big Internet deal -- an intricate transaction involving Worldcom, Compuserve and America Online -- and it seems that the real value lies in the dull plumbing of cyberspace, not the glamour of new media.
Worldcom Inc., the nation's fourth-largest long-distance phone company, agreed to pay about $1.2 billion in stock for the Compuserve Corporation. It will keep the under-the-hood side of Compuserve's business, managing data networks and providing data services for big corporate clients. 
 In the next step of the deal, Worldcom will sell Compuserve's well-known but struggling on-line service to America Online for the equivalent of $250 million. In short, the plumbing of Compuserve, which is controlled by H & R Block, is worth nearly $1 billion, while its on-line service amounts to pocket change by comparison.
Shares of Worldcom rose sharply yesterday, up $2.25, to $33.75, and were the most actively traded, with nearly 14.6 million changing hands. But if Worldcom jumped, then America Online shares soared, closing up $6.125, to $76.0625.
The enthusiasm was not only because America Online had cut a good deal, but also because the acquisition should help it further a strategy of becoming a genuine media company -- and one able to draw more revenue from advertising and electronic commerce like on-line shopping.
Advertising and commerce now account for about 15 percent of America Online's revenues -- up from next to nothing a couple of years ago -- with the rest coming from monthly subscription fees. The company wants to see the advertising and marketing revenues rise sharply in the coming years, toward the level of 50 percent.
The key to attracting advertising dollars is building an audience on the scale provided by mainstream media. And America Online certainly appears well on its way. Today, it is by far the largest on-line service, with 9 million subscribers. By purchasing Compuserve, the second-largest on-line service, America Online, which is based in Dulles, Va., would add 2.6 million more subscribers worldwide. That would lengthen America Online's already yawning lead over its nearest remaining rival, the Microsoft Network, which has 2.3 million subscribers.
"The next stage of the Internet economy is that the media companies will start to make money, not just the infrastructure suppliers as has been the case until now," said Kate Delhagen, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
"America Online is taking a leading role in that development, and acquiring Compuserve is a big step ahead," Ms. Delhagen said. "You assemble an audience of more than 10 million subscribers, and Madison Avenue has to pay attention."
In the deal, America Online is increasing its focus as a media company not only by adding subscribers, but also by selling its ANS Communications unit to Worldcom.
Less than three years ago, America Online bought ANS, once the Internet's network backbone and run by the National Science Foundation. America Online paid $35 million for ANS, seeking greater vertical integration and less dependence on major telecommunications companies.
Today, the ANS investment seems to have been a particularly shrewd one for America Online, and one that points to the rising value of high-speed digital communications gear that keeps the Internet running. For ANS, Worldcom will give America Online Compuserve's on-line service and a cash payment of $175 million, putting a value on ANS of about $425 million.
To be sure, America Online invested in ANS and Worldcom will assume $150 million in ANS lease obligations, which are the equivalent of debt. Still, the ANS investment has been a big winner for America Online, perhaps providing more profit in the last few years than the company's basic business.
Yet Wall Street is evaluating America Online far less by its near-term profits than by its progress in assembling a working business model for the hybrid media, called interactive services, that combine communication, entertainment, information and on-line shopping. The company's market valuation -- or total market capitalization -- rose sharply yesterday to more than $7.4 billion.
But Stephen M. Case, America Online's chairman, noted yesterday that it would be years before cyberspace was considered a mass medium. In the United States, the on-line population has more than doubled in two years but still represents fewer than 20 percent of all households. "Today's deal really is a step toward the promise of a connected society," he said. "But there is still a lot of work to be done to make interactive services a mass-market media."
The deal, executives said, is expected to take three to six months to be completed. It is subject to approval by the shareholders of the respective companies and will also be subject to review by the Justice Department's antitrust division as well as the European Commission, since both America Online and Compuserve have hundreds of thousands of subscribers in Europe.
Mr. Case said he expected no challenge on antitrust grounds because the Internet business was still so young and relatively easy to enter. The list of current and prospective rivals, he said, includes Microsoft, Walt Disney, Time Warner and AT&T. "It's a pretty daunting list of potential competitors," he said.

HEADLINE: Computer on Mir Fails, Forcing Crew to Shut Down Equipment

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 8

 BODY:
The Mir's computer broke down again today and forced the crew to shut down most of the space station's equipment.
Russian and American space officials played down the seriousness of the computer crash, the third aboard Mir since mid-July. The station was able to maintain its orientation toward the Sun, and its power supplies were in much better shape than during the previous breakdowns. 
 Ground controllers said they hoped to repair and restart the computer on Tuesday. In the meantime, they said, the crew was in no danger.
"Why do these malfunctions happen?" asked Vladimir Solovyov, the chief of Russia's Mission Control. "Do you know why your car breaks down? It's hard to say what the reasons might be."
Valery Lyndin, a space agency spokesman, said, "The computer has become capricious again."
Capricious is as good a word as any to describe the Mir's endless, and endlessly vexing, journey around the Earth for the last eight months or so. The space station, which has been aloft for 11 years, has spun from one mishap to the next -- from a fire to oxygen system breakdowns, from a collision with a cargo ship to the repeated computer breakdowns.
Mir's computer became unplugged on July 17 when a crew member accidentally disconnected a cable, then broke down again on Aug. 18 during docking of a cargo ship.
In the latest fumble, the computer shut itself off at about 3 A.M. today, and the crew responded by turning off most systems to economize on power, Mr. Lyndin said.
The crew said later today that they had enough power for normal operations, but had turned off all systems it did not immediately need, including the Elektron oxygen-generating system. The existing oxygen supply is good for several days, and there are also backup oxygen canisters if needed.
The space station's gyroscopes, which keep the station pointed toward the Sun, went down when the computer went off-line. However, the astronaut Pavel Vinogradov said the Mir was maintaining its proper position, the Interfax news agency reported.
In the previous breakdowns, it took hours to bring the computer system back up and several days to fully restore all functions.
There were indications that Mir might bounce back quicker this time. Rob Navias, a NASA spokesman speaking from the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said Mir's solar batteries were filled with juice Monday, in contrast to the previous two breakdowns.
He said he expected the Mir crew to re-boot the computer within a day, and replace a part. Then the crew will spin the gyroscopes back up to resume automatic steering of the station.
Mr. Solovyov, the Mission Control chief, said the computer would be brought back up on Tuesday.
"We will download the necessary information into it to restore it to working order tomorrow," he added.
It has been a trying week for the Mir's crew, which includes two newly arrived Russian astronauts and the American astronaut Michael Foale. On Saturday Mr. Foale and the Mir commander, Anatoly Solovyov, spent six hours on a space walk trying to find holes in the skin of a punctured module, but came up empty. The recent accidents have raised questions about safety aboard the Mir, which was launched in 1986 with an expected life span of five years.

HEADLINE: Chance of Tobacco Deal in '97 Gets Slimmer

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
President Clinton will not offer an opinion on the proposed tobacco accord until next week at the earliest, aides said today, further diminishing chances that Congress will act on the accord this year.
Senior advisers, including Donna E. Shalala, the Health and Human Services Secretary, and Bruce Reed, the President's chief domestic policy aide, are completing recommendations on the complex proposal. Those recommendations will be presented to the President this week, officials said. 
 The President was originally to have offered his views on the proposal, which was announced on June 20, in late July. But that timetable slipped as aides discovered that the 68-page settlement document negotiated by state attorneys general, plaintiffs' lawyers and tobacco executives raised perplexing questions of law, economics and public health.
In Texas, state officials and tobacco lawyers said today that they were prepared to try that state's suit against the industry, now set to begin on Sept. 29, unless a national accord was reached in the next few weeks.
It has been clear from the beginning that Mr. Clinton would not endorse the settlement plan without demanding significant changes. The White House has signaled that the President will insist that Federal regulatory authority over tobacco be strengthened, that penalities for failing to meet targets for reductions in tobacco use by the young be increased and that the overall cost to the tobacco industry be raised.
Under the proposed settlement, the cigarette manufacturers would pay $368.5 billion over 25 years and agree to stiff Federal tobacco regulation and broad restrictions on marketing and advertising. In return, 40 state lawsuits would be dropped and the industry would get immunity from most other tobacco-related litigation.
There appear to be two principal reasons the proposal has produced little sense of urgency at the White House.
First, critics of the proposal in Congress and among public health experts have objected to it as a bailout of an outlaw industry that does not go far enough toward reducing addiction to nicotine. These critics include many influential Democrats on Capitol Hill as well as powerful health voices, including Dr. David A. Kessler, the former Commissioner of Food and Drugs, and Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General.
The President, aides said, will be loath to endorse a plan that lacks the blessing of these forces.
And second, some political advisers within the White House welcome a delay in debate on the accord. They believe that the tobacco makers' bargaining position weakens by the day and look forward to confronting the manufacturers over teen-age smoking and Government regulation of nicotine next spring as the election season begins.
In a related development, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said today that he expected Congress to repeal a $50 billion credit for the tobacco industry that was slipped into the balanced-budget deal last month. The provision was meant to offset a new 15-cents-a-pack tax on cigarettes to finance health care for children.
The White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said that Mr. Clinton supported the repeal of the provision.
If Congress does not act to rescind the tax break, Mr. McCurry said, Mr. Clinton will insist that the $50 billion be added to the cost of a tobacco settlement.
In Texas, Attorney General Dan Morales said today that the prospects for an out-of-court settlement of the state's $14 billion case -- which seeks to recoup the state's Medicaid costs for treating ill smokers -- were "essentially zero."
The cigarette makers' lead attorney, Dan Webb, told reporters in Texarkana, Tex., where the case is to be tried in Federal court, that the companies were prepared to try the Texas case and dozens of other state claims one by one unless a national deal was reached to settle them all at once.
"We are going to trial, no question," Mr. Webb said. "Under no circumstances will this case be settled outside of the global resolution."
Mr. Morales and Mr. Webb appeared before Judge David Folsom of Federal District Court, who wanted to assess the prospects for a pretrial settlement.
Florida and Mississippi have already reached multibillion-dollar agreements with the major tobacco companies to settle their Medicaid claims.
Another three dozen states have pending suits against the industry, but most are not likely to go to trial for several years.

HEADLINE: IN PRIMARY TODAY, DEMOCRATS SELECT GIULIANI OPPONENT

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
With a flurry of rallies, advertisements and street-and-subway stumping, three Democratic candidates for New York City mayor brought their campaigns to a close last night, encountering relatively small crowds and often uninterested voters as they struggled to draw attention to today's primary.
"I'm city Councilman Sal Albanese, Democrat candidate for mayor. Give me a chance!" said Mr. Albanese as he sought to buttonhole commuters rushing up the crowded stairway at the 72d Street subway on the Upper West Side. 
 Fifty blocks north, the Rev. Al Sharpton gazed across a rainy and poorly attended primary eve rally on 125th Street and somberly predicted victory today. "We're here on the eve of an upset," he told perhaps 100 people who came to hear him speak.
Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, who is widely considered the front-runner, spent the day traveling to all five boroughs, dismissing as impossible any chance that she would get less than 40 percent of the vote and be forced into a runoff. Instead, Ms. Messinger presumed victory and moved, before a vote was cast, to set the table for a contest against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
"People understand that after I win the primary, I'm going to be the underdog," Ms. Messinger said as she embarked on a walking tour of Harlem. "But this is a city that has a long tradition of listening to underdogs, of paying attention to underdogs, of rallying around them."
With these appearances, a last-minute burst of television advertising by Mr. Albanese and Ms. Messinger, and radio advertising by all three candidates, the mayoral candidates wound down one of the least eventful political contests New York has seen in many years. The candidates found themselves answering questions about how low the turnout would be today, and defending the campaigns they had run.
"I think this is a campaign that people are just beginning to pay attention to," Ms. Messinger said.
Besides the mayoral primary, there is a strongly contested six-way race for the Democratic nomination for Manhattan borough president, primaries for Brooklyn and Bronx borough president and several City Council district primaries. The polls open at 6 A.M. and close at 9 P.M.
There was one last flicker of disagreement among the candidates in the final hours of the race. Mr. Albanese, who has been increasingly irritated over what he sees as the unfair presentation of Ms. Messinger as the front-runner in the primary, used a radio interview yesterday to describe her as a candidate without a philosophy, and doomed to lose to Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Albanese's decision to criticize Ms. Messinger in the relatively low-profile radio interview came after he repeatedly declined to assail her while she sat next to him during a series of debates this weekend.
In a gesture with obvious symbolism, Mr. Albanese ended his campaign in the heart of Ms. Messinger's base, the Upper West Side, even paying brief calls to two well-known local food stores, Zabar's and Fairway.
Mr. Giuliani, in City Hall, said the Democrats were facing a low turnout because of what he described as "very, very excessive negative campaigning." The Mayor suggested that voters should consider staying home in protest.
"Each one of them has spent most of their time being exceedingly negative and personal in the way in which they've campaigned," Mr. Giuliani said. "And I think voters don't like that any more. And I think they will record some of that by having at least a fairly low turnout."
In truth, the Democratic candidates have largely refrained from attacks on one another, although they have attacked Mr. Giuliani's performance as Mayor. Mr. Giuliani's remarks may have partly served as a pre-emptive maneuver to head off any criticism of him once he begins what his aides say will be an intense battering of his expected rival, Ms. Messinger.
Another Republican, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, said he would begin a three-week television campaign today that would blame liberals for hurting the public school system. Mr. D'Amato's advertisements would appear to be directed at Ms. Messinger, who has made Mr. Giuliani's education record the central issue of her campaign.
Mr. D'Amato denied that yesterday, saying he was only trying to advertise his own concern with the issue in advance of his own contest next year, though he could not help offering some advice to Mr. Giuliani's expected rival. "If she had half a brain, she would be attacking me," Mr. D'Amato said. "It would rally the liberals around her."
Ms. Messinger did not need the advice. "Al D'Amato is exactly the kind of supporter that Rudy Giuliani deserves," she said when asked about the radio advertising during her stop in Harlem.
In addition to Mr. Albanese, Mr. Sharpton and Ms. Messinger, two other lesser-known candidates appear on the primary ballot today: Roland Rogers, a businessman, and Eric Ruano-Melendez, a civil engineer who works for the city.
Ms. Messinger spent most of her day talking about the Mayor, but Mr. Albanese focused on Ms. Messinger, describing her as "the weakest candidate" the Democrats could put up.
'She is running a campaign without core values," he said. "One week she attacks the rich; the next week she attacks workers. She polls, and basically accommodates positions based on polling. That's why her campaign hasn't taken off. That's why she's going to lose tomorrow."
Mr. Sharpton, at his rally last night, predicted he would win and asserted that he had forced his rivals to work harder and talk about the issues he has stressed this year, police behavior and the economy.
"They thought when we announced this campaign that it was a joke," he said. "But the last two or three days, we've wiped the smile off their faces. Nobody's laughing now. They're all out hustling or working."
Of the three main candidates, Ms. Messinger appeared the least concerned about today's vote, dismissing any hint that she might fall below 40 percent and be forced into a runoff. "I'm going to win tomorrow night, without a runoff," she said.
She described Mr. Giuliani as "a bully" and said: "I'm ready for whatever he's planning to shell out. I'm going to be talking to people in this city about we can make this a better city. I will give as good as I get."
But Ms. Messinger received a hint of her difficulties as she stopped off at the Country Club diner on Staten Island. Two women eating dinner looked up as Ms. Messinger entered with her small entourage.
"Is that Liz Holtzman?" one asked.

HEADLINE: Tribes' New Power Over Welfare May Come at Too High a Price

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: ROSEBUD SIOUX RESERVATION, S.D.

 BODY:
On the wind-scarred grassland stretching past Ghost Hawk Lake, Monica Burning Breast, 25, single and pregnant with her third child, has spent her life in a world on welfare.
Government checks have let her bring up her 3- and 5-year-old sons in a beaten-down brown bungalow on this stark, sprawling reservation east of the Badlands. Shoehorned into the same house, her mother, Lorraine Two Elk, is rearing three other children on welfare. 
 Some reservation families are so poor, living in isolated enclaves like Upper Cut Meat and He Dog, that on food-stamp day, they can obtain transportation to the nearest supermarket only by paying for it with some of the milk and bread that they intended to feed to their children.
Though tribal leaders around the country fear that life for Indians like Ms. Burning Breast and thousands of others may become even tougher under the new Federal welfare law's work rules -- daunting requirements in rural, often remote areas with few jobs -- the law may also give those leaders a small chance to soften the blow. In a little-noticed provision in the year-old welfare law, Indian reservations are, for the first time, given the right to run their own programs. The states are the only other entities allowed to set rules on who can receive welfare and for how long.
The same law that gave tribes this new opportunity, which Indian organizations say may be the United States Government's strongest recognition yet of Indian sovereignty, failed to provide enough money for many tribes to take advantage of it.
So tribes like the Rosebud Sioux are caught in a wrenching dilemma. If they choose to run their own programs, they may be able to tailor them to be more sensitive to the people on the reservations, or even more demanding, if necessary. But without sufficient money, the tribes may end up hurting the people they are trying to help, or further squeezing the tribe's resources.
Congress requires states to pay for part of their own welfare-to-work programs, usually at least a third of the cost, and the Federal Government pays the rest. But Congress did not require a state to contribute money for welfare programs run by Indian tribes living within that state, because lawmakers were reluctant to anger state governors. Under the law, the tribes are entitled only to the Federal share. The law also did not provide start-up money for tribes to set up welfare offices by buying computers and hiring caseworkers.
Although states are generally eager to shift the responsibility for reservation welfare to the tribes, most are not eager to shift the resources. Some states say they need the money to shoulder the additional cost of workfare programs; others say that a program not under state control should not be financed by the state.
Many tribes say that without that money, running their programs would be impossible.
"This was something that was anticipated with a great amount of enthusiasm out in Indian country," JoAnn K. Chase, executive director of the National Congress of American Indians, said of the opportunity to design their own welfare rules.
Some tribes had reported that state-run welfare programs were causing some people to leave reservations, Ms. Chase said, because they could not find jobs.
"We looked at this as a true opportunity to make a significant advancement in tribal sovereignty," she said. "But in order for the tribes to do this, they'll just need flat out the money to make it work."
 
Without State Money, A Deal Out of Reach
Of the 557 federally recognized Indian tribes, 11 have applied for approval to run welfare programs. Two have received permission, and the other applications are in the pipeline. Those 11 tribes -- 4 in Wisconsin, 2 each in Oklahoma, Arizona and Oregon and 1 in South Dakota -- are generally smaller and have less poverty than other tribes.
Oregon and Arizona have agreed to give the tribes the money that would have been spent if the tribal members had stayed on state welfare rolls, said Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the Federal Department of Health and Human Services.
In South Dakota, Indians make up 7.4 percent of the population but account for 53 percent of the welfare recipients. State officials say they can afford to give tribes only a one-time infusion of start-up money. Eight of the nine tribes in South Dakota say that would make tribal-run programs untenable.
"We'd like to run everything on our own," said Jesse Taken Alive, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which straddles South Dakota and North Dakota. "For us, it is part of what we call a decolonization process. We know that they want to give this responsibility back to the tribes. But they want to do it with no money."
The one South Dakota tribe able to afford its own program has the fewest welfare recipients. That tribe, the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux, expects to start its welfare program on Oct. 1, but it has only 80 welfare families out of 5,500 people on its reservation.
The Sisseton-Wahpeton reservation has seen its welfare population shrink in the last few years. A factory that makes plastic garbage bags and three tribal casinos that draw gamblers from North Dakota and Canada have given jobs to dozens of former welfare recipients. Now, tribal leaders say, only a third of the adults who can work are unemployed.
But on the Rosebud reservation, with 20,000 people, a Bureau of Indian Affairs report in 1993 said that only 11 percent of the adults who could work were actually employed.
Sisseton-Wahpeton is prepared to spend up to $200,000 a year to supplement the Federal money it will receive to pay welfare benefits.
"We just felt it was morally right to have our people under our system rather than leave them under the state system," said Gary Johnson, who is not an ethnic Indian but was adopted into the tribe. Kay Bursheim, a member of the tribe who helped draw up its welfare plan, cited another benefit.
"We can be more assertive," Ms. Bursheim said, "and nobody can come back and say we're being biased or racist. Some people are going to need a tough-love approach."
 
Tribe Puts Its Hopes On Flexible Rules
Sisseton-Wahpeton plans to stretch state and Federal rules in its program, which, to pass Federal muster, had to show that it was "really about helping to reduce welfare dependency among tribal members," Mr. Kharfen said.
Under the South Dakota system that began on July 1, the state pays benefits to welfare recipients only if they work or participate in an approved "work activity" like job training or community service. If a recipient goes a month without complying, the family's benefits are cut in half. After two months without working, the family loses all benefits.
The Federal law's intent is to move people to work from welfare, and so it discourages states from reducing their welfare rolls simply by dropping recipients. The law stipulates that after having received welfare for five years over a lifetime -- or, in most cases, for two consecutive years -- a recipient should be dropped and expected to find a job.
The Sisseton-Wahpeton program differs in several ways from the Federal and state requirements. It will allow people to receive welfare for six years over a lifetime, not five. Ten percent of recipients have to be working in the first year of the program, not 25 percent, as Federal law specifies. If people do not fulfill the work requirements, their benefits will be stopped in three months, not two. And the definition of acceptable "work activities" expands.
Lanise Montreal, 22, a welfare mother with a 4-year-old son, Alex, plans to attend a tribal community college to learn to work with computers. Under the state plan, Ms. Montreal would be able to collect welfare for only the first year of college. Then she would have to work. The tribe will allow benefits for at least two years, the time it should take her to receive a degree.
"Now I won't have to worry," Ms. Montreal said in her simple house in Peever Flats, a cluster of houses on the Sisseton-Wahpeton reservation.
Other South Dakota tribes have said that if they could afford it, they would be even more flexible. People would have to work only 16 hours a week, to increase flexibility for needs like child care, not the state and Federal minimum of 20 hours.
Some officials on the Rosebud reservation said they would like to see the definition of work activities include hunting and fishing. Many tribe members stock up on deer and walleye before the bitter winter wind zips people tight inside their homes.
 
In the Meantime, Indians Make Do
The states have incentives to see tribes run their own programs, especially if they do not have to give the tribes money. States would be relieved of responsibility for welfare recipients on reservations, greatly reducing some states' welfare rolls. State caseworkers would no longer have to deal with the cultural and social differences on reservations. And state governments, frequently feuding with tribes over land use or legal authority, would have a chance to offer symbolic support for tribal sovereignty.
But the states have also been given an added burden: making sure that related state-run programs like Medicaid and food stamps are coordinated with the tribal welfare programs.
Deb Bowman, a special assistant to Gov. William J. Janklow of South Dakota, said state officials understood the dire circumstances on many reservations and would help tribes if they did not end up running their own programs. Ms. Bowman said the state was working on ways to offer child care on reservations and to provide transportation from reservations to jobs.
But Ms. Bowman said the state could not afford to give tribes the roughly $5.5 million that the state would spend on welfare if Indians on reservations stayed on state rolls.
"We still have to have our offices on the reservations in order to administer Medicaid and food stamps," she said.
The tribes and Governor Janklow have persuaded Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader, to ask Congress for $5 million a year for three years so the South Dakota tribes could run their own programs. The request will be considered in a few weeks.
The program would be a pilot project in South Dakota and would not help tribes in other states.
In the meantime, the Rosebud reservation is trying to comply with the state's new welfare-to-work program.
The reservation's only significant private employer is a casino, which spends much of its profits on water and electricity for destitute families and on $75 clothing vouchers for the tribe's schoolchildren.
Government programs are among the few places providing work for unskilled people. But those are public service jobs, and the programs will be hard-pressed to pay people salaries after welfare benefits expire. So welfare recipients will be back in the position of trying to find a paying job in an area where few exist.
That, of course, would be a problem, even if Rosebud could run the program. But the Rosebud director of child and family services, Rose Chasing Hawk, said a tribal system would give the tribe more time to develop jobs and job-training programs by keeping people on welfare longer and would help more people go to tribal college.
"What jobs there are on the reservation are jobs that require a degree," Ms. Chasing Hawk said. "Even to be a secretary, you have to have some type of training."
Recently, Bevelyn Brave Hawk, 40, a welfare mother who is bringing up 12 of her 13 children in a house with holes pocking the bedroom walls, landed a tribal government job, cleaning a community center.
"First time I had a job," said Ms. Brave Hawk, who left work a bit early one day to join hundreds of people waiting for clothing vouchers.
Ms. Burning Breast and Ms. Two Elk both had their welfare checks reduced last year because they did not meet the state's previous work requirements. Ms. Burning Breast had trouble with child care, she said, and her mother had wanted to spend time making quilts, something that might qualify as a work activity under a tribal program. They will now work in a Head Start program.
"I've been trying to do my best," said Ms. Burning Breast, who needs four months of study to receive a high school diploma. "I'll just try to qualify for benefits for my babies."

$12.5 Billion Offering Set For France Telecom
The French Government said that it would sell up to 38 percent of France Telecom for some $12.5 billion. The Government said it was retaining a majority stake and therefore the sale would not amount to a privatization. The new Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, has resolutely opposed privatizing France Telecom and Air France.
One-fifth of France Telecom will be sold on the stock market in one of the world's largest initial public offerings, and up to 13 percent will be swapped with other companies, including a 7.5 percent stake with Deutsche Telekom, its main global partner. Employees can also buy shares. [Page D3.]

HEADLINE: Clinton Embarking on a New Nafta Quest

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
President Clinton is about to leap into what promises to be a bruising battle over the expansion of Nafta within Latin America and his powers to negotiate other international trade accords.
Even the hint of a plan to eventually expand America's most famous trade accord is bitterly dividing Democrats and infuriating labor unions. It is also prompting arguments over whether the United States can force other nations into pacts requiring them to raise wages and protect the environment. 
 On Wednesday Mr. Clinton will open a campaign to convince Congress that he desperately needs the authority to negotiate new trade accords if America is to keep up with its economic competitors in Latin America and Asia. His authority to do so expired three years ago.
Mr. Clinton and his aides are marshaling an array of economic and political arguments to make the case that they can wait no longer for that negotiating authority, although Congress is not being asked to vote on any new trade accord and probably will not do so for years.
The Clinton Administration is arguing that the United States has fewer trade barriers than most nations, so negotiations to sweep them away are far more likely to benefit the United States than its competitors. With the economy roaring, the United States is now in a better negotiating position with its trading partners than it has been in decades.
And already, Administration officials warn, Canada and Mexico are striking trade deals with Latin American countries that exclude Washington, a trend that they contend will spill around the globe if Congress does not act fast.
But the reality remains that poll after poll shows Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement, as less popular today than the day it passed it 1993. It remains a symbol of the kinds of global accords that, in the minds of millions, make it easier for a good factory job to disappear even in prosperous times.
So even vague talk about its extension has touched off a battle over whether trade pacts simply steal away American jobs, a battle already tinged with the politics of the next Presidential election.
"This has become a matter of America's global leadership, and the trick is for the President to explain it that way," said Commerce Secretary William Daley, who in the first term, as a special liaison with Congress, was put in charge of pushing Nafta through. "But let's face it: the vast majority of Democrats are not comfortable with it."
Technically the debate hinges on a piece of legislation so arcane that when it was first passed by Congress, in the last days of the Nixon Administration, hardly anyone noticed.
It carries a name that sounds more like the lingo of bookmakers than legislators: "fast track." What it means is that the Administration has the power to negotiate trade accords and submit them to Congress for a quick vote, with no amendments. Without that assurance, other nations around the world say, they will not talk trade with Washington. Every agreement would come unglued, they contend, as soon as it hit the floor of Congress and special interest groups began tinkering with the wording.
"This is a mechanism that has been enormously successful for many years," said I. M. Destler, a professor at the University of Maryland and one of the nation's leading historians on trade talks. "It has enabled the United States to shape the terms of globalization to the advantage of American workers." But after years as a noncontroversial mechanism for facilitating negotiations, Mr. Destler said, "fast track has gradually become a stalking horse for all sorts of other issues."
The three-year lapse in authority is the longest that a President has gone since 1974 without the power to negotiate broad trade agreements. An attempted renewal failed in 1995, and in 1996 the Administration determined that the issue was too volatile and divisive before an election.
In the broadest sense, it has become an argument over the wisdom of free trade accords. But most trade agreements are bilateral deals governing trade in specific products or services, from pharmaceuticals to telecommunications. So the debate in Congress is quickly turning into a re-examination of Nafta, which the Administration insisted in 1993 would become a boon for the American economy, and which opponents argued would be a disaster for American workers.
Not surprisingly, voluminous studies conducted since its passage have reached dramatically different conclusions, depending on who paid for the research. The view of many economists who did not have a stake in the original debate is that Nafta has been far less important to American workers than either its advocates or its opponents predicted.
A widely respected study by researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles concluded that the United States had gained just 2,990 jobs since the agreement took effect, though that figure masked considerable job destruction and job creation in some specific industries. It also concluded that in the long term, the United States would gain more jobs than it lost.
But even the Administration now concedes that it wildly oversold the benefits of Nafta in 1993. A study the White House sent to Congress in July suggested that at most, 90,000 to 160,000 American jobs rely on increased exports to Mexico as a result of the pact. In an economy that has created roughly 11 million jobs over the past four years, that is a statistical blip.
But as the Congressional debate begins, there is reason to wonder whether Nafta is the right example to look at. The trade agreements that Mr. Clinton is considering begin with Chile, a nation far from the American border that seems unlikely to suck away many American jobs or to raise many concerns about illegal immigration and drugs.
Beyond Chile's integration into Nafta, there is talk of a "Free Trade Area of the Americas." But at the Latin American summit meeting Mr. Clinton held in Miami in 1994, the date for that hemispheric accord was set at 2005. A similar free trade area among the nations that make up the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group would only begin in 2010.
"Our biggest problem now is explaining why all this is so urgent," one of Mr. Clinton's economic advisers acknowledged recently.

HEADLINE: Rail Strike Has San Francisco Commuters Creeping Along Alternative Routes

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Traffic around the San Francisco Bay Area crept along for hours at times today as a two-day railway strike left thousands of commuters struggling to get to work and back.
"This was the heaviest traffic I've ever seen," said Scott Johnston, a software company manager who commuted today by car pool to San Francisco from his home in the East Bay town of Lafayette. "It was so bad that I'm thinking of staying home tomorrow." 
 On Sunday morning, workers for Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, went on strike, shutting down the commuter rail system here that carries 270,000 riders each weekday.
Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. of San Francisco warned at a news conference today that the strike could "cripple the city's economy" and offered his services as an unofficial mediator.
"I seriously doubt we'll reach an agreement today," said a BART spokesman, Michael C. Healy. "But we think if anyone can get the unions to look realistically at the issues, the Mayor can, so we welcome his help."
Several union leaders and top BART officials met this afternoon in Mayor Brown's office. The main issues in the dispute are wages and the railroad's two-tier system of employment. New employees work six years to reach journeyman status, and even then, their earnings are limited to 90 percent of the salaries of colleagues who have more seniority.
Without BART, morning commuters turned to buses, ferries and cars in their effort to get to work on time.
"It was an hourlong wait to get on the ferry," said Andrea L. Wright, who normally drives to her job as a hospital manager but chose to travel by boat to avoid the traffic. "Every seat was taken."
The backup was the worst on the Bay Bridge, which connects San Francisco and Oakland. The bridge on normal days is the busiest toll bridge in the nation, and by 4:30 A.M. today, traffic on it was at a crawl, said Jeff A. Weiss, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation.
"I've never seen such heavy traffic that early before," Mr. Weiss said, estimating that an additional 50,000 cars were on local roads because of the strike. "The problem is the Bay Bridge is already beyond capacity."
Major San Francisco employers like the Bank of America, Levi Strauss & Company and the Pacific Gas and Electric Company said they were encouraging employees to work from home or during off hours to bypass rush-hour traffic.
"There are definitely fewer people in the office today," said Robert C. Wynne, a spokesman for Bank of America, which employs 9,300 people in San Francisco. "Some people are using the strike as an excuse to try telecommuting or take the day off and wait and see if they'll resolve it."
In the afternoon, Officer Ruth O'Brien of the California Highway Patrol described "seriously long lines at the ferries." But, Officer O'Brien added, "traffic on the Bay Bridge looked light."
Traffic was backed up on major highways around the Oakland Alameda County Coliseum, she said, but much of that could probably be attributed to a football game scheduled for tonight.
If the strike does not end soon, its economic impact will become a major concern for Mayor Brown, his press secretary, Kandace Bender, said.
"Common sense tells you that if 270,000 people are unable to get to San Francisco in a timely fashion, that will have an impact on the economy. It just will," Ms. Bender said. "It's a horrendous inconvenience."
Sympathies among more than a dozen commuters interviewed this morning were divided, but the majority sided with BART management.
"I think it's a tragedy, really, that the union is hung up upon squeezing money out of the public," said John M. Smith, a legal consultant who rode his black BMW motorcycle over the Golden Gate Bridge to work today. "The workers are very well paid, and frankly, greedy."
BART maintenance workers, who belong to the Service Employees International Union Local 790, earn a base wage of $48,000 a year. Train operators and station agents, members of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555, make $40,900, placing them among the highest paid transit workers in the country.
Members of both unions rejected an offer from management that would have raised their pay 3 percent a year for three years.
Stacey L. Richman, 27, who works for United Way and who normally commutes by BART, said she supported the union.
"Just because it's inconvenient for us doesn't make it wrong for them to look out for their interests," Ms. Richman said, "and I do think the two-tier system is wrong."

HEADLINE: CLINTON PROMOTES EDUCATION TESTING GINGRICH OPPOSES

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
President Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich staked out opposing positions today on national educational testing as Congress planned for crucial votes perhaps as early as Tuesday on the program that Mr. Clinton has made a centerpiece of his second-term education agenda.
At an elementary school in Gambrills, Md., on his first day back from vacation, Mr. Clinton said support for his call to develop national tests for fourth-grade reading skills and eighth-grade math abilities should transcend partisanship. 
 "I think every American -- Republicans, Democrats, independents -- should favor high standards," he said. "I think people from all backgrounds should want all of our children to learn at a high level."
Children were clustered around him as he spoke at the school, about 25 miles northeast of Washington, under a banner proclaiming, "Educating Everyone Takes Everyone!"
But with conservative Republicans deeply suspicious of anything that could be seen as a Federal intrusion into local control of schools, Mr. Gingrich said today: "The President is focused on the wrong end. He's focused on Washington bureaucracy, Washington regulations, Washington red tape."
At a news conference in Detroit before a speech to the Economic Club of Detroit, Mr. Gingrich said, "We believe he ought to be focusing on local parents, local students and local teachers."
The battle over Mr. Clinton's plan for developing national tests to measure educational performance is one of many confrontations looming over education, as Republicans and Democrats alike plan to carry competing education agendas into the 1998 midterm Congressional elections to woo suburban swing voters.
Mr. Clinton proposed the national tests to allow parents and local school districts to assess student performance. While several such tests now exist, they are given to samplings of students and are not useful in determining how an individual student or school is performing.
To head off conservative opposition, Mr. Clinton repeated that use of the tests by states and school districts would be voluntary. "No school or school district will be forced to use them if they don't want to," he said. "But they will give us a sense of a national level of achievement in reading for fourth graders and math for eighth graders."
Recently, in an effort to further assuage the Republican Party, he also said the tests would be developed by the National Assessment Governing Board, a bipartisan, independent board created by Congress.
Democrats in the Senate said they thought that Mr. Clinton's pledge to use the independent board would win him support for the testing in the Senate, where a vote could come as early as Tuesday, as part of the spending bill that finances education.
Democratic negotiators said they were close to agreement with Republicans on a compromise under which the G.O.P. would withdraw an amendment to block the Education Department from spending money to develop the tests and would instead require the department to turn development of the tests over to the independent board.
But the situation was fluid. Senator Dan Coats, the Indiana Republican who co-sponsored the amendment, has not agreed to withdraw it, said his spokesman, Erik Hotmire. "Talks are continuing," he said. "There is not an agreement.
Even if the Senate approved the plan, opposition remains strong in the more conservative House, which could vote as early as Tuesday on its own amendment, by Representative William F. Goodling, to block the Education Department from spending money to develop the tests.
Mr. Goodling, the Pennsylvania Republican who leads the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, has argued that in the past decade 46 states have already set higher standards and created new tests. He says that another test will not help students who are performing poorly.
"What they don't need is one more standardized test to tell them and to tell their parents one more time that they are not doing well," Mr. Goodling said. "They know that." He said money should be put into classrooms instead. The Education Department is spending $15 million to develop the tests this year and President Clinton has asked for another $16 million in the next fiscal year.
Mr. Goodling has been drawing support from both ends of the political spectrum and said he thought his amendment would pass.
Conservatives like Gary Bauer, the head of the Family Research Council, have long warned against an expanded Federal role in schools. "It's an attempt by the Education Department to usurp more control from the states and local communities over the education of our children," Mr. Bauer said in a statement about the national testing plan.
Some liberal Democrats like Representative Major R. Owens of Brooklyn have also come out against Mr. Clinton's plan because, they say, not enough Federal money is being spent on schools to make sure that the poorest urban students do well.
A split vote by the Senate and House would mean that the issue would be decided in a conference committee, where Republicans would have to consider a possible veto fight with Mr. Clinton on an education issue.
The President made no veto threat today, with aides saying he did not want to disrupt Senate negotiations. But his spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said a testing ban "is not going to become law, one way or another."
Mr. Clinton did give a clear display of how he planned to stump for the issue as he asked the children who surrounded him how many books they had read over the summer.
"I want to make sure we give a reading test to every fourth grader in America," he said, "so we'll know if the children need help measuring up to national standards, we'll know if a class needs help, we'll know if a school needs help."

HEADLINE: Bilingual Education Keeps Students in School;
Economics Are a Factor

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Diane Ravitch (Op-Ed, Sept. 5) cites the dropout rates of Hispanic students as proof that bilingual education has failed. That Hispanic students with low English proficiency drop out at higher rates than Hispanic students with high English proficiency has been proved in education studies to result from differences in socioeconomic status. 
 Students with low English proficiency are most often children of immigrant parents who have been in this country for a short period of time. The parents tend to have less education and income than parents of Hispanic students born in the United States.
Ms. Ravitch suggests immersion programs as a preferred alternative to bilingual education. Most studies agree that how students adapt to the school environment has a lasting effect on success. Immersion can only make this adaptation more traumatic for non-English-speaking students, suggesting grave consequences for their future educational success.

HEADLINE: THE WARMING WORLD: Coping With Climate Change;
Experts on Climate Change Pondering: How Urgent Is It?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
WITH the nations of the world counting down to a Dec. 10 deadline for negotiating cuts in emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases that many scientists say are altering the earth's climate, a fundamental question continues to pervade the debate:
Just how urgent is the problem of climate change? 
 The problem has often been perceived as lying off in the dim future -- a century away, say, since that is the time scale on which most analysis of the question has been based. It can be very hard to get excited about something that seems so remote. "We see the train coming," President Clinton said not long ago, "but most ordinary Americans in their day-to-day lives can't hear the whistle blowing."
Mainstream scientists say that the whistle is getting louder all the time, that many signs of a changing climate are already evident. On the night of Aug. 20 and 21, for instance, a cloudburst poured up to nine inches of rain on New Jersey in three hours. No conclusions about climate change can be drawn from a single downpour. But it provided one more data point in what Government scientists say is a clear trend in the United States: heavy rainstorms have become more common, making damaging floods more likely, and over all it is raining more than it used to.
Other parts of the world have also experienced increases in precipitation in this century. And while the trend's association with global warming is not yet firmly nailed down, mainstream scientists say it is precisely, and unsurprisingly, what would be expected as the earth's atmosphere heats up.
The average surface temperature of the globe has risen by about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the 20th century, and about half a degree in the last 40 years -- with temperatures generally rising more the farther away one gets from the Equator. A warmer atmosphere sucks up more water from the oceans and in general makes more moisture available to developing storms. Observations show that atmospheric water vapor has increased. Therefore, the scientists say, global warming may well be revving up the planet's rainmaking machine.
A rainier world is just one of several climatic changes already observed that are associated with the warming, scientists say. Temperatures have risen more at night than in the day, portending milder winter evenings but also more deadly heat waves. Experts, for instance, attributed the record death toll in Chicago's 1995 heat wave mainly to a combination of unusually high nighttime temperature and humidity.
The area of the Northern Hemisphere covered by snow has generally declined in the last 25 years. Mountain glaciers have receded in many areas. Sea level has risen as warmth has caused the water to expand. Spring comes earlier and fall arrives later in Northern latitudes, which have become about 10 percent greener.
"The climate reality is that if you look out your window, part of what you see in terms of the weather is produced by ourselves," said Thomas R. Karl, senior scientist at the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C. "If you look out the window 50 years from now, we're going to be responsible for more of it."
Mr. Karl has not been known as a doomsayer on the question of global warming. It was he and his colleagues who analyzed 20th-century climatic data for the United States and southern Canada and found that both overall precipitation and the frequency of intense rainstorms and snowstorms had, on average, increased by about 10 percent over the century. Intense storms were defined as those in the top 10 percent, in terms of the amount of precipitation delivered, at the start of the century.
The trend, said Mr. Karl, is consistent with what would be expected in a world made warmer by greenhouse gases -- principally carbon dioxide, which is produced by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.
This is only the beginning, if a panel of more than 2,000 scientists advising the world's governments is right. While no one is predicting apocalypse any time soon, the scientists' best estimate is that the world will warm by more than another half degree in the next 20 years if greenhouse emissions are not reduced (although the underlying trend would surely be modified from time to time by natural climatic variations). With another half degree of warming, the average global temperature would approach the highest experienced in the 10,000 years since the last ice age, said Dr. Thomas J. Crowley, a paleoclimatologist at Texas A & M University.
A century from now, according to the scientific panel's best estimate, the earth's surface will be some 3.5 degrees warmer than in 1990. "You have to go back millions of years to find global temperatures like that," said Dr. Crowley. By way of comparison, it was 5 to 9 degrees colder in the depths of the last ice age.
The panel predicted that the warming would bring widespread climatic, environmental and economic dislocation. Some benefits are expected to result, including longer growing seasons in Northern Hemisphere breadbaskets and more robust plant growth stimulated by increased carbon dioxide. But many effects would be adverse, including intensified cycling of water through the ocean-atmosphere system that would result in both more frequent and severe floods and droughts; it would rain harder but things would dry out more and faster between storms. Sea level is expected to rise by about a foot and a half, inundating many low-lying coastlines. Climatic zones would shift away from the Equator, upsetting natural ecosystems. Entire forest types might disappear. Agriculture in some parts of the world, especially Africa, might be devastated. The geographical range of tropical diseases would expand.
Not all scientists agree with Mr. Karl and the international scientific panel, and the disagreement is symptomatic of a more general, nagging uncertainty that plagues all efforts to gauge the urgency of the climate problem. The uncertainty also complicates the task of negotiators from around the world as they struggle to determine how much and how rapidly greenhouse gas emissions should be cut. The negotiators' next session is in Bonn in late October, with a final session in Kyoto, Japan, in the first 10 days in December.
"Yes, there have been these big climate changes, but I think they're all natural," said Dr. William M. Gray, a climatologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins who has been skeptical that greenhouse gases are altering the climate. "I respect Tom Karl a lot, but I don't agree with his interpretation of his data." Another skeptic, Dr. Richard S. Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says that the natural system has built-in resilience -- "it has to wobble a bit" -- and that the observed changes are an expression of this. Since he believes that global warming is expected to amount to little, Dr. Lindzen believes there is little or no urgency.
The potential Achilles' heel in the mainstream scientists' projections of future climate is that they are based on computerized models of the atmosphere's response to estimates of future greenhouse gas emissions. Everyone agrees that the models are imperfect, and Dr. Lindzen goes so far as to liken them to Ouija boards, but many experts believe they are steadily improving and becoming more realistic. In any case, they say, there is no other way to even begin to cope with the atmosphere's complexities.
The international panel of scientists, which was established by the United Nations and is called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, relied heavily on the models in rendering its landmark judgment, two years ago, that "the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate." The cautiously phrased statement, a compromise product of intense discussions, was a watershed in the climate debate because until then the panel had always said the observed warming and attendant climate changes could have been a result of natural variability.
Since then, some opponents of action to cut greenhouse gases have seized on an article in the May 16 issue of the journal Science, which dealt with uncertainties surrounding the panel's conclusion that humans are probably altering the climate, to suggest that the uncertainty has grown.
But that is disputed by the chief author of the intergovernmental panel's chapter on detection of human influence on climate. The scientist, Dr. Benjamin D. Santer of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who was quoted in the Science article, said in a recent interview that further studies have not only reinforced the original conclusion, but might even strengthen it. And in a recent open letter, he said that despite large uncertainties, "the question is not whether, but rather to what extent" greenhouse gases are influencing the climate. The best evidence, he wrote, "suggests that the human component of climate change is not trivially small."
The size of that component remains, perhaps, the major uncertainty in gauging how urgent the climate change problem is.
But if the intergovernmental panel is right, the average global surface temperature will rise by about a third of a degree Fahrenheit per decade over the next century if greenhouse gases are not reduced.
Many scientists believe that no matter what action is taken in Kyoto, some substantial measure of future warming is already assured.
"We haven't seen the full ramifications" of the greenhouse gases already emitted, said Dr. Kevin Trenberth, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. The reason is that built-in inertia, mainly stemming from a drag on heating exerted by the oceans, prevents the climate system from reacting immediately to the emissions. Only about half the warming potential of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere has been realized, said Dr. James E. Hansen, a climatologist who directs the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.
What this means, he said, is that even if greenhouse gas emissions suddenly ceased today, "you'd get a few tenths of a degree" of global warming in the next quarter century.
But emissions are not going to cease now, since any policy adopted in Kyoto would require some time to have any appreciable effect. This means that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases would continue to grow. "You can't turn that off" right away, said Dr. Trenberth. He noted that even if emissions were reduced to 1990 levels -- a target that most industrialized nations are already failing to meet -- atmospheric concentrations would continue to rise indefinitely. This is because the 1990 levels were already so high.
Dr. Hansen says that "what we do now is not going to have much influence on climate change in the next couple of decades; the main impact of changes we make now will be 50 and 100 years downstream." Consequently, he believes, climatic change is going to become "more apparent over the next decade or so." Dr. Hansen has long been a firm adherent of the view that greenhouse gases are the major cause of the observed warming.
Some scientists, while convinced that humans are changing the climate in important ways and that greenhouse warming is a serious issue, believe that taking no action now would have little appreciable climatic effect. One is Dr. Tom Wigley of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who said, "Just from a pure climate point of view, another 20 years of doing nothing is unlikely to mess things up." He acknowledged that many experts would not agree, and quickly added, "I'm not saying we should do nothing for 20 years." For one thing, he said, "the longer we delay, then the more we have to do later."
How much to do now is the crux of the discussions that will culminate in Kyoto. The decision is complicated by the fact that while the intergovernmental panel estimated a 3.5-degree increase in average global temperature by 2100, it also said the increase could be as low as 2 degrees and as high as 6.
This poses a dilemma, in the view of Dr. Michael E. Schlesinger, a climatologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign: If the warming is on the low end of the panel's estimate and the Kyoto delegates decide to do too much, it will be too costly to the world economy. But if it is on the high end and they decide to do too little, climatic damage will be too high and it will still be too costly.
What should governments do? "We should not do nothing and hope for the best; that's crazy," Dr. Schlesinger said. "On the other hand, we shouldn't do everything, either; we don't want to squander resources on something that might turn out to be a nonproblem." He and others call for an adaptive strategy in which at least some action is taken now, and then both the climatic effects and the economic cost of acting are periodically reassessed. Mid-course corrections would be made as needed. This principle is, in fact, built into the 1992 Rio treaty on climate change, under which the present negotiations are proceeding.
But then a further difficulty arises, in Dr. Schlesinger's view. Since the effects of any emissions reductions undertaken now would not be apparent in the next two decades, it would be impossible to tell for some time whether the right thing was done. And if the reductions did subsequently succeed in mitigating the warming, that very fact would make it harder to know how serious the warming would otherwise have been, and therefore what further action might or might not be needed.
"That," said Dr. Schlesinger, "is what's so difficult about this cockamamie problem."

As governments negotiate cuts in emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases, scientists look for signs of climate change. The map at right shows a trend toward more precipitation at higher latitudes and less in the tropics over the last century -- the kind of change computer models predict would occur in a warming world.
 
Further Signs of Change
 
GLOBAL MEAN TEMPERATURE
The atmosphere has warmed by about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the 20th century, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
 
SEA LEVEL RISE
The global sea level has risen by up to 10 inches in the last 100 years, and much of the rise may be related to the increase in global mean temperature.
 
PRECIPITATION PATTERNS
Intense rainstorms and snowstorms have become about 10 percent more frequent in the United States and southern Canada in the 20th century, Government scientists say.
 
FREQUENCY OF WINTER CYCLONES
The number of intense cyclone events per winter has been on the upswing in recent years.

HEADLINE: A Smart Aleck's Second Chance;
At 18, the 'Squirt TV' Guy Resumes His Pop-Scene Assault

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS

 BODY:
At 14, Jake Fogelnest started his own public-access television show in Manhattan. At 16, he was the host of his own talk show on MTV. At 17, he was unemployed and in a drug rehabilitation clinic. Now, at 18, he is back, rebuilding his career as a radio host, producer, musician, record executive, comedian and more. In just four years, Jake Fogelnest has completed a career cycle that typically spans a lifetime. And he still lives with his mother.
"My dad has said once again I have the world by the neck," Mr. Fogelnest said over dinner recently at the Coffee Shop in Union Square. 
 Although Mr. Fogelnest is 18, he still looks 14. A scrawny guy in an oversize blue T-shirt with a thin growth of black hair that looks out of place on his baby face, Mr. Fogelnest has made a career out of being a smart aleck.
At a recent star-filled party in SoHo, he walked up to Russell Simmons, the rap mogul, and asked if he could be booked on his black-comic television show "Def Comedy Jam." It was not the first time he had asked Mr. Simmons the question. He later snuck up on the shock-rock star Marilyn Manson, petted his fur coat, grabbed a random male passer-by and announced that they were now engaged. Then, after being introduced to the rapper and executive Sean (Puffy) Combs, he said in deference, "It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Puff Daddy, sir." That was just the beginning of a night of flippancy.
Mr. Fogelnest's fearless, wisecracking city-kid demeanor is what made his public-access show, "Squirt TV," so appealing when it first appeared on Manhattan cable television in January 1994. The show's concept was basic: Mr. Fogelnest sitting on his bed talking to a stationary camera about music, the week's tabloid news and whatever else was on his mind. Occasionally he interviewed visiting musicians and passers-by outside, asking them challenging questions like "Have you seen Chris Farley naked?" and "If a kid had a lemon for a head, would it be fair to tease him?"
Before he had taped a dozen episodes of "Squirt TV," Mr. Fogelnest was phoned by a few new fans: Mike D. of the Beastie Boys, Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, John Flansburgh of They Might Be Giants and Eric Bogosian.
"I've tried to figure out what made my show so successful on public access and what made people like me and want to do stuff with me," Mr. Fogelnest said. "I think it was the fact that here's a 14-year-old kid who's not a big tough guy, talking trash about whatever he wants without fear of offending anyone. I didn't care. I had no friends. Everyone in seventh grade hated me."
Though Mr. Fogelnest had been monkeying around with his parents' video cameras since he was 6, the show was all his own idea and recorded with a camera he bought with money from summer jobs. He also credits his success to the creative background of his mother (a freelance art director who works with DC Comics) and his father (a criminal-defense lawyer who puts out a magazine, The Fogelnest Files, filled with the year's most bizarre news clippings), who separated when he was a toddler.
"After all that Jake has experienced, considering that his age is only 18," said his mother, Murphy Fogelnest, "staying focused on his ongoing desire to build an empire that satisfies his creative wit, financial independence and desire to sleep late in the morning seems to be a challenge he is more than capable of meeting on his own. But that's only Jake's mother's opinion, without prejudice, of course."
In early 1995, MTV, pop culture's quickest star-making machine, offered to pick up "Squirt TV." After making the grade as a host on MTV's spring break shows and creating an hour of "Squirt TV" for Comedy Central, Mr. Fogelnest began "Squirt TV on MTV," though not without a dispute: MTV wanted to record the show in a studio, and Mr. Fogelnest wanted to keep using his bedroom, near Little Italy.
In the end, youth and perseverance paid off, and the bedroom was beamed to millions of homes twice a week, with the Fugees, the Wu-Tang Clan, Adam Sandler, Sean Lennon and others stopping by and subjecting themselves to absurd questions.
In one memorable episode, he challenged the Hong Kong action-movie star Jackie Chan to a video game of Mortal Kombat and won. Though the show lost its homemade charm, it was still a success, and after a three-month trial run MTV renewed it for eight more episodes.
 
'I Didn't See It In Myself'
But trouble was building, from money disputes to Mr. Fogelnest's increasing disappearances. "I became so obsessed at MTV with the idea of making a million dollars and being successful and being independent and being on my own, that I completely lost sight of what I was doing," he now admits.
"I was also probably difficult to deal with because I was in the teen angst rebellion period, which I used to make fun of. But I didn't see it in myself when it happened."
When it came time for MTV to make a second run of "Squirt TV" episodes, Mr. Fogelnest was nowhere to be found. Days passed, weeks passed, a month passed. He had abandoned MTV, so MTV abandoned "Squirt TV." Suddenly, Mr. Fogelnest reappeared in the East Village, performing stand-up comedy at the Luna Lounge, showing old episodes of "Squirt TV" across the street at the Pink Pony cafe and talking about his recent dances with drug abuse.
"He went from being a fresh-faced little kid -- a squirt -- to going down this path I didn't like, where he was hanging out with a bunch of undesirables and dating this older woman," said Shelby Meade, who has handled his publicity, without charge, since 1994. "Then all of a sudden, he checked out. I heard from people he may have been using drugs, then I looked at his behavioral patterns and thought he probably was.
"But now that he's back, he's really becoming an adult. He has a really strong understanding of the entertainment business, and he's much more mature. I'm really proud of what he's done with his life."
Mr. Fogelnest said he did not like to dwell on his monthlong disappearance, during which he put himself back on track at a rehabilitation clinic. "That stuff finds you," he said. "I never got that bad. I could have gotten a lot worse. You're 16 years old, you're on MTV, you're out of your mind, and you lose sight of what's important. I'm glad to have that behind me as early as I did. When you're younger, you bounce back quicker."
Mr. Fogelnest lights a cigarette and attempts to clear up one more misconception: "I never slept with Courtney Love either."
Though the rumor (which Howard Stern asked him about on the air) may seem ludicrous, Mr. Fogelnest does like to befriend musicians 10 and 20 years his elder, he said, "because they know more."
In conversation, Mr. Fogelnest speaks about the goings-on at record labels and MTV like a seasoned industry player. And he constantly talks about such friends as Russell Simins of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, the MTV executive Amy Finnerty, the 18-year-old Australian rocker Ben Lee and Mike D., who, as a musician, record executive and magazine publisher, has been one of his idols.
"I relate to Jake in the sense that I was no different," Mike D. said. "I was going to clubs in Manhattan when I was 14. I kind of idolized older punk-rock and hip-hop bands, and I was like 15 when I started the Beastie Boys. And what business did we having doing that at that age? Jake could've been hanging out with us then."
Mr. Fogelnest's propensity for seeking the acceptance of his elders in the music industry has not always succeeded. Marilyn Manson and his group put him in a highchair at the fetish-theme restaurant La Nouvelle Justine in Chelsea and ordered him a spanking; the band Weezer dropped ice cubes down his shirt backstage at Roseland, and the singer Henry Rollins chastised him for 20 minutes during a radio interview, telling him to change his life and get pants that fit. But most of these have been good-humored gibes at one of the entertainment industry's more resilient figures.
He has already moved far beyond his experiences at MTV. He is the host of a radio show on the New York radio station known as K-Rock (WXRK, 92.3 FM) every Sunday at midnight, and he is one of the few disk jockeys with some control over the music he plays. He is producing an album for a rock band from Oklahoma called Epperley. He says he is days away from signing a contract to become a consultant and talent scout for a major record label. He is writing articles for Grand Royal, the magazine run by the Beastie Boys. He is preparing to make his debut as a human beatbox in a rock band. And he recently traveled to Scotland, where he met with television executives interested in discussing future "Squirt TV"-type projects.
 
'A Lot of Doors Open to Me'
Though Mr. Fogelnest has done a little of everything at an age when most teen-agers are worrying about S.A.T. results, he still is not sure what to do next or five years from now.
"There are a lot of doors open to me right now, and I just have to pick the right ones," he said. "I'm 18 years old, and Squirt TV happened really fast. It also ended really fast. So I'm into a slow build now, because I don't have to rush. All my friends keep telling me: 'Just relax. You don't have to hold yourself to the standards you've made for yourself in comparison to us, who are much older and have been doing this for years.' And that part of it has finally sunk in. Maybe I'll surprise everyone and go to college."
For Mr. Fogelnest, there are disadvantages to being a local celebrity so young. After dinner, he called his mother to check his messages and walked to the Beauty Bar on East 14th Street to meet some friends. As he waited in line outside, the bouncer recognized him: "Hey, you're from 'Squirt TV.' "
"Yeah, that's me," Mr. Fogelnest responded with a smile.
The bouncer smiled back and said, "Then you're definitely going to have to show me ID."

HEADLINE: California Is Big Enough

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The notion that population growth is good for California and, for that matter, for the United States, is ridiculous (front page, Sept. 3). Any benefits seen in California are short term and will hurt the state in the long haul. Most of the people who are moving into the state are unskilled, and many are illiterate. 
 In contrast, population growth due to the booming high-tech industry is relatively small. Yet this is responsible for the recent economic growth of the state.

HEADLINE: Debt Incurred By Consumers Soared in July

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Consumer installment credit climbed in July by $6.5 billion, or at a 6.4 percent annual rate, after a revised $800 million increase in June, or at a rate of eight-tenths of 1 percent, the Federal Reserve said today.
The July increase was well above the forecasts of Wall Street economists for a $4.3 billion rise and reflected a strong bounce in borrowing to buy new cars and in credit-card use. 
 Previously, the Fed said June consumer credit was unchanged from May.
The overall rise in July consumer credit was the strongest in three months, since it gained by $9.6 billion in April.
Total credit outstanding grew by $2.7 billion in May.
In July, auto credit outstanding shot up by $3.6 billion, or at a 10.9 percent annual rate, after a much smaller $900 million increase at a 2.8 percent rate in June.
Revolving, or credit-card, credit was up by $5.4 billion, or at a 12.5 percent annual rate in July -- the strongest monthly rise since last January, when it advanced $7.3 billion, or 13 percent, the Fed said. Credit-card debt had risen $2.4 billion, or at a 5.6 percent rate, in June.
Other credit, which includes consumer bank loans like those for mobile homes and to pay for education, but not real estate mortgages, fell $2.5 billion in July. That was the same as the $2.5 billion reduction in June.
Before seasonal adjustment, total consumer credit outstanding in July was $1.218 trillion, up from $1.158 trillion in July 1996.

HEADLINE: Ms. Albright's Daunting Agenda

 BODY:
Madeleine Albright could hardly have found a dicier time to make her first visit to the Middle East as Secretary of State. Not only has the peace effort between Israel and the Palestinians all but collapsed, but regional powers like Saudi Arabia and Iran are asserting themselves in ways that may undermine America's leadership in the area. As Ms. Albright works her way through the region this week, she will need all her vaunted bluntness and determination to keep instability at bay.
Washington's role in the Middle East has not been as problematic since before the Persian Gulf war in 1991. The war made the political and military landscape more favorable to peace by weakening Iraq and demonstrating the potential benefits of cooperation between the United States, Israel and leading Arab countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia. But the gulf war coalition, which indirectly opened the way to peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians though Israel itself was not a member, has lost cohesion in recent years. The dynamic works two ways. When the peace talks falter, strains in the coalition increase, and when the informal alliance is divided, as it is today, the pressure for peace diminishes. 
 Ms. Albright can address the first part of the equation by getting Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasir Arafat talking again. It will not be easy. The Israeli Prime Minister justifiably insists that negotiations cannot resume until the Palestinian leader cracks down on terrorists. Ms. Albright properly plans to make plain to Mr. Arafat that his indifference to terrorism has stunted the peace. She need not be tactful in delivering the message. Mr. Arafat must understand that any tolerance for terrorism is unacceptable and that his coy minuet with Palestinian terrorists will sink the peace effort.
Mr. Netanyahu should recognize that Israel, though understandably anxious about its security, can be more selective in its punishment of Palestinians and ought to avoid provocative actions like new construction projects on the West Bank and in Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem. While there is no equivalency between bombs and bulldozers, as Ms. Albright said earlier this summer, Israeli actions do influence the overall climate for peace.
A resumption of peace talks would help Ms. Albright hold together the American-led coalition. Arab leaders, disturbed by the lack of progress, skeptical of Mr. Netanyahu's intentions and doubtful that the economic benefits of regional cooperation will materialize, are drifting out of the American orbit. Saudi Arabia, for one, has threatened to boycott an annual Mideast economic conference supported by the United States and attended by Israeli representatives and instead may go to a meeting organized by Iran.
Some of this impatience is posturing. No country in the region is more dependent on American military protection than Saudi Arabia or more fearful of a resurgent Iraq. But the breakdown in peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, coupled with the election of a more moderate President in Iran, has created opportunity for mischief.
Ms. Albright cannot untangle the problems in one visit. But if she fails to budge anyone, the decline of the peace effort and erosion of American leadership in the Mideast could quickly get worse.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
For Asia, Austerity and Exports

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS

 BODY:
Now that nearly all the nations of Southeast Asia are reeling under a wave of currency losses, how will they extract themselves from their economic mess?
Probably the same way that Mexico did not so long after it was hit by a devastating currency collapse: exports. 
 Already, the economic crisis in Southeast Asia threatens growth there and raises questions about the sustainability of the success these nations have generally enjoyed over the last decade. And even under the best of circumstances, countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines are going to have to throttle back on their domestic growth to reinforce the advantage that a cheaper currency will provide them in selling goods abroad.
"A decade of boom is ending in a bust," said Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Primark Decision Economics in Boston. "There is a big question mark over the Asian region and a big risk for the world economy."
Indeed, almost any expected outcome will deliver at least a dose of bitter medicine to the rest of the Asian continent and the world. As austerity takes hold, Japan is expected to suffer the most, since Southeast Asia takes about a quarter of its exports.
But as the other countries adopt Indonesia's announced prescription last week of fostering export-led growth, renewed trade squabbles with the United States and the Europeans are likely to break out in certain industries.
These will probably be manageable, a number of analysts say, in part because the Southeast Asian economies are still not large enough to disrupt prevailing patterns of international trade. Together, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand -- three of those hardest hit -- account for only 3.2 percent of world exports. That compares with 2.8 percent for the United States, which has sustained an export boom despite increases in the value of the dollar.
And the United States is not the dominant market for these economies. It absorbs 17 percent of Malaysia's exports, 11 percent of Thailand's and 7 percent of those from Indonesia and the Philippines.
The biggest question facing the fast-growth nations of Southeast Asian is whether they will emerge from this crisis permanently damaged, or will use the opportunity to improve their ability to compete with China's giant economy.
Stock markets in the region, after repeated blows in recent weeks, improved sharply Friday and generally again yesterday. Indonesian stocks rose on hopes that last week's deregulation package might allow interest rates to come down faster than expected. Malaysia's benchmark index soared to a two-week high after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad ended the stock-trading restrictions that Malaysian officials had imposed late last month. And Thai stocks staged their biggest rally in more than a month.
Many economists argue that the region will recover from the current crisis in a relatively short time. "Experience elsewhere of falling currencies and higher interest rates points to slower growth," said Desmond Lachman, director of emerging-market research at Salomon Brothers. "But this could be beneficial if they take all the steps needed to restore competitiveness, especially against China."
C. Fred Bergsten of the Institute for International Economics in Washington agrees. "In the short run, they face retrenchment and belt-tightening to restore confidence," he said. "But in the longer run, they will see this crisis as a wake-up call for reform. These countries are smart and pragmatic."
At least one economist, Gary Hufbauer of the Council on Foreign Affairs, warns that the tendency of officials in Malaysia and Thailand to blame foreign speculators for their difficulties, and to intervene in their markets, suggests that they may turn their backs on the free-market approach urged by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank if their fortunes do not improve relatively quickly. "A lot is riding on an Asian recovery," he said, "because if these countries don't pull out of the downturn after two years or so, it will raise a huge cloud over the Washington consensus."
What is unclear is just how bad the domestic downturns will be and how low their currencies will have to go for strong growth to resume.
Mexico may provide a model. When it suffered from a 50 percent loss in the value of the peso against the dollar between November 1994 and March 1995, the deficit in Mexico's current account -- the overall balance of trade and investment -- shrank from 7 percent of national output in 1994 to a manageable three-tenths of 1 percent the following year. Mexico's exports to the United States and the rest of the world, by then much cheaper, surged.
But the cost of re-establishing confidence in the peso was recession -- a brutal turnaround in the economy from 4.5 growth in 1994 to a 6.2 percent contraction the following year. Only in 1996 did Mexico start growing again.
Few economists think that the Asian currency problems will wreak such havoc. And many say that Thailand is likely to take the brunt of the blow, with Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines emerging relatively unscathed. ING Barings, Merrill Lynch and J. P. Morgan all expect Indonesia and Malaysia to sustain growth rates of 6 to 8 percent this year and next. They forecast growth of 4 to 5 percent for the Philippines.
Still, J. P. Morgan warns in its latest Global Data Watch publication that because of the expected slump in capital investment and the need to increase exports, the region as a whole "will shift from being a net booster of demand in the rest of the world to being a net drag."
And some are even less sanguine. "The emerging nations of Southeast Asia -- not just Thailand -- will suffer longer and more difficult adjustments ahead than those forecast thus far by the major investment houses," said Lisa S. Kaess of Geoffrey Bell & Company, a New York financial adviser.
Even the pessimists agree, though, that investment in the region will pick up again to take advantage of more favorable exchange rates as soon as Southeast Asia takes steps to upgrade its mixture of products and reassure investors that the region can stay ahead of the threat from the vast new export capacity coming on stream in China.
The Chinese, according to the World Bank, received $52 billion of foreign direct investment last year, roughly one-fifth of all private capital flows to developing countries. And since 1994, they devalued their currency 35 percent against the dollar and gave exporters a 17 percent tax rebate. All in all, the price of China's exports has fallen by nearly 25 percent in the last three years. Ultimately, that is what Southeast Asia must respond to.

Dollar Up in Thin Trading

 The dollar rose against leading currencies yesterday, helped by market rumors that August employment data for Germany would show further weakness and help keep interest rates there low.
Further helping the dollar was a modest rally in American financial markets, a Japanese monetary official's endorsement of low interest rates and a drop in the British pound on data that seemed to reduce prospects for higher interest rates there.
But dealings were thin, and traders were reluctant to draw long-term conclusions from the currency market's behavior. Many predicted little significant movement in dollar exchange rates pending release of data on United States producer prices and retail sales on Friday.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.8068 German marks, up from 1.8024 on Friday, and 121.17 Japanese yen, up from 121.06. The British pound cost $1.5820, down from $1.5939.

Bond Prices Rise a Bit After Last Week's Selloff

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Treasury securities were higher yesterday, with selling on advances limiting the session's gains. Activity was thin, so movement was exaggerated. Many market participants came into the session believing that last week's selloff was a bit overdone.
The 30-year bond rose 11/32, to a price of 97. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.61 percent, from 6.64 percent on Friday. Traders largely expect the market to trade in a narrow range most of the week, until Friday, when retail sales and producer price numbers are to be released. 
 Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors, describes them as "the two blockbuster statistical economic releases this week, which should reveal that both consumer demand and pricing pressures appear to be accelerating as we proceed into the third quarter of 1997." That outlook was disconcerting to many market participants, he added.
Referring to a speech on Friday night by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, who questioned the reliability of key economic statistics, Mr. Chan said, "Some people drew the conclusion that the chairman is concerned that we have had a lot of growth, but with little inflation." He added, "But now if we begin to add more growth and start showing early signs of inflation, the Fed's degree of complacency could change."
Also, market participants are wondering how more than $12 billion of corporate debt that is expected to be priced over the next few days will affect yields. Yesterday, Amresco Residential Capital Markets Inc. priced a multi-part asset-backed issue through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter. Yields ranged from 5.962 percent for securities with an average life of 0.51 year to 7.7945 percent for one with an average life of 6.98 years. There are also a number of securities priced from 19 basis points to 97 basis points over the one-month London interbank offered rate. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In addition, several borrowers from around the world are expected to price issues in the public market this week. Argentina, Venezuela and the Korean Development Bank are each expected to raise $1 billion.
Doug Burtnick, managing analyst for Technical Data in Boston, said, "The investment community has still not shown an interest in buying the market on rallies." These investors, he added, "buy dips and they may even sell rallies to make room for the new corporate issuance." He said, "This can only last as long as the economic data are mixed, and the prospects for a Sept. 30 tightening remains low."
Richard Medley, president of the Medley Investment Group, said that one result of Mr. Greenspan's speech was a squeeze on short positions in the Treasury market. Short- covering occurs when some market participants sell borrowed securities, hoping to buy them back later at lower prices, thereby pocketing the difference. However, if prices begin to rise instead of fall, as they did yesterday, these participants try to cover their short positions: that is, buying back the securities to limit their losses.
Interest rates at the regular weekly bill auction dropped yesterday in what traders said was a better-than-expected auction. The average rate for a three-month maturity was down 6 basis points, to 5.01 percent, from last week, while the six-month bill was awarded at an average rate of 5.14 percent, down 5 basis points.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:

Bills	Average Price	98.734	97.401	Discounted Rate	5.01%	5.14%	Coupon Yield	5.14%	5.35%	High Price	98.736	97.412	Discounted Rate	5.00%	5.12%	Coupon Yield	5.13%	5.33%	Low Price	98.731	97.401	Discounted Rate	5.02%	5.14%	Coupon Yield	5.16%	5.35%	Accepted at low price	14%	41%	Total applied for	$51,484,288	$49,199,974	Accepted	$11,648,438	$11,816,163	Noncompetitive	$1,174,664	$1,097,867

HEADLINE: Small-Company Stocks Continue to Gain

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING

 BODY:
After meandering, major stock market indexes finished higher yesterday in moderate trading as investors looked for underpriced stocks and sectors.
Despite a seemingly tranquil session, the Russell index of 2,000 companies, a major index of small-company stocks, and the Nasdaq composite index again hit record highs, as airlines and technology stocks rose. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 12.77 points, to close at 7,835.18, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 companies finished at 931.20, up 2.15 points. Analysts said they expected stock prices to continue moving in a narrow range this week as investors awaited some initial indications of inflation in August. Several economic reports are scheduled for release on Friday.
"You don't have a malaise, but you don't have the makings of everybody having to go out and buy stocks right now," said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at Cowen & Company in New York.
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who questioned the reliability of several economic statistics in a speech in California late Friday, did not roil markets yesterday, but investors are becoming increasingly worried that the Fed may feel it needs to curb economic growth by raising interest rates before the end of the year, Mr. Pradilla and other analysts said.
Investors continued to favor small-cap stocks by pushing the Russell index up 2.95 points, to 435.99, its eight consecutive high.
The Nasdaq composite index increased 9.58 points, to a new high of 1,645.35.
Two airline sector indexes were among the best performing yesterday, in response to a move by the major airlines to raise ticket prices by 5 percent, even though two carriers -- Delta Air Lines and AMR's American Airlines -- backed off the increase yesterday. The American Stock Exchange airline index, which includes the 10 largest airline companies, gained 5.4 percent, while the 12-company Philadelphia airline sector index rose 5.19 percent.
The fare increases, a sign of strong fall bookings and airlines' confidence about meeting third-quarter earnings forecasts "gave a whole bunch of investors a reason to jump" into the stocks, said Thomas S. Schreier, a director of equity research at Credit Suisse First Boston.
AMR climbed 4 3/16, to a new high of 110 7/16. Delta Air Lines gained 5 points, closing at 99 5/16. Northwest Airlines, which initiated the price increase last week, picked up 3 1/8, to 40 1/4.
In contrast to the market's roller-coaster ride in August, September seems to be opening somewhat sedately. In the first five trading sessions this month, the Dow closed more than 100 points higher or lower only once, on Sept. 2, when it advanced 257.36 points. But analysts believe the halt in volatility is just a brief respite.
"I think when you get to the end of this week, the market could be nervous," said Robert Froehlich chief investment strategist at Zurich Kemper Investments. "We've sort of convinced ourselves that the Goldilocks economy is alive and well. That will last until Wednesday."
By tomorrow, investor concerns about the Producer Price Index and retail sales reports, which are scheduled for Friday, should cause an increase in volatility, Mr. Froehlich said.
Meanwhile, announcements of expected third-quarter earnings shortfalls continued to hurt some companies.
Cymer fell almost 13 points yesterday after the company announced that third-quarter earnings might fall below expectations. It closed at 69 1/8, off 12 7/8.
Worldcom was the most actively traded issue yesterday as the company agreed to acquire Compuserve for $1.2 billion. As part of the transaction, Worldcom will also purchase an America Online communications network in exchange for Compuserve's on-line service and $175 million.
Worldcom closed at 33 3/4, up 2 1/4, while Compuserve slipped 3/16, to 13 5/16.
Shares of America Online jumped 6 1/8, to a new high, closing at 76 1/16, after the company announced that it would purchase Compuserve's on-line business.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong's Leader Heads for U.S. to Correct 'Misconceptions'

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Tung Chee-hwa, the man chosen by Beijing to run Hong Kong, left today for his first visit to the United States since Britain returned this territory to Chinese control on July 1. He said the visit was intended to correct American "misconceptions" about Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong that Mr. Tung will discuss with President Clinton, members of Congress and interested Americans is flourishing economically. But it has no democratic institutions, has undergone a sharp contraction of civil liberties and apparently has three times the number of people it did 25 years ago who are living in poverty, in part because of an aging population and the large number of immigrants from China who do not have the skills that enable them to work in an increasingly non-manufacturing ecnonomy. 
 "I'm looking forward to going to the U.S.," said Mr. Tung, a shipping tycoon. "Really to tell my friends in America what is happening in Hong Kong, not only about the transition, but what is going on."
Mr. Tung was dissuaded from visiting the United States in the months leading up to Chinese rule, in part because of criticism over his decision to roll back certain rights.
Now, however, with two months of calm behind him, Mr. Tung said he is ready to spread news of Hong Kong's success under Chinese rule to skeptics in the United States, particularly to members of Congress who have been critical of Beijing.
Mr. Tung said he expected to meet with President Clinton, who met last spring with Martin Lee of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, which opposed Beijing's move to disband the elected legislature. He also hopes to meet with other Administration officials and key members of Congress.
"The Government is functioning as normal," said Mr. Tung. "The financial market is moving. Demonstrations are continuing, arguments everywhere. The legislative body is just as assertive as before, challenging everything we want to do."
Still, many people here, including Mr. Tung himself, believe he will face a hostile audience in explaining why Hong Kong is considered not ready for democracy.
Mr. Tung has proposed an electoral system that would give Hong Kong's leading companies and banks a major say in the legislature's composition.
Under his proposal, seats would be distributed to parties according to their proportion of total votes. A third of the seats would be chosen by companies, banks and professional associations. This arrangement is likely to prevent the Democratic Party, which won the largest share of seats in the fully elected legislature of 1995, from winning a large number of seats in elections next May. Because even losers in the elections will gain legislative seats, as permitted under a proportional voting system, and because companies are dominated by conservative business people, the Democratic Party's share of seats is almost certain to fall sharply.
Mr. Tung's view of how things are going is not shared by legislators who were removed from office by China on July 1 and replaced with a body of lawmakers of its choosing.
"It is a step backward -- it's highly undemocratic," said Mr. Lee, describing Mr. Tung's proposal.
The rosy picture painted by Mr. Tung was clouded somewhat today by a report by a group of university academics, the Hong Kong Social Security Society, which found that 856,000 people, 14 percent of the territory's population, are living beneath the poverty line of $358 a month.

Latest Cyberdeal Seems to Have Room for Two Winners

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Follow the money in yesterday's big Internet deal -- an intricate transaction involving Worldcom, Compuserve and America Online -- and it seems that the real value lies in the dull plumbing of cyberspace, not the glamour of new media.
Worldcom Inc., the nation's fourth-largest long-distance phone company, agreed to pay about $1.2 billion in stock for the Compuserve Corporation. It will keep the under-the-hood side of Compuserve's business, managing data networks and providing data services for big corporate clients. 
 In the next step of the deal, Worldcom will sell Compuserve's well-known but struggling on-line service to America Online for the equivalent of $250 million. In short, the plumbing of Compuserve, which is controlled by H & R Block, is worth nearly $1 billion, while its on-line service amounts to pocket change by comparison.
Shares of Worldcom rose sharply yesterday, up $2.25, to $33.75, and were the most actively traded, with nearly 14.6 million changing hands. But if Worldcom jumped, then America Online shares soared, closing up $6.125, to $76.0625.
The enthusiasm was not only because America Online had cut a good deal, but also because the acquisition should help it further a strategy of becoming a genuine media company -- and one able to draw more revenue from advertising and electronic commerce like on-line shopping.
Advertising and commerce now account for about 15 percent of America Online's revenues -- up from next to nothing a couple of years ago -- with the rest coming from monthly subscription fees. The company wants to see the advertising and marketing revenues rise sharply in the coming years, toward the level of 50 percent.
The key to attracting advertising dollars is building an audience on the scale provided by mainstream media. And America Online certainly appears well on its way. Today, it is by far the largest on-line service, with 9 million subscribers. By purchasing Compuserve, the second-largest on-line service, America Online, which is based in Dulles, Va., would add 2.6 million more subscribers worldwide. That would lengthen America Online's already yawning lead over its nearest remaining rival, the Microsoft Network, which has 2.3 million subscribers.
"The next stage of the Internet economy is that the media companies will start to make money, not just the infrastructure suppliers as has been the case until now," said Kate Delhagen, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
"America Online is taking a leading role in that development, and acquiring Compuserve is a big step ahead," Ms. Delhagen said. "You assemble an audience of more than 10 million subscribers, and Madison Avenue has to pay attention."
In the deal, America Online is increasing its focus as a media company not only by adding subscribers, but also by selling its ANS Communications unit to Worldcom.
Less than three years ago, America Online bought ANS, once the Internet's network backbone and run by the National Science Foundation. America Online paid $35 million for ANS, seeking greater vertical integration and less dependence on major telecommunications companies.
Today, the ANS investment seems to have been a particularly shrewd one for America Online, and one that points to the rising value of high-speed digital communications gear that keeps the Internet running. For ANS, Worldcom will give America Online Compuserve's on-line service and a cash payment of $175 million, putting a value on ANS of about $425 million.
To be sure, America Online invested in ANS and Worldcom will assume $150 million in ANS lease obligations, which are the equivalent of debt. Still, the ANS investment has been a big winner for America Online, perhaps providing more profit in the last few years than the company's basic business.
Yet Wall Street is evaluating America Online far less by its near-term profits than by its progress in assembling a working business model for the hybrid media, called interactive services, that combine communication, entertainment, information and on-line shopping. The company's market valuation -- or total market capitalization -- rose sharply yesterday to more than $7.4 billion.
But Stephen M. Case, America Online's chairman, noted yesterday that it would be years before cyberspace was considered a mass medium. In the United States, the on-line population has more than doubled in two years but still represents fewer than 20 percent of all households. "Today's deal really is a step toward the promise of a connected society," he said. "But there is still a lot of work to be done to make interactive services a mass-market media."
The deal, executives said, is expected to take three to six months to be completed. It is subject to approval by the shareholders of the respective companies and will also be subject to review by the Justice Department's antitrust division as well as the European Commission, since both America Online and Compuserve have hundreds of thousands of subscribers in Europe.
Mr. Case said he expected no challenge on antitrust grounds because the Internet business was still so young and relatively easy to enter. The list of current and prospective rivals, he said, includes Microsoft, Walt Disney, Time Warner and AT&T. "It's a pretty daunting list of potential competitors," he said.

HEADLINE: Computer on Mir Fails, Forcing Crew to Shut Down Equipment

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 8

 BODY:
The Mir's computer broke down again today and forced the crew to shut down most of the space station's equipment.
Russian and American space officials played down the seriousness of the computer crash, the third aboard Mir since mid-July. The station was able to maintain its orientation toward the Sun, and its power supplies were in much better shape than during the previous breakdowns. 
 Ground controllers said they hoped to repair and restart the computer on Tuesday. In the meantime, they said, the crew was in no danger.
"Why do these malfunctions happen?" asked Vladimir Solovyov, the chief of Russia's Mission Control. "Do you know why your car breaks down? It's hard to say what the reasons might be."
Valery Lyndin, a space agency spokesman, said, "The computer has become capricious again."
Capricious is as good a word as any to describe the Mir's endless, and endlessly vexing, journey around the Earth for the last eight months or so. The space station, which has been aloft for 11 years, has spun from one mishap to the next -- from a fire to oxygen system breakdowns, from a collision with a cargo ship to the repeated computer breakdowns.
Mir's computer became unplugged on July 17 when a crew member accidentally disconnected a cable, then broke down again on Aug. 18 during docking of a cargo ship.
In the latest fumble, the computer shut itself off at about 3 A.M. today, and the crew responded by turning off most systems to economize on power, Mr. Lyndin said.
The crew said later today that they had enough power for normal operations, but had turned off all systems it did not immediately need, including the Elektron oxygen-generating system. The existing oxygen supply is good for several days, and there are also backup oxygen canisters if needed.
The space station's gyroscopes, which keep the station pointed toward the Sun, went down when the computer went off-line. However, the astronaut Pavel Vinogradov said the Mir was maintaining its proper position, the Interfax news agency reported.
In the previous breakdowns, it took hours to bring the computer system back up and several days to fully restore all functions.
There were indications that Mir might bounce back quicker this time. Rob Navias, a NASA spokesman speaking from the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said Mir's solar batteries were filled with juice Monday, in contrast to the previous two breakdowns.
He said he expected the Mir crew to re-boot the computer within a day, and replace a part. Then the crew will spin the gyroscopes back up to resume automatic steering of the station.
Mr. Solovyov, the Mission Control chief, said the computer would be brought back up on Tuesday.
"We will download the necessary information into it to restore it to working order tomorrow," he added.
It has been a trying week for the Mir's crew, which includes two newly arrived Russian astronauts and the American astronaut Michael Foale. On Saturday Mr. Foale and the Mir commander, Anatoly Solovyov, spent six hours on a space walk trying to find holes in the skin of a punctured module, but came up empty. The recent accidents have raised questions about safety aboard the Mir, which was launched in 1986 with an expected life span of five years.

HEADLINE: Chance of Tobacco Deal in '97 Gets Slimmer

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
President Clinton will not offer an opinion on the proposed tobacco accord until next week at the earliest, aides said today, further diminishing chances that Congress will act on the accord this year.
Senior advisers, including Donna E. Shalala, the Health and Human Services Secretary, and Bruce Reed, the President's chief domestic policy aide, are completing recommendations on the complex proposal. Those recommendations will be presented to the President this week, officials said. 
 The President was originally to have offered his views on the proposal, which was announced on June 20, in late July. But that timetable slipped as aides discovered that the 68-page settlement document negotiated by state attorneys general, plaintiffs' lawyers and tobacco executives raised perplexing questions of law, economics and public health.
In Texas, state officials and tobacco lawyers said today that they were prepared to try that state's suit against the industry, now set to begin on Sept. 29, unless a national accord was reached in the next few weeks.
It has been clear from the beginning that Mr. Clinton would not endorse the settlement plan without demanding significant changes. The White House has signaled that the President will insist that Federal regulatory authority over tobacco be strengthened, that penalities for failing to meet targets for reductions in tobacco use by the young be increased and that the overall cost to the tobacco industry be raised.
Under the proposed settlement, the cigarette manufacturers would pay $368.5 billion over 25 years and agree to stiff Federal tobacco regulation and broad restrictions on marketing and advertising. In return, 40 state lawsuits would be dropped and the industry would get immunity from most other tobacco-related litigation.
There appear to be two principal reasons the proposal has produced little sense of urgency at the White House.
First, critics of the proposal in Congress and among public health experts have objected to it as a bailout of an outlaw industry that does not go far enough toward reducing addiction to nicotine. These critics include many influential Democrats on Capitol Hill as well as powerful health voices, including Dr. David A. Kessler, the former Commissioner of Food and Drugs, and Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General.
The President, aides said, will be loath to endorse a plan that lacks the blessing of these forces.
And second, some political advisers within the White House welcome a delay in debate on the accord. They believe that the tobacco makers' bargaining position weakens by the day and look forward to confronting the manufacturers over teen-age smoking and Government regulation of nicotine next spring as the election season begins.
In a related development, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, said today that he expected Congress to repeal a $50 billion credit for the tobacco industry that was slipped into the balanced-budget deal last month. The provision was meant to offset a new 15-cents-a-pack tax on cigarettes to finance health care for children.
The White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said that Mr. Clinton supported the repeal of the provision.
If Congress does not act to rescind the tax break, Mr. McCurry said, Mr. Clinton will insist that the $50 billion be added to the cost of a tobacco settlement.
In Texas, Attorney General Dan Morales said today that the prospects for an out-of-court settlement of the state's $14 billion case -- which seeks to recoup the state's Medicaid costs for treating ill smokers -- were "essentially zero."
The cigarette makers' lead attorney, Dan Webb, told reporters in Texarkana, Tex., where the case is to be tried in Federal court, that the companies were prepared to try the Texas case and dozens of other state claims one by one unless a national deal was reached to settle them all at once.
"We are going to trial, no question," Mr. Webb said. "Under no circumstances will this case be settled outside of the global resolution."
Mr. Morales and Mr. Webb appeared before Judge David Folsom of Federal District Court, who wanted to assess the prospects for a pretrial settlement.
Florida and Mississippi have already reached multibillion-dollar agreements with the major tobacco companies to settle their Medicaid claims.
Another three dozen states have pending suits against the industry, but most are not likely to go to trial for several years.

HEADLINE: IN PRIMARY TODAY, DEMOCRATS SELECT GIULIANI OPPONENT

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
With a flurry of rallies, advertisements and street-and-subway stumping, three Democratic candidates for New York City mayor brought their campaigns to a close last night, encountering relatively small crowds and often uninterested voters as they struggled to draw attention to today's primary.
"I'm city Councilman Sal Albanese, Democrat candidate for mayor. Give me a chance!" said Mr. Albanese as he sought to buttonhole commuters rushing up the crowded stairway at the 72d Street subway on the Upper West Side. 
 Fifty blocks north, the Rev. Al Sharpton gazed across a rainy and poorly attended primary eve rally on 125th Street and somberly predicted victory today. "We're here on the eve of an upset," he told perhaps 100 people who came to hear him speak.
Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, who is widely considered the front-runner, spent the day traveling to all five boroughs, dismissing as impossible any chance that she would get less than 40 percent of the vote and be forced into a runoff. Instead, Ms. Messinger presumed victory and moved, before a vote was cast, to set the table for a contest against Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
"People understand that after I win the primary, I'm going to be the underdog," Ms. Messinger said as she embarked on a walking tour of Harlem. "But this is a city that has a long tradition of listening to underdogs, of paying attention to underdogs, of rallying around them."
With these appearances, a last-minute burst of television advertising by Mr. Albanese and Ms. Messinger, and radio advertising by all three candidates, the mayoral candidates wound down one of the least eventful political contests New York has seen in many years. The candidates found themselves answering questions about how low the turnout would be today, and defending the campaigns they had run.
"I think this is a campaign that people are just beginning to pay attention to," Ms. Messinger said.
Besides the mayoral primary, there is a strongly contested six-way race for the Democratic nomination for Manhattan borough president, primaries for Brooklyn and Bronx borough president and several City Council district primaries. The polls open at 6 A.M. and close at 9 P.M.
There was one last flicker of disagreement among the candidates in the final hours of the race. Mr. Albanese, who has been increasingly irritated over what he sees as the unfair presentation of Ms. Messinger as the front-runner in the primary, used a radio interview yesterday to describe her as a candidate without a philosophy, and doomed to lose to Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Albanese's decision to criticize Ms. Messinger in the relatively low-profile radio interview came after he repeatedly declined to assail her while she sat next to him during a series of debates this weekend.
In a gesture with obvious symbolism, Mr. Albanese ended his campaign in the heart of Ms. Messinger's base, the Upper West Side, even paying brief calls to two well-known local food stores, Zabar's and Fairway.
Mr. Giuliani, in City Hall, said the Democrats were facing a low turnout because of what he described as "very, very excessive negative campaigning." The Mayor suggested that voters should consider staying home in protest.
"Each one of them has spent most of their time being exceedingly negative and personal in the way in which they've campaigned," Mr. Giuliani said. "And I think voters don't like that any more. And I think they will record some of that by having at least a fairly low turnout."
In truth, the Democratic candidates have largely refrained from attacks on one another, although they have attacked Mr. Giuliani's performance as Mayor. Mr. Giuliani's remarks may have partly served as a pre-emptive maneuver to head off any criticism of him once he begins what his aides say will be an intense battering of his expected rival, Ms. Messinger.
Another Republican, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, said he would begin a three-week television campaign today that would blame liberals for hurting the public school system. Mr. D'Amato's advertisements would appear to be directed at Ms. Messinger, who has made Mr. Giuliani's education record the central issue of her campaign.
Mr. D'Amato denied that yesterday, saying he was only trying to advertise his own concern with the issue in advance of his own contest next year, though he could not help offering some advice to Mr. Giuliani's expected rival. "If she had half a brain, she would be attacking me," Mr. D'Amato said. "It would rally the liberals around her."
Ms. Messinger did not need the advice. "Al D'Amato is exactly the kind of supporter that Rudy Giuliani deserves," she said when asked about the radio advertising during her stop in Harlem.
In addition to Mr. Albanese, Mr. Sharpton and Ms. Messinger, two other lesser-known candidates appear on the primary ballot today: Roland Rogers, a businessman, and Eric Ruano-Melendez, a civil engineer who works for the city.
Ms. Messinger spent most of her day talking about the Mayor, but Mr. Albanese focused on Ms. Messinger, describing her as "the weakest candidate" the Democrats could put up.
'She is running a campaign without core values," he said. "One week she attacks the rich; the next week she attacks workers. She polls, and basically accommodates positions based on polling. That's why her campaign hasn't taken off. That's why she's going to lose tomorrow."
Mr. Sharpton, at his rally last night, predicted he would win and asserted that he had forced his rivals to work harder and talk about the issues he has stressed this year, police behavior and the economy.
"They thought when we announced this campaign that it was a joke," he said. "But the last two or three days, we've wiped the smile off their faces. Nobody's laughing now. They're all out hustling or working."
Of the three main candidates, Ms. Messinger appeared the least concerned about today's vote, dismissing any hint that she might fall below 40 percent and be forced into a runoff. "I'm going to win tomorrow night, without a runoff," she said.
She described Mr. Giuliani as "a bully" and said: "I'm ready for whatever he's planning to shell out. I'm going to be talking to people in this city about we can make this a better city. I will give as good as I get."
But Ms. Messinger received a hint of her difficulties as she stopped off at the Country Club diner on Staten Island. Two women eating dinner looked up as Ms. Messinger entered with her small entourage.
"Is that Liz Holtzman?" one asked.

HEADLINE: Tribes' New Power Over Welfare May Come at Too High a Price

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: ROSEBUD SIOUX RESERVATION, S.D.

 BODY:
On the wind-scarred grassland stretching past Ghost Hawk Lake, Monica Burning Breast, 25, single and pregnant with her third child, has spent her life in a world on welfare.
Government checks have let her bring up her 3- and 5-year-old sons in a beaten-down brown bungalow on this stark, sprawling reservation east of the Badlands. Shoehorned into the same house, her mother, Lorraine Two Elk, is rearing three other children on welfare. 
 Some reservation families are so poor, living in isolated enclaves like Upper Cut Meat and He Dog, that on food-stamp day, they can obtain transportation to the nearest supermarket only by paying for it with some of the milk and bread that they intended to feed to their children.
Though tribal leaders around the country fear that life for Indians like Ms. Burning Breast and thousands of others may become even tougher under the new Federal welfare law's work rules -- daunting requirements in rural, often remote areas with few jobs -- the law may also give those leaders a small chance to soften the blow. In a little-noticed provision in the year-old welfare law, Indian reservations are, for the first time, given the right to run their own programs. The states are the only other entities allowed to set rules on who can receive welfare and for how long.
The same law that gave tribes this new opportunity, which Indian organizations say may be the United States Government's strongest recognition yet of Indian sovereignty, failed to provide enough money for many tribes to take advantage of it.
So tribes like the Rosebud Sioux are caught in a wrenching dilemma. If they choose to run their own programs, they may be able to tailor them to be more sensitive to the people on the reservations, or even more demanding, if necessary. But without sufficient money, the tribes may end up hurting the people they are trying to help, or further squeezing the tribe's resources.
Congress requires states to pay for part of their own welfare-to-work programs, usually at least a third of the cost, and the Federal Government pays the rest. But Congress did not require a state to contribute money for welfare programs run by Indian tribes living within that state, because lawmakers were reluctant to anger state governors. Under the law, the tribes are entitled only to the Federal share. The law also did not provide start-up money for tribes to set up welfare offices by buying computers and hiring caseworkers.
Although states are generally eager to shift the responsibility for reservation welfare to the tribes, most are not eager to shift the resources. Some states say they need the money to shoulder the additional cost of workfare programs; others say that a program not under state control should not be financed by the state.
Many tribes say that without that money, running their programs would be impossible.
"This was something that was anticipated with a great amount of enthusiasm out in Indian country," JoAnn K. Chase, executive director of the National Congress of American Indians, said of the opportunity to design their own welfare rules.
Some tribes had reported that state-run welfare programs were causing some people to leave reservations, Ms. Chase said, because they could not find jobs.
"We looked at this as a true opportunity to make a significant advancement in tribal sovereignty," she said. "But in order for the tribes to do this, they'll just need flat out the money to make it work."
 
Without State Money, A Deal Out of Reach
Of the 557 federally recognized Indian tribes, 11 have applied for approval to run welfare programs. Two have received permission, and the other applications are in the pipeline. Those 11 tribes -- 4 in Wisconsin, 2 each in Oklahoma, Arizona and Oregon and 1 in South Dakota -- are generally smaller and have less poverty than other tribes.
Oregon and Arizona have agreed to give the tribes the money that would have been spent if the tribal members had stayed on state welfare rolls, said Michael Kharfen, a spokesman for the Federal Department of Health and Human Services.
In South Dakota, Indians make up 7.4 percent of the population but account for 53 percent of the welfare recipients. State officials say they can afford to give tribes only a one-time infusion of start-up money. Eight of the nine tribes in South Dakota say that would make tribal-run programs untenable.
"We'd like to run everything on our own," said Jesse Taken Alive, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which straddles South Dakota and North Dakota. "For us, it is part of what we call a decolonization process. We know that they want to give this responsibility back to the tribes. But they want to do it with no money."
The one South Dakota tribe able to afford its own program has the fewest welfare recipients. That tribe, the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux, expects to start its welfare program on Oct. 1, but it has only 80 welfare families out of 5,500 people on its reservation.
The Sisseton-Wahpeton reservation has seen its welfare population shrink in the last few years. A factory that makes plastic garbage bags and three tribal casinos that draw gamblers from North Dakota and Canada have given jobs to dozens of former welfare recipients. Now, tribal leaders say, only a third of the adults who can work are unemployed.
But on the Rosebud reservation, with 20,000 people, a Bureau of Indian Affairs report in 1993 said that only 11 percent of the adults who could work were actually employed.
Sisseton-Wahpeton is prepared to spend up to $200,000 a year to supplement the Federal money it will receive to pay welfare benefits.
"We just felt it was morally right to have our people under our system rather than leave them under the state system," said Gary Johnson, who is not an ethnic Indian but was adopted into the tribe. Kay Bursheim, a member of the tribe who helped draw up its welfare plan, cited another benefit.
"We can be more assertive," Ms. Bursheim said, "and nobody can come back and say we're being biased or racist. Some people are going to need a tough-love approach."
 
Tribe Puts Its Hopes On Flexible Rules
Sisseton-Wahpeton plans to stretch state and Federal rules in its program, which, to pass Federal muster, had to show that it was "really about helping to reduce welfare dependency among tribal members," Mr. Kharfen said.
Under the South Dakota system that began on July 1, the state pays benefits to welfare recipients only if they work or participate in an approved "work activity" like job training or community service. If a recipient goes a month without complying, the family's benefits are cut in half. After two months without working, the family loses all benefits.
The Federal law's intent is to move people to work from welfare, and so it discourages states from reducing their welfare rolls simply by dropping recipients. The law stipulates that after having received welfare for five years over a lifetime -- or, in most cases, for two consecutive years -- a recipient should be dropped and expected to find a job.
The Sisseton-Wahpeton program differs in several ways from the Federal and state requirements. It will allow people to receive welfare for six years over a lifetime, not five. Ten percent of recipients have to be working in the first year of the program, not 25 percent, as Federal law specifies. If people do not fulfill the work requirements, their benefits will be stopped in three months, not two. And the definition of acceptable "work activities" expands.
Lanise Montreal, 22, a welfare mother with a 4-year-old son, Alex, plans to attend a tribal community college to learn to work with computers. Under the state plan, Ms. Montreal would be able to collect welfare for only the first year of college. Then she would have to work. The tribe will allow benefits for at least two years, the time it should take her to receive a degree.
"Now I won't have to worry," Ms. Montreal said in her simple house in Peever Flats, a cluster of houses on the Sisseton-Wahpeton reservation.
Other South Dakota tribes have said that if they could afford it, they would be even more flexible. People would have to work only 16 hours a week, to increase flexibility for needs like child care, not the state and Federal minimum of 20 hours.
Some officials on the Rosebud reservation said they would like to see the definition of work activities include hunting and fishing. Many tribe members stock up on deer and walleye before the bitter winter wind zips people tight inside their homes.
 
In the Meantime, Indians Make Do
The states have incentives to see tribes run their own programs, especially if they do not have to give the tribes money. States would be relieved of responsibility for welfare recipients on reservations, greatly reducing some states' welfare rolls. State caseworkers would no longer have to deal with the cultural and social differences on reservations. And state governments, frequently feuding with tribes over land use or legal authority, would have a chance to offer symbolic support for tribal sovereignty.
But the states have also been given an added burden: making sure that related state-run programs like Medicaid and food stamps are coordinated with the tribal welfare programs.
Deb Bowman, a special assistant to Gov. William J. Janklow of South Dakota, said state officials understood the dire circumstances on many reservations and would help tribes if they did not end up running their own programs. Ms. Bowman said the state was working on ways to offer child care on reservations and to provide transportation from reservations to jobs.
But Ms. Bowman said the state could not afford to give tribes the roughly $5.5 million that the state would spend on welfare if Indians on reservations stayed on state rolls.
"We still have to have our offices on the reservations in order to administer Medicaid and food stamps," she said.
The tribes and Governor Janklow have persuaded Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader, to ask Congress for $5 million a year for three years so the South Dakota tribes could run their own programs. The request will be considered in a few weeks.
The program would be a pilot project in South Dakota and would not help tribes in other states.
In the meantime, the Rosebud reservation is trying to comply with the state's new welfare-to-work program.
The reservation's only significant private employer is a casino, which spends much of its profits on water and electricity for destitute families and on $75 clothing vouchers for the tribe's schoolchildren.
Government programs are among the few places providing work for unskilled people. But those are public service jobs, and the programs will be hard-pressed to pay people salaries after welfare benefits expire. So welfare recipients will be back in the position of trying to find a paying job in an area where few exist.
That, of course, would be a problem, even if Rosebud could run the program. But the Rosebud director of child and family services, Rose Chasing Hawk, said a tribal system would give the tribe more time to develop jobs and job-training programs by keeping people on welfare longer and would help more people go to tribal college.
"What jobs there are on the reservation are jobs that require a degree," Ms. Chasing Hawk said. "Even to be a secretary, you have to have some type of training."
Recently, Bevelyn Brave Hawk, 40, a welfare mother who is bringing up 12 of her 13 children in a house with holes pocking the bedroom walls, landed a tribal government job, cleaning a community center.
"First time I had a job," said Ms. Brave Hawk, who left work a bit early one day to join hundreds of people waiting for clothing vouchers.
Ms. Burning Breast and Ms. Two Elk both had their welfare checks reduced last year because they did not meet the state's previous work requirements. Ms. Burning Breast had trouble with child care, she said, and her mother had wanted to spend time making quilts, something that might qualify as a work activity under a tribal program. They will now work in a Head Start program.
"I've been trying to do my best," said Ms. Burning Breast, who needs four months of study to receive a high school diploma. "I'll just try to qualify for benefits for my babies."

HEADLINE: Clinton Embarking on a New Nafta Quest

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
President Clinton is about to leap into what promises to be a bruising battle over the expansion of Nafta within Latin America and his powers to negotiate other international trade accords.
Even the hint of a plan to eventually expand America's most famous trade accord is bitterly dividing Democrats and infuriating labor unions. It is also prompting arguments over whether the United States can force other nations into pacts requiring them to raise wages and protect the environment. 
 On Wednesday Mr. Clinton will open a campaign to convince Congress that he desperately needs the authority to negotiate new trade accords if America is to keep up with its economic competitors in Latin America and Asia. His authority to do so expired three years ago.
Mr. Clinton and his aides are marshaling an array of economic and political arguments to make the case that they can wait no longer for that negotiating authority, although Congress is not being asked to vote on any new trade accord and probably will not do so for years.
The Clinton Administration is arguing that the United States has fewer trade barriers than most nations, so negotiations to sweep them away are far more likely to benefit the United States than its competitors. With the economy roaring, the United States is now in a better negotiating position with its trading partners than it has been in decades.
And already, Administration officials warn, Canada and Mexico are striking trade deals with Latin American countries that exclude Washington, a trend that they contend will spill around the globe if Congress does not act fast.
But the reality remains that poll after poll shows Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement, as less popular today than the day it passed it 1993. It remains a symbol of the kinds of global accords that, in the minds of millions, make it easier for a good factory job to disappear even in prosperous times.
So even vague talk about its extension has touched off a battle over whether trade pacts simply steal away American jobs, a battle already tinged with the politics of the next Presidential election.
"This has become a matter of America's global leadership, and the trick is for the President to explain it that way," said Commerce Secretary William Daley, who in the first term, as a special liaison with Congress, was put in charge of pushing Nafta through. "But let's face it: the vast majority of Democrats are not comfortable with it."
Technically the debate hinges on a piece of legislation so arcane that when it was first passed by Congress, in the last days of the Nixon Administration, hardly anyone noticed.
It carries a name that sounds more like the lingo of bookmakers than legislators: "fast track." What it means is that the Administration has the power to negotiate trade accords and submit them to Congress for a quick vote, with no amendments. Without that assurance, other nations around the world say, they will not talk trade with Washington. Every agreement would come unglued, they contend, as soon as it hit the floor of Congress and special interest groups began tinkering with the wording.
"This is a mechanism that has been enormously successful for many years," said I. M. Destler, a professor at the University of Maryland and one of the nation's leading historians on trade talks. "It has enabled the United States to shape the terms of globalization to the advantage of American workers." But after years as a noncontroversial mechanism for facilitating negotiations, Mr. Destler said, "fast track has gradually become a stalking horse for all sorts of other issues."
The three-year lapse in authority is the longest that a President has gone since 1974 without the power to negotiate broad trade agreements. An attempted renewal failed in 1995, and in 1996 the Administration determined that the issue was too volatile and divisive before an election.
In the broadest sense, it has become an argument over the wisdom of free trade accords. But most trade agreements are bilateral deals governing trade in specific products or services, from pharmaceuticals to telecommunications. So the debate in Congress is quickly turning into a re-examination of Nafta, which the Administration insisted in 1993 would become a boon for the American economy, and which opponents argued would be a disaster for American workers.
Not surprisingly, voluminous studies conducted since its passage have reached dramatically different conclusions, depending on who paid for the research. The view of many economists who did not have a stake in the original debate is that Nafta has been far less important to American workers than either its advocates or its opponents predicted.
A widely respected study by researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles concluded that the United States had gained just 2,990 jobs since the agreement took effect, though that figure masked considerable job destruction and job creation in some specific industries. It also concluded that in the long term, the United States would gain more jobs than it lost.
But even the Administration now concedes that it wildly oversold the benefits of Nafta in 1993. A study the White House sent to Congress in July suggested that at most, 90,000 to 160,000 American jobs rely on increased exports to Mexico as a result of the pact. In an economy that has created roughly 11 million jobs over the past four years, that is a statistical blip.
But as the Congressional debate begins, there is reason to wonder whether Nafta is the right example to look at. The trade agreements that Mr. Clinton is considering begin with Chile, a nation far from the American border that seems unlikely to suck away many American jobs or to raise many concerns about illegal immigration and drugs.
Beyond Chile's integration into Nafta, there is talk of a "Free Trade Area of the Americas." But at the Latin American summit meeting Mr. Clinton held in Miami in 1994, the date for that hemispheric accord was set at 2005. A similar free trade area among the nations that make up the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group would only begin in 2010.
"Our biggest problem now is explaining why all this is so urgent," one of Mr. Clinton's economic advisers acknowledged recently.

HEADLINE: Rail Strike Has San Francisco Commuters Creeping Along Alternative Routes

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 8

 BODY:
Traffic around the San Francisco Bay Area crept along for hours at times today as a two-day railway strike left thousands of commuters struggling to get to work and back.
"This was the heaviest traffic I've ever seen," said Scott Johnston, a software company manager who commuted today by car pool to San Francisco from his home in the East Bay town of Lafayette. "It was so bad that I'm thinking of staying home tomorrow." 
 On Sunday morning, workers for Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, went on strike, shutting down the commuter rail system here that carries 270,000 riders each weekday.
Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. of San Francisco warned at a news conference today that the strike could "cripple the city's economy" and offered his services as an unofficial mediator.
"I seriously doubt we'll reach an agreement today," said a BART spokesman, Michael C. Healy. "But we think if anyone can get the unions to look realistically at the issues, the Mayor can, so we welcome his help."
Several union leaders and top BART officials met this afternoon in Mayor Brown's office. The main issues in the dispute are wages and the railroad's two-tier system of employment. New employees work six years to reach journeyman status, and even then, their earnings are limited to 90 percent of the salaries of colleagues who have more seniority.
Without BART, morning commuters turned to buses, ferries and cars in their effort to get to work on time.
"It was an hourlong wait to get on the ferry," said Andrea L. Wright, who normally drives to her job as a hospital manager but chose to travel by boat to avoid the traffic. "Every seat was taken."
The backup was the worst on the Bay Bridge, which connects San Francisco and Oakland. The bridge on normal days is the busiest toll bridge in the nation, and by 4:30 A.M. today, traffic on it was at a crawl, said Jeff A. Weiss, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation.
"I've never seen such heavy traffic that early before," Mr. Weiss said, estimating that an additional 50,000 cars were on local roads because of the strike. "The problem is the Bay Bridge is already beyond capacity."
Major San Francisco employers like the Bank of America, Levi Strauss & Company and the Pacific Gas and Electric Company said they were encouraging employees to work from home or during off hours to bypass rush-hour traffic.
"There are definitely fewer people in the office today," said Robert C. Wynne, a spokesman for Bank of America, which employs 9,300 people in San Francisco. "Some people are using the strike as an excuse to try telecommuting or take the day off and wait and see if they'll resolve it."
In the afternoon, Officer Ruth O'Brien of the California Highway Patrol described "seriously long lines at the ferries." But, Officer O'Brien added, "traffic on the Bay Bridge looked light."
Traffic was backed up on major highways around the Oakland Alameda County Coliseum, she said, but much of that could probably be attributed to a football game scheduled for tonight.
If the strike does not end soon, its economic impact will become a major concern for Mayor Brown, his press secretary, Kandace Bender, said.
"Common sense tells you that if 270,000 people are unable to get to San Francisco in a timely fashion, that will have an impact on the economy. It just will," Ms. Bender said. "It's a horrendous inconvenience."
Sympathies among more than a dozen commuters interviewed this morning were divided, but the majority sided with BART management.
"I think it's a tragedy, really, that the union is hung up upon squeezing money out of the public," said John M. Smith, a legal consultant who rode his black BMW motorcycle over the Golden Gate Bridge to work today. "The workers are very well paid, and frankly, greedy."
BART maintenance workers, who belong to the Service Employees International Union Local 790, earn a base wage of $48,000 a year. Train operators and station agents, members of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555, make $40,900, placing them among the highest paid transit workers in the country.
Members of both unions rejected an offer from management that would have raised their pay 3 percent a year for three years.
Stacey L. Richman, 27, who works for United Way and who normally commutes by BART, said she supported the union.
"Just because it's inconvenient for us doesn't make it wrong for them to look out for their interests," Ms. Richman said, "and I do think the two-tier system is wrong."

HEADLINE: CLINTON PROMOTES EDUCATION TESTING GINGRICH OPPOSES

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 8

 BODY:
President Clinton and Speaker Newt Gingrich staked out opposing positions today on national educational testing as Congress planned for crucial votes perhaps as early as Tuesday on the program that Mr. Clinton has made a centerpiece of his second-term education agenda.
At an elementary school in Gambrills, Md., on his first day back from vacation, Mr. Clinton said support for his call to develop national tests for fourth-grade reading skills and eighth-grade math abilities should transcend partisanship. 
 "I think every American -- Republicans, Democrats, independents -- should favor high standards," he said. "I think people from all backgrounds should want all of our children to learn at a high level."
Children were clustered around him as he spoke at the school, about 25 miles northeast of Washington, under a banner proclaiming, "Educating Everyone Takes Everyone!"
But with conservative Republicans deeply suspicious of anything that could be seen as a Federal intrusion into local control of schools, Mr. Gingrich said today: "The President is focused on the wrong end. He's focused on Washington bureaucracy, Washington regulations, Washington red tape."
At a news conference in Detroit before a speech to the Economic Club of Detroit, Mr. Gingrich said, "We believe he ought to be focusing on local parents, local students and local teachers."
The battle over Mr. Clinton's plan for developing national tests to measure educational performance is one of many confrontations looming over education, as Republicans and Democrats alike plan to carry competing education agendas into the 1998 midterm Congressional elections to woo suburban swing voters.
Mr. Clinton proposed the national tests to allow parents and local school districts to assess student performance. While several such tests now exist, they are given to samplings of students and are not useful in determining how an individual student or school is performing.
To head off conservative opposition, Mr. Clinton repeated that use of the tests by states and school districts would be voluntary. "No school or school district will be forced to use them if they don't want to," he said. "But they will give us a sense of a national level of achievement in reading for fourth graders and math for eighth graders."
Recently, in an effort to further assuage the Republican Party, he also said the tests would be developed by the National Assessment Governing Board, a bipartisan, independent board created by Congress.
Democrats in the Senate said they thought that Mr. Clinton's pledge to use the independent board would win him support for the testing in the Senate, where a vote could come as early as Tuesday, as part of the spending bill that finances education.
Democratic negotiators said they were close to agreement with Republicans on a compromise under which the G.O.P. would withdraw an amendment to block the Education Department from spending money to develop the tests and would instead require the department to turn development of the tests over to the independent board.
But the situation was fluid. Senator Dan Coats, the Indiana Republican who co-sponsored the amendment, has not agreed to withdraw it, said his spokesman, Erik Hotmire. "Talks are continuing," he said. "There is not an agreement.
Even if the Senate approved the plan, opposition remains strong in the more conservative House, which could vote as early as Tuesday on its own amendment, by Representative William F. Goodling, to block the Education Department from spending money to develop the tests.
Mr. Goodling, the Pennsylvania Republican who leads the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, has argued that in the past decade 46 states have already set higher standards and created new tests. He says that another test will not help students who are performing poorly.
"What they don't need is one more standardized test to tell them and to tell their parents one more time that they are not doing well," Mr. Goodling said. "They know that." He said money should be put into classrooms instead. The Education Department is spending $15 million to develop the tests this year and President Clinton has asked for another $16 million in the next fiscal year.
Mr. Goodling has been drawing support from both ends of the political spectrum and said he thought his amendment would pass.
Conservatives like Gary Bauer, the head of the Family Research Council, have long warned against an expanded Federal role in schools. "It's an attempt by the Education Department to usurp more control from the states and local communities over the education of our children," Mr. Bauer said in a statement about the national testing plan.
Some liberal Democrats like Representative Major R. Owens of Brooklyn have also come out against Mr. Clinton's plan because, they say, not enough Federal money is being spent on schools to make sure that the poorest urban students do well.
A split vote by the Senate and House would mean that the issue would be decided in a conference committee, where Republicans would have to consider a possible veto fight with Mr. Clinton on an education issue.
The President made no veto threat today, with aides saying he did not want to disrupt Senate negotiations. But his spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, said a testing ban "is not going to become law, one way or another."
Mr. Clinton did give a clear display of how he planned to stump for the issue as he asked the children who surrounded him how many books they had read over the summer.
"I want to make sure we give a reading test to every fourth grader in America," he said, "so we'll know if the children need help measuring up to national standards, we'll know if a class needs help, we'll know if a school needs help."

HEADLINE: Bilingual Education Keeps Students in School;
Economics Are a Factor

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Diane Ravitch (Op-Ed, Sept. 5) cites the dropout rates of Hispanic students as proof that bilingual education has failed. That Hispanic students with low English proficiency drop out at higher rates than Hispanic students with high English proficiency has been proved in education studies to result from differences in socioeconomic status. 
 Students with low English proficiency are most often children of immigrant parents who have been in this country for a short period of time. The parents tend to have less education and income than parents of Hispanic students born in the United States.
Ms. Ravitch suggests immersion programs as a preferred alternative to bilingual education. Most studies agree that how students adapt to the school environment has a lasting effect on success. Immersion can only make this adaptation more traumatic for non-English-speaking students, suggesting grave consequences for their future educational success.

HEADLINE: Youth Study Elevates Family's Role

BYLINE: By SUSAN GILBERT 

 BODY:
THERE is no shortage of efforts in homes, schools and communities to discourage teen-agers from taking drugs, smoking, drinking or having sex. The question is, What really works? One answer, from a major study of adolescents, is that families are more important than previously thought, perhaps as important as peers.
The portion of the study's data that has been analyzed so far did not look at peer pressure, but the findings call into question the idea that peer relationships almost completely eclipse family relationships in their influence over teen-agers' behavior, said Dr. Robert William Blum, one of the study's researchers and the director of the Adolescent Health Program at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. The primacy of peer relationships has been a widely held concept among professionals since the 1960's. 
"There's been a pretty significant myth that peer groups are important and parents are not," Dr. Blum said. "We've focused so tremendously on peer pressure and instituted so many things to deal with peer pressure. And what this study is saying is that family environment matters."
The National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent Health, a survey of roughly 90,000 children, some of them 12 but a vast majority teen-agers, is the largest, most comprehensive study ever conducted on adolescent behavior in this country. It will take a decade to analyze all the data, but the first results are being published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association.
"These findings offer the parents of America a blueprint for what works in protecting their kids from harm," said Dr. J. Richard Udry, the principal investigator and a sociologist at the Carolina Population Center of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.
The most significant finding is that the teen-agers who reported feeling close to their families were the least likely to engage in any of the risky behaviors studied, which included smoking marijuana or cigarettes, drinking or having sex. Nearly as important were high expectations from the parents for their teen-agers' school performance. To a lesser degree, having a parent home at important times of day, like after school, at dinner and at bedtime, was also associated with less risky behavior.
In addition, the study identified school characteristics that were protective. Whether the school was public, parochial or private mattered less than whether the students felt that their teachers cared about them and treated them fairly.
In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Jonathan D. Klein, a pediatrician at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry who specializes in adolescent medicine, wrote that many of the results confirmed what other research has found, like the benefits of a close ties at school and at home. "The sheer size of the study plus the opportunity to get more data are what make this study special," he said in an interview.
The survey suggests that manypreventive measures used by schools and communities are misdirected, Dr. Blum said. "Most of the rules and regulations that schools institute, like suspending students for smoking on school grounds, don't seem to have a significant impact," he said. "We invest heavily in rule development, but that's not where the action is. The action is in adults' connecting with kids."
The study began in 1995 and was conducted in three phases. In the first phase, about 90,000 students from grades 7 through 12 at 145 schools answered questionnaires about themselves.
In the second phase, interviews were conducted with about 20,000 of those students and their parents in the students' homes. To insure privacy, the students listened to questions with headphones and typed their answers into laptop computers. Students were asked about their experiences with smoking, drinking and other kinds of dangerous behavior. In the third phase, the home interviews with the teen-agers were repeated a year later.
The results published today are based on 12,118 of the initial in-home interviews. This sample was representative of the social and economic make-up of teen-agers around the country.
On one level, the results are a report card on teen-agers' behavior. In the survey, 25 percent of the students said they were current smokers, 11 percent said they had smoked marijuana at least once in the past month, 17 percent reported having had alcohol more than once a month and 3 percent said they had attempted suicide in the past year. In addition, 16 percent of the 7th and 8th graders and 48 percent of those in 9th to 12th grade said they had engaged in sex.
The researchers sought to identify particular characteristics of the families, schools or students that seemed to protect against or promote risky behavior. The results were controlled for demographic characteristics like sex, race and socioeconomic status.
Certain factors correlated with lower risks in specific areas. For example, a teen-ager who had been a crime victim was more likely to be associated with violent behavior. And living in a house without easy access to alcohol, drugs, cigarettes or guns was associated with a lower likelihood of drinking, taking drugs, smoking or using guns.
But the only factor that was linked with a lower risk across the board was a close-knit family, the study found. Emotional closeness proved more significant than the amount of time that parents spent with their teen-agers at home, calling into question a prevalent view among experts that parents can make a big difference by being home at important times of day, like after school, Dr. Blum said. Being home at such times was associated with a lower incidence of some behaviors, like smoking cigarettes or marijuana and, only among those in 9th to 12 grade, less frequent alcohol use.
"What this study showed is that it is emotional availability far more than physical presence that makes the difference," Dr. Blum said. "You need to give your kids the message that when they need to talk to you, you're available, even if it's by phone, and that they matter."

HEADLINE: For Food-Stamp Families, a More Uncertain Future

BYLINE: By DONNA ST. GEORGE 

 BODY:
HER refrigerator is nearly empty. There are 10 cans of food left in the kitchen cabinet. Ruth Acosta looks over her meager spread -- sweet peas, instant potatoes, cling peaches, kidney beans -- and a grimace crosses her face.
She has no money left and no more food stamps. 
 "That's it," she says.
Eight days remain until her food stamps will come again, and in Ms. Acosta's cramped little apartment on the Upper West Side, with its broken appliances and holes in the walls and steamy humid air, that means 24 meals to scrounge up for a family of six -- herself, three sons, ages 5, 7 and 12, a teen-age daughter and a grandson, 3.
Ms. Acosta does not know where the food will come from or how her family will get by. But she tries not to panic. This uncertainty comes every month, a period of nothing, bleak and foreseeable. Always, she finds a way to work it out.
For Ms. Acosta, who came to New York 30 years ago from the Dominican Republic but who never lived the immigrant's dream, never tried, never really imagined it, the hardest part may be knowing her troubles are about to get worse.
This month and next month, 900,000 people across the country will lose their food stamps when a Federal law that abolishes aid to legal immigrants is implemented. In New York City, local and state laws will spare children, the elderly and the disabled from the cuts, but that will leave 30,000 to 40,000 legal immigrants eliminated from the food program.
Ms. Acosta, 37, will be one of them. Her family may lose $65 to $75 a month in food stamps, a big hit for people eating on 87 cents a meal each.
A world away from political debates in Washington, Ms. Acosta may not be an argument for welfare nor one against it. But her experiences over the course of eight months, starting last February, offer a glimpse into the lives of others coping with the same problem: making do with little, anticipating less.
In the world of food stamps, Ms. Acosta's household is larger than most. The average is a family of three. Her history with public aid goes back longer than most do -- she had a baby as a teen-ager and decided to stay home rather than work.
But in many ways, her experience is shared by many families. Like three-quarters of New York's 1.2 million people on food stamps, she receives public assistance. Her monthly income consists of $488 in food stamps and $523 in public assistance.
For Ms. Acosta and others, running out of cash and stamps is a common experience. They make do by stockpiling staples. Collecting free food from pantries. Getting loans from friends. Eating with relatives. Using school lunch programs. Taking jobs off the books.
There is a rhythm to life on food stamps in many families -- a sense of well-being at the start of the month, when cupboards are stocked, and a growing worry as weeks go by and dinner becomes less predictable.
HALF a block from the plush greenery of Central Park, Ruth Acosta leaves her West 92d Street apartment wearing worn blue jeans and a baggy jacket, her pocket stuffed with food stamps.
This is the day of the month when Ms. Acosta feels the most prosperous, when she can walk into the grocery store and fill up a shopping cart, when she has choices.
Her food stamps came today.
They arrived as they always do, paid at a currency exchange on her Government-assigned day of the month. Ms. Acosta collects them in the morning, buys meat at a butcher shop and walks to the supermarket with her oldest son, Jason Rodriguez.
Once inside C Town on Columbus Avenue, Jason is all eyes. He fetches a five-pound bag of bright red apples. Then a 98-cent package of green grapes. The lanky sixth grader looks at his mother. She nods. Into the shopping cart they go.
They buy vinegar (73 cents), plantains (six for $1), cooking oil (2 1/2 gallons for $14.99), white rice (20 pounds for $6.99), dried red beans (99 cents), generic cornflakes ($1.99), Frosted Flakes ($3.69) and three giant cans of Tang ($8.99 each).
The cart fills quickly. "I try to get sales to make it last longer," Ms. Acosta says, poring over the sale flier, "but it doesn't seem to."
They pass up frozen food. They pass up a big display for Cocoa Pebbles. They bypass the candy, the crackers, the potato chips. They buy Vienna sausages, milk, pancake mix, hot-dog buns. In 52 minutes, they collect $108 in groceries, a bounty of staples and a few indulgences: pudding cups, Oreos, grape soda.
Experts say even the wisest shoppers would have trouble living on food stamps, which were not intended to be a family's only source of income for meals. Food stamps are supposed to help, not suffice.
"Food stamps will never supply you with food for a month," said Nilda Tirado, a nutritionist with Cornell University's Cooperative Extension Service in New York City.
As mother and son wind their way toward the cash register, Jason notices a bottle of generic pancake syrup that his mother has placed into their cart. He scans the flier -- and finds that Aunt Jemima is on sale. He races to make an exchange.
BACK in their seven-story apartment building, Ms. Acosta and Jason ride a tiny, halting elevator to their apartment on the sixth floor. As they open the door, they are greeted by a rush of footsteps and a clamor of children's voices. The two younger children, Kenny and Dennis Rodriguez, seize the grocery bags and drag them into the kitchen, squealing, pushing, running with the food.
"Apples!" Kenny announces.
The boys dash into the living room, red-skinned beauties held aloft, and plunk on the raggedy couch. Jason joins them, and they eat with glee.
In a rare moment, this brings quiet to the living room, a place as haphazard as their lives. Here, clothes are drying on the radiator. A mattress is propped against the wall. The walls are bare except for a certificate declaring Jason "Student of the Month" and two photographs of him in a baseball uniform.
As the older boys devour their apples, Ms. Acosta's grandson, Rene Barrientos, is in the kitchen hunting down an apple. "Are the apples here?" he calls out.
A day later, the fruit is gone.
Researchers say that, over all, food stamps are spent on food that is just as nutritious, or more so, than what the general population buys.
Dr. Kathryn Edin, a sociologist who interviewed 214 welfare families for a recent book, "Making Ends Meet," said she found that welfare mothers bought food in bulk, looked for cheaper stores and tended toward staples that are low in cost and high in nutrition.
"I can't remember seeing a frozen pizza on the table," Dr. Edin said.
But that's not to say there wasn't the occasional box of freeze pops in the house. "Every mother wants to give her kids a decent life, a feeling that they're normal," she said.
Eight days after her food stamps arrive, Ms. Acosta is at a food pantry for the poor, run by the West Side Campaign Against Hunger.
Like others who rely on the pantry, in the basement of SS. Paul and Andrew Church, at 86th Street and West End Avenue, Ms. Acosta is allowed to come once a month, on a specially assigned day. Today, she will get three days' worth of groceries for each member of the family.
This morning, she's No. 34 in a line of 50. She has been waiting an hour, since 10 A.M., but she is undeterred, talking quietly with her friend Tita. As the women wait, Ms. Acosta notices a sign on the pantry's bulletin board that says legal immigrants are to lose food stamps.
She reads the notice soberly and tells her friend what it says.
Ms. Acosta was 7 when she and her mother emigrated from the Dominican Republic. She has had a green card since she was a child, and has worked for short periods of time over the years. She has no contact with the father of her oldest child, Lillian Aponte, 18, who is the mother of Rene. The father of her three sons, she said, visits occasionally but is unemployed and has contributed little to the family's support.
Her friend at the pantry cares for eight grandchildren and is frightened by the prospect of losing her food stamps. "But what can I do?" she frets. The women fall silent.
Back at home, dinners are dictated by what is in the cabinet or the refrigerator; often that means rice and beans, oxtail stew, baked chicken, hamburgers or spaghetti.
Lunch is easier, free under the school-lunch program. Today at Public School 84, where Kenny and Dennis are enrolled, the menu is deep-fried meat pies, mixed vegetables and tangerines. It is not a big hit with most of the children. But Dennis, quiet and deliberate, eats one bite of meat pie after another.
On another day, Rene, who is not yet in school, waits for his grandmother to fix lunch. Ms. Acosta baby-sits while Lillian attends a program to complete high school and overcome alcohol problems.
Ms. Acosta is boiling pasta in the kitchen, a tiny room where every appliance is broken and cockroaches dart across the walls. A black-and-white television with a hopelessly fuzzy picture is tuned to the Spanish soap opera "Guadalupe." Rene plunks himself down on the only kitchen chair that has all its legs.
"You want it with cheese, or you want it plain?" Ms. Acosta asks.
"Cheese!" Rene says.
Ms. Acosta spoons his noodles into a small bowl. But she realizes all the cheese is gone. So she roots through her cabinet and finds a last can of spaghetti sauce, which she opens by plunging a knife through the top.
"Sauce!" Rene declares, grinning.
TWENTY-TWO days after the food stamps arrive, they are gone. Ms. Acosta spends the last $5 on bread, salami and cheese.
During the month, she has spent her cash on basics that cannot be bought with food stamps, things like clothing, school supplies, bus fares, dental work, toilet paper, shampoo, detergent, insecticide -- and the subsidized rent of $135 a month.
Her grandson needed new sneakers. Her teen-age daughter wanted eye liner and lipstick. Jason wants his favorite gold jacket dry-cleaned, but he has to wait. "Every check, someone else in the family gets a turn," she says.
Ms. Acosta thinks of herself as a wise shopper, but sometimes money slips through her hands. She spent $45 on Rene's new sneakers. Sometimes, she buys a hot chocolate at McDonald's. At least one night a month, the family eats out. They have no telephone -- but pay $37.50 a month for cable television.
To cut down on impulse buying, she gives her food stamps to Jason for safekeeping -- and doesn't ask where he hides them. "He's the bookkeeper for me," she says. "If you go outside with money, you go broke."
As the month ends, Ms. Acosta relies on rice and beans. She relies on her sister's cooking one night, her sister's money the next. When all else fails, her neighbor lends her $10 for "chicken and stuff." Ms. Acosta is vague about how they get by. They just do.
NOW, the long-feared cut in food stamps is about to take effect -- just as Ms. Acosta and her family have begun to sort out some of their difficulties.
Lillian had a summer job; the three eldest boys took home trophies for summer baseball; the family has a new refrigerator and stove, and Ruth has joined a maintenance crew as part of a welfare work program, which in many ways she enjoys. "I feel like you're earning what you're getting now," she says.
And the work program has increased her food supply: she is paid $3 a day for transportation, but Ms. Acosta often walks the mile to work, using the money for groceries.
But this stability will soon change. "I'm just waiting to see," she says.

Dollar Falls Sharply vs. Yen On U.S. Remarks About Trade

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar suffered its biggest one-day drop against the yen in a month yesterday after comments by a Treasury Department official caused concerns about increased trade tensions with Japan. But the dollar gained against the mark as prospects for higher German interest rates dimmed.
The dollar sharply reversed its recent rally against the yen after Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers was quoted as saying that Washington was worried that Japan would rely too heavily on exports to revive its economy. 
 "Given that there weren't a lot of other things to focus on, this certainly drew the market's attention," said Michael Faust, a foreign-exchange strategist with Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser, a Foster City, Calif., money-management firm.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 118.93 yen, down 2 percent from 121.17 late Monday. It was the biggest drop since a 3 percent slide on Aug. 9, and the lowest level since Aug. 28. The dollar settled at 1.8135 marks, up from 1.8068.
The remarks by Mr. Summers heightened traders' fears that the dollar had exceeded what is considered a comfortable level for United States-Japanese trade relations.
"I continue to be concerned that Japan does what's necessary to achieve the domestic demand-led growth to which it's committed and avoid the export-led growth that has been a hallmark of many past Japanese recoveries," Mr. Summers was quoted as saying in The Financial Times.
While a weaker yen can help Japan's economy by making its goods cheaper overseas, it worries United States exporters because their products are more expensive in Japan.
Against the mark, the dollar was bolstered by a report that German unemployment in August rose sharply. The report was seen as evidence that Germany's economy was not growing fast enough to merit a rate increase by the central bank.
The dollar also benefited from comments from Ernst Welteke, a member of the central bank's policy-setting council, that Germany's economic recovery was being hampered by the weak labor market.
"At the moment, no one expects the Bundesbank to lower rates," Mr. Welteke said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A small agency creates a campaign for Black & Decker's new line of Kitchen Tools.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
A PRODUCER of prosaic household appliances is undertaking an ambitious effort to carve out a succulent slice of the lucrative market for higher-priced kitchen gadgets.
The Black & Decker Corporation is adding six sleek products with high-tech glosses and user-friendly features to a lineup ranging from waffle makers to irons to toaster ovens. A comprehensive advertising, marketing and promotional campaign, which starts this month and runs through December, promises that the new line will be "simple tools for fine cuisine." 
 To reinforce the separate identity of the new products -- yet also capitalize on the Black & Decker reputation for making sanders, screw drivers and other tools -- they are arriving on shelves of department stores across the country under the moniker Kitchen Tools. The familiar Black & Decker logo is tucked discreetly into corners of packages, advertisements and brochures.
"It taps into the core equity of the Black & Decker brand, which is all about durable, reliable tools," said Becky Bunnell, director for marketing communications and consumer intelligence -- yes, that's her title -- at Black & Decker in Shelton, Conn.
"And it also taps into the 'Martha Stewartization' of the world," she added, "by sending a signal that this line is specifically for people who look at cooking as a creative outlet."
A small New York agency, Nick and Paul, which specializes in projects to identify and exploit the essence, or "DNA," of brands, has developed the introductory campaign for Kitchen Tools. Ms. Bunnell estimated the budget as "north of $2 million to $2.5 million."
Nick and Paul has handled all aspects of Kitchen Tools in what is known as an integrated marketing communications effort: naming the brand, designing the logo and packaging, creating print ads and brochures, even producing instruction manuals and warranty cards.
"It was a 'power tool for the kitchen' approach" developed from consumer research, said Paul Bennett, creative director at Nick and Paul, "a yin and yang between creativity and functionality, stretching the idea of a tool to make it feel upscale."
Indeed, the arrival of Kitchen Tools is indicative of the renewed interest in premium-priced products among giant marketers as the American economy continues to grow and shoppers "trade up" by buying goods with pricier price tags in categories from liquor to autos to apparel.
"People may be feeling their personal-wealth perception is a little higher," Ms. Bunnell said, "and are feathering their nests with Sub-Zero refrigerators and Viking stoves."
That is also noticeable in the realm of less bulky kitchen appliances like food processors, mixers and blenders -- small electrics, in the parlance of Hudson's department stores. Of the estimated 1.3 million to 1.5 million stand mixers sold annually, Ms. Bunnell said, the market share for higher-priced brands has now grown to 56 percent.
"Kitchen Tools is aimed at the more premium end of the market" than products sold under the Black & Decker brand, Ms. Bunnell said.
"It's for people who see a tool they need and are very much willing to pay more for higher quality," she added, particularly if it is perceived as "a tool that allows them to do more." Brands already serving that market include Braun, Cuisinart, DeLonghi, Krups and T-Fal.
So a coffee maker bearing the Kitchen Tools name will sell for $139 to $159, on par with Braun and Krups, compared with its Black & Decker sibling, which may be priced at $69 to $79. Other products that will be sold under the banners of both Black & Decker and Kitchen Tools are can openers, food processors and hand mixers; Kitchen Tools will also offer blenders and stand mixers.
Black & Decker hired Nick and Paul 16 months ago to handle a creative assignment for its household products group that became the Kitchen Tools introduction. The group's agency of record remains the McCann-Erickson New York unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, which in May was also awarded the company's consumer power tools account.
"Nick and Paul was able to create a voice that goes through every aspect of our communications for Kitchen Tools," Ms. Bunnell said, "and really helped us understand what the relationship should be to Black & Decker and how to leverage that in positive ways."
For example, in the naming process, the agency recommended "that we celebrate our tool name, our tool heritage," she added, rather than coin a name that would scream "high-end, chi-chi, designer apparel" or "down and dirty performance, like a race car."
The brand's identity, according to Mr. Bennett, "was originally much more about creativity, recipes, until consumers told us: 'Get real. Just give me the facts, how this performs, not how to make sushi.' "
"It's important for Black & Decker to have kitchen credibility," he added, "when you're selling a $300 mixer."
That tone is apparent in the ads, which appear in magazines like Food & Wine and Saveur. "It can take years of practice to truly master fine cuisine," the cover of a brochure asserts. "The same shouldn't be true for your kitchen appliances." An ad for the Kitchen Tools coffee maker ends: "Finally, a coffee maker rethought and made simple. Which you can appreciate first thing in the morning."
A label on the carton of the food processor, describing various "quicker assembly" features, declares, "It's a tool, not a puzzle." And warranty cards chattily begin: "So you bought a Kitchen Tools product? Welcome to the family."
Other elements of the introduction include product demonstrations in malls, sponsored by Bon Appetit and Gourmet magazines, and a "Tool Jam" for trainee chefs in cooking schools, sponsored by Food & Wine.
Initial results for Kitchen Tools are, well, yummy.
"We're already starting to see sales that are better than our expectations," Ms. Bunnell said.

Treasuries Dip in Wait-and-See Trading

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities dipped yesterday on weakness in the dollar against the yen and apprehension about a heavy supply of corporate and global debt that will be priced in coming days.
In quiet trading in advance of significant economic reports scheduled for Friday, the 30-year bond slipped 6/32, to a price of 96 26/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.62 percent, up one-hundredth of a percentage point from the yield on Monday. 
 Among the issuers of debt coming to the market are Venezuela, Argentina, the Korean Development Bank and the Swiss Bank Corporation. Securities firms that are managing the debt sales often hedge against possible losses by selling government securities before the debt is sold.
Among the first issues to go on sale yesterday was a $300 million offering of 12-year notes by GTE California Inc., a unit of the GTE Corporation, that were priced to yield 6.861 percent through underwriters led by Merrill Lynch & Company. Noncallable by the issuer, the notes were rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and AA- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In a two-part offering through Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company, E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company priced $500 million of five-year noncallable notes to yield 6.576 percent and a similar amount of 10-year notes to yield 6.782 percent.
Bonds were modestly affected yesterday by a report from the Labor Department that said productivity, a measure of time and effort involved in the production of goods and serves, rose to an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the second quarter. It was the largest increase since the fourth quarter of 1993.
The Government also reported that unit labor costs were up an annualized rate of five-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, well below the 2.4 percent increase initially reported. This suggested that the Fed might not have to raise short-term interest rates at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Sept. 30.
The Fed has not raised interest rates since March, when it increased the Federal funds rate, the rate banks charge one another for overnight loans, to 5.50 percent from 5.25 percent. Many market participants expect no action this month.
In addition to the increased supply of debt coming to the market, there was also a reluctance by investors to buy bonds before the release of the August retail and producer price reports on Friday. Investors believe these reports may provide more clues about the strength of the economy and the rate of inflation, which are closely monitored by the Federal Reserve.
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of fixed income at J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., said the market has not been performing as expected lately on data showing no inflation and little growth -- positive numbers for the market because they would give the Fed little reason to raise rates.
"I think everyone is waiting for bad-good numbers, where inflation and growth show signs of accelerating," he said. The market only offers short-term downside risk, he added, because everyone is waiting for something negative.
Mr. Pugliese is not among those who think the large supply of corporate debt will affect the market significantly.
"I really don't think it's a factor," he said. "Issues get sold 10 minutes after they are priced. Cash has to be put to work, and that area has seen much success. Even the high-yield issues are getting absorbed quickly. I am convinced the market is in a wait-and-see posture for the next few weeks, unless there is something dramatic on the inflation front."
Bill Gamba, senior vice president and head of government bond trading at Cowen & Company, saw yesterday as a typical day when important data are scheduled for late in the week and a huge supply of corporate and global debt issues are looming.
"People are less interested in the Treasury market at this point," he said. "You're not going to see them place any major bets going into Friday's economic data."
While the dollar did play an early role in the market's weakness, Mr. Gamba said, it was only one of many ingredients in a lackluster session.

HEADLINE: Productivity Up; What It Signals Is Still Debated

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The productivity of American workers -- measuring how much they produce in an hour on the job -- was much higher in the second quarter than originally estimated, the Labor Department reported yesterday. But both sides in a growing debate over the efficiency of the nation's work force saw support for their viewpoints in the new figures.
Productivity for the nonfarm business sector, covering all private business except agriculture, grew in the second quarter at an annual rate of 2.7 percent, far better than the six-tenths of 1 percent estimate issued last month by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. The new figure represented the fastest quarterly growth since late 1993. But productivity has spurted upward before, only to die away. Lasting trends, up or down, become evident only in hindsight, after several years of accumulated data. 
 "I don't see an argument for saying that the last few quarters are markedly different from the 1980's or 1990's so far," said Edwin Dean, chief of the bureau division that compiles the productivity numbers. "They are just a shade better."
The upward revision reinforces a slight upward trend in the nation's recent productivity growth. That upward trend has encouraged some economists to argue that the United States has turned a corner; that the country is heading back toward a level of efficiency characteristic of the prosperous early post-war decades, but absent for the last 25 years.
"The numbers are beginning to show positive growth," said Barry Bluestone, a labor economist at the University of Massachusetts.
The upward revision for the second quarter was mostly a result of a previously announced upward revision in the gross domestic product. The nation's workers produced much more from April through June than originally estimated, without working many more hours. So their productivity -- in repairing a car, cleaning a hotel room, selling insurance -- was greater. The improvement came outside manufacturing, where the second-quarter number was revised downward, to an annual rate of 2.4 percent from last month's estimate of 3.2 percent.
The upward movement in overall productivity reflected the short term. Viewed over a longer period, a different interpretation emerges. Since the start of the current economic expansion in 1991, the annual productivity growth rate has averaged only 1.2 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported yesterday. That is less than the 1.5 percent average for a similar six years of economic expansion in the 1980's, when there were also periodic spurts in productivity.
The performance in both decades has been well below the most prosperous postwar years, from 1947 to 1973, when the productivity growth rate nationwide averaged 2.8 percent annually, or 1.6 percentage points above the 1990's average. The difference is significant. If a shoemaker, for example, increases in a single hour the sales revenue from his work to $101.60 from $100, then his productivity has grown by 1.6 percent.
The extra money can go into profits or into a raise or both. The shoemaker's boss does not have to increase prices, feeding inflation, to make possible a raise or a higher profit. That higher productivity was at the heart of the prosperity in the early postwar decades. And some economists insist that a similar pattern has re-emerged, though not yet in the official numbers.
The basis of this argument is the coexistence for more than 18 months of low inflation, smartly rising profits and the beginnings of increases in wages. If productivity were not improving, the companies would have to raise prices to fatten profits and give raises, the productivity optimists argue, and they are not raising prices.
"Rising productivity is the only possible explanation," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, a Wall Street firm.
But the productivity pessimists do offer other explanations. They note, for example, that men and women have been entering the labor force recently in unusually large numbers. The smartly rising profits, they say, might be coming not from the shoemaker's rising hourly output, but from the output of two shoemakers rather than one. Or companies might be feeding profits by holding back on pay.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, has entered the debate on the side of the optimists, but with caveats. "The still open question is whether productivity growth is in the process of picking up," he said in a speech last Friday.
Like others, Mr. Greenspan has argued that productivity is very difficult to measure in several major sectors of the economy, including financial institutions and noncorporate partnerships and proprietorships. Research by Fed economists, cited by Mr. Greenspan, found productivity to be falling in this latter sector, despite healthy profit margins -- a contradiction that suggests measurement error to Mr. Greenspan.
Seeking a better signal of what may be happening in the economy as a whole, Mr. Greenspan has focused on productivity in the nonfinancial corporate sector. The Bureau of Labor Statistics yesterday issued its first estimate of productivity growth in this sector in the second quarter. It rose 3.2 percent at an annual rate, and has averaged 2.4 percent growth over the last four quarters and about 1.6 percent over a longer period.

Columbia/HCA Warns Earnings Will Be Lower
The Government inquiry into Columbia/HCA Healthcare and stagnant business at its 342 hospitals will push third-quarter earnings at the troubled health care provider down. The company said that per-share earnings would drop to 20 cents or 25 cents, compared with 46 cents in the quarter a year earlier.
Analysts were surprised by the company's announcement; they had predicted that earnings would exceed 50 cents a share. Columbia shares fell 9 percent. [Page D5.] 

Xerox Is Selling Another Unit
Xerox is continuing its plan to exit the insurance business. Its latest liquidation is of its Resolution Group, which will be acquired by 14 investors, including top executives, for $612 million. [D5.]
 
Stock Indexes Continue to Inch Up
Stocks moved slightly higher, though investors were concerned about currency fluctuations and earnings disappointments. The Dow Jones industrial average increased 16.73 points to close at 7,851.91. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index recorded its third consecutive new high, gaining 10.87 points, to 1,656.22. [D8.]
 
Treasury prices fell on weakness in the dollar against the yen and apprehension about a heavy supply of corporate and global debt later this week. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.62 percent from 6.61. [D6.]
 
Talks on a Tobacco Deal Change
White House officials and tobacco industry representatives are negotiating a possible overhaul of the provisions on youth smoking in the proposed $368.5 billion tobacco settlement that could reduce fines against companies and increase cigarette costs. [A14.]
 
No Credit Cards, Yet
The Government said that it planned to make paying taxes so easy that taxpayers need do nothing more than allow the I.R.S. to dip into their bank accounts. But the Treasury said it had yet to figure out how consumers could pay their taxes with credit cards. Both credit card and debit card payments were approved by the new tax legislation, but the law prohibits the Government from paying fees to card companies. [D2.]
 
Starwood Lodging Buying Westin
As expected, Starwood Lodging Trust is acquiring Westin Hotels for $540 million in cash and stock and assuming more than $1 billion in debt. The new company will own and operate 219 hotels in 38 states and 23 countries and have $4 billion in annual revenue. [D4.]
 
World Bank Sees New Powerhouses
The World Bank forecast that growth in developing countries would accelerate over the next decade, and that the five biggest emerging economies -- China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and Russia -- would become economic powerhouses in the next quarter-century. [D7.]
 
German Woes Appear to Be Growing
Statistics show German unemployment at record levels, inflation increasing and eastern Germany falling further behind the west in economic growth. [A13.]
 
The German economic news helped the dollar against the mark. But the dollar suffered its biggest one-day drop against the yen in a month after comments by a Treasury Department official caused concerns about increased trade tensions with Japan. [D15.]
 
Circuit City in Licensing Pacts
Circuit City Stores has reached licensing agreements with major film studios and makers of digital videodisk players for a technology that would create disposable rental films. The encryption technology, dubbed Divx, is also intended to prevent movie piracy by requiring the use of specially encoded disks and players. [D7.]

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN FINANCE: THE INTERESTED PARTIES;
Sinking of Casino Plan Makes Tribes Cry Foul

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
When a half-dozen Minnesota and Wisconsin Indian tribes set out two years ago to sink a rival Indian casino proposal, they turned to some influential Washington insiders for help.
The tribes hired Patrick O'Connor, a lobbyist in Minneapolis and Washington who is a former treasurer of the Democratic National Committee. Mr. O'Connor then arranged for tribal leaders to meet with an old friend, Donald L. Fowler, who was then the Democratic Party chairman. 
 The tribes that opposed the project were longtime Democratic supporters who ran their own lucrative gambling operations and wanted to prevent a potential new competitor -- three Chippewa tribes from Wisconsin -- from cutting into their profits. At a meeting here on April 28, 1995, Mr. Fowler promised to get in contact with the Interior Department and Harold M. Ickes, the deputy White House chief of staff, on the tribes' behalf.
What happened next is a bit murky, but the results are not, as Senators investigating campaign-finance abuses heard in testimony today. Less than three months after the meeting, the Interior Department killed the project, overruling the Minneapolis office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which had supported the plan.
The tribes that opposed the project, including the Oneida and St. Croix and some other Chippewas, were grateful. Four of the tribes donated $56,000 to the Democratic National Committee in 1995, mainly in the weeks after the decision, and $225,000 in 1996. The tribes also contributed thousands of dollars to the Minnesota Democratic Party. Tribal leaders showed their appreciation.
"On behalf of the Ho-Chunk Nation, I want to thank you for your help in the successful effort to defeat the Hudson casino," JoAnn Jones, president of one of the tribes, in Black River Falls, Wis., said in a note to Mr. Fowler. "You were particularly instrumental in helping the department understand the significance and importance of their decision."
But the tribes that wanted to build a casino on a failing dog-racing track in Hudson, Wis., 20 miles east of Minneapolis, were not amused. They filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Madison, Wis., contending that improper political pressure had been used to kill the project.
The Interior Department denied that it had been pressured into the decision, citing the economic effects that a new casino would have had on the gambling operations of the nearby St. Croix tribe.
But in March, Judge Barbara B. Crabb of Federal District Court in Madison ruled that "there is a distinct possibility that improper political influence affected" the decision. The judge may allow the Wisconsin tribes to subpoena Clinton Administration officials to testify.
Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, said at the hearing today, "It's certainly the case that such actions as were taken undermine public confidence to have officials engaged in fund-raising, in my view to be advocating on behalf of contributors on matters before Government agencies."
The Hudson casino episode was one of several that Republican senators sought to portray as examples of where Mr. Fowler promised favors in exchange for specific donations.
Mr. Fowler acknowledged making calls on behalf of the tribes who opposed the project but said he had not influenced the final decision. "I called Mr. Ickes, explained to him the nature of the situation, and I called someone at the Department of Interior," Mr. Fowler said. "I do not recall the name of the person with whom I talked at the Department of Interior. To my recollection, I did not suggest a result, did not ask for an outcome. I just asked that it be reviewed."
But in a memorandum dated May 5, 1995, Mr. Fowler argued for Mr. Ickes to intervene on behalf of the Oneida and St. Croix, if nothing else than to thwart Republican supporters. "The proposal to convert a dog track to a casino is being pushed by American Indian tribes who are supporters of Governor Thompson," the memorandum said, referring to the state's Governor, Tommy G. Thompson, a Republican.
Mr. Fowler had a difficult time explaining at least seven telephone conversations that Mr. O'Connor had with David Mercer, a senior fund-raising official at the Democratic National Committee, from April 28, the day of the meeting, to Aug. 21.
"Can you explain to me why a lobbyist for the tribes would have so much contact with the D.N.C. deputy finance director about the same time that the casino application was under consideration?" Senator Collins asked.
Mr. Fowler replied: "One could infer that the casino matter was discussed -- but I don't know that. Mr. O'Connor is also involved in various activities and various affairs of the Democratic Party."
Senator Collins asked again whether Mr. Fowler had championed the cause of the tribes who opposed the project because he knew the Indians would give more money.
"If the implication of that question is did I perform or do something in response to a contribution, or did I do something under the condition of receiving a contribution, I categorically said or answered that, no," Mr. Fowler said. "Whatever they contributed or didn't contribute had nothing to do with my actions in that regard."

Palestinians Said to Arrest Hamas Militants in Gaza
The Palestinian Authority was reported to have arrested scores of suspected members of the militant Hamas movement in the Gaza Strip, according to Hamas members and a Palestinian security officer. The detentions came on the eve of a visit to the Middle East by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. A1
 
Vows of Peace in Belfast
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, formally committed itself for the first time to exclusively peaceful methods in its effort to reach an agreement on the political future of Northern Ireland. The commitment qualified the party to take part in peace talks. A12 

U.N. Divers Search for Bodies
Anxious family members watched as United Nations divers continued removing bodies from the overcrowded ferry that capsized and sank just off the coast of Haiti. Police and other government officials estimated that the death toll would reach 200. President Rene Preval went to the area and sought to defuse townspeople's anger at their lack of a pier. A3
 
NATO Troops Stop Bosnia Coup
NATO forces intervened in what American officials called a second coup attempt against Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic. Alliance troops disarmed dozens of Bosnian Serb hardliners loyal to the wartime leader Radovan Karadzic and, elsewhere in Banja Luka, closed down a barracks of Dr. Karadzic's special police. A12
 
Economy Dims Kohl's Fortunes
Statistics in Germany suggested that half a million jobs had been lost this year and unemployment had climbed to 18.3 percent in the former East Germany and to 9.7 percent in the western part of the country. Coupled with signs of growing inflation, the figures do not augur well for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose popularity ahead of next year's national elections has wilted. A13
 
Driver's Blood Test Confirmed
A new blood test confirmed again that the driver in the crash that killed Diana, Princess of Wales, had a level of alcohol more than three times the legal limit in France. A lawyer for the family of Diana's companion who also died, Emad al-Fayed, claimed photos taken moments before the crash showed the driver dazzled by a camera flash from a nearby motorcycle. A10
 
Hong Kong Chief Defends Plan
Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's chief executive, visited Washington and told Congress that the territory, over which China resumed sovereignty on July 1, would soon enjoy more democracy than it ever enjoyed under colonial rule. He defended his annulment of electoral reforms introduced in the last year of British rule and his own transitional plans, in which companies, banks and professional associations choose one third of the legislators directly.

Democratic Official Helped Contributors Gain Access
Donald L. Fowler, the Democratic Party chairman during last year's election campaign, acknowledged publicly that he intervened with officials of the Clinton Administration on behalf of some of the party's largest supporters. Mr. Fowler, the most prominent Democrat to testify thus far in the hearings on campaign finance practices, insisted that he acted properly, even though the party's official legal guidelines for fund-raising seem to preclude intervention with Government agencies. A1
 
Donors Were Put at Risk
The Democratic National Committee took at least $2 million in contributions restricted to generic use by the party and spent it directly for the re-election campaign of President Clinton and other candidates in a practice that placed some of its most cherished donors in violation of Federal election laws. A1

Privacy and Medical Records
Clinton Administration officials, bowing to Federal and state law enforcement authorities, will soon propose legislation that would guarantee police officers broad access to patients' medical records, with hardly any restrictions on use or redisclosure of the data. A1

Nominee Questioned on Troops
Though his confirmation as the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is all but certain, Gen. Henry H. Shelton was confronted in the Senate with pointed questions about whether the United States will meet its deadline to pull thousands of American troops out of Bosnia next year. A20

New Tax Cuts Proposed
G.O.P. sophomores in the House, disenchanted with the Republican leadership's pace on pushing for tax cuts, started a major new tax-cutting initiative by proposing to eliminate the so-called marriage tax penalty. A20

Clinton Plans Broad Agenda
President Clinton spelled out a broad agenda for the rest of the year, trying to summon support for a grab bag of causes from expanding trade to tightening pollution controls. A20

Messinger and Sharpton To Meet in Primary Runoff
Ruth W. Messinger will face the Rev. Al Sharpton in a runoff for the Democratic mayoral nomination on Sept. 23, as a low voter turnout and a strong showing by Mr. Sharpton dashed her hope for a jubilant primary night sendoff into the fall campaign against Mayor Giuliani. A1

Fields Wins Manhattan Race
C. Virginia Fields, a City Councilwoman who touted her roots in the civil rights movement, won the Democratic nomination for Manhattan Borough President after a bitter campaign involving a diverse field of six candidates. A1

Looted Art Recovered
Federal prosecutors said they had recovered more than $10 million worth of valuable drawings, including works by Rembrandt and Albrecht Durer, which were part of the collection looted from the Bremen museum in Germany at the chaotic end of World War II and later stolen from the National Museum of Baku in Azerbaijan. B3

Equal Justice for Cats
A little-noticed change in New York State law that begins next year will impose the same penalties on hit-and-run motorists who strike cats as have traditionally been applied to motorists who strike dogs.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong's New Leader Disputes U.S. on Rights

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
In the first of a series of high-level visits over the next two months between American and Chinese leaders, the new Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, sparred with members of Congress over human rights today and declared that Hong Kong would soon enjoy more democracy "than we ever had in 156 years of colonial rule."
The arrival of Mr. Tung, a shipping magnate chosen by Beijing to run Hong Kong, precedes by a month and a half a long-waited summit meeting here between President Jiang Zemin of China and President Clinton. At times today, it seemed as if Mr. Tung's visit was intended to vent some of the pent-up frustration with China's human rights record in Congress before Mr. Jiang arrives. 
 Mr. Tung clearly decided that the best defense was a good offense, favorably comparing his own proposal for elections in Hong Kong -- which has been widely criticized as benefiting conservative business interests -- with the former British rule.
But in a series of visits today, he skipped lightly over his decision to roll back the electoral reforms pushed through before the handover, which widened the franchise in voting for Hong Kong's legislature.
Mr. Tung also lashed out at American press coverage of the July 1 handover, arguing that it had been slanted to give viewers the impression that the Chinese Army was taking over the city.
"On July 1, after showing the official ceremony, the TV pictures switched to People's Liberation Army soldiers entering Hong Kong," he said, "not emphasis on the peaceful return of a territory taken years ago in an unjust war, not consideration of Hong Kong people being given full responsibility for their government for the first time in their history."
Usually garrulous and relaxed, Mr. Tung seemed a little nervous as he met with members of Congress who have been critical of China and of Mr. Tung's reworking of Hong Kong's electoral system.
This afternoon Mr. Tung met with Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who is to travel to Hong Kong next week for annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
At the Treasury today, Mr. Tung emphasized Hong Kong's economic health in the face of a currency crisis that has swept through the rest of Southeast Asia. He reassured Mr. Rubin that Hong Kong would continue to peg its currency to the United States dollar -- one of the city's main claims to financial stability.
But even Mr. Rubin brought up human rights and free speech issues, tying them to Hong Kong's future financial health. Mr. Tung touched on the same theme in his speech, declaring that his city would "continue to uphold academic and media freedom" and would remain "the best place to find out what is going on across Asia."
But much of Mr. Tung's time today was spent defending his proposal for an electoral system under which companies, banks and professional associations will choose the occupants of a third of the seats in the Hong Kong legislature. He argued that these were part of a series of transition rules that would ultimately lead to greater direct participation in elections.

Beijing Ex-Mayor Charged
 BEIJING, Sept. 9 (By The New York Times) -- Just days before the opening of a Communist Party Congress, China's biggest political gathering in five years, the party authorities announced tonight that they were prosecuting a disgraced senior leader and longtime rival to President Jiang Zemin on corruption charges.
Mr. Jiang, who is also General Secretary of the party, is clearly trying to stamp his personal authority on the party congress, which opens on Friday and is to approve China's leaders and policy for the post-Deng era.
By expelling and prosecuting the former official, Chen Xitong, a member of the party's ruling Politburo who dominated the Beijing municipal government for more than 12 years as Mayor and then as local party chief, the authorities led by Mr. Jiang won a big trophy for their campaign against corruption and demonstrated Mr. Jiang's resolve to defeat a rival.
Mr. Chen, 67, the most senior Chinese leader to face criminal charges since the reform program began 20 years ago, was accused of embezzling state funds, accepting bribes and abusing power.
Mr. Chen's exact whereabouts have been kept secret, as has his response to the charges.

HEADLINE: Students Hear Clinton Tell Of Priorities For the Fall

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNETT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 9

 BODY:
Declaring the economic and political drag of budget deficits to be a thing of the past, President Clinton moved on today to a broad agenda for the rest of the year, trying to summon support for a grab bag of causes from expanding trade to tightening pollution controls to passing wide-reaching laws to restrict tobacco.
Speaking to his second audience of students in two days, Mr. Clinton again called on Congress to support his plan for new national tests measured against voluntary standards in reading and math. 
 Mr. Clinton also threatened today to direct "the full glare of public light" toward any senators who try to block legislation to tighten campaign finance laws. But even as he spoke this afternoon about the peril of money in politics and a Senate committee sharply questioned a former top Democratic official about fund-raising, Mr. Clinton planned to attend two dinners tonight to raise $550,000 for the Democratic National Committee.
Addressing the students and faculty of American University here, Mr. Clinton invoked John F. Kennedy's vision of a world free from the cold war, articulated 34 years ago at the same university.
"It is up to you and to me and to our fellow Americans to imagine what the 21st century will be, and then to do what is necessary to make that vision a reality for all our people," he said.
Mr. Clinton addressed topics as open-ended as whether the rush of technology could leave citizens "each with our own Web page, but linked by few human bonds of community." But he also raised more specific matters, urging for the first time in weeks that his nominee for Ambassador to Mexico, William F. Weld, receive a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Mr. Clinton assured his college audience that Social Security would survive to benefit them, and pledged in the next three months to appoint members of a new commission to study Medicare. He also called on Congress to take this "historic opportunity" to pass "sweeping legislation that focuses first and foremost on reducing smoking among young people."
The President was raucously received by some 4,000 students and faculty members packed into a basketball gymnasium, and flashbulbs pulsed from the bleachers throughout his 41-minute address. Like most of the President's other major addresses this year, the speech today divided into the triad of "opportunity, responsibility, community, " familiar from his 1996 campaign.
One senior aide billed the address, which Mr. Clinton worked on in the last two weeks of his vacation, as a "back to work, back to school, America's back" speech. And Mr. Clinton provided a remarkably upbeat assessment of the nation's health, pointing to low inflation and unemployment as the products of an economy so robust that "many of our poorest urban and rural communities are in a springtime of renewal."
He lavishly praised the recent agreement to balance the budget by 2002.
"Now, after years in which the deficit dominated our politics and dampened our economy, America finally has lifted that burden from the next generation," Mr. Clinton said. "After years in which the two parties seemed often as tired and trapped as punch-drunk fighters in a ring getting smaller and smaller, finally we found a way for Democrats and Republicans to work together for the national interest."
After he turned to foreign policy, however, Mr. Clinton sounded slightly defensive as he described his plans to meet here later this fall with President Jiang Zemin of China. He called the meeting "a chance for us to address candidly and face-to-face our differences on issues like human rights and religious freedom."
He said that "sitting down together across the table is far more likely to produce progress than pointing fingers across the Pacific."
Linking free trade with the growth of democracy, Mr. Clinton called for expanded trade with Asia and other parts of the world. On Wednesday he plans to announce a campaign to persuade Congress to increase his powers to negotiate trade agreements.
For the first time since his address to the United Nations on June 26, Mr. Clinton returned to the subject of global climate change. He is trying to build public support for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases before a summit on climate change in December in Japan.
Mr. Clinton warned that, if it is not checked, climate change could cause flooding in southern Florida and Louisiana over the next 50 years, and he said Americans could take cost-free steps to cut emissions of gases that contribute to climatic warming.
"We could reduce them 20 percent tomorrow with technology that is already available at no cost if we just changed the way we do things," Mr. Clinton said, but offering no specific suggestions.
His aides said today that they could not determine the source of his 20 percent figure, but that he was referring to measures like much more widespread use of refrigerators and light bulbs that require less electricity.
While the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee continued today to investigate the price of access to politicians, including the President, Mr. Clinton turned that subject around, saying the primary cause of the mounting cost of campaigns was "the cost of access to you, the voters." He called for free or reduced advertising time for politicians.
Mr. Clinton repeated his support for campaign finance legislation sponsored by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, saying, "Every year I have been President, I have supported a good campaign finance reform bill."
Under the McCain-Feingold bill, much of the money Mr. Clinton planned to raise at the events tonight -- the unlimited donations to parties classified as "soft money" -- would be illegal. Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, wearily repeated today that the Democrats would not "unilaterally disarm" by abandoning soft money.
"We'll continue to try to change the rules even as we try to compete effectively under the rules," Mr. McCurry said.

HEADLINE: RACE FOR CITY HALL: THE OVERVIEW;
MESSINGER FACES SHARPTON IN SEPT. 23 MAYORAL RUNOFF; DEMOCRATIC TURNOUT LIGHT

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Ruth W. Messinger was forced last night into a runoff for the Democratic mayoral nomination with the Rev. Al Sharpton, as a low voter turnout in a three-way race, combined with a strong performance by Mr. Sharpton, dashed her hope for a jubilant primary night sendoff into the fall campaign.
With all 5,627 precincts reporting, Ms. Messinger had 155,913 votes or 39 percent, to 126,799 votes or 32 percent, for Mr. Sharpton. The third major candidate in the race, Councilman Sal F. Albanese, had 83,402 votes, or 21 percent. 
 Under state law, a candidate in a mayoral primary is required to win 40 percent of the vote to capture the nomination. The runoff, to be held on Sept. 23, will be the first Democratic runoff since 1977, when Edward I. Koch defeated Mario M. Cuomo.
Ms. Messinger's aides attributed the result last night to the case of Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant who prosecutors said was assaulted while in police custody in Brooklyn on Aug. 9. Mr. Sharpton -- who had nowhere near the organization or financial resources of Ms. Messinger or Mr. Albanese -- quickly identified his campaign with the Louima case, and Ms. Messinger's aides pointed to Mr. Sharpton's victory in Brooklyn as proof of the success of that strategy.
But Ms. Messinger was also hurt by Mr. Albanese's healthy showing, which interviews suggested drew support away from Ms. Messinger, and from what may have been the worst voter turnout in a Democratic primary since World War II. Only 395,395 of the 2,246,987 registered Democrats voted, about 18 percent.
Mr. Sharpton, beaming in the brightest spotlight he has enjoyed in a high-profile career as a protest leader and civil-rights advocate, pledged to adhere to the traditional values of his party. In an energetic, televised speech to supporters last night, he also scolded Democrats who he said had sought to abandon those values.
"This is our day. This is our time. I can fly! I can fly! I can fly!" Mr. Sharpton declared exuberantly, repeating the words of the popular song, "I Believe I Can Fly," by R. Kelly, the hip-hop artist, which he plays in his car, in his home and at most campaign stops.
Turning his attention to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani -- who has until now refused to engage Mr. Sharpton in any debate -- the candidate declared: "Whatever skirmish Ms. Messinger and I have, Mr. Giuliani, at the end of the skirmish, we're coming to City Hall and one of us is going to take your seat in 1997."
A few blocks away, Ms. Messinger, standing next to a glum David N. Dinkins in the ballroom of the Grand Hyatt, presented the outcome as just a small setback. "Well, friends, they never said this would be easy," she commented. There was a scattering of boos when she said that there would probably be a runoff. "We're going to have to win this the hard way, but win it we will,' she said.
Still, by any measure, the runoff appears to be a huge setback for Democrats seeking to unseat Mr. Giuliani. It will delay for two weeks the general election assault on Mr. Giuliani, forcing Ms. Messinger and Mr. Sharpton to devote resources against each other instead.
A runoff against Mr. Sharpton is likely to prove particularly uncomfortable for Ms. Messinger. She will now be forced to run head-on against a candidate with a strong following in some parts of the black electorate, but without alienating the black voters who are critical to any hope she has of defeating Mr. Giuliani.
The runoff is also likely to complicate Ms. Messinger's efforts to position herself on the center of the political spectrum in anticipation of a race against Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Sharpton has repeatedly scolded Ms. Messinger for trying to win election by abandoning the liberal wing of the party. Until now, she has been able to ignore him, but that might be difficult starting today.
Ms. Messinger herself seemed unprepared for the outcome yesterday. Right up to the eve of the election, she had been predicting that she would not only avoid a runoff but win easily. She in effect raised expectations for herself, which made her showing last night appear even more damaging. Mr. Sharpton's showing, on the other hand, was almost exactly what he predicted it would be.
There were two other candidates on the ballot: Eric Ruano-Melendez, who received 18,940 votes, or 5 percent, and Roland Rogers, with 11,061 votes, or 3 percent.
Ms. Messinger was almost certainly hurt by the presence of Mr. Albanese on the ballot. Still, her performance was a startling setback for a woman who has been a fixture on New York's political scene since she emerged on the Upper West Side 25 years ago, running first for school board, then for the City Council and then, in 1989, for Manhattan borough president. Her history, base of support and fund-raising ability had led Democratic leaders across the city to view her as the almost certain nominee from the day Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, dropped out of the mayoral race in early May.
Even before the polls closed, Democratic leaders across the city were criticizing the campaign Ms. Messinger and her advisers had run as they began seeing signs of her defeat.
In particular, they were critical of one central tactical decision by the Messinger campaign: to forgo the heavy "get out the vote" operation that has always been integral to winning primary elections in this city. The campaign instead devoted its resources to a television advertisement. And that ad spoke only about what Ms. Messinger had presumed would be her contest with Mr. Giuliani -- thereby not even alerting her supporters to yesterday's vote.
Influential Democrats in Ms. Messinger's own neighborhood, reporting during the day on signs of duress in her backyard, said they had been constantly frustrated in their attempts to persuade her staff to turn its attention to what is known as street campaigning. "All we got on the West Side was 150 pieces of literature on Saturday," one Democrat supporting Ms. Messinger said last night. "This has taken a media strategy to a new dimension."
The result last night underscored questions raised by several political analysts over Ms. Messinger's decision to staff her office with political professionals who had little or no experience in New York. Her campaign manager, Jim Andrews, is from Chicago; her media consultant, Mandy Grunwald, is from Washington, though her clients include Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
The difficulties of the comparatively well-financed Messinger campaign seem all the more stark when put up against the bare-bones campaign waged by Mr. Sharpton that has forced Ms. Messinger into this position. He broadcast no television advertisements, hired no campaign consultants and did not retain a media adviser. Instead, he adhered to a relentless schedule of campaigning across the city.
And he raised so little money that he could not even meet the $250,000 threshold for qualifying for city campaign finance money.
But Mr. Sharpton's campaign benefited from the Louima case, as evidenced by the vote in Brooklyn. And he also may have been helped by the primary for Manhattan borough president. Democrats said there was a high turnout in black communities for C. Virginia Fields, who won the Democratic nomination yesterday.
Beyond that, Mr. Sharpton offered what many Democrats saw as a far more extensive -- and, from a Democratic perspective, traditional -- view of what he thought the party was about. He repeatedly criticized Democrats who moved to the center, arguing that the party should not abandon its traditional position of helping the poor and oppressed.
Mr. Sharpton discussed that last night, taking full advantage of his suddenly huge platform to present his view of the Democratic Party. But he also took care, at least initially, to frame his challenge as one to Mr. Giuliani, rather than Ms. Messinger.
"Ruth Messinger is not the loser at all tonight," Mr. Sharpton said. "The real loser is Rudy Giuliani." Addressing his remarks to Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Sharpton said: "You will not be able to ignore the issues and the constituency that I've tried to represent. Those days are over. The issues of unemployment and police brutality and schools' not working are on the front burner. And you can run, Rudy, but you can't hide."
Ms. Messinger has framed her campaign around the condition of the schools, which she says have deteriorated under Mr. Giuliani's watch. She visited a public school yesterday, before the polls closed, and spoke of the issue again last night.
But mostly, Ms. Messinger seemed to be trying to reassure her supporters that the results last night were nothing more than a small setback, and not the end of what even her own friends had come to see as a troubled campaign. In doing so, she for perhaps the first time acknowledged the existence of strong opponents for the nomination.
"Tonight, my friends, is just a first step," she said, smiling. "When I decided to run for Mayor, I knew that we would have a fight on my hands. A tough fight against a bully of a Mayor, and yes, a tough fight against my rivals in the Democratic party."
Mr. Albanese, speaking at his early concession speech, declined to say last night whom he would support in a runoff. He could barely disguise his disappointment.
"We campaigned for a year and half," he said after his concession speech. "We shook a lot of hands. But you have 8 million people in this city; you have 2.5 million registered voters. You have to get on the air. But we rallied a lot of people together around the same issues. It was a good campaign. I have no regrets about it."
Interviews with Democrats around the city yesterday suggested that many had decided to skip the primary because they had concluded that the candidates had simply said and done too little to motivate them. Others said they were not at all eager to throw Mayor Giuliani out of office, so why bother voting in the primary?
Sol Sobel, a 73-year-old lawyer, said he had never passed up an opportunity to vote in a Democratic primary. Until now.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Is Mixed as Dealers Await Japanese Trade Figures

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar was mixed against other leading currencies yesterday as traders awaited the release of Japanese trade figures amid rising tensions with the United States.
The dollar rose narrowly against the yen, but traders seemed hesitant to make major moves after a plunge on Tuesday caused by concern about growing Japanese exports. 
 Strong German economic data pushed the dollar lower yesterday against the mark.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 119.31 yen, up from 118.93 late Tuesday. It fetched 1.7990 marks, down from 1.8135. The British pound eased to $1.5850, from $1.5881.
The slight rebound against the yen came after the dollar suffered its biggest one-day drop in a month. The plunge was caused by remarks from Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, who said the United States was worried that Japan would rely too heavily on exports for an economic rebound, widening its trade surplus.
The Japanese are to report their current-account balance for July today, and currency traders expected it to show growth in the surplus.
The dollar was also held back by nervousness about a coming meeting of finance officials from the Group of Seven industrial nations, said Christopher Low of HSBC Securities in New York. "There is a fear that the Treasury may resort to intervention to push the dollar down if they're not successful in getting at least some of their trade goals," Mr. Low said.
A higher dollar worsens the trade rift between the United States and Japan by making American exports more expensive and Japanese goods cheaper. The dollar had been rising for the last two weeks amid weak Japanese economic data.
Traders also sold yen yesterday for marks and Swiss francs, which indirectly helped the dollar strengthen against the yen, said Bob Houck of Norwest Bank in Minneapolis.
The mark's strength against the yen contributed to mark gains against the dollar -- something bolstered by German reports of stronger growth in the second-quarter gross domestic product. The prospect of further gains by the mark seemed limited, analysts said, adding that it was not clear the German central bank would raise interest rates despite the stronger growth.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Some say no to a high-powered drive to revamp patent law.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
WITH the blessing of a coalition of large, technology-driven corporations, the Clinton Administration and some senior members of Congress are pressing for a makeover of American patent law. "We're starved for resources and shackled by regulation," argued Bruce A. Lehman, Commissioner of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
But they will not get far if Franco Modigliani, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at M.I.T. as well as an inventor, has the last word on the subject. Casting himself as David to the establishment Goliath, he has organized an open letter to the Senate signed by 20 American Nobel laureates in chemistry, physics and medicine as well as economics. It decries the rush to judgment against "our time tested patent system" and warns that the proposed changes "would sap the very spirit of that wonderful institution." 
 Whether he's right is an open question. But the publicity is likely to improve the odds of stopping the legislative juggernaut, which has been slowed only by a small lobby of independent inventors and some right-wing Congressmen suspicious of anything the Clinton Administration favors.
From economists' perspective, the key tension is the need to foster innovation without inhibiting the diffusion of new technology. Thus, the "optimal" patent system gives inventors strong incentives to invent -- but not to slow adaptation by charging too much or blocking licensing.
The catch, of course, is that nobody knows how to get from here to there. And much of the controversy over the Senate bill comes from the reality that the actual effect of the proposals can't be predicted with much confidence.
The bill, sponsored by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch, would require all patent applications to be disclosed publicly within 18 months rather than when the patent is issued. It would allow challenges to patents -- the jargon is "re-examination" -- under relatively informal administrative procedures. And it would grant limited "prior use" rights to companies that had developed the technology independently but failed to apply for a patent.
Last but hardly least, it would make the Patent Office an independent Government corporation, a variation on the model of the Post Office.
Mr. Lehman insists that the first two provisions would minimize duplicate research -- and subsequent litigation. But Steven Shore, president of the Alliance for American Innovation, the small-inventors' lobby formed to oppose the bill, sees darker implications. "The changes would expose the little guy to new legal challenges, favoring multinationals with deep pockets," he argued.
The debate over "prior use" rights offers a little more to hold onto, but is still apt to leave all but the most dedicated C-Span devotees scratching their heads. Herbert Wamsley, executive director of Intellectual Property Owners, a lobbying arm for big business, calls the provision a "compromise" that minimizes grounds for litigation between patent holders and those who developed similar technology in tandem but chose to keep it secret.
Mr. Modigliani views it as an invitation to substitute trade secrets -- like the recipe for Coke -- for public patents as a means of protecting intellectual property. Reducing the incentive to patent ideas, he argues, is antithetical to society's interest in their rapid dissemination.
Paul A. Samuelson, a fellow Nobel laureate and economist, agrees. "Prior use exemptions weaken the thrust of patent protection," he said.
Easily lost in this fierce fight is the revolutionary idea of corporatizing the Patent Office. The Clinton Administration has made it the centerpiece of Vice President Al Gore's reinvention-of-government initiative. The idea, simply stated, is to leave the agency under the indirect control of the Secretary of Commerce but grant it broad flexibility in administration and personnel.
According to Commissioner Lehman, this would make it possible to run the agency like the skilled service business it resembles. "We train a patent examiner for years in an area like biotechnology," Mr. Lehman lamented, only to lose him to a higher-paid job in private industry.
By the same token, Mr. Lehman wants the flexibility to short-circuit Government procurement policies, especially in information technology. The sad tale of the Federal Aviation Administration's two-decade odyssey in modernizing the air traffic control system comes to mind.
The fact that change is largely driven by big business doesn't necessarily mean that it is bad for smaller business or the public. On the other hand, there is little doubt that many inventors really are convinced that politicians are selling them out for a mess of campaign contributions.
Probably the most convincing argument Mr. Modigliani and friends make is that the highly technical debate has not been given a proper airing. "Lighting a fire with the public can't be a bad thing," Mr. Samuelson allowed.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Heavy Supply Keeps Bonds On Defensive

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities remained depressed for a second day yesterday, as market sentiment remained negative before tomorrow's reports on retail and manufacturing data for last month.
The volume of corporate and international supply rolling into the market -- $15 billion this week and perhaps a similar amount next week -- helped keep traders on the defensive. Selling was concentrated in securities with long maturities, and there was some buying at the short end. 
 The benchmark 30-year bond dropped 12/32, to a price of 96 13/32, pushing the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, to 6.65 percent, from 6.62 percent on Tuesday.
Dave Shabelman, Treasury market analyst for Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis unit in San Francisco, said that with little economic data available yesterday, bears seized control of trading in the long bond because of concerns that the retail sales report would be strong, raising the possibility of inflation. "What the market is doing is pricing in the additional risk of a stronger-than-expected number," Mr. Shabelman said.
Mr. Shabelman also said the weakness in the early morning smacked of what he called "stop hunting," in which there are certain technical levels at which investors have given orders to either sell to stop losses or to establish defensive positions.
Prices were supported somewhat by a move by the Federal Reserve to buy coupons. The market had anticipated, but then given up hope of, such a move, in which the Fed buys securities for its own account. The central bank bought coupons dated from March 31, 1998, through Aug. 31, 1999.
But that was not enough to offset the negative effect of the flood of new supply. Among the debt issues priced yesterday was a $1.25 billion deal by ICI Wilmington Inc. that is guaranteed by the parent, Imperial Chemical Industries of Britain. It was offered in three parts, as underwriters led by Goldman. Sachs & Company priced $250 million of 5-year notes to yield 6.755 percent, $750 million of 7-year notes yielding 6.955 percent and $250 million of 10-year notes yielding 7.063 percent.
Also, Petroleos Mexicanos, the Mexican state-owned oil company, started selling $1 billion in bonds. In the first part, the oil concern is selling $600 million in bonds due in about 10 years, at a price to yield 250 to 255 basis points more than a comparable government security. It is also selling $400 million of bonds with a maturity of about 30 years, to yield about 280 to 285 basis points more than a comparable government security. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Jack Ablin, executive vice president at Barnett Capital Advisors, said investor demand allowed the South Korean Development Bank to raise a debt offering through Lehman Brothers and J. P. Morgan to $1.5 billion from $1 billion.
"As little as six months ago Korea was a favorite among fixed-income investors; then, about two months ago, it was suddenly out of favor," Mr. Ablin said. "A lot had to do with problems in the Southeast Asian region. There were some highly visible bankruptcies amid an unstable political climate that also contributed to the Street's negative bias." The demand for the latest offering indicates that South Korea is perhaps back in favor, he said.
The offering consists of $900 million of four-year bonds at a price to yield 98 basis points over a comparable Treasury, and $600 million of seven-year bonds at 115 basis points above Treasury.
