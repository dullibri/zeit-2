HEADLINE: The Commencement Controversy

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA. 
An investigative reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE actor James Franco at U.C.L.A. John M. McHugh, the former Army secretary, at the State University of New York at Oswego. The commentator Ben Stein at the University of Vermont. All are notable figures who were invited to participate in college graduations in recent years, only to withdraw or be disinvited in the face of campus protests.
Commencement season has arrived, and with it a perennial debate over free speech on campus. So far this year, students on at least 10 campuses have protested speakers invited to commencement events. Robert B. Zoellick, the former president of the World Bank, withdrew last month as a commencement speaker at Swarthmore College -- his alma mater -- after students mounted a campaign on Facebook calling him an ''architect of the Iraq war'' and a ''war criminal'' because of his support of the 2003 invasion. Benjamin Carson, a renowned neurosurgeon and conservative icon, dropped out as a commencement speaker last month at Johns Hopkins University after students protested comments he'd made lumping together homosexuality, pedophilia and bestiality. 
Earlier this month, President Obama was the subject of a controversy at Morehouse College, where he is slated to give this year's commencement speech. Morehouse also invited a Philadelphia pastor, the Rev. Kevin Johnson, to speak the day before Mr. Obama. But after the minister wrote a column in The Philadelphia Tribune criticizing Mr. Obama for failing to appoint African-Americans to cabinet positions, the university told Mr. Johnson -- in a move that alumni later criticized -- that they wanted to provide a broad spectrum of views so he would not be the sole speaker at that event. Mr. Johnson publicly withdrew as a speaker.
Even though most free-speech advocacy groups do not compile data on such protests, ''It does appear that 'disinvitation season' incidents have accelerated in recent years, with this year inspiring an uptick of these episodes,'' said Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.
In the era of Facebook and flash mobs, university administrators appear to be more skittish, knowing how quickly ideas -- be they good, bad or just plain unruly -- can go viral.
''It's difficult for an institution to identify speakers who don't raise the ire of some group but can still provide a thought-provoking commencement speech,'' said Rae Goldsmith, a vice president at the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, an educational association. Some commentators regard student protests against invited speakers as another indicator of the divisiveness of American culture and part of a larger trend of politically correct ''orthodoxies'' on campuses. Universities are meant to be bastions of open-mindedness and free speech, they say, but are more prone to censoring disagreeable ideas or drowning them out -- a practice some have labeled ''the heckler's veto.''
''By giving in to protesters, colleges are denying the majority of students their right to hear controversial opinions and drawing their own conclusions about those opinions,'' said Bob Beckel, a Democratic strategist and commentator, in a recent USA Today online debate.
But other free-speech advocates contend that these protests actually represent an increase in free speech and that students should be able to influence campus decisions. The aim of such protests, these advocates say, is not usually to prevent controversial speakers from presenting their ideas but to encourage them to take the microphone at a time other than commencement day.
''This isn't about tolerance or intolerance,'' Mark Schwartz, a Swarthmore alumnus, told the campus newspaper about the successful protests against Mr. Zoellick's appearance on campus, where he was to receive an honorary degree. ''It's about whether or not you honor somebody within the highest ideals of Swarthmore's Quaker tradition.''
The protests take various forms. In 2002, Syracuse students held up their wallets during the commencement speech by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City. The wallets were meant to recall Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who was shot at 41 times by policemen in 1999 after he reached for his identification. The conservative commentator Ann Coulter canceled an appearance at the University of Ottawa in 2010 after about 2,000 students, angered by her comments about Muslims, crowded the entrance to the hall at which she was scheduled to speak.
Some schools have tried to insulate themselves by avoiding civic leaders and politicians, and turning instead to pop culture icons like Kermit the Frog, Dolly Parton and Stephen Colbert for commencement addresses. (But even this does not always work: Mr. Franco's invitation from U.C.L.A. was protested for its lack of gravitas.)
Other universities have reserved the guest speakership for campus figures, like popular professors or university chancellors. According to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, more than 70 universities have tried to corral protesters into ''free speech zones'' -- designated places where rallies are permitted but are often removed from main events or in fenced-off areas.
Still, the protests show no signs of ebbing. Cuts to education and welfare spending by Gov. Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania spurred an online campaign against his scheduled commencement appearance at Millersville University in central Pennsylvania. And in April, Skidmore College students stormed a faculty meeting to protest an invitation to Cynthia Carroll, the former chief executive of the mining company Anglo American, citing her company's environmental and human rights record.
''It's my commencement,'' one student told faculty members. ''Not hers. Not yours.''

CORRECTION-DATE: June 9, 2013

 CORRECTION:
A news analysis article on May 12, about controversies over commencement speakers, incorrectly described the death of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who was killed by New York City police officers in 1999. They fired 41 shots, 19 of which struck Mr. Diallo; he was not shot 41 times.

HEADLINE: After Fair Trade Coffee, Fair Trade Shea

BYLINE: FRANKIE EDOZIEN


HIGHLIGHT: Some of the West African women who harvest shea are coming to New York this week to talk to the multinationals that buy their product about how to make sure everyone benefits. 

 BODY:
A few of the estimated 16 million African women who pick shea nuts for a living are going to be making their case for fair trade to the giant corporations who buy their nuts in New York City on Monday.
These women - many of them making their first trip outside Africa - are the main attraction at the first-ever Shea Butter Trade Industry conferencein North America. 
They will rub shoulders in a midtown Manhattan hotel with cosmetic industry titans - the likes of L'Oréal, Kao (maker of Jergens brand products) and the Body Shop - as well as large-scale chocolatiers and confectioners.
In rural villages across West Africa, women use traditional methods to extract the fat from shea nuts, producing shea butter, a solid, whitish-yellow vegetable fat. 
They use it for cooking and for skin care. This same fat is the main ingredient in the Body Shop's best-selling Chocomania Body Butter and many other skin-care products.
For confectioners, specialty fats made from shea are used to make "cocoa butter equivalents" that give chocolate a higher melting point and a smoother texture.
You can see how one community in northern Ghana extracts shea butter here. 
The women coming to New York want their corporate buyers to pay a fair price. They also want them to buy and use more shea in food products. Shea is currently used to make Kit Kat bars, Almond Joys, Milky Ways and other confections. 
Antoine Turpin of IOI Loders Croklaan - a worldwide supplier of edible oils - says "shea is an important source of revenue to millions of women and their families across Africa. Empowering these women economically is crucial to the industry's sustainability."
That sustainability is in his interest too. His firmpurchases an estimated 25 percent of all the shea nuts picked by women in West Africa for use in confectioneries. 
Mr. Turpin will be explaining the supply chain, "from tree to chocolate," on Monday and making a case for how shea can be used.
The conference organizers, the Global Shea Alliance, was first brought together by the West Africa Trade Hub, an offshoot of the United States Agency for International Development, in 2011.
Now it is an independent body, and this gathering is their coming out. 
In the same way that the members up and down the supply chain involved in other global commodities, most famously coffee, have embraced fair trade, many stakeholders in the shea business hope to do the same. 
"The Body Shop has used shea for over 19 years and we are firmly committed to using our learning to build a sustainable shea sector," said Mark Davis, the company's director of community fair trade. "Being a member of the Global Shea Alliance is critical to achieving that goal." 
One of the alliance's stated goals is that the women who pick the shea nuts get good prices but also deliver better quality product. They are coming to New York "to develop a strategy to empower the millions of women who collect shea nuts," said Salima Makama, the association's president. 
Development consultants will join them. 
A 2010 U.S.A.I.D. survey conducted in Burkina Faso found that for every $1,000 worth of shea nuts sold, an additional $1,580 in economic activity was generated for the village.
It's estimated that shea exports from West Africa total $90 million to $200 million a year. The trees grow in the savannah region that lies south of the Sahel in an area totaling 3 million square kilometers, or 1.15 million square miles, and extends from Senegal to South Sudan. 
This area is dry and generally flat. Shea trees appear to grow at random in the wild but are actually managed on parklands.

HEADLINE: Little Pigs, Little Pigs, Let Us In on Your Mysterious Past

BYLINE: EDNA ISHAYIK


HIGHLIGHT: Crates of ceramic pigs found in an all-but-forgotten storage area at New York University left some wondering where the tchotchkes had come from and why they were there. 

 BODY:
Joe Diaz remembers the call on his two-way radio. About eight years ago, he was beckoned down to the crawl space under the auditorium at the Stern School of Business at New York University. His team of facilities workers had found something he needed to see: a box full of little ceramic pigs. 
Among the castoff cleaning products and outdated office supplies in the all-but-forgotten storage area were crates full of pig-shaped tchotchkes: salt and pepper shakers, gravy boats, ashtrays, and all manner of figurines. There was a wax candle piglet, a terra-cotta souvenir from Mexico, a beer stein molded in a pig's likeness, even a few marzipan pigs. 
"It went on like an archaeological dig," Mr. Diaz, a facilities manager, wrote in an e-mail recently. "The boxes containing the pigs were not all together and they kept appearing."
And so a mystery was born. Where had the pigs - well over 200 of them - come from? And why were they there?
Mr. Diaz was met with confused looks when he told his superiors about the cache. But the order came down quickly: toss the boxes. 
Luckily for the pigs, Paul Affuso was in the room. Mr. Affuso, now an associate dean at the business school, had worked at the university since 1973 and had heard about the pigs. "I was told they were left as a gift to the undergraduate college, and that this woman had collected them all her life, just as a hobby," Mr. Affuso said. "I think she was an alum. I assume she passed away."
Mr. Affuso believes that the collection was appraised when it was first donated. More than that he does not recall.
Under Mr. Affuso's direction, the pigs were moved to a supply closet on the seventh floor of the business school's Tisch Hall. 
"I went through the exercise of unpacking them, just for fun, and put them up on bookcases," Mr. Affuso said. There they remained, to be forgotten again, in a small dark, windowless room, behind a locked door. 
One day about four years later, the door was left ajar, and John W. Asker, an assistant professor of economics, happened to peek inside. 
"I was stunned," said Mr. Asker, now an associate professor, "and then deeply amused." 
Word of the strange treasure in the seventh-floor storage space got out, and real estate in New York being what it is, the pigs' new habitat was soon threatened. 
"There were a lot of people who coveted the pig closet," said Barbara Albrecht, the school's head of facilities. "We used to not let anybody in there. Somehow people got in there. And I have these notes like, 'We really could use that space.'" 
Professional movers were called by the facilities team to consolidate the hogs. Each one was wrapped in white paper, and they were packed into 16 fresh cardboard moving boxes. Ms. Albrecht said the boxes were not stored in one place, but scattered in large crates in various storage places on campus.
To this day, the provenance of the pigs remains completely obscure. At the request of The New York Times, the Stern development office searched its records for any notes regarding this distinctive in-kind contribution, to no avail.
One day last month, university officials pulled some of the pigs out of a closet in Tisch Hall to allow a reporter to see them. The Stern School's executive budget director, Ellen Axelrod, happened to be nearby. She had had no idea of their existence.
"I'm excited!" Ms. Axelrod said. "I want to look at them! Of all the animals, they're pigs, which I love. This is exciting for Stern!"
Despite Ms. Axelrod's enthusiasm, Ms. Albrecht said there were no plans to display the pigs any time soon. 
"It's possible that we might consolidate all of the pig crates into a single closet, however, we might just leave the crates stored in the various locations where they are now," Ms. Albrecht said in an e-mail. "They are safe and secure as they are."

HEADLINE: Student Debt and the Crushing of the American Dream

BYLINE: JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ


HIGHLIGHT: With soaring costs, stagnating incomes and little help from the government, there is only one way to pay for higher education: debt. 

 BODY:
A CERTAIN drama has become familiar in the United States (and some other advanced industrialized countries): Bankers encourage people to borrow beyond their means, preying especially on those who are financially unsophisticated. They use their political influence to get favorable treatment of one form or another. Debts mount. Journalists record the human toll. Then comes bewilderment: How could we let this happen again? Officials promise to fix things. Something is done about the most egregious abuses. People move on, reassured that the crisis has abated, but suspecting that it will recur soon.
The crisis that is about to break out involves student debt and how we finance higher education. Like the housing crisis that preceded it, this crisis is intimately connected to America's soaring inequality, and how, as Americans on the bottom rungs of the ladder strive to climb up, they are inevitably pulled down - some to a point even lower than where they began. 
This new crisis is emerging even before the last one has been resolved, and the two are becoming intertwined. In the decades after World War II, homeownership and higher education became signs of success in America.

Before the housing bubble burst in 2007, banks persuaded low- and moderate-income homeowners that they could turn their houses and apartments into piggy banks. They seduced them into taking out home-equity loans - and in the end, millions lost their homes. In other cases, the banks, mortgage brokers and real-estate agents pushed aspiring homeowners to borrow beyond their means. The wizards of finance, who prided themselves on risk management, sold toxic mortgages that were designed to explode. They bundled the dubious loans into complex financial instruments and sold them to unsuspecting investors.
Everyone recognizes that education is the only way up, but as a college degree becomes increasingly essential to making one's way in a 21st-century economy, education for those not to the manor born is increasingly unaffordable. Student debt for seniors graduating with loans now exceeds $26,000, about a 40 percent increase (not adjusted for inflation) in just seven years. But an "average" like this masks huge variations.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, almost 13 percent of student-loan borrowers of all ages owe more than $50,000, and nearly 4 percent owe more than $100,000. These debts are beyond students' ability to repay, (especially in our nearly jobless recovery); this is demonstrated by the fact that delinquency and default rates are soaring. Some 17 percent of student-loan borrowers were 90 days or more behind in payments at the end of 2012. When only those in repayment were counted - in other words, not including borrowers who were in loan deferment or forbearance - more than 30 percent were 90 days or more behind. For federal loans taken out in the 2009 fiscal year, three-year default rates exceeded 13 percent.
America is distinctive among advanced industrialized countries in the burden it places on students and their parents for financing higher education. America is also exceptional among comparable countries for the high cost of a college degree, including at public universities. Average tuition, and room and board, at four-year colleges is just short of $22,000 a year, up from under $9,000 (adjusted for inflation) in 1980-81.
Compare this more-than-doubling in tuition with the stagnation in median family income, which is now about $50,000, compared to $46,000 in 1980 (adjusted for inflation).
Like much else, the problem of student debt worsened during the Great Recession: tuition costs at public universities increased by 27 percent in the past five years - partly because of cutbacks - while median income shrank. In California, inflation-adjusted tuition more than doubled in public two-year community colleges (which for poorer Americans are often the key to upward mobility), and by more than 70 percent in four-year public schools, from 2007-8 to 2012-13.
With costs soaring, incomes stagnating and little help from government, it was not surprising that total student debt, around $1 trillion, surpassed total credit-card debt last year. Responsible Americans have learned how to curb their credit-card debt - many have forsaken them for debit cards, or educated themselves about usurious interest rates, fees and penalties charged by card issuers - but the challenge of controlling student debt is even more unsettling.
Curbing student debt is tantamount to curbing social and economic opportunity. College graduates earn $12,000 more per year than those without college degrees; the gap has almost tripled just since 1980. Our economy is increasingly reliant on knowledge-related industries. No matter what happens with currency wars and trade balances, the United States is not going to return to making textiles. Unemployment rates among college graduates are much lower than among those with only a high school diploma.
America - home of the land-grant university, the G.I. Bill and world-class public universities from California to Michigan to Texas - has fallen from the top in terms of university education. With strangling student debt, we are likely to fall further. What economists call "human capital" - investing in people - is a key to long-term growth. To be competitive in the 21st century is to have a highly educated labor force, one with college and advanced degrees. Instead, we are foreclosing on our future as a nation.
Student debt also is a drag on the slow recovery that began in 2009. By dampening consumption, it hinders economic growth. It is also holding back recovery in real estate, the sector where the Great Recession started.
It's true that housing prices seem to be on the upswing, but home construction is far from the levels reached in the years before the bubble burst of 2007.
Those with huge debts are likely to be cautious before undertaking the additional burdens of a family. But even when they do, they will find it more difficult to get a mortgage. And if they do, it will be smaller, and the real estate recovery will consequently be weaker. (One study of recent Rutgers University graduates showed that 40 percent had delayed making a major home purchase, and for a quarter, the high level of debt had an effect on household formation or getting further education. Another recent study showed that homeownership among 30-year-olds with a history of student debt fell by more than 10 percentage points during the Great Recession and in its aftermath.)
It's a vicious cycle: lack of demand for housing contributes to a lack of jobs, which contributes to weak household formation, which contributes to a lack of demand for housing.
As bad as things are, they may get worse. With budgetary pressures mounting - along with demands for cutbacks in "discretionary domestic programs" (read: K-12 education subsidies, Pell Grants for poor kids to attend college, research money) - students and families are left to fend for themselves. College costs will continue to rise far faster than incomes. As has been repeatedly observed, all of the economic gains since the Great Recession have gone to the top 1 percent.
Consider another dubious distinction: student debt is almost impossible to discharge in bankruptcy proceedings.
We're a long way from the debtors' prisons Dickens described. We don't send debtors to penal colonies or put them in bonded labor. Although personal bankruptcy laws have been tightened, the principle that bankrupt individuals should be allowed a fresh start, and a chance to discharge excessive debt, is an established principle. This helps debt markets work better, and also provides incentives for creditors to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers.
Yet education loans are almost impossible to write off in bankruptcy court - even when for-profit schools didn't deliver what they promised and didn't provide an education that would let the borrower get a job that paid enough to pay back the loan.
We should cut off federal support for these for-profit schools when they fail to graduate students, who don't get jobs and then default on their loans.
To its credit, the Obama administration tried to make it tougher for these predatory schools to lure students with false promises. Under the new rules, schools had to meet one of three tests, or lose their eligibility for federal student aid: at least 35 percent of graduates had to be repaying their loans; the typical graduate's estimated annual loan payments could not exceed 12 percent of earnings; or the payments could not exceed 30 percent of discretionary income. But in 2012, a federal judge struck down the rules as arbitrary; the rules remain in legal limbo.
The combination of predatory for-profit schools and predatory lenders is a leech on America's poor. These schools have even gone after young veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. There are heart-rending stories of parents who co-signed student loans - only to see their child killed in an accident or die of cancer or another disease - and, like students, can't easily discharge these debts.
Interest rates on federal Stafford loans were set to double in July, to 6.8 percent. Good news came on Friday: it appears that there is a temporary reprieve, as Republicans have come around. But the stay would be temporary and would not address a more fundamental issue: if the Federal Reserve is willing to lend to the banks that caused the crisis at just 0.75 percent, shouldn't it be willing to lend to students, who will be crucial to our long-term recovery, at an appropriately low rate? The government shouldn't be profiting from our poorest while subsidizing our richest. A proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, for lower student-loan interest rates is a step in the right direction.
Along with tougher regulation of for-profit schools and the banks they connive with, and more humane bankruptcy laws, we must give more support to middle-class families struggling to send their children to college, to ensure that they have a standard of living at least equal to that of their parents.
But a real long-term solution requires rethinking how we finance higher education. Australia has designed a system of publicly provided income-contingent loans that all students must take out. Repayments vary according to individual income after graduation. This aligns the incentives of the providers of education and the receivers. Both have an incentive to see that students do well. It means that if an unfortunate event happens, like an illness or an accident, the loan obligation is automatically reduced. It means that the burden of the debt is always commensurate with an individual's ability to repay. The repayments are collected through the tax system, minimizing the administrative costs.
Some wonder how the American ideal of equality of opportunity has eroded so much. The way we finance higher education provides part of the answer. Student debt has become an integral part of the story of American inequality. Robust higher education, with healthy public support, was once the linchpin in a system that promised opportunity for dedicated students of any means. We now have a pay-to-play, winner-take-all game where the wealthiest are assured a spot, and the rest are compelled to take a gamble on huge debts, with no guarantee of a payoff.
Even if compassion isn't a factor - even if we focus just on recovery now and growth and innovation tomorrow - we must do something about student debt. Those concerned about the damage America's growing divide is doing to our ideals and our moral character should put student debt at the top of any reform agenda.

HEADLINE: How We Do It: Time Diaries of Family Life

BYLINE: KJ DELL'ANTONIA


HIGHLIGHT: Parents taking on the ordinary challenges of life and work and family hear it all the time: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you do it!&#8221; In Motherlode&#8217;s new series, they offer the play by play on a typical day. 

 BODY:
"I don't know how you do it." 
It's a book title ("I Don't Know How She Does It"), a movie (ditto) and refrain sung of parents everywhere who are taking on the usual challenges of life and work and family and then some. How do we do it all? There are only so many hours in the day, and as parents, we're on deck for our children for every single one of them, even as we stay on top of our other responsibilities - work, community obligations, caring for other family members. We're caregivers and breadwinners, and we're still finding time to be ourselves. 
For our new series "How I Do It," Motherlode sought out parents across the country (and in one case overseas) to ask the question literally: How, on a day-to-day basis, do you do it? 
We asked contributors to keep a time diary of a typical day. Who gets up when? Who makes breakfast? Who does drop off, or who stays home? If a child gets sick at school, who takes the call?
"Be honest," we asked, about how much help you have, and how much help you need. In our "do it yourself" culture, some parents find it difficult to own up to needing a nanny or housekeeper. But one universal of life as a parent of young children is that every parent who ever left the house without a child in tow needs help (even the most even-steven dedicated parenting couples need to go out together once in a while). As one participant put it, paid help is a "privilege and a luxury," but in her case, and in many others, it's also a necessity. Some of us, at almost every economic level, pay for help. Others find it in family or trade for it with friends. Very few of us are truly going it alone, and we all benefit when we don't pretend otherwise.
"How I Do It" kicks off on Mother's Day, 2013, with Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Her diary of a Saturday at home (because she's rarely home during the week) can be readhere. She will be followed by a line engineer for the Chevrolet Malibu, an American Public Media host (Marketplace's Kai Ryssdal), a Walmart employee who parents her grandchildren, the former pro basketball star and sports analyst Rebecca Lobo and others. So far, one universal has emerged: even a typical day is never predictable. 
How do you do it? Share your time diary on your blog (tweet it with hashtag #howidoit and @NYTMotherlode will share), or give us a glimpse of a "typical" morning, afternoon or witching hour in the comments or on Facebook.

HIGHLIGHT: Ted Cruz and the politics of selfishness. 

 BODY:
Logic, thy name is not Ted Cruz. The very junior senator from Texas is a well-credentialed windbag, with degrees from Princeton and Harvard Law, and a stint clerking at the Supreme Court. After a few months in Congress promoting Ted Cruz, smartest guy in the room, it looks as if he now wants to be Ted Cruz, extremely obnoxious president. But he keeps saying things that make no sense.
There he was, earlier this month, writing in opposition to a bill that would allow cash-strapped states to tax Internet sales. It passed by a bipartisan majority in the Senate, which is like saying Newt Gingrich just climbed Mount Everest. 
"And, how is it fair for a Texas business to collect taxes to support California Gov. Jerry Brown's big spending? Or to underwrite New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's nanny statism or Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's anti-Second Amendment agenda?"
Perhaps it's not fair, but neither is it a mandatory requirement of the bill. The Marketplace Fairness Act would allow consumers to buy local, and keep the taxes local, should they wish. Isn't that what Republicans want? I mean, outside of trying to repeal the 20th century.

It's clear that Senator Cruz can't stand California, Illinois or New York and all they represent. Fine. But let's say the Internet sales-tax bill becomes law, and Senator Cruz is sitting at home in Houston, doing some online shopping. While buying the latest weapon accessories, he could support Texas values and purchase only from Texas-based retailers, thus ensuring that Texas taxes continue to be spent on their usual things - everything but regulatory oversight of industrial polluters. Wow: choice!
Now, should his wandering shopper's eye drift toward some product that comes from one of the evil blue states, he would indeed have to contribute in a small way to the welfare of non-Texans. This happens every day, of course, on a huge scale, with the distribution of federal tax dollars throughout the United States, all 50 of them.
Just to take the Cruz argument to its, um, logical end, you should be pretty upset if you live in New York, California or Illinois right now, because you keep afloat dozens of Republican states. New Yorkers pay far more in federal tax dollars than they get back in federal spending. Between 1990 and 2009, taxpayers in New York State transferred out $950 billion to the rest of the country in federal taxes, according to The Economist.
That money went to keep states like Kentucky, Alabama, West Virginia and Arkansas from further hardship. Still, even though New Yorkers subsidized the states closest to the political values of Ted Cruz, you never heard much complaining about how it's unfair to support the gun-toting culture of the South, or underwrite its chronic disregard for the poor, the environment and those without health insurance. For that matter, "how is it fair" that tax dollars from Rahm Emanuel's Chicago are underwriting Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, where dozens of recruits say they were sexually harassed and raped by their instructors?
You pay taxes, but you don't get to pick and choose how they are spent. Cruz knows this. He also has to know that Republican governors like Bob McDonnell of Virginia support the Internet sales-tax bill, because it will pay for needed transportation projects and allow the state to forgo a gas-tax hike. The bill is endorsed by the National Governors Association - where Republicans hold a majority - because the states lost out on an estimated $26 billion in sales taxes last year alone.
The National Retail Federation also favors the Internet sales-tax bill. To them, it's a matter of simple fairness. A brick and mortar store, selling the same product as a Web-based retailer, pays taxes that the competitor can avoid. "This collective disparity," the organization wrote in support of the bill "has tilted the competitive landscape against local stores, creating a crisis for brick and mortar retailers around the country."
Helping fellow Republicans govern, or small businesses prosper, is clearly not part of the grand design of Ted Cruz. His job is to say outrageous things, and hope that enough people consider him a maverick for his outbursts. But shouldn't a man with his self-proclaimed intellectual prowess at least try to be consistent? You would think that someone born in Calgary, Alberta, to a father who is an immigrant from Cuba would reach out to the 11 million illegal immigrants in this country. Instead he put his marker down last week: under no circumstances would he support a path to citizenship for those living in the shadows.
Senator Cruz probably doesn't mind the title that's been hung on him - most hated man in the Senate. I suspect he also relishes being called a "wacko bird" (John McCain's term) because, for now, it's the avian wing that dominates his party.

HEADLINE: Pilotless Planes, Pacific Tensions

BYLINE: By RICHARD PARKER. 
Richard Parker, a journalist, is the author of the forthcoming book ''Unblinking: Rise of the Modern Superdrones.''

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex.
THIS week the Navy will launch an entirely autonomous combat drone -- without a pilot on a joystick anywhere -- off the deck of an aircraft carrier, the George H. W. Bush. The drone will then try to land aboard the same ship, a feat only a relatively few human pilots in the world can accomplish.
This exercise is the beginning of a new chapter in military history: autonomous drone warfare. But it is also an ominous turn in a potentially dangerous military rivalry now building between the United States and China. 
The X-47B, a stealth plane nicknamed ''the Robot'' by Navy crews, is a big bird -- 38 feet long, with a 62-foot wingspan -- that flies at high subsonic speeds with a range of over 2,000 miles. But it is the technology inside the Robot that makes it a game-changer in East Asia. Its entirely computerized takeoff, flight and landing raise the possibility of dozens or hundreds of its successors engaged in combat at once.
It is also capable of withstanding radiation levels that would kill a human pilot and destroy a regular jet's electronics: in addition to conventional bombs, successors to this test plane could be equipped to carry a high-power microwave, a device that emits a burst of radiation that would fry a tech-savvy enemy's power grids, knocking out everything connected to it, including computer networks that connect satellites, ships and precision-guided missiles.
And these, of course, are among the key things China has invested in during its crash-course military modernization. While the United States Navy is launching an autonomous drone, the Chinese Navy is playing catch-up with piloted carrier flight. Last November the Chinese Navy landed a J-15 jet fighter on the deck of the Liaoning aircraft carrier, the country's first carrier landing.
Though China still has miles to go in developing a carrier fleet to rival America's, the landing demonstrates its ambitions. With nearly half a million sailors and fast approaching 1,000 vessels, its navy is by some measures already the second largest in the world.
With that new navy, Beijing seeks to project its power over a series of island chains far into the Pacific: the first extends southward from the Korean Peninsula, down the eastern shore of Taiwan, encircling the South China Sea, while the second runs southeast from Japan to the Bonin and Marshall Islands, encompassing both the Northern Mariana Islands, a United States territory, and Guam -- the key American base in the western Pacific. Some unofficial Chinese military literature even refers to a third chain: the Hawaiian Islands.
To project this kind of power, China must rely not only on the quantity of its ships but also on the quality of its technology. Keeping the Americans half an ocean away requires the capability for long-range precision strikes -- which, in turn, require the satellite reconnaissance, cyber warfare, encrypted communications and computer networks in which China has invested nearly $100 billion over the last decade.
Ideally for both countries, China's efforts would create a new balance of power in the region. But to offset China's numerical advantage and technological advances, the United States Navy is betting heavily on drones -- not just the X-47B and its successors, but anti-submarine reconnaissance drones, long-range communications drones, even underwater drones. A single hunter-killer pairing of a Triton reconnaissance drone and a P-8A Poseidon piloted anti-submarine plane can sweep 2.7 million square miles of ocean in a single mission.
The arms race between the world's largest navies undermines the likelihood of attaining a new balance of power, and raise the possibility of unintended collisions as the United States deploys hundreds, even thousands of drones and China scrambles for ways to counter the new challenge. And drones, because they are cheap and don't need a human pilot, lower the bar for aggressive behavior on the part of America's military leaders -- as they will for China's navy, as soon as it makes its own inevitable foray into drone capabilities (indeed, there were reports last week that China was preparing its own stealth drone for flight tests).
By themselves, naval rivalries do not start wars. During peacetime, in fact, naval operations are a form of diplomacy, which provide rivals with healthy displays of force that serve as deterrents to war. But they have to be enveloped in larger political relationships, too.
At present, the United States-China relationship is really just about economics. As long as that relationship remains vibrant, confrontation is in neither country's interest. But should that slender reed snap, there is little in the way of a larger political relationship, let alone alliance, to take its place. The only thing between crisis and conflict, then, would be two ever larger, more dangerous navies, prepared to fight a breed of drone-centric war we don't yet fully understand, and so are all the more likely to fall into.

HEADLINE: Life After Watson For Researcher

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
To the degree there was a human face of Watson, the ''Jeopardy!'' computer champion, it was David Ferrucci. He was the I.B.M. researcher who led the development of Watson, an artificial intelligence engine. The goateed computer scientist was always articulate and at ease in front of a camera or a microphone.
Dr. Ferrucci has left I.B.M. to join the giant hedge fund Bridgewater Associates. And the weight of the Watson-related fame, it seems, played a role. ''I was so linked to the Watson achievement, and where I.B.M. was taking it, that I felt I was almost losing my identity,'' he said in a recent interview. 
After Watson beat the best human Jeopardy champions in 2011, its artificial intelligence technology was directed toward new challenges, like assisting doctors in making diagnoses in a research project at the Cleveland Clinic.
Dr. Ferrucci led that next-generation Watson research as well. But he went to Bridgewater at the end of last year. Bridgewater, a private company, made no announcement of its new hire. Yet word of Dr. Ferrucci's departure from I.B.M. has been circulating among scientists in the artificial intelligence field. And I caught up with him recently for an interview, supplemented by a lengthy e-mail he titled, ''My Reflections.''
Dr. Ferrucci, 51, said he had ''a great, great career'' at I.B.M., spanning 20 years, and ''they paid me very well.''He said he ''never imagined myself at a hedge fund,'' but eventually the appeal of working in a smaller environment in an entirely new field for him -- applying artificial intelligence to macroeconomic modeling -- won him over.
Dr. Ferrucci said the more recent work he was doing at I.B.M., called WatsonPaths, was the direction he thought artificial intelligence research needed to go to make further advances, and it was the approach he saw Bridgewater pursuing to economic modeling.
Much of artificial intelligence today, he said, focuses on mining vast amounts of data to make predictions. Those predictions are based on statistical probabilities and patterns -- a certain symptom is highly correlated with a certain disease, for example.
''But in a purely data-driven approach, I can't explain my decisions,'' Dr. Ferrucci said. ''People are so enamored with the data-driven approach that they believe correlation is sufficient.''
The Big Data formula, he noted, has proved to be ''incredibly powerful'' for tasks like natural-language processing -- a central technology behind Google search, for instance.
WatsonPaths, by contrast, builds step-by-step graphs, or paths, that trace possible causes rather than mere statistical correlations. In the case of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic project, for example, the paths go from an observation of symptoms to a conclusion about the diagnosis of a disease and treatment.
That approach is a hybrid of the Big Data tools, which sift through troves of medical literature, and logic tools to identify likely chains of inference -- what humans see as logical explanations for the ''why'' of things. The approach is also a step in the direction of classic artificial intelligence, which relied on knowledge rules and relationships, to create so-called expert systems. The blend combines elements of what Dr. Ferrucci termed ''my 30-year journey in A.I.''
At Bridgewater, Dr. Ferrucci sees a similar path to modeling the economy and markets. ''Their approach to investment,'' he wrote in his e-mail, ''is based on a fundamental understanding of how the global 'economic machine' works.''
Its models, he added, are ''informed by but not blindly driven by the data.'' The opportunity, Dr. Ferrucci wrote, is to build ''predictive systems that fit perfectly with my interests. How cool is it to imagine a machine that can combine deductive and inductive processes to develop, apply, refine and explain a fundamental economic theory?''
Cool, indeed. If successful, perhaps Bridgewater could share its findings with the Fed and the Treasury rather than merely trading for its own account. In the realm of policy, economic modeling and forecasting could use some help.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Building Ties To a Neighbor On the Border

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
SAN DIEGO -- Opening a satellite city office in a far-flung neighborhood is not unusual in sprawling cities like this one. But one thing sets apart Mayor Bob Filner's newest outpost: it is in another country.
When he opened San Diego's Tijuana office this year, Mr. Filner spoke in grand terms about the future of cross-border relations. ''Dos ciudades, pero una region -- we are two cities, but one region,'' he said, using the phrase popular among those who want more collaboration in the area. San Diego would put in a bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics, he said, but only to host jointly with Tijuana.
For years, this coastal city was widely viewed as a hotbed of illegal immigration. Neighbors traded stories of migrants hiding in their garages and hopping through their backyards. But now the region is considered one of the safest parts of the Mexican border, and the number of apprehensions of people crossing illegally is a tiny fraction of what it was a decade ago. 
The changes have helped bring an astounding shift in residents' attitudes toward the border: far from seeing it as a threat, more are embracing it as a potential economic engine for the region. Perhaps one of the most remarkable things about Mr. Filner's efforts to bolster Tijuana is that there has been no opposition from other politicians or organized protests from conservative critics.
''We need to make the border the center, not the end -- but the biggest problem we have is not security, it is openness and communication,'' Mr. Filner said in an interview in his City Hall office. ''People have to understand that the infrastructure that we need should be an important part of any discussion on immigration. The volume here is so incredible, yet nobody understands how much this matters. People can't go back and forth, and we're losing out.''
Border security has been at the center of the debate on an immigration overhaul in Washington, with many lawmakers pushing for more security and fences at the border. The bipartisan group of eight senators who proposed sweeping changes have pointed to San Diego as the example of a secure border. But here, where a multimillion-dollar secondary fence was added a few years ago, many worry about the enormous economic cost of improving security that they feel is already too tight, not too loose.
Mr. Filner and his supporters cite delays at the border crossings that frequently stretch to more than three hours as the prime example of the problems the region faces. They say that more crossing lanes and agents are needed to allow people to cross quickly, and that technology could allow inspections to be completed in seconds rather than minutes. A study by the San Diego Association of Governments estimated that the region loses more than $2 billion annually because of the waits.
''The political buzz made it so that there is a self-evident truth that the border was out of control, and that national stigma remains,'' said Paul Ganster, the director of the Institute for Regional Studies of the Californias at San Diego State University. ''It might make people from Iowa feel better knowing that it takes hours to cross the border, but a better approach is to fix the border so it functions for legitimate purposes. Right now we're just penalizing ourselves with huge inefficiencies.''
While several former mayors have had warm relations with Tijuana officials, Mr. Filner has made cross-border relations a centerpiece of his administration, appointing a binational affairs director and mentioning Mexico at nearly every opportunity. In his inaugural speech, he congratulated the Tijuana soccer team, the Xolos, for winning the Mexican league title the day before, calling the team ''our champions.'' And while the Olympic Committee has already rejected the cross-border bid, Mr. Filner is not deterred.
He was elected last fall after serving for nearly two decades as the Democratic congressman representing a district that included all of California's Mexico border communities. In Congress, he routinely complained about the long lines at the border here, the busiest land crossing in the world.
There are still signs that the longstanding ambivalence about the border here remains. While other American cities along the border have deep ties -- or even a reliance -- with Mexico, many here say San Diego residents mostly have their back to the border and give little thought to their southern neighbor. A recent survey by one local group found that less than 10 percent of residents believed that strengthening the border region should be a priority for improving the local economy. By some estimates, more than 60 percent of San Diego residents have never crossed the border.
''People here tend to think about ourselves as the edge of the Earth, as if there's nothing beyond the border,'' said Denise Moreno Ducheny, a former state senator and an analyst at the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego. ''When you see a place as poor, you can tell yourself it can be ignored or mistreated. But people are starting to understand that it is the front door for a lot of good things that we want to come our way.''
Mexico receives more exports from the United States than any country besides Canada, according to the North American Center for Transborder Studies at Arizona State University. At the Otay-Mesa crossing, a primarily commercial port of entry just eight miles east of the coast, some 3,000 trucks cross daily using two small local roads.
While plans to expand the larger crossing to the west have been approved, the federal money has never been appropriated. The Mexican government completed a renovation on its side of the San Ysidro-Tijuana crossing, but the plans on the American side of the border have stalled, although President Obama included $226 million for the project in his proposed federal budget last month.
''The problem has always been getting others to listen to us,'' said Mayor Carlos Bustamante of Tijuana, who was born in California and attended the University of San Diego. ''But we are an economic force now in a way that we were not a decade or two ago. It is in everyone's interest to take advantage of that.''
Many business leaders here say that marketing San Diego and Tijuana as one large region can help attract jobs and have encouraged manufacturers to move operations from China to Mexico. They mention the success of DJO, an orthopedic company based in Vista, just north of San Diego, with a factory in Tijuana. Over the last several years, the company has added hundreds of jobs on both sides of the border, and several executives work in Tijuana but live in San Diego.
The commute also works the other way. Mario Lopez, Mr. Filner's binational affairs director, still owns a home in his native Tijuana and uses a border pass designed for frequent crossers.
A poster of San Diego hangs prominently in Mr. Lopez's downtown office, meant to remind him of the popular image of the city: sailboats docked in a marina with the picturesque bay and sunny skies in the distance. Like the view from his City Hall window, there is no trace of the border in sight. He pointed to another photo, taken from the vantage point of the hills of Tijuana, which shows a sprawling metropolis on both sides of the border.
''That's what I have to get everyone to see,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Chinese Creating New Auto Niche Within Detroit

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Dozens of companies from China are putting down roots in Detroit, part of the country's steady push into the American auto industry.
Chinese-owned companies are investing in American businesses and new vehicle technology, selling everything from seat belts to shock absorbers in retail stores, and hiring experienced engineers and designers in an effort to soak up the talent and expertise of domestic automakers and their suppliers.
While starting with batteries and auto parts, the spread of Chinese business is expected to result eventually in the sale of Chinese cars in the United States.
''The Chinese are well behind the Japanese when they hit our shores 30 years ago,'' said David E. Cole, a founder of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''They lack the know-how, and they're coming here to get it.'' 
As businesses sprout up with little fanfare, Chinese companies seem to be trying to avoid the type of public opposition experienced by the Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda in the 1980s, when the sudden influx of foreign cars competing head-on with cars from General Motors, Ford and Chrysler was perceived as a threat to American jobs.
In contrast to the Japanese, Chinese auto companies are assiduously avoiding the spotlight. Last year, the biggest carmaker in China, Shanghai Automotive Industries, opened new offices in suburban Detroit without any publicity, which is almost unheard-of in an industry that thrives on media coverage.
But China's growth in the American auto industry is drawing notice in Washington. Last year, the Obama administration filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization that China's government was unfairly subsidizing the production of some parts shipped to America. And the country's inroads into American-made batteries and electric vehicles have drawn scrutiny because that sector of the industry has been heavily subsidized by the United States government.
The American industry's overall resurgence has drawn a growing Chinese population to Detroit, with Chinese-owned suppliers bringing executives from their country and American automakers adding new talent. About 50,000 Chinese, many of them engineers and other professionals who work at General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, live in the metropolitan area.
Business networks are growing too. The Detroit Chinese Business Association boasts a flourishing membership, and counts about 100 Chinese-owned businesses, mostly auto-related, in the region.
The Ford Chinese Association, with 650 white-collar workers, predominantly from mainland China, has become one of the largest employee groups at the company. Its president, Raymond Xu, recalled that in 1999, when he came to Detroit to attend college, there were very few Chinese in the area.
''I think people are going to get more and more comfortable with it,'' Mr. Xu said.
Typical of the Chinese expansion are the nondescript offices of Changan Automotive in an industrial park in the suburban city of Plymouth. Changan, a major carmaker in China, set up a research center to better understand the structural chassis of a vehicle -- then hired about 20 Detroit engineers, some of whom had been laid off from Detroit's auto companies, to staff the project.
''Most of the engineers are very young in China,'' said Hong Su, the Changan executive heading the American facility. ''They know how to make vehicles, but they don't know how to develop them.''One of his employees is Alan Wall, 54, a former contract engineer at Chrysler who lost his job during the recession.
''It was an opportunity,'' he said. ''And those tend to come from a company that is trying to expand.''
Last year, China exported about $13 billion in automotive goods to the United States -- tires, wheels and radios that are sold as replacement parts -- according to AlixPartners, a consulting firm.
But many Chinese suppliers are pursuing direct business with the Detroit car companies, which now get many of their most common parts from low-wage nations like Mexico. One supplier, Brilliance Auto, an industrial giant with about 500,000 employees in the city of Shenyang in northeast China, is still an underdog in Detroit, trying to crack an intricate network of suppliers that have long relationships with G.M. and the other carmakers.
''We have been exporting our parts to North America for 15 years for the aftermarket,'' said Dongbin Chen, a Brilliance executive, referring to retail sales of replacement parts. ''Now our biggest opportunity is with G.M. and the other big companies.''
Brilliance scored a coup last year by supplying lightweight engine mounts for the new Cadillac ATS sedan made by G.M. in Lansing, Mich., which has whetted the company's appetite for more.
At a United States-China conference held here in November, Brilliance displayed a large exhibit showcasing a range of mundane parts -- including seat belts, steering wheels and shock absorbers -- that it hopes to export to America.
''We have the ability and the capacity to supply these kinds of parts,'' Mr. Chen said. ''And I think right now, it is very important for us to be here.''
In addition to Chinese companies locating in Detroit, a cottage industry of lawyers, accountants and corporate advisers has grown up to assist them. Their numbers are small now, but the impact of the Chinese on the local economy is slowly expanding.
Industry analysts are hard-pressed to put a number on the Chinese suppliers operating in the United States. ''We simply don't know how many there are,'' said David Andrea, an official with the Original Equipment Suppliers Association, a trade organization for auto parts makers.
In one of the more prominent deals, the Wanxiang Group bought most of the assets of the battery maker A123 Systems, which filed for bankruptcy last year despite receiving $132 million of $249 million in federal grants to build two factories in Michigan.
Congressional Republicans criticized the deal, saying A123's technology could support military applications in China. Still, the buyout was approved this year by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a federal government panel.
Wanxiang, which has its United States headquarters near Chicago, has acquired several American auto parts and solar companies in recent years. But it attracted little attention until it took an interest in A123 Systems.
''I wasn't surprised by the negative reaction,'' said Pin Ni, president of the company's American unit. ''The reality is we grow here like a small seed into a bigger tree, and we cannot avoid this type of response.''
He said that Wanxiang employed several thousand American workers, and kept local management in place at companies it had bought. ''We act, talk and walk like an American company,'' Mr. Ni said. ''In the end, it's all about making money.''
Other Chinese companies are averse to publicity. Shanghai Auto is the largest carmaker in China and has major joint ventures there with G.M. and the German automaker Volkswagen. But when the company opened its new Detroit-area offices last year, even G.M. was surprised.
''Since we do not do business with SAIC in the U.S., there is no connection between G.M. and the SAIC office in the U.S.,'' said Dayna Hart, a G.M. spokeswoman.
The arms-length reaction underscores the sensitivity surrounding China's presence in the American industry. Only about 4 percent of Chinese-made light vehicles are exported now, mostly to countries in Africa and the Middle East. But the Detroit automakers are bracing for the day when competitive Chinese cars hit the American market.
''The Chinese have a lot of money and they are moving fast,'' said Mr. Cole. ''We're going to see a lot more of them here.''
The growth in the Chinese professional class has had a ripple effect on the broader community, as well, with Chinese community groups sponsoring youth soccer leagues, basketball tournaments and musical performances at Detroit Tigers games. One organization runs a Chinese soup kitchen every year at a local homeless shelter.
Frank Chiu was an engineer for an auto supply company when he saw the growing number of Chinese professionals entering the industry and saw an opportunity. He left his job to open a Chinese grocery store in Canton, Mich, a bedroom community not far from Ford headquarters.
''The timing was very good for this type of business,'' said Mr. Chiu, whose store features Chinese delicacies like chicken feet, snow fungus and pork uterus.
As customers roamed the store around him, Mr. Chiu reflected on how much had changed since he moved from Taiwan more than 20 years ago. ''What was it like then?'' he said. ''Lonely is the first word that comes to mind.''
At Ford, Chinese employees play an integral part in the company's expansion in China, where it is building several new factories. They also help prepare American executives for transfers to China, and play host to Chinese car dealers when they visit Ford's headquarters.
On Feb. 14, hundreds of Ford employees celebrated the Chinese New Year at the stately Dearborn Inn, which was conceived by Henry Ford in the 1930s as a replica of an early American village, with guest cottages that copied the homes of historical figures like Walt Whitman and Patrick Henry.
''We definitely see more openness to the Chinese culture,'' said Mr. Xu, the Ford Chinese Association president. ''We started small here, but we are coming on strong.''

HEADLINE: Dire Report On Detroit Is Offered By Manager

BYLINE: By STEVEN YACCINO and MONICA DAVEY; Steven Yaccino reported from Detroit, and Monica Davey from Wisconsin Dells, Wis.

 BODY:
DETROIT -- An emergency manager assigned to lead this city back from the brink of financial ruin has taken his first detailed look at Detroit's woes, and the picture of debt and disarray he paints may be bleaker even than earlier grim portrayals.
In a report to be presented to Michigan's treasurer on Monday, Kevyn D. Orr, the emergency manager appointed in March to take over operations here, described long-term obligations of at least $15 billion, unsustainable cash flow shortages and miserably low credit ratings that make it difficult to borrow. 
And in the face of those fiscal troubles, Mr. Orr, a longtime bankruptcy lawyer, portrayed city operations in Detroit as in need of significant repair, including overhauls of the city's Police Department and Fire Department, among others.
''No one should underestimate the severity of the financial crisis,'' Mr. Orr said in a statement issued by his office on Sunday. ''The path Detroit has followed for more than 40 years is unsustainable and only a complete restructuring of the city's finances and operations will allow Detroit to regain its footing and return to a path of prosperity.''
The account from Mr. Orr, 45 days into his time in Detroit, is required under a Michigan law that dictates the state's oversight of cities that appear headed for financial collapse. But Mr. Orr's findings, painfully detailing the city's problems over more than 40 pages, also seem likely to become a new focal point for debate for some in Detroit who have questioned the seriousness of the city's troubles and the need for state intervention at a level rarely seen for a city of its size.
''It's not as bad as what they're trying to make it out to be,'' Edward L. McNeil, a local official for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said on Sunday. Mr. McNeil had not viewed a copy of Mr. Orr's report, which was not made public until late Sunday, but he said he had grown accustomed to overly negative assessments of Detroit by the state and its representatives.
''All of this was a cooked deal for them to take control of the city and take the assets,'' Mr. McNeil said. ''This has been a sham.''
In his filing for the state, Mr. Orr made clear that the city must fundamentally restructure its financial liabilities. Noting that retirees from the city now outnumber current workers by more than two to one, Mr. Orr said pension and health care costs must be addressed.
Mr. Orr found that the Detroit Police Department, led by five chiefs over the last five years, suffers from ''extremely low'' efficiency, effectiveness and morale, and said its equipment and technology were out of date. The Fire Department has 52 facilities across the city, but as many as 12 may be essentially out of service on any given day, Mr. Orr said, because of ''staffing and equipment constraints.'' Meanwhile, he said, at least 60,000 parcels of land across the city are vacant, as are 78,000 buildings.
''The city's operations have become dysfunctional and wasteful after years of budgetary restrictions, mismanagement, crippling operational practices and, in some cases, indifference or corruption,'' he wrote. ''Outdated policies, work practices, procedures and systems must be improved consistent with best practices of 21st-century government.''
While Mr. Orr's report is titled ''Financial and Operating Plan,'' it amounts more to a detailed assessment of the city's problems than a plan for what precisely he will do to fix them. Mr. Orr, who has the authority to make significant changes to union contracts, sell city assets and privatize city services, is expected to amend the plan in the months ahead.
Under state law, an emergency manager may lead a city to seek bankruptcy protection in court, an option that city and state officials have said they view as remote and undesirable. Such a bankruptcy, known as Chapter 9, would be the largest, in terms of debt and population, for a municipality in the nation.
Patrick O'Keefe, a financial consultant from the Detroit area who has dealt with municipal turnarounds, said Mr. Orr's outline of Detroit's troubles was needed before any plan for fixing the problems could gain support -- particularly from those who may be asked to make concessions, like employees, unions and creditors.
''There are still constituencies that are in a state of denial as to how deep the problem is,'' Mr. O'Keefe said. ''I think if there's any meaningful negotiations that are going to take place outside of Chapter 9, people have to agree on what the facts are.''
This city, once the nation's fourth largest, has a shrunken tax base but still has a vast 139 square miles of land to maintain. And by Mr. Orr's assessment, some of the city's problems are simply described, if not simply resolved.
''The City of Detroit continues to incur expenditures in excess of revenues despite cost reductions and proceeds from long-term debt issuances,'' Mr. Orr wrote. ''In other words, Detroit spends more than it takes in -- it is clearly insolvent on a cash flow basis.''

HEADLINE: An Orchestra In the Throes Of a Lockout

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH

 BODY:
When the Finnish conductor Osmo Vanska took over as music director of the Minnesota Orchestra in 2003, he told the players that he wanted it to be ''the best orchestra in this country in four or five years,'' he recounted in a 2006 interview.
''At least no one laughed,'' he added.
Outsiders, however, may have scoffed. Every incoming maestro would desire such a rosy outcome; achieving it is another matter. And who, after all, was this little-known maestro -- experienced mainly in provincial outposts (the Tapiola Sinfonietta and Lahti Symphony in Finland, the Iceland Symphony, the BBC Scottish Symphony) and new to the American orchestral scene -- to lead Minnesota to the mountaintop?
''For the duration of the evening of March 1st,'' Alex Ross wrote in The New Yorker in 2010, ''the Minnesota Orchestra sounded, to my ears, like the greatest orchestra in the world.'' Mr. Ross's ears are finely tuned indeed, especially when it comes to Nordic music, and he was reviewing the orchestra's performance of Sibelius's big choral symphony ''Kullervo,'' at Carnegie Hall. 
''The idea was not to issue a hard-and-fast superlative,'' Mr. Ross now writes on his blog, ''The Rest Is Noise,'' ''but to undercut the entire business of ranking orchestras. Still, I stand by the statement, at least as far as the musicians themselves are concerned.''
What Mr. Vanska has achieved over 10 seasons in Minnesota is remarkable by any standard. The latest evidence includes two superb CDs of Sibelius symphonies: one (Bis 1986; Symphonies Nos. 2 and 5) nominated for a Grammy last year, the other (Bis 1996; Nos. 1 and 4) a good bet to win one this year.
But no, make that nine seasons. On Wednesday, the Minnesota Orchestra announced that it was canceling concerts through June 2, the remains of a season now lost entirely to a lockout of the musicians by management on Oct. 1, after the players had rejected a proposal for a 32 percent cut in base pay and declined to offer a counterproposal. (Thus Mr. Ross's shout-out to ''the musicians themselves.'')
With financial woes widespread among American orchestras these days, a sort of compassion fatigue sets in, and it is tempting to dismiss this as just another temporary setback, however dire, that will surely right itself, like the Detroit Symphony players' strike of 2010 or the Philadelphia Orchestra bankruptcy filing of 2011. But each orchestra suffers in its own way, and the Minnesota case is particularly agonizing and seemingly inexplicable.
In Minneapolis, a city that has spawned and supported important cultural institutions over many decades and appears to be in robust financial health, there is an ensemble poised on the cusp of certifiable greatness. The orchestra is scheduled to record again in September and to form a major component of Carnegie Hall's next season, with two Sibelius concerts in November and two more in April, encompassing all seven of the symphonies and other works.
But the ensemble now seems in danger of coming apart. Players have dispersed to freelance gigs elsewhere, and one has left permanently. The excellent principal clarinetist, Burt Hara, has won a position as associate principal clarinetist of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and will be granted a year's leave of absence from Minnesota. In sports, Mr. Hara would be called a franchise player, and this loss would be immense.
The concertmaster is pivotal in any orchestra, and Minnesota has a fine one in Erin Keefe, who joined in 2011. She is said to have received two offers elsewhere. (Ms. Keefe could not be reached for confirmation on Sunday.)
As music directors are wont to do (and advised to do) during labor conflicts, Mr. Vanska has kept a low profile, with a few notable exceptions. In November, only a month into the lockout, he sent a letter to both management and players, noting that he was ''desperately anxious'' about the orchestra's future and urged ''a resolution of this dreadful situation.'' In February he conducted the players in a special concert of Sibelius's Second and Fifth Symphonies to celebrate the Grammy nomination, arranged in large part by Mayor R. T. Rybak of Minneapolis.
But with a letter of April 30 to Jon R. Campbell, the board chairman, and Michael Henson, the president and chief executive, now reproduced widely on the Internet, Mr. Vanska stepped up his presence, giving ''formal notice'' of his belief that the orchestra's ''musical policy of excellence'' was ''under critical threat.''
''The Carnegie Hall project represents for me one of the most significant goals of my entire Minnesota Orchestra tenure,'' he wrote. If Carnegie were to lose faith in the orchestra's ability to perform adequately and thus cancel the concerts, he added, ''I will be forced to resign my position as music director.''
Mr. Vanska could not be reached last week to discuss the letter. Mr. Campbell told The Star Tribune in Minnesota that ''Vanska should have directed his letter to the musicians instead of the board,'' according to Graydon Royce, the reporter.
''They are the ones who are holding up the progress right now,'' Mr. Campbell was quoted as saying. ''We've responded to Osmo by saying he could help the process by encouraging the musicians to return to negotiations -- to have real dialogue.''
What is at stake, Mr. Campbell and Mr. Henson maintain, is the very survival of the orchestra. They are speaking financially, but it is clear by now that artistic survival is equally endangered.
That money is needed is not in dispute. The orchestra reported deficits of $2.9 million in 2011 and $6 million in 2012. Mr. Henson, refusing to continue the perilous practice of drawing down the endowment (now around $140 million) to cover deficits, proposes cuts that would reduce the orchestra's annual budget from $32 million to $26 million. Players' annual base salary would be cut from $113,000 to $78,000. (By comparison, the musicians of the San Francisco Symphony emerged from a recent strike and Carnegie cancellation with a base salary of $148,000.)
The Minnesota players say they mistrust management's figures, the reason they give for having refused to negotiate, and an independent financial review is under way. Further clouding the issue is a $50 million renovation of Orchestra Hall, the ensemble's home in Minneapolis, to be completed by the fall. Management points out that funds raised specifically for that purpose are unavailable to fill gaps in the operating budget. The players argue that the changes being made in the hall are heavier on public amenities than on items of musical substance.
But the crucial matter now is what kind of orchestra will occupy the hall. While no one can question the need for financial prudence in an economy still rife with uncertainties, the present course seems bent on destroying the institution in order to save it.
With the announcement of the cancellation of the season's final concerts, management issued a proposal that negotiation meetings take place in the presence of a federal mediator on May 20, 21 and 22. The players had not responded by Sunday.
You don't have to take sides in the dispute to realize that nothing is being accomplished by the parties' not speaking to each other. It is long past time for reasonable adults to sit down in a room and talk: if need be, in company with some friend of the orchestra, like the mayor or the chief executive of one of the city's flagship corporations.
Surely the great cultural mecca of Minneapolis must want this resolved quickly. We in New York do. And whatever happens, the world will be watching. Mr. Vanska and his formidable troops have seen to that.

HEADLINE: Hospital Mergers Reset Abortion-Access Battle

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
MOUNT VERNON, Wash. -- Politicians seeking to restrict access to abortion, a marked trend this year from North Dakota to Arkansas, tend not to get much traction in this part of the country.
Washington is heavily Democratic, leaning left especially on social issues. A majority of voters even put into law a statutory right to abortion in 1970 -- the only state ever to do that. The governor, Jay Inslee, a Democrat, is pushing the Legislature even now to pass a law at a special session on Monday requiring health insurers to pay for elective abortions, another first for the state if it makes it to Mr. Inslee's desk.
But now a wave of proposed and completed mergers between secular and Roman Catholic hospitals, which are barred by church doctrine from performing procedures that could harm the unborn, is raising the prospect that unelected health care administrators could go where politicians could not.
The merger wave is mirrored around the country, driven by the shifting economic landscape in health care and the looming changes in federal regulation. Previous Catholic takeovers in Kentucky, Illinois and Pennsylvania have made news and drawn scrutiny. 
The concentration of mergers here, through happenstance and history -- Catholic nuns arrived in Washington with the first waves of settlers in the 1850s -- is particularly pronounced. If all the proposed religious and secular combinations go through, almost half of the hospital beds in the state -- the highest percentage in the nation, and up from less than a third at the beginning of last year -- would be controlled by the Catholic health systems, according to Merger Watch, a nonprofit group in New York that tracks hospitals.
Another wrinkle is that many Washingtonians are not that keen on religion to start with. A poll by Gallup conducted throughout 2012 put the state at 12th from the bottom in percentage of people who described themselves as ''very religious.'' It is also one of only two states -- Oregon is the other -- where voters have approved a physician-assisted suicide law for terminally ill people. Centuries of Catholic teaching hold suicide as a mortal sin.
''You happen to be the hot zone,'' Sarah A. Dunne, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, said on a recent evening to a group of 75 or so residents here in Mount Vernon who are opposing the mergers.
Skagit Valley Hospital in Mount Vernon, about an hour north of Seattle, has joined with two other small local hospitals in seeking a merger partner and is entertaining bids from two Catholic and two secular hospitals. A decision is expected this summer.
The A.C.L.U. has been ''exploring plans for possible litigation,'' as Ms. Dunne put it in an interview, over whether mergers involving religious and secular hospitals that get taxpayer support could violate a provision of the State Constitution barring public funds for religious purposes. Ten counties out of 39 in the state would have 100 percent of their hospital beds in Catholic health system hands by year's end if all the proposed mergers went through, according to the A.C.L.U.
''Frankly, I wish we could do nothing,'' said Vince Oliver, the chief executive at the 43-bed Island Hospital in nearby Anacortes, which is one of the three hospitals, including Skagit Valley, that are shopping for a partner. ''But the future for a small independent hospital is not a very rosy picture right now,'' he said.
Catholic hospital leaders said that changes in the medical and economic landscape could threaten service to millions of Americans in rural and suburban areas who might have no choices at all if their local hospital closed or shrank, and that Catholic partners -- driven by a mission to serve the underserved -- are uniquely fitted to help. The issue is not availability of abortion or consult to the dying, they say, which will still be available in secular institutions not that far away, but access to care at all.
''The Catholic health system is in many of the communities we're in because other health care providers have not wanted to serve those communities and have not had a commitment to serve every human being,'' said Peter Adler, a senior vice president at PeaceHealth, a Catholic hospital system based in the Pacific Northwest that is one of the bidders for the three hospitals in northwest Washington.
But critics said that Catholic hospitals do not, in fact, serve every human being because they deny certain reproductive services or end-of-life care that could help a dying patient end his or her suffering.
''It's a collision course,'' said Suzanne Holland, a science and values professor in the department of religion at the University of Puget Sound, referring to the potential of constriction in health care options from economic change, and at the same time restricted choice on moral grounds at hospitals operated through a lens of religious doctrine.
Professor Holland, a Catholic and a lesbian, said she already tried to avoid going to a Catholic hospital near her because she was concerned that administrators there would not recognize the rights of her civil union partner.
A spokesman for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which issues rules for Catholic care providers called the ''Ethical and Religious Directives,'' said that procedures deemed by the church to be immoral are bright lines that cannot be crossed.
Anything relating to abortion is one such line, but anything making it easier for a person to end his or her own life, as Washington's Death with Dignity law does, would also be prohibited, said the Rev. Thomas Weinandy, the executive director of the Conference of Catholic Bishops' Secretariat for Doctrine.
Washington's assisted suicide law, passed by the voters in 2008, gives all hospitals and individual caregivers the option to participate. And that creates a very mixed, complicated picture on the merger front, with physicians and pharmacists, even in secular hospitals that back the program, able to decide for themselves whether to be involved.
The question at formerly secular hospitals under new Catholic control is therefore not whether helping terminal patients die would be allowed on the premises -- clearly not, church authorities said -- but what kind of private, confidential advice a physician would have the authority to give about end-of-life options under the state law, including where legal services to ease death might be obtained.
''If you go to a Catholic medical institution, you're going to get medical advice that is in keeping with the moral norms of that institution,'' Father Weinandy said. ''We think Catholic medical advice is the best medical advice to give.''
The Religious Directives document puts it even more assertively: ''The professional-patient relationship is never separated, then, from the Catholic identity of the health care institution.''
But Mr. Adler, the spokesman for PeaceHealth, said that in his organization, at least, the confidentiality of a physician's advice is protected.
''The conversation between patients and their physicians at PeaceHealth we consider sacred,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Report Ranks Universities by Individual Subjects

BYLINE: By JOYCE LAU

 BODY:
QS, a British education company that produces an established international university ranking system, rated institutions based on specific majors in its latest report published last week. Prospective students can search 30 individual subjects to see how 200 top universities fare. 
Harvard, Oxford and Cambridge are the top three -- in various combinations -- in English, medicine and law. Harvard takes the top ranking for political science, followed by the London School of Economics and Yale. The best places to study computer science are the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University and Oxford. The University of California, Berkeley, is the top choice for statistics, sociology and media.
Among the top three universities in each subject, there were only a few institutions outside of the usual U.S.-U.K. elite. The University of Melbourne is the third-best place for someone looking to study education, and the University of Tokyo is the third-best for civil engineering.
Hong Kong tycoon finances new Oxford research center
Prime Minister David Cameron and the Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing attended a ceremony this month announcing a new £90 million Center for Health Information and Discovery, Oxford University said in a statement. The facility will be able to accommodate up to 600 scientists when it is completed.
The center will be named after Mr. Li, whose charitable foundation donated £20 million, or $30 million, to the center, which is meant to help revolutionize health research through the use of big data. Mr. Li made the appearance in Britain on May 3, at a time when his company was embroiled in a 40-day strike by dock workers in Hong Kong over low pay.
U.S. study finds New School is most international campus
At the New School, 27 percent of undergraduates are from overseas, giving the New York City university the most international student body in the United States, U.S. News and World Report reported last week.
The New School was followed by the Florida Institute of Technology (26 percent), the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago (21 percent), Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida (18 percent), and the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma (18 percent). The five institutions with the highest percentages of foreign students were all private. On average, among all colleges and universities ranked by U.S. News, foreign students make up 5 percent of the student body.
Russia-Vietnam university on agenda of visit, media say
Talks for a planned Vietnam-Russia University of Technology in Hanoi are expected to continue when Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung visits Moscow this month, the Vietnamese media reported.
Under a new agreement, Russian professors will teach in Vietnam, while educators and students from Le Quy Don Technical University will have the chance to study in Russia, The Viet Nam News reported.

HEADLINE: In Britain, a Return to the Idea of the Liberal Arts

BYLINE: By D.D. GUTTENPLAN

 BODY:
LONDON -- Until very recently, students in Britain who wanted to study more than one or two subjects at college received some blunt advice: ''Go west'' -- to the United States or Canada, where the classical tradition of a broad-based humanistic education has long flourished in liberal arts colleges. Despite their European origins, the liberal arts have been in continual retreat on the Continent, edged out by programs devoted to a single discipline like economics or history.
In Britain, the more traditional private schools have carried on the classical approach -- many still require students to study both Latin and ancient Greek -- but the British system, too, is one of relentlessly narrowing focus. Students, who may take a dozen different subjects at age 14, are expected to filter down to just three or four by age 16 in preparation for applying to study a single subject at university.
There are a few exceptions: Students studying natural sciences at Cambridge or Durham University are allowed to take courses across the sciences in their first two years before choosing one for their final-year exams. Oxford offers a number of joint honors degrees allowing students to combine two disciplines, like history and economics or philosophy and physics. The University of Edinburgh offers a similar program combining law and a number of other disciplines. 
But anyone who wanted to study both the arts and the sciences, or to take courses across a range of disciplines, had to leave the country, until now. This past autumn, King's College London and University College London both admitted their first cohort of undergraduates to new programs in the liberal arts. The University of Exeter is set to begin offering a similar program next autumn. So are the University of Birmingham and the University of Kent in Canterbury, whose courses will each take four years to complete, making them even more like a U.S. undergraduate degree.
Aaron Rosen, deputy director of the liberal arts program at King's, said the resemblance was entirely intentional. ''All of us who teach on the program here are either American or people who have an American component in our own education,'' said Dr. Rosen, who did his undergraduate studies at Bowdoin College in his native Maine and then earned a master's and a doctorate from Cambridge in theology. A specialist in Jewish art, a field he said ''most people would say doesn't exist,'' Dr. Rosen said his colleagues' familiarity with the American system ''gives us the opportunity to correct some of the flaws that are endemic in the U.S.''
The liberal arts in the United States, he said, ''got drunk on their own eccentricity.''
''When I was at Bowdoin it seemed like the departments competed to offer the most narrow, irrelevant courses,'' he said. ''This gives us a chance to dial it back to fundamentals.''
Each year, all students on the King's College program will be required to take one core course -- the first one, which looks at London itself, combining history, literature, art and geography, is to be taught by Dr. Rosen. Students will also be required to study a modern language, to choose a major at the end of their first year and to spend part of their second year abroad.
''There are trade-offs with the traditional single-subject approach in terms of the number of courses you can take,'' said James E. Bjork, head of King's College's liberal arts program. But Dr. Bjork, who teaches European history, said that ''we think it makes you a better historian, for example, if you spend three years having done other things than just history. It gives you a sense of what's unique to a subject and what isn't.''
For Carl Gombrich, who directs the University College London program, a broader perspective is second nature. With degrees in mathematics, physics and philosophy, he was an opera singer before becoming an academic. He is also the grandson of Ernst Gombrich, the art historian whose work he cites as the inspiration for his efforts to reach across disciplines. ''My grandfather was a brilliant psychologist. Yet he never took an exam in psychology. Instead he said, 'Let's think about how we perceive things.' He was a classic interdisciplinarian.''
At U.C.L., core courses, including modules on quantitative methods, approaches to knowledge, language and qualitative thinking, form half the program. ''We teach all our students the tools of coding. We teach them all how to understand and use statistics,'' Dr. Gombrich said. The other half of core courses is devoted to major pathways: cultures, health and the environment, sciences and engineering, and societies.
Perhaps most audacious is the U.C.L. program's ambition to bridge the chasm dividing what the writer C.P. Snow once described as ''the two cultures'' of science and the humanities.
All applicants will be required to have A-levels, the single-subject exams that serve for both high school graduation and university admissions, in both the humanities and in math or a science. All British universities require A-levels in at least three subjects. Students who study a science as their major will have to study a humanities minor, and vice versa. ''We're determined to be just as science-y as we are arts-y,'' Dr. Gombrich said. Graduates will receive a bachelor of arts and sciences degree.
''We've taken a big risk,'' Dr. Gombrich said, acknowledging that defenders of the traditional single-subject approach might argue the new program lacks depth.
''But that's a rather British view of what depth is,'' he said. ''If you study psychology, half your courses might be on topics you're not interested in. Wouldn't it be better to do a module on child health, or linguistics or embryology?''
So far both programs seem popular. ''We've exceeded our expected applications by 25 percent,'' Dr. Gombrich said, adding that applications for next year were up by a further 10 percent.
Gabrielle Cecil, a first-year student at King's College London, said she ''fell in love with the course.''
''I found deciding which A-levels to take so hard, and applying to study just one at university just seemed impossible,'' she said.
Ms. Cecil, who grew up on a farm in Cornwall, said that coming to London had also been a big factor, as it was for her classmate Jibran Khan. Mr. Khan had already completed a year studying economics and Arabic when he heard about the course at King's and decided to apply even though it meant starting his degree all over again.
''I liked it that they don't just let you do one or two subjects. You get to bring them together, which wasn't true at Edinburgh,'' said Mr. Khan, an American who ''grew up moving between countries.''
Many of the King's students said they had also considered colleges in the United States. ''I was very close to enrolling at Tufts,'' near Boston, said Fabian Midby, a Swede who, after taking courses in French, geography, politics, philosophy and film his first year, has decided to major in economics. In addition to being closer to home for European students, with tuition capped at £9,000, or about $14,000, a year for British and European students, both schools are considerably cheaper than comparable U.S. schools.
Even American students, who would pay £17,000 at U.C.L. and £15,000 at King's, would still save a whole year on tuition and living expenses.
Dr. Gombrich said he would know the program was a success if, at the end of their three years, liberal arts students did as well or better on their final subject exams as U.C.L. students taking a single subject. And if that calls into question the whole British model, the university's president, Malcolm Grant, said he did not mind.
''I've always felt it was a mistake to make students specialize such a young age,'' he said in an interview. ''At 15, how many people know they want to be scientists -- or lawyers?''
''This program combines the best of the British model, where you progress from year to year, with the fairly significant amount of choice you have in America,'' Dr. Grant said. ''If we can continue to attract the smartest students, as we have done in the first year, I think this will become the principal mode of entry into this university,'' he said.
U.C.L. plans on hold
University College London said last week on its Web site that it was seeking a new site for its planned £1 billion Stratford campus after talks fell apart with the council representing Newham, a London borough. According to Times Higher Education, U.C.L.'s plans to build in an area that is currently home to Carpenters Estate, a housing development, prompted protests.

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Focus on Conservatives Gives G.O.P. an Issue to Seize On

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN and MATTHEW L. WALD; Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Internal Revenue Service's special scrutiny of small-government groups applying for tax-exempt status went beyond keyword hunts for organizations with ''Tea Party'' or ''Patriot'' in their names, to a more overtly ideological search for applicants seeking to ''make America a better place to live'' or ''criticize how the country is being run,'' according to part of a draft audit by the inspector general that has been given to Capitol Hill.
The head of the division on tax-exempt organizations, Lois Lerner, was briefed on the effort in June 2011, seemingly contradicting her assertion on Friday that she learned of the effort from news reports. But the audit shows that she seemed to work hard to rein in the focus on conservatives and change it to a look at any political advocacy group of any stripe.
The new information will only add to the criticism that has emerged since Ms. Lerner apologized to Tea Party and other conservative groups on Friday for unwarranted scrutiny. The full audit by the Treasury Department's inspector general for tax administration is set to be released this week. 
House Republicans have vowed to begin their own hearings and investigations. And Republicans fanned out on the political talk shows on Sunday to express outrage that is only likely to grow. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and a prominent moderate, said on CNN that the singling out of conservative groups was ''absolutely chilling.''
Since last year's elections, Republicans in Congress have struggled for traction on their legislative efforts, torn between conservatives who drove the agenda after their 2010 landslide and new voices counseling a shift in course to reflect President Obama's re-election and the loss of Republican seats in the House and the Senate.
But the accusations of I.R.S. abuse are sure to fuel an effort that appears to be uniting dispirited Republicans and their conservative political base: investigating Mr. Obama and his administration. Republicans are pushing a portrayal of an administration overreaching its authority and punishing its enemies.
''The bottom line is they used keywords to go after conservatives,'' Representative Darrell Issa of California, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said Sunday on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.'' He requested the inspector general's audit along with another Republican, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio. As an audit, it will not find blame or refer anyone for criminal prosecution.
Indicating the political stakes may be high, the White House spokesman Jay Carney released a statement on Sunday saying that the president ''is concerned that the conduct of a small number of Internal Revenue Service employees may have fallen short'' of ''the highest levels of integrity'' he expects for government officials.
Republicans got little political traction last year when they highlighted the ''Fast and Furious'' operation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, in which guns that were supposed to be tracked by the agency were instead lost to drug cartels in Mexico.
But the Republican focus on attacks on United States officials in Benghazi, Libya, got new life last week when Gregory Hicks, a State Department critic of the military's response, told a House committee that he had been effectively demoted after lodging his criticism.
Congressional Republicans are also showcasing complaints from businesses on a near-daily basis about the cost of the president's signature health care law as it prepares to go into full effect in 2014.
The I.R.S. disclosures present Republican critics a golden opportunity. In 1998, Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee mounted a series of hearings on I.R.S. abuse, featuring taxpayers who portrayed the agency's tax collectors as overzealous thugs with no respect for due process. Under I.R.S. rules, the agency could not defend itself against specific charges without the permission of the taxpayers who were making the accusations. The result was a one-sided media onslaught, and many of the cases would later prove to be considerably more complex than portrayed at the hearings.
In this case, it is Republicans in the House who will take the lead. Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, has promised a broad investigation, and Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said Friday that he would hold hearings soon.
There will be no shortage of witnesses.
''The I.R.S. has demonstrated the most disturbing, illegal and outrageous abuse of government power,'' Jenny Beth Martin, national coordinator for Tea Party Patriots, said in a statement. ''This deliberate targeting and harassment of Tea Party groups reaches a new low in illegal government activity and overreach.''
The I.R.S. has been under pressure from Democrats and campaign finance watchdogs for some time to crack down on abuse of the 501(c)4 tax exemption, which is supposed to go to organizations primarily promoting ''social welfare'' but which is routinely granted to overt political advocacy groups with little or no social welfare work.
The New York Times obtained a 12-page timeline from the inspector general's audit on Sunday. It suggests that the effort to single out Tea Party groups goes back to March 2010 when a special Determinations Unit in the Cincinnati office of the I.R.S. began searching tax-exemption applications that focused on groups on one side of the political spectrum, rather than broadly on political groups without a social-welfare mission.
The unit searched for groups using the names ''Tea Party,'' ''Patriots'' or ''9/12 Project,'' a movement begun by Glenn Beck. The unit was also looking for ''applications involving political sounding names'' like ''We the People'' or ''Take Back the Country,'' according to the document. That time frame brought the ''Be On the Lookout'' list back to the Tea Party movement's early months, well before the movement helped fuel a historic Republican landslide in 2010.
On June 29, 2011, the document states, Ms. Lerner was briefed. By then the search appeared even more refined to conservative groups. Beyond ''Tea Party,'' ''Patriots'' and ''9/12 Project,'' the Cincinnati team was looking at issues of government spending, debt and taxes; educational efforts to ''make America a better place to live''; and statements in the case file that ''criticize how the country is being run.''
Ms. Lerner said Friday that the terms ''Tea Party'' and ''Patriots'' were used as a ''shortcut'' by the unit, not as a tool to single out any one political outlook. But the timeline suggests that the search went well beyond a few keywords. Over 100 applications had been identified by that briefing, using criteria with distinctly conservative undertones.
Just days later, on July 5, a conference call involving Ms. Lerner, a manager of the Determinations Unit and others broadened the search to take out its overt conservative bias. Instead, the lookout list was changed to ''organizations involved with political, lobbying or advocacy for exemptions under 501(c)3 or 501(c)4,'' a criterion much more in line with concerns that overt political advocates were receiving special tax protection.
But repeated revisions of the lookout list kept lapsing back to the original search. In January 2012, for instance, the search parameters were again revised to ''political action-type organizations involved in limiting/expanding government, educating on the Constitution and Bill of Rights, social economic reform/movement,'' criteria broad enough to ensnare liberal organizations as well but seemingly still honed in on the Tea Party.
On Feb. 29, 2012, just as a rash of news articles began publicizing complaints of harassment from Tea Party applicants, Ms. Lerner ordered the Cincinnati unit to stop issuing requests for additional information from the groups, the beginning of an extended process of pulling back the scrutiny.
But the scrutiny of the I.R.S. -- and by extension the Obama administration -- has likely just begun.

HEADLINE: Dark Heritage

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
Last week the Heritage Foundation delivered a report claiming that legalizing undocumented immigrants will create a more-or-less permanent underclass of benefit-sucking, wage-lowering, economy-crippling parasites, with a cost to American taxpayers of -- megaphone, please -- SIX POINT THREE TRILLION DOLLARS! The report was promptly denounced, not least by reputable conservative economists, for example here and here and here. Then one of the report's co-authors resigned from Heritage after The Washington Post discovered that he had once proposed blocking immigrants with low I.Q. scores. (More on that later.)
You might think that after such a reception the report would be quickly retired to the Bogus Science Hall of Fame. But not so fast. This one deserves a closer look.
The Heritage Foundation has never made a secret of its conservative political orientation, but it has generally tried to remain within plausible boundaries of analysis. Heritage gives you data with lots of spin, but tends to avoid being downright outlandish. On issues like health care and welfare reform, Heritage scholarship has made serious contributions to the public debate, whatever you think of the policies prescribed. 
But on immigration, something else is going on. As the economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former economic adviser to John McCain, pointed out at National Review Online, until 2006 the Heritage line on immigrants was comfortably within the mainstream: that immigrants are not welfare sponges but rather -- as consumers, workers and creators of new businesses -- they, and especially their children and grandchildren, are contributors to the national wealth. Then in 2007, with an immigration bill pending in Congress, Heritage analyst Robert Rector issued the first version of the hair-raising analysis that was repurposed last week.
Heritage's abrupt turn was a puzzle to many conservatives, including some within the Heritage family. Holtz-Eakin, who had been a Heritage fellow, told me he was mystified. Tim Kane, the Heritage analyst who had prepared the earlier, immigration-is-good report and is now chief economist at the Hudson Institute, said former colleagues at Heritage now worry that the new report will cast doubt on their other scholarship.
I'm not an economist (and neither is Robert Rector, the principal author of the new report), but I've discussed the analysis with six economists, some of them specialists in immigration policy, four of them staunch conservatives. Their consensus is that the report issued last week is not an objective quest for enlightenment, but 100 pages in service of a boldface headline. (SIX POINT THREE TRILLION DOLLARS!) It systematically overestimates the percentage of undocumented immigrants who will get citizenship, and exaggerates the likelihood that they will end up as wards of the welfare state. It underestimates the contribution these immigrants and their children will make to the country's wealth if they are allowed out of the shadows to work and study and open businesses without fear. It plays down the reality that these immigrants already cost taxpayers many millions. And it assumes that for the duration of this supposed pig-out at the federal trough -- 50 years is Rector's time frame -- nothing much changes in government policy.
Rector points out that if you look closely, right there on page 33, he acknowledges a few factors that could bring down the cost of amnesty. This comes right after his longer list of factors that could make the costs even higher -- which he told me is what he really believes. But none of these caveats changes the headline. SIX POINT THREE TRILLION etc.
I believe Rector is sincere in his conviction that amnesty will put a crushing burden on taxpayers. But I suspect that like many profoundly convinced people he sees what he wants to see. This is the same researcher who, according to my colleague Jason DeParle, once published a report claiming tens of thousands of poor people had Jacuzzis and swimming pools -- extrapolating from a government survey that had found four. Before you laugh, you should know that Rector's views on the deadbeat poor had considerable influence on the shape of Bill Clinton's welfare reform, and that his earlier version of the costs-of-amnesty study helped kill immigration reform last time around. He is an ideological force in Washington.
But Rector's inflated numbers are not the worst thing about the Heritage report. His basic point, that integrating a large population of mostly poor people into the aboveground American economy will be expensive for at least a generation or two, is right, even if the costs will not be as shocking as he claims. The fundamental flaw is framing the immigration debate as essentially about the federal deficit. In fact, the case for immigration reform -- and in particular the case for amnesty -- is about rationalizing an inhumane and counterproductive system; about putting families that are now stunted by their illegal status on a path, not just to citizenship but to taxpaying productivity; about assimilation and mobility, innovation and entrepreneurship and, ultimately, about economic growth. Heritage is not just offering the wrong answer; it's obsessing on the wrong question.
There are other lessons you can take away from this episode. Here are three.
First, this is an unusually stark sign of the transformation of Washington's think tank culture into a more partisan archipelago of propaganda factories. In recent years, according to James McGann, director of the Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program at the University of Pennsylvania, think tanks on both the right and the left have set up explicit lobbying arms, anointed leaders known not for academic credibility but for partisan ferocity, and picked their fights at least in part to help drive their fund-raising. Last year the right-wing billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch exercised their megadonors' droit du seigneur over the libertarian Cato Institute, ousting the longtime president. The announcement in December that Senator Jim DeMint, a Tea Party darling, would become Heritage's new president was not the beginning of a transformation, but its logical culmination. DeMint was enthusiastically front and center last week in the unveiling of the Heritage immigration report, even as scholars in his employ were telling friends they found the study embarrassing. I'm told the 2007 attack on immigration reform was gangbusters as a fund-raising message. Some speculate that this time around the issue might also make a nice platform for DeMint's possible presidential ambitions.
Second, what we are seeing here is not just an attack on immigration reform, but a declaration of war on Republicans who would like to make their party less strident and meanspirited. To the hard right, which has been so ascendant in the G.O.P., the Republicans hoping to win Hispanic votes and soften their hardhearted image by liberating 11 million unlawful immigrants are apostates. ''Marco Rubio does not understand any of this,'' Rector said scornfully when we discussed the Heritage report. What is revealing is not that Rector thinks he is smarter than the Republican senator who is pushing immigration reform, but that he feels perfectly free to say so on the record.
And third, be wary of scholarship that can be twisted into the service of bigotry. The dark streak of nativist prejudice that lurks in this generally welcoming country has often been inflamed by questionable or selective research that played to popular fears and resentments: fear of competition for jobs and opportunity and resources, fear that immigration brings criminals and terrorists, and just plain fear of the other, the different, the foreign.
Which brings us to Rector's co-author, Jason Richwine, whose 2009 doctoral dissertation was entitled ''IQ and Immigration Policy.'' Richwine argues that based on I.Q. tests today's immigrants, especially Hispanic immigrants ''lack the raw cognitive ability'' of earlier European immigrants, and that these defects persist from generation to generation. ''No one knows whether Hispanics will ever reach I.Q. parity with whites, but the prediction that new Hispanic immigrants will have low-I.Q. children and grandchildren is difficult to argue against.'' This, he writes, leads to ''underclass behavior'' and ''less social trust.'' Whether differences in I.Q. are the result of culture, environment, genetics or biases in the testing is one of the great unresolved debates in social science, but Richwine is convinced that these differences justify a new program of social engineering. He concludes that new immigrants should be screened for intelligence. Because I.Q. testing is ''a political nonstarter'' owing to its past association with racism and eugenics, he suggests that lawmakers should use the euphemism ''skill tests.'' By the end of the week, even some of his dissertation advisers were backing away from the document, as David Weigel reported in a thoughtful exploration of the subject on Slate.
The idea that our immigration system should make more room for well-educated and highly skilled applicants is a fixture in most reform proposals and is the practice in many other countries. Heritage supports it, and so do the various bipartisan proposals in Congress, as a way to compete for and retain the world's best talent. But Richwine's proposal for an I.Q. admissions test, like Rector's portrayal of immigrants as merely a costly encumbrance, gives comfort to those who would treat immigrants as an inferior species -- not just freeloaders, but mentally deficient to boot. At least Heritage can console itself that it was not to blame for Richwine's exercise in social Darwinism. That particular piece of work earned him a Ph.D. from Harvard.

HEADLINE: South Korea Seeks Journalist's Arrest in Defamation Case

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- State prosecutors are seeking to arrest a South Korean journalist on charges of violating election laws for reporting an unconfirmed suspicion ahead of December's presidential vote that the brother of the leading candidate might have been involved in the killing of a relative, the journalist's lawyers said Sunday.
In the indictment, a copy of which was made available on Sunday, the prosecutors said the journalist, Choo Chin-woo, had written articles and made a podcast that ''defamed'' and ''spread false information'' about the brother of the governing party's candidate, Park Geun-hye, with ''an aim of blocking her election.'' 
Ms. Park won the election by a narrow margin and was inaugurated in February. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The previous government also pursued criminal indictments of television producers and bloggers on charges of defaming political figures and disseminating false information -- a practice that international human rights groups have denounced for creating a chilling effect among government critics.
''My crime was raising questions those in power don't like,'' Mr. Choo, 39, said in a recent interview. ''They hate me like a cockroach and want to squash me.'' A court is scheduled to decide on Tuesday whether to allow his arrest.
Mr. Choo skyrocketed to national fame as a co-host of the satirical political podcast ''Naneun Ggomsuda,'' or ''I Am a Petty-Minded Creep.'' The name invokes a derisive nickname for the prior president, Lee Myun-bak. Started in 2011, the show raised allegations of wrongdoing against some of the country's religious, economic and political leaders. It became one of the world's most downloaded political podcasts from Apple's iTunes store, avidly followed by South Koreans who had lost trust in mainstream news media, much as young Americans embraced ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.''
The show was suspended after the December election, and prosecutors accused another co-host, Kim Ou-joon, of staying abroad to avoid an investigation on charges similar to what Mr. Choo faced.
Mr. Choo works for a leading newsweekly SisaIN. In his articles and podcast ahead of the December election, he revisited a little-known 2011 case in which a son of a cousin of Ms. Park's was found dead in a mountain park in Seoul, the nation's capital. Another cousin of Ms. Park's was found hanging from a tree. The police concluded that he had killed the first man and then committed suicide.
In his reports, Mr. Choo cited a legal dispute between Ms. Park's brother, Park Ji-man, and his brother-in-law revolving around the brother-in-law's accusations that Mr. Park had plotted to kill him and had hired as a hit man the Park relative found dead. (The brother-in-law, the husband of the Parks' estranged younger sister, lost the case and served time in prison for slandering Mr. Park.)
Mr. Choo's reports raised questions about the police investigation and cited the suspicion raised by the brother-in-law and his lawyer that the killing in the mountain park might have had something to do with a plot to block the victim from testifying for them. They also raised the possibility that the man who the police said hanged himself might have been killed.
Mr. Park sued Mr. Choo in December on charges of spreading false rumors to influence the presidential election. That set off the investigation by the prosecutors.
International free-speech advocates -- including Reporters Without Borders and Frank La Rue, the special rapporteur on the freedom of opinion and expression for the United Nations -- have voiced concerns about a lack of tolerance for dissent in South Korea, where defamation is a criminal offense.
Lee Jae-jeong, Mr. Choo's lawyer, said of the possibility of his client's arrest, ''I don't think this kind of thing can happen except in a backward country ruled by an authoritarian government bent on stifling freedom of expression.''
Park Kyung-sin, a professor of law at Korea University here, said filing a criminal indictment against people accused of defaming public figures with false rumors and then trying to arrest and hold them before any trial went against ''international human rights standards.''
Such prosecutions, Professor Park said, hamper the role of the news media as a public watchdog, particularly since defendants accused of defamation are required to prove that their allegations are true.
Many conservative South Koreans accuse the co-hosts of ''I Am a Petty-Minded Creep'' of using the mantle of satire to broadcast irresponsible statements, commit character assassination and promote political cronyism.
But at times, the show has sniffed out major news. It was among the first outlets to discuss suspicions that the country's intelligence agency was involved in a secret online campaign to try to discredit opposition candidates in the December election.
Last month, the police announced that at least two government intelligence agents had been involved in such an operation. Prosecutors have since expanded the investigation, raiding the headquarters of the spy agency.

HEADLINE: Valuable as Art, but Priceless As a Tool to Launder Money

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
According to the air bill slapped on the crate that arrived at Kennedy International Airport from London, an unnamed painting worth $100 was inside. Only later did federal investigators discover that it was by the American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and worth $8 million.
This painting, known as ''Hannibal'' after a word scribbled on its surface, was brought into the United States in 2007 as part of a Brazilian embezzler's elaborate effort to launder money, the authorities say. It was later seized at a Manhattan warehouse by federal investigators who are now preparing to return it to Brazil at the behest of law enforcement officials there.
The painting's seizure was a victory in the economy-rattling, billion-dollar fraud and money laundering case of Edemar Cid Ferreira, a former Brazilian banker who converted some of his loot into a 12,000-piece art collection.
Law enforcement officials in the United States and abroad say ''Hannibal'' is just one of thousands of valuable artworks being used by criminals to hide illicit profits and illegally transfer assets around the globe. As other traditional money-laundering techniques have come under closer scrutiny, smugglers, drug traffickers, arms dealers and the like have increasingly turned to the famously opaque art market, officials say. 
It is hard to imagine a business more custom-made for money laundering, with million-dollar sales conducted in secrecy and with virtually no oversight. What this means in practical terms is that ''you can have a transaction where the seller is listed as 'private collection' and the buyer is listed as 'private collection,' '' said Sharon Cohen Levin, chief of the asset forfeiture unit of the United States attorney's office in Manhattan. ''In any other business, no one would be able to get away with this.''
Though there are no hard statistics on the amount of laundered money invested in art, law enforcements officials and scholars agree they are seeing more of it. The Basel Institute on Governance, a nonprofit research organization in Switzerland -- the site of the world's premier contemporary and Modern art show -- warned last year of the high volume of illegal and suspicious transactions involving art. But regulation has been scattershot and difficult to coordinate internationally.
In the United States federal money laundering statutes apply to nearly every major transaction through which illegal profits are disguised to look legal. Typically, dirty money is laundered through the purchase of, say, a penthouse apartment, or mixed in with the earnings of a legitimate business like a restaurant. When gambling winnings or drug proceeds come out the other end, they appear as a real estate asset or business profit. They look clean.
Most of these industries have checks. Real estate titles and deeds at least require a name. Mortgage brokers, stockbrokers, casinos, banks and Western Union must report suspicious financial activity to the federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Banks must report all transactions of $10,000 or more. Altogether, the network logs more than 15 million currency transactions each year that can be used to track dirty money, said Steve Hudak, a spokesman for the agency. The art market lacks these safeguards. Roll up a canvas and it is easy to stash or move between countries; prices can be raised or lowered by millions of dollars in a heartbeat; and the names of buyers and sellers tend to be guarded zealously, leaving law enforcement to guess who was involved, where the money came from and whether the price was suspicious.
(Although federal prosecutors last month charged the New York art dealer Helly Nahmad with conspiring to launder $100 million in gambling money, the indictment says that bank accounts, not art, were used for laundering.)
Governments around the world have taken steps to bring illegal activity to light. In February, for instance, the European Commission passed rules requiring galleries to report anyone who pays for a work with more than 7,500 euros in cash (about $9,825), and to file suspicious-transaction reports.
The United States similarly requires all cash transactions of $10,000 or more to be reported. Still, laundering involving art tends to be handled case by case. Federal prosecutors, who usually discover art-related laundering through suspicious banking activity or illegal transport across borders, have worked closely with other countries and aggressively used their powers under civil law to confiscate art that they can establish is linked to a crime, even in the absence of a criminal conviction.
In a forthcoming book, ''Money Laundering Through Art,'' the Brazilian judge who presided over the Ferreira case, Fausto Martin De Sanctis, argues for more concerted international regulation, saying that if businesses like casinos and gem dealers must report suspicious financial activity to regulators, so should art dealers and auction houses.
But to dealers and their clients, secrecy is a crucial element of the art market's mystique and practice. The Art Dealers Association of America dismissed the idea that using money to launder art was even a problem. ''The issue is not an industrywide problem and really does not pertain to us,'' said Lily Mitchem Pearsall, the association's spokeswoman.
Law enforcement officials complain that dealers are playing down art's role in a criminal underworld.
In Newark, federal prosecutors in a civil case recently announced the seizure of nearly $16 million in fine art photographs as part of a fraud and money laundering scheme that prosecutors say was engineered by Philip Rivkin, a Texas businessman.
The 2,200 photographs by masters like Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Weston and Edward Steichen -- more than could fit into an 18-wheeler -- were paid for, court papers say, with some of the $78 million that the authorities say Mr. Rivkin got from defrauding oil companies like Shell, Exxon, and Mobil. Mr. Rivkin, who has not been charged with any crimes, was last thought to be in Spain and had arranged to have the photos shipped there.
In New York, victims of the fraud and money laundering scams of the disbarred lawyer Marc Dreier are still in court fighting over art he bought with some of the $700 million stolen from hedge funds and investors. At the moment 28 works by artists like Matisse, Warhol, Rothko and Damien Hirst are being stored by the federal government.
''Hannibal'' also sits in storage. That 1982 Basquiat work was part of a spectacular collection that Mr. Ferreira assembled while he controlled Banco Santos in Brazil. Some of these works had been exhibited at museums like the Guggenheim in New York.
Like most laundering cases involving art in the United States, this one was uncovered when the work was illegally transported into the country. In 2004 Mr. Ferreira's financial empire, built partly on embezzled funds, collapsed, leaving $1 billion in debts. A court in São Paulo sentenced him in 2006 to 21 years in prison for bank fraud, tax evasion and money laundering, a conviction he is appealing. Before his arrest, however, more than $30 million of art owned by Mr. Ferreira and his wife, Márcia, was smuggled out of Brazil, Judge De Sanctis said.
According to court papers, ''Hannibal'' was bought for $1 million in 2004 by a Panamanian company called Broadening-Info Enterprises, which later tried to sell the painting for $5 million. It was sent to New York in 2007, passing through the hands of four shipping agents in two countries before landing at Kennedy.
Since merchandise valued at less than $200 may enter the United States without customs documentation, duty or tax, ''Hannibal,'' labeled worth $100, was cleared for entry even before the plane landed.
Philip Byler, Broadening's lawyer in New York, said that the inaccurate invoices were merely a shortsighted attempt by the art dealer that Broadening hired to save importation fees. ''It was not done with the intention of smuggling,'' he said. He also challenged the Brazilian authorities' claim, saying that ''Hannibal'' was legally purchased from a company owned by Mr. Ferreira's wife.
Mr. Byler said that Broadening intends to appeal the forfeiture.

HEADLINE: There Is Something Rotten In the Kingdom of Rome

BYLINE: By ZACHARY WOOLFE

 BODY:
It's been a strong few weeks for productions of operas from the 1930s and '40s at New York conservatories. First, on April 24, came a powerful vision of Brecht and Weill's ''Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny'' at the Manhattan School of Music, a reminder of the continued relevance of that sharp and moving work. 
Britten's ''Rape of Lucretia,'' well performed on Friday by the Mannes Opera at the Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College, is on the surface a very different piece. Weill's score is raucously populist; Britten's is a complex, chromatic hothouse flower. ''Mahagonny'' takes place in modern times, in a twisted half-American, half-imaginary pleasure city; ''Lucretia'' is set in a stylized version of ancient Rome.
But both operas are startling in their depictions of bad behavior, and their shared conclusion -- understandable after decades of war and suffering -- that there is something inalterably rotten at the world's core. They leave room for only the most ambiguous optimism.
''Lucretia'' (1946), with a libretto by Ronald Duncan, draws on centuries of depictions of the rape of a Roman matron by an Etruscan prince, and her subsequent suicide. Britten produced, out of economic necessity, a work far smaller in scale than ''Peter Grimes,'' which had given him a breakthrough success the year before.
The ''Lucretia'' score calls for just 8 singers and 13 players, an intimate ensemble that redoubles the impact of a plot about the violation of privacy. The moody, ominous score (acutely played on Friday by the Mannes Orchestra under Joseph Colaneri) elegantly captures the fanfares and machismo of a soldiers' camp and the gauzy relaxation of women weaving, the urgency of a galloping horse and the stillness of mourning.
It is not a perfect opera. It lags, particularly in the first act, and the libretto can be risibly purple: ''the oatmeal slippers of sleep,'' ''the quietus of your thighs.'' The pagan-era tale has been given two characters, serving as male and female ''choruses,'' who interpret the events in light of later Christian theology, an interpolation that many have viewed as heavy-handed.
But it is easier to accept those choruses when they are performed by artists as firm-voiced and thoughtful as the tenor Christopher Colmenero and the soprano Felicia Moore. All the Mannes singers, directed by Laura Alley, were talented and dramatically committed, particularly the men.
They did not shy from the hopelessness at the heart of the work. Lucretia's rape is said to have incited the revolution that overthrew the Etruscan monarchy and established the Roman republic.
But there is no sign that Britten found this reassuring. A Roman call to arms at the end is made to seem an empty, craven attempt to take political advantage of a private tragedy, a bit of saber rattling as pointless as the rape itself.

HEADLINE: How Immigrants Change Their Towns

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Immigrants Are Transforming a New York Town'' (front page, May 6), about changes to Port Chester, N.Y.: 
The story of immigrants creating jobs by starting new businesses is as old as immigration itself. While immigrants have made up, on average, just over 10 percent of the population for the past 160 years, more than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children, according to a report by the Partnership for a New American Economy.
More recently, between 1985 and 2010, nearly 20 percent of Fortune 500 companies have been founded by immigrants. In other words, immigrants have created millions of American jobs and contributed trillions of dollars to the American economy.
This isn't all that surprising when you think about the qualities of strength, imagination and determination needed for people to radically alter their lives and seek a new existence in a foreign land.
ALAN VAN CAPELLE New York, May 6, 2013
The writer is chief executive of Bend the Arc: A Jewish Partnership for Justice.
To the Editor:
Having lived on the ''poor side of town'' of Greenwich, Conn., abutting Port Chester, N.Y., from 1992 to 2000, and as a frequent visitor, I can attest to the renewed vitality of this little village. Back in the early '90s it was seedier and a bit more shuttered. As time went by, the Latino community, emboldened by sheer numbers, did indeed start to transform their community and themselves.
A great Peruvian restaurant, where a wonderful meal could be had on the cheap, gave you the sense of a secret discovery. The Chinese owner of a laundry and dry cleaner spoke Spanish to accommodate his new clientele and communicate with his employees.
Over time, the streets became lively, storefronts were unshuttered, new small businesses opened, and people were out and about. They were mostly Spanish-speaking, but there were also Brazilians, Asians and a smattering of Eastern Europeans. I met my husband, who is Mexican, in Port Chester, where he courted me in an Indian restaurant and proposed to me sitting by the little marina.
There may be a downside to this transformation, like the arrival of the big box stores, a testament to greater prosperity. And in transforming their community the immigrants will eventually transform themselves into average, amorphous, ever-consuming Americans. The great little authentic taquería will give way to yet another Taco Bell, the panadería to Panera's, as Port Chester may forfeit some of its current vibrancy to enjoy its ultimate renewal.

HEADLINE: Newspaper Monopoly That Lost Its Grip

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; twitter.com/carr2n

 BODY:
A year after announcing a plan to reorganize The Times-Picayune of New Orleans into a more digitally focused enterprise that produced a newspaper just three days a week -- enraging local residents -- its owners have added a new innovation: they will go back to producing a printed product every day.
''We are excited about this opportunity to extend our daily reach in print,'' an advertising executive at the newspaper said in the announcement.
You don't say. 
This daily newspaper thing may be catching on. Last week, The Philadelphia Inquirer announced that it would begin selling a Saturday edition on newsstands after a nearly two-year hiatus.
The much ballyhooed unmaking of daily newspapering seems to be unmaking itself, and there's a reason for that. Most newspapers have hung onto the ancient practice of embedding prose on a page and throwing it in people's yards because that's where the money and the customers are for the time being.
The industry tried chasing clicks for a while to win back fleeing advertisers, decided it was a fool's errand and is now turning to customers for revenue. But in order to charge people for news, you have to prosecute journalism.
The belief that historic monopolies will hold together just on the basis of inertia has proved to be wrong. Newspapers that have cut their operations beyond usefulness or quit delivering a daily print presence have suffered. The audience has to be earned every day.
Newspaper publishing will never return to the 30 percent plus margins it once had, but some people believe there is a business model. Warren E. Buffett thinks that a 10 percent return is reasonable, now that sale prices have sunk.
Clearly, commanding a market to change on a dime because it suits your business plan does not mean readers will obey. Just ask Advance Publications, owned by the Newhouse family, which is back to where it started in New Orleans with The Times-Picayune.
Except that the name Times-Picayune, which had stood for quality and civic constancy for decades, does not mean the same thing anymore. The vaunted Web site that was to be the lifeblood of the new enterprise remains a creaky mess, and the newsroom has been denuded of remarkably talented people.
Several of those people, including the two former managing editors of the newspapers, have gone to work for The Advocate, the Baton Rouge daily that has introduced a New Orleans edition. With a new, rich owner, it has taken aim at the market The Times-Picayune once owned.
Advance made its decisions up against some very dark trends in the business, but they were made with the dead-eyed arrogance of a monopolist in a much-changed world. Columbia Journalism Review described The Times-Picayune's strategy of the last year as a ''rolling disaster.''
It's been a jaw-dropping blunder to watch. Advance misjudged the marketplace -- the whole city and state went ballistic when the changes were announced -- and failed to execute a modern digital strategy. Now it is in full retreat with new competition.
The company endlessly complicated what had been a simple proposition that has worked since the newspaper's founding in 1837: deliver a printed bundle of its best efforts every day for a fixed price. The new distribution plan is hard to explain, but I will do my best.
On Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays, a broadsheet called The Times-Picayune will be available for home delivery and on the newsstands for 75 cents. On Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, a tabloid called TPStreet will be available only on newsstands for 75 cents.
In addition, a special electronic edition of TPStreet will be available to the three-day subscribers of the home-delivered newspaper. On Saturdays, there will be early print editions of the Sunday Times-Picayune with some breaking news and some Sunday content.
There's more, but you get the idea -- or not. It's an array of products, frequencies and approaches that is difficult to explain, much less market.
The move was clearly defensive, unveiled the day before John Georges, the new owner of The Advocate, announced that it would expand its incursion into New Orleans. Since early fall, The Advocate has been publishing The New Orleans Advocate, with 20,000 subscribers.
Mr. Georges, a successful businessman who had less success running for governor of Louisiana and mayor of New Orleans, held a news conference on May 1 where he was accompanied by the governor, Bobby Jindal, and the mayor of New Orleans, Mitch Landrieu. It was an indication that the home team had chosen sides and the once-beloved Times-Picayune was on the wrong side of the field.
Last July, Senator David Vitter, a Republican from Louisiana, wrote a brutal letter to Steven Newhouse, the chairman of Advance.
''From a pure business perspective, you're about to get smoked,'' Mr. Vitter wrote. ''The Advocate and others are moving in to fill the void you are creating. And TP subscribers, including me, will be eager to cheer them on by trading our subscriptions.''
The Advocate has never had the assets or the reputation that The Times-Picayune built up over the years, but the management of The Times-Picayune managed to create the one thing the paper never had before: actual competition.
''The Web site is still mysteriously frustrating for those who are interested in accessing the information we used to get in The Times-Picayune,'' said Jed Horne, a former editor at The Times-Picayune who now works at The Lens, an online investigative news site in New Orleans.
''They promised a Tesla and it performs more like an Edsel,'' he said. ''Our hope is that we will be treated to an invigorating old-time press war between The Advocate and The Times-Picayune, but of course, it could end up being two dinosaurs fighting over the last mud hole on an overheated planet.''
Jim Amoss, the editor of Nola.com-The Times-Picayune, said he is proud of the various products the paper is producing and believed he had the talent and the support from ownership to compete for attention. He suggested that journalists are far more obsessed over the particulars than the audience is.
''I try to take the approach that readers' habits are changing all of the time,'' he said, ''and while I share the gut reaction from journalists whose world has been turned upside down, the appetites for news here is as voracious as it has ever been.''
Still, after the deep personnel losses, Mr. Amoss is increasingly the captain of a ghost ship.
That fact was etched with some degree of finality last week when The Advocate raided The Times-Picayune and hired Gordon Russell, former city editor and investigations reporter; Martha Carr (no relation), a veteran of the city desk; and two city reporters, Claire Galofaro and Andrew Vanacore. Collectively, the departures represented what the Gambit, a local weekly, called a ''shock-and-awe hiring.''
''I hate to see when talent walks out the door,'' Mr. Amoss said. ''But as I told the people here on the day that happened, I am incredibly proud of the people we have and the job we are doing.'' (Nola.com's excellent coverage of a mass shooting on Sunday that injured about 17 people at a parade in the city demonstrated that the site still plays an important local role.)
Nevertheless, the raid served as a reminder that The Times-Picayune's former monopoly over talent was a thing of the past. That doesn't mean that The Advocate will have anywhere near the impact on New Orleans that The Times-Picayune once did, or that it will magically defy the laws of contemporary publishing economics. But it does suggest that Advance's belief that it had New Orleans to itself and could do as it wished was deeply mistaken.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 14, 2013 

 CORRECTION:
The Media Equation column on Monday, about a decision by The Times-Picayune of New Orleans to return to daily print production, referred incorrectly to The Philadelphia Inquirer's Saturday edition. While it has not been sold on newsstands for nearly two years, it has still been printed and delivered to subscribers. The Saturday edition has not been on ''a nearly two-year hiatus.''

HEADLINE: In Taiwan, Lamenting A Lost Lead

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Jonney Shih, the chairman of Asustek Computer, has epitomized the Taiwanese electronics engineer for a generation: a slender figure in rumpled, baggy trousers, he once helped Intel solve heat problems in its Pentium 4 microprocessors.
So it has been a surprise over the last several years to see Mr. Shih, now 60, reinvent himself with snug-cut Italian suits, innovative designs for tablet and notebook computers and scathing criticisms of Taiwan's test-obsessed, engineering-oriented educational system.
''I don't think the Taiwanese got very good training to drive the mentality of innovation,'' he said during an interview at Asus's headquarters here on the outskirts of Taipei. (Mr. Shih also demonstrated his flexibility in the interview, assuming the lotus position while wearing a dark blue Armani suit with a sky-blue Armani tie.)
Fostering innovation has become a mantra among corporate leaders and government officials alike in Taiwan this year because the island's huge consumer electronics industry has run into serious trouble. 
Worldwide sales of PCs, for which Taiwanese companies control over 90 percent of the final design and manufacturing, are declining steadily. Sales of smartphones, for which Taiwanese companies control less than a fifth of the market, are rising briskly. Tablets based on the Android operating system, which most Taiwanese companies, with the exception of Asus, have been slow to embrace, are also on the same upward trajectory.
''Outside of Asus, all the others are struggling,'' said Helen Chiang, a Taiwan electronics specialist at the IDC research firm.
Foxconn and Acer have each reported that sales in the first quarter dropped 19 percent from a year ago. HTC's sales plunged 37 percent, although that was partly because the company began shipping the annually improved version of its best-known smartphone in late March instead of February. At Quanta, a 70,000-employee contract designer and manufacturer of notebook computers, sales have shown double-digit percentage drops from year-earlier levels for 14 consecutive months.
Foreign rivals have proved more nimble. In South Korea, Samsung is expanding rapidly in smartphones, tablet computers and other sectors. After embracing the Android operating system early, the company has built on its huge economies of scale in the mass production of components, like display screens and microprocessors.
In China, Lenovo and many smaller manufacturers are relying on labor that, while no longer cheap, is still less expensive than in Taiwan. That helped make Lenovo the only one among the top five PC makers worldwide to eke out a gain in shipments in the first quarter -- although by only a tenth of a percent.
And in the United States, Apple, Google and Amazon have shown themselves adept at producing breakthrough consumer products, while pending legislation would allow them to import more foreign engineers at a lower cost than hiring and training domestic engineers.
As notebooks and other Windows-based PCs have lost ground, first to Apple tablets and now to Android-based designs, even Microsoft has been indicating dissatisfaction with the pace of PC innovation in Taiwan. Despite a longtime aversion to hardware, Microsoft recently introduced its own Surface tablet.
''The Surface tablet is a pretty strong signal to the whole Taiwan PC ecosystem that they're not innovating enough,'' said Bill Whyman, a senior managing director at the ISI research firm.
One exception to Taiwan's difficulties is Asus. Its many new Android-based tablets, including one that it has branded with Google, allowed it to surpass Amazon in the first quarter of this year to become the third-largest player in the global tablet computer market, behind Apple and Samsung, according to IDC.
And some of its designs are downright clever. One new model, the PadFone, lets the user slide a cellphone into the back, turning the tablet into an oversize cellphone. Another tablet, the Transformer, features a detachable keyboard with a wireless connection and a two-sided display panel that can show a movie on one side to entertain children or guests while the other side is a regular computer display for the owner.
Those innovations have helped keep Asus's sales growing, up 16 percent in the first quarter from a year ago. That was even as worldwide PC shipments fell 11.2 percent, according to Gartner, another research firm.
Taiwan's strengths and weaknesses in pursuing broader innovation echo the challenges of many countries that, for varying reasons, seek to foster the growth of industries based on creativity. The United States and Europe have long worried that their businesses and universities come up with many new ideas but then fail to commercialize them. Mainland China has fretted that its businesses and universities are too slow to come up with original ideas.
That Taiwan needs to look to 60-year-olds like Mr. Shih for innovation is a concern for government officials. As economic growth has stalled in Taiwan and new factories have shifted to mainland China, young people have become more interested in civil service jobs and academia instead of industry, government and industry officials say.
One worry is that people with new ideas at universities and government laboratories are not commercializing them. ''Our teams think the problem here is those inventors didn't pursue it, to push their inventions into the market,'' said C. Y. Cyrus Chu, the official who oversees the National Science Council. ''Youngsters here are afraid to fail -- we are not ready to face failure.''
The government has started a program of grants and advice for inventors to help them develop business plans and seek venture capital.
Another big concern for industry and government is that the ability of Taiwan's electronics business to innovate may be hamstrung by the very quality that has brought the sector so far over the last three decades: obsessive secrecy.
American giants like Apple have long treasured the ability of Taiwanese companies like Foxconn to do the final engineering and then mass-produce new consumer electronics devices by the millions, with remarkably few leaks to competitors or to the ravenous technology news media.
To win contracts to supply the likes of Hewlett-Packard and Dell, Taiwanese companies routinely divide their staffs and dedicate teams to each foreign customer. They even set procedures for making sure that engineers and buyers from different clients do not accidentally meet one another while having lunch at company cafeterias here.
But that secrecy makes it harder for the Taiwanese industry to learn good ideas quickly from foreign and domestic rivals. ''They keep secrets and don't duplicate, so the customers are happy to work with them,'' said Chan Wen-Hsin, a senior industrial technology specialist at the ministry of economic affairs.
Taiwanese technology companies have decades of experience in accepting detailed computer performance benchmarks from American customers and then figuring out the least expensive way to meet those benchmarks. But that may also be an obstacle to innovation now.
The least expensive approach often involves barely exceeding the benchmarks, and not coming up with solutions that may cost more but dazzle consumers.
Mr. Chan cited a decision by Steven P. Jobs, then Apple's chief, to choose glass screens for the iPhone instead of plastic ones, which could be scratched.
In Taiwan, he said, ''we do not pursue a perfect solution; we pursue a good enough solution.''
Yet another concern for Taiwan, much more than for the United States, lies in a brain drain of midcareer technology experts who speak fluent Mandarin Chinese. A tripling in the number of mainland Chinese college students over the last decade, to 30 million last year, has produced a severe shortage of professors who speak Mandarin Chinese.
The result has been a series of departures from Taiwan's universities and elite, government-backed research institutes. Even the vaunted Industrial Technology Research Institute, which gave birth to global semiconductor powerhouses like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and the United Microelectronics Corporation, has been losing experienced researchers.
To be sure, Taiwanese companies are now trying to increase the pace of innovation. Acer says that it plans to double research and development spending as a share of sales this year, by 1.2 to 1.5 percent. Gregory Bryant, the general manager of Intel's Asia and Pacific operations, said, ''There is a resurgence of innovation and investment in Taiwan.''
One lingering cost advantage for Taiwanese companies is that pay here for recent college graduates in electronics engineering and computer sciences is low and gradually declining. A rapid expansion of higher education over the last decade has produced a flood of fresh job applicants. Recent graduates typically earn $800 to $900 a month -- more than in mainland China, where the pay is more like $500 to $600 a month, but still much less than in the United States.
Japanese automakers opened design centers in the United States as pay in their home market began catching up with American levels, like the Toyota center in Ann Arbor, Mich., and the Nissan center in San Diego. But Taiwanese electronics companies have been wary of following suit. Asked why Asus does not open an engineering center in the United States so as to tap American innovation, Jonathan Tseng, the company's vice chairman and president, gave a single-word answer: ''Cost.''
Asus, a 10,000-employee company, does have an office of 300 employees in Fremont, Calif., which includes sales staff and so-called program managers, who are responsible for pricing, marketing and consumer research.
Analysts say that Asus's innovations may not represent the same kind of big leaps forward as the iPad or iPhone, but may be what other Taiwan manufacturers need to retain their role in the global consumer electronics industry.
''It's incremental, it's true,'' said Tracy Tsai, a Gartner analyst here. ''But compared to other device manufacturers, they are doing better.''

HEADLINE: Defending a Scrap of Soul Against MoMA

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
Last week was a good one for common sense and manning the barricades in New York. The City Planning Commission recommended limiting the special permit that allows Madison Square Garden to operate at its current site, which opens the door to fixing Penn Station, trapped below it.
And the Museum of Modern Art blinked.
Faced with a storm of protests, the Modern stepped back from its plan to demolish its diminutive neighbor on West 53rd Street, the former American Folk Art Museum, a striking sliver of a building designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien, admired in architectural quarters. MoMA announced that Diller Scofidio & Renfro, the New York firm, which among other things remodeled the Lincoln Center campus and collaborated on the first two phases of the High Line, will do what should have been done in the first place: provide a clear rationale for expansion to the west of its current site, which would subsume the former museum.
''Whether we include Folk Art or not, as is, is an open question,'' stressed Jerry I. Speyer, the real estate developer and the Modern's chairman. The remark sounded suspiciously as if the Modern's officials anticipate going through this belated architectural and public relations exercise only to tear down the building anyway, except perhaps a token part of it. 
That would be a mistake and miss what this tiny building, albeit flawed, signifies. The stakes go beyond the Modern to civic health. Midtown and MoMA could both use more variety, serendipity and soul. The former folk art museum building, having all those things, isn't an obstacle to progress but an opportunity.
When it opened late in 2001, its ingenuity and craft, laden with symbolism after Sept. 11, made it an instant architectural attraction, even though, crammed onto a minuscule lot, it turned out to be mostly stairwells and passages inside, the galleries narrow and tricky to install with art.
By the time the folk art museum officials sold their place to MoMA in 2011 to help pay off a mountain of debt, skeptics pointed to the building as another case of architectural vanity by a cultural institution with overweening ambition, implying that the architects shared the fiscal blame, having merely done a cunning job with an impossible site. For its part, the Modern had arranged to expand into floors of an 82-story tower by Jean Nouvel to rise west of the folk museum, on a plot the Modern sold to Hines, the Houston developer. MoMA officials let it be known that the folk museum's faceted bronze-alloy facade didn't fit in with the Modern's glass aesthetic and that its floors didn't line up with MoMA's, as if that constituted a design obstacle too formidable to overcome.
The message was clear: A museum dedicated to contemporary art and design wanted to destroy a distinctive work of contemporary design. The Modern had previously found ways to incorporate parts of its earlier buildings into its current one, so it wasn't unfamiliar with adaptive reuse. And yes, it had knocked down buildings before, good ones even, to make way for earlier expansions. But all that happened in the past, and it doesn't excuse a fresh act of what the architecture critic James S. Russell, speaking for a chorus of detractors, called ''cultural vandalism.''
The backlash revealed a surprising antipathy toward MoMA. Not so long ago, it was the art museum New Yorkers loved and identified with; it seemed familial, its scale personal. It had a special place in the city's heart. The Met was the big pompous, bureaucratic machine. Now the tables have turned, and even while it has grown, the Met has come to seem the nimble, venturesome one, more intimately loved. A 40-something friend told me the other morning: ''I used to spend my days in the previous incarnation of MoMA after my father died. Back then MoMA was my chapel. I would make my way to my favorite Rothko, and the progression from the street to that gallery in the old building didn't feel like you were moving through a shopping mall or a W Hotel.'' He stopped going to the museum after its expansion in 2004, and canceled his family membership. ''It's just not a place for New Yorkers anymore,'' he said.
I thought about that progression. Years ago, 53rd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues was a pokey Midtown cross street. The Modern, smaller yet somehow more distinctive, was tucked into the middle of the block with an entrance that, from the front doors, looked straight through the garden to the town houses on West 54th Street: a view from the city back into it. The Modern was in and of the urban fabric. Its ethos was embedded in the street grid, its architecture dovetailing with the art inside, so much of it consonant with the syncopated rhythms and complex geometry of New York.
Today, West 53rd Street is a monotonous corporate corridor. Across the street from MoMA, a 50-story luxury hotel-condo tower will soon sit atop the Donnell Library Center, once a haunt for generations of New Yorkers. The library, it was also revealed last week, will be squeezed into its basement, a third of its original size. I liked Yoshio Taniguchi's MoMA building before it opened nine years ago -- proving it's a fool's game to judge any place before it's up and running. The museum has turned out to be a people-moving machine, with a Sheetrock atrium, cut off from the street, herding masses upward toward anodyne spaces without repose. The problem involves more than crowds. It is baked into the architecture and the mind-set.
By contrast, the former folk museum, with its textured, tooled facade like a Paul Klee or the hinged door of an ancient temple, is a skinny little chess whiz in a college classroom of jocks, a clever outlier on the street, a work of artisanal sculpture whose idiosyncrasy is in keeping with the objects it was conceived to house.
It's a relief on the block, representing the diversity vital to healthy streets -- not a perfect building, not even its architects' best work. But its unembarrassed, luxuriant materiality, its small scale and vulnerability, all qualities that the Modern now seems to reject, belong no less than the glass tower to the messy story of Modernism and city life.
Economic development encourages the proliferation of glass giants, tourism and ever bigger museums, but not always smart streets or better culture. The building by Mr. Williams and Ms. Tsien can be saved, and more than just its facade, whose preservation might be the museum's strategic fallback position. Maybe the former folk museum could become a respite in the future Modern -- or its galleries a refuge for photographs or drawings or design objects. The clash with MoMA's unrelenting elevation on 53rd Street, and with its wearying interior, is its virtue.
For the moment, give MoMA's trustees credit for listening to critics of the demolition, just as city planning officials heeded the growing calls to improve Penn Station, notwithstanding the desires of the owners of Madison Square Garden. Clearly, the climate is changing and New Yorkers can make themselves heard when it comes to shaping the public realm.
Institutions, lavished with tax breaks, responsible to the people, would do well to listen. (New York Public Library, that includes you.)

HEADLINE: E Pluribus Me

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN. 
Paul Krugman is off today.

 BODY:
Logic, thy name is not Ted Cruz. The very junior senator from Texas is a well-credentialed windbag, with degrees from Princeton and Harvard Law, and a stint clerking at the Supreme Court. After a few months in Congress promoting Ted Cruz, smartest guy in the room, it looks as if he now wants to be Ted Cruz, extremely obnoxious president. But he keeps saying things that make no sense.
There he was, earlier this month, writing in opposition to a bill that would allow cash-strapped states to tax Internet sales. It passed by a bipartisan majority in the Senate, which is like saying Newt Gingrich just climbed Mount Everest. 
''And, how is it fair for a Texas business to collect taxes to support California Gov. Jerry Brown's big spending? Or to underwrite New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's nanny statism or Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's anti-Second Amendment agenda?''
Perhaps it's not fair, but neither is it a mandatory requirement of the bill. The Marketplace Fairness Act would allow consumers to buy local, and keep the taxes local, should they wish. Isn't that what Republicans want? I mean, outside of trying to repeal the 20th century.It's clear that Senator Cruz can't stand California, Illinois or New York and all they represent. Fine. But let's say the Internet sales-tax bill becomes law, and Senator Cruz is sitting at home in Houston, doing some online shopping. While buying the latest weapon accessories, he could support Texas values and purchase only from Texas-based retailers, thus ensuring that Texas taxes continue to be spent on their usual things -- everything but regulatory oversight of industrial polluters. Wow: choice!
Now, should his wandering shopper's eye drift toward some product that comes from one of the evil blue states, he would indeed have to contribute in a small way to the welfare of non-Texans. This happens every day, of course, on a huge scale, with the distribution of federal tax dollars throughout the United States, all 50 of them.
Just to take the Cruz argument to its, um, logical end, you should be pretty upset if you live in New York, California or Illinois right now, because you keep afloat dozens of Republican states. New Yorkers pay far more in federal tax dollars than they get back in federal spending. Between 1990 and 2009, taxpayers in New York State transferred out $950 billion to the rest of the country in federal taxes, according to The Economist.
That money went to keep states like Kentucky, Alabama, West Virginia and Arkansas from further hardship. Still, even though New Yorkers subsidized the states closest to the political values of Ted Cruz, you never heard much complaining about how it's unfair to support the gun-toting culture of the South, or underwrite its chronic disregard for the poor, the environment and those without health insurance. For that matter, ''how is it fair'' that tax dollars from Rahm Emanuel's Chicago are underwriting Lackland Air Force Base in Texas, where dozens of recruits say they were sexually harassed and raped by their instructors?
You pay taxes, but you don't get to pick and choose how they are spent. Cruz knows this. He also has to know that Republican governors like Bob McDonnell of Virginia support the Internet sales-tax bill, because it will pay for needed transportation projects and allow the state to forgo a gas-tax hike. The bill is endorsed by the National Governors Association -- where Republicans hold a majority -- because the states lost out on an estimated $26 billion in sales taxes last year alone.
The National Retail Federation also favors the Internet sales-tax bill. To them, it's a matter of simple fairness. A brick and mortar store, selling the same product as a Web-based retailer, pays taxes that the competitor can avoid. ''This collective disparity,'' the organization wrote in support of the bill ''has tilted the competitive landscape against local stores, creating a crisis for brick and mortar retailers around the country.''
Helping fellow Republicans govern, or small businesses prosper, is clearly not part of the grand design of Ted Cruz. His job is to say outrageous things, and hope that enough people consider him a maverick for his outbursts. But shouldn't a man with his self-proclaimed intellectual prowess at least try to be consistent? You would think that someone born in Calgary, Alberta, to a father who is an immigrant from Cuba would reach out to the 11 million illegal immigrants in this country. Instead he put his marker down last week: under no circumstances would he support a path to citizenship for those living in the shadows.
Senator Cruz probably doesn't mind the title that's been hung on him -- most hated man in the Senate. I suspect he also relishes being called a ''wacko bird'' (John McCain's term) because, for now, it's the avian wing that dominates his party.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: How Austerity Kills

BYLINE: By DAVID STUCKLER and SANJAY BASU. 
David Stuckler, a senior research leader in sociology at Oxford, and Sanjay Basu, an assistant professor of medicine and an epidemiologist in the Prevention Research Center at Stanford, are the authors of ''The Body Economic: Why Austerity Kills.''

 BODY:
EARLY last month, a triple suicide was reported in the seaside town of Civitanova Marche, Italy. A married couple, Anna Maria Sopranzi, 68, and Romeo Dionisi, 62, had been struggling to live on her monthly pension of around 500 euros (about $650), and had fallen behind on rent.
Because the Italian government's austerity budget had raised the retirement age, Mr. Dionisi, a former construction worker, became one of Italy's esodati (exiled ones) -- older workers plunged into poverty without a safety net. On April 5, he and his wife left a note on a neighbor's car asking for forgiveness, then hanged themselves in a storage closet at home. When Ms. Sopranzi's brother, Giuseppe Sopranzi, 73, heard the news, he drowned himself in the Adriatic.
The correlation between unemployment and suicide has been observed since the 19th century. People looking for work are about twice as likely to end their lives as those who have jobs. 
In the United States, the suicide rate, which had slowly risen since 2000, jumped during and after the 2007-9 recession. In a new book, we estimate that 4,750 ''excess'' suicides -- that is, deaths above what pre-existing trends would predict -- occurred from 2007 to 2010. Rates of such suicides were significantly greater in the states that experienced the greatest job losses. Deaths from suicide overtook deaths from car crashes in 2009.
If suicides were an unavoidable consequence of economic downturns, this would just be another story about the human toll of the Great Recession. But it isn't so. Countries that slashed health and social protection budgets, like Greece, Italy and Spain, have seen starkly worse health outcomes than nations like Germany, Iceland and Sweden, which maintained their social safety nets and opted for stimulus over austerity. (Germany preaches the virtues of austerity -- for others.)
As scholars of public health and political economy, we have watched aghast as politicians endlessly debate debts and deficits with little regard for the human costs of their decisions. Over the past decade, we mined huge data sets from across the globe to understand how economic shocks -- from the Great Depression to the end of the Soviet Union to the Asian financial crisis to the Great Recession -- affect our health. What we've found is that people do not inevitably get sick or die because the economy has faltered. Fiscal policy, it turns out, can be a matter of life or death.
At one extreme is Greece, which is in the middle of a public health disaster. The national health budget has been cut by 40 percent since 2008, partly to meet deficit-reduction targets set by the so-called troika -- the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank -- as part of a 2010 austerity package. Some 35,000 doctors, nurses and other health workers have lost their jobs. Hospital admissions have soared after Greeks avoided getting routine and preventive treatment because of long wait times and rising drug costs. Infant mortality rose by 40 percent. New H.I.V. infections more than doubled, a result of rising intravenous drug use -- as the budget for needle-exchange programs was cut. After mosquito-spraying programs were slashed in southern Greece, malaria cases were reported in significant numbers for the first time since the early 1970s.
In contrast, Iceland avoided a public health disaster even though it experienced, in 2008, the largest banking crisis in history, relative to the size of its economy. After three main commercial banks failed, total debt soared, unemployment increased ninefold, and the value of its currency, the krona, collapsed. Iceland became the first European country to seek an I.M.F. bailout since 1976. But instead of bailing out the banks and slashing budgets, as the I.M.F. demanded, Iceland's politicians took a radical step: they put austerity to a vote. In two referendums, in 2010 and 2011, Icelanders voted overwhelmingly to pay off foreign creditors gradually, rather than all at once through austerity. Iceland's economy has largely recovered, while Greece's teeters on collapse. No one lost health care coverage or access to medication, even as the price of imported drugs rose. There was no significant increase in suicide. Last year, the first U.N. World Happiness Report ranked Iceland as one of the world's happiest nations.
Skeptics will point to structural differences between Greece and Iceland. Greece's membership in the euro zone made currency devaluation impossible, and it had less political room to reject I.M.F. calls for austerity. But the contrast supports our thesis that an economic crisis does not necessarily have to involve a public health crisis.
Somewhere between these extremes is the United States. Initially, the 2009 stimulus package shored up the safety net. But there are warning signs -- beyond the higher suicide rate -- that health trends are worsening. Prescriptions for antidepressants have soared. Three-quarters of a million people (particularly out-of-work young men) have turned to binge drinking. Over five million Americans lost access to health care in the recession because they lost their jobs (and either could not afford to extend their insurance under the Cobra law or exhausted their eligibility). Preventive medical visits dropped as people delayed medical care and ended up in emergency rooms. (President Obama's health care law expands coverage, but only gradually.)
The $85 billion ''sequester'' that began on March 1 will cut nutrition subsidies for approximately 600,000 pregnant women, newborns and infants by year's end. Public housing budgets will be cut by nearly $2 billion this year, even while 1.4 million homes are in foreclosure. Even the budget of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nation's main defense against epidemics like last year's fungal meningitis outbreak, is being cut, by $293 million this year.
To test our hypothesis that austerity is deadly, we've analyzed data from other regions and eras. After the Soviet Union dissolved, in 1991, Russia's economy collapsed. Poverty soared and life expectancy dropped, particularly among young, working-age men. But this did not occur everywhere in the former Soviet sphere. Russia, Kazakhstan and the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) -- which adopted economic ''shock therapy'' programs advocated by economists like Jeffrey D. Sachs and Lawrence H. Summers -- experienced the worst rises in suicides, heart attacks and alcohol-related deaths.
Countries like Belarus, Poland and Slovenia took a different, gradualist approach, advocated by economists like Joseph E. Stiglitz and the former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. These countries privatized their state-controlled economies in stages and saw much better health outcomes than nearby countries that opted for mass privatizations and layoffs, which caused severe economic and social disruptions.
Like the fall of the Soviet Union, the 1997 Asian financial crisis offers case studies -- in effect, a natural experiment -- worth examining. Thailand and Indonesia, which submitted to harsh austerity plans imposed by the I.M.F., experienced mass hunger and sharp increases in deaths from infectious disease, while Malaysia, which resisted the I.M.F.'s advice, maintained the health of its citizens. In 2012, the I.M.F. formally apologized for its handling of the crisis, estimating that the damage from its recommendations may have been three times greater than previously assumed.
America's experience of the Depression is also instructive. During the Depression, mortality rates in the United States fell by about 10 percent. The suicide rate actually soared between 1929, when the stock market crashed, and 1932, when Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected president. But the increase in suicides was more than offset by the ''epidemiological transition'' -- improvements in hygiene that reduced deaths from infectious diseases like tuberculosis, pneumonia and influenza -- and by a sharp drop in fatal traffic accidents, as Americans could not afford to drive. Comparing historical data across states, we estimate that every $100 in New Deal spending per capita was associated with a decline in pneumonia deaths of 18 per 100,000 people; a reduction in infant deaths of 18 per 1,000 live births; and a drop in suicides of 4 per 100,000 people.
OUR research suggests that investing $1 in public health programs can yield as much as $3 in economic growth. Public health investment not only saves lives in a recession, but can help spur economic recovery. These findings suggest that three principles should guide responses to economic crises.
First, do no harm: if austerity were tested like a medication in a clinical trial, it would have been stopped long ago, given its deadly side effects. Each nation should establish a nonpartisan, independent Office of Health Responsibility, staffed by epidemiologists and economists, to evaluate the health effects of fiscal and monetary policies.
Second, treat joblessness like the pandemic it is. Unemployment is a leading cause of depression, anxiety, alcoholism and suicidal thinking. Politicians in Finland and Sweden helped prevent depression and suicides during recessions by investing in ''active labor-market programs'' that targeted the newly unemployed and helped them find jobs quickly, with net economic benefits.
Finally, expand investments in public health when times are bad. The cliché that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure happens to be true. It is far more expensive to control an epidemic than to prevent one. New York City spent $1 billion in the mid-1990s to control an outbreak of drug-resistant tuberculosis. The drug-resistant strain resulted from the city's failure to ensure that low-income tuberculosis patients completed their regimen of inexpensive generic medications.
One need not be an economic ideologue -- we certainly aren't -- to recognize that the price of austerity can be calculated in human lives. We are not exonerating poor policy decisions of the past or calling for universal debt forgiveness. It's up to policy makers in America and Europe to figure out the right mix of fiscal and monetary policy. What we have found is that austerity -- severe, immediate, indiscriminate cuts to social and health spending -- is not only self-defeating, but fatal.

HEADLINE: The Care and Feeding of Small Business

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Tax breaks and incentives currently devoted to luring companies to move could be better spent on nurturing new businesses, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. 
As a growing number of small business organizations pursue a policy agenda distinct from that of corporate America, they may be able to nudge state and local government toward new economic development strategies. 
Currently, the businesses best able to garner generous grants and tax incentives by promising to create jobs within specific political boundaries are large, mobile corporations that can pit communities against one another, demanding ever-higher subsidies. 
Greg LeRoy wrote about the problem at length in "The Great American Jobs Scam." In his 2010 book, "Investment Incentives and the Global Competition for Capital," Kenneth Thomas estimated the total cost to American taxpayers at about $70 billion a year. 
A number of technical issues regarding treatment of tax expenditures and property tax abatements come into play in such estimates, but another accounting based on investigative reporting by The New York Times generated an estimate of $80 billion a year. The details unearthed in the Times series, United States of Subsidies, show that 48 companies have received more than $100 million in state grants since 2007. 
A bias toward large companies has been particularly obvious in the retail sector, where big-box stores have been big winners, with adverse effects on small independent businesses. Critics of Walmart have developed an entire Web site devoted to monitoring the public subsidies it receives.

The state of Texas touts its success in luring large companies from other states, offering generous tax subsidies financed by cuts in spending on local education, infrastructure and other public services. But critics of the Texas model contend that corporate relocations have had a "microscopic" impact on the state's economy. 
Meanwhile, alternative economic development strategies are gradually gaining traction. Littleton, Colo., a suburb of Denver, has pioneered an "economic gardening" approach that rejects a "hunting" model in favor of growing its own small businesses, providing supportive services and planning assistance. Its success has inspired pilot projects in several states, including Florida, Iowa, Kansas and Louisiana. The Colorado legislature is currently considering a statewide pilot project. 
Economic gardening tends to focus on companies that are well established but ready to move into a growth phase. Many efforts to foster and develop new businesses fall under the rubric of "localist incubation." My University of Massachusetts student Joseph Costello just completed an undergraduate honors paper on this topic, including a detailed account of the efforts of the Franklin County Community Development Corporation in nearby Greenfield, an area that includes many small farms growing high-quality organic produce.
Their Western Massachusetts Food Processing Center offers food entrepreneurs an industrial kitchen space meeting federal standards for commercial food production, as well as large refrigeration and storage units, and packing machinery. One of its success stories is Real Pickles, a company that supplies high-quality naturally fermented products to about 300 local stores. In business for 11 years, with a current staff of about 12, the company just announced plans to transition to a fully worker-owned cooperative model.
Promotion of worker-owned cooperatives is a way to create entrepreneurs and jobs at the same time. The Evergreen Cooperatives of Cleveland represent a stellar example, recently called out by the Federal Reserve Board member Sarah Bloom Raskin as an effective model of local economic development. A similar effort is on the verge of starting in Springfield, Mass. 
States and cities have carried out a variety of other efforts to help small businesses grow. But the level of public investment in such efforts seems tiny compared with the amounts spent on incentives for large companies to relocate. The governor of Texas may dream of winning jobs from California, but the country as a whole would benefit more from the creation of new jobs. 
It would be interesting to estimate what $70 billion to $80 billion in subsidies to economic gardening could yield, relative to economic hunting. 
Mr. LeRoy explains that the nonprofit organization Good Jobs First has begun a study of relative spending on subsidies for small versus big businesses. In the meantime, he asserts, "Small business groups should put their shoulder to the wheel on state economic development policy reform."
The jobs they could create, after all, would be their own.

 The Week's Best Quote:
 Anne Bezancon believes older entrepreneurs are better: "This is why, contrary to popular belief, most entrepreneurs do not create companies in their early twenties. Almost always, they have experienced real economic relationships and power dynamics, and gained an understanding of where the opportunities were, in order to figure out what problems need fixing or how something can be done better. Age is not just a data point - it signifies years spent watching, listening and learning, filing away facts and lessons, and developing the ability to recognize patterns and opportunities at the right time."

HEADLINE: The Birth of the 'Stainless Banner'

BYLINE: JOHN M. COSKI


HIGHLIGHT: Why did the Confederacy replace its national flag in 1863? 

 BODY:
On May 1, 1863, the Confederate Congress approved a new national flag - colloquially dubbed the Stainless Banner - to replace the so-called Stars and Bars, the Confederacy's national flag since March 1861. The new flag was a plain white field emblazoned with what was already a powerful and famous Confederate symbol, the Southern Cross, the star-bedecked blue saltire, or diagonal cross, that had been a famous battle flag since the fall of 1861. Its incorporation into the national flag confirmed the Southern Cross as the de facto symbol of Confederate nationalism. 
The first recorded use of the flag came 10 days later, and in a manner that sealed its place in Southern history. Lt. Gen. Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson had been wounded in his hour of triumph at the Battle of Chancellorsville, Va., on May 2 and he died on May 10. When his body lay in state at the Virginia State Capitol on May 12, his coffin was draped by a garrison-size second national flag, apparently intended to fly over the Capitol building. 
How did the Southern Cross become so central to the Confederacy? After all, other Confederate armies had embraced other flags, but those other flags did not elicit wide support outside of their armies and among the Confederate nation at large. 
But those other armies didn't belong to Gen. Robert E. Lee, whose Army of Northern Virginia had flown the Southern Cross battle flag during the campaigns and battles that had won Lee's army international fame. It was the Confederacy's marquee force, the army fighting to defend the capital city, and the army that won the victories that kept the Confederacy alive. It was, as the historian Gary Gallagher has argued, more than just a military unit, but the very touchstone of martial Confederate nationalism. It was the symbol of the fighting South. In the words of Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, the battle flag had been "consecrated by the best blood of our country on so many battle-fields."
Some congressmen and newspaper editors favored making the Army of Northern Virginia battle flag (in a rectangular shape) itself the new national flag. But Beauregard and others felt the nation needed its own distinctive symbol, and so recommended that the Southern Cross be emblazoned in the corner of a white field. (Not that it did any good; even today, people mistakenly believe the Confederate battle flag was the same as the national flag.)
The popularity of the "consecrated" Army of Northern Virginia battle flag was only one dimension to this story. The other is the Confederacy's rejection of the Stars and Bars.
"Every body wants a new Confederate flag," wrote George Bagby, editor of The Southern Literary Messenger, in January 1862. "The present one is universally hated. It resembles the Yankee flag and that is enough to make it unutterably detestable." The editor of the Charleston Mercury echoed Bagby in his criticism and in his solution: "It seems to be generally agreed that the 'Stars and Bars' will never do for us. They resemble too closely the dishonored Flag of Yankee Doodle ... we imagine that the Battle Flag will become the Southern Flag by popular acclaim." As early as April 1861, critics denounced the Stars and Bars as a "servile imitation" and a "detested parody" of the Stars and Stripes. 
More insightfully, The New Orleans Delta characterized the Stars and Bars as a "hybrid bunting" that was useful "during our transition state from attempted to confirmed independence." Adopted in March 1861, the Stars and Bars indeed deliberately resembled the Stars and Stripes and represented a concession to what the Committee on Flag and Seal called "a desire to retain at least a suggestion of the old 'Stars and Stripes.'" 
But the war changed that, accomplishing what secession alone had not: it made the masses of white Southerners feel separate and distinct from the United States.
As the Confederacy was ready to make the transformation from "attempted" to "confirmed" independence, it was clear what the new national symbol should be. A correspondent to The Richmond Enquirer waxed eloquent on the virtue of having "our bright, simple, appropriate, defiant Battle Flag to float over our young Confederacy; all the more becoming, too, from its having floated over many a battle-field through which that Confederacy has been working its way to independence and a place among the nations of the earth." 
A handful of contemporaries linked the new flag design to the "peculiar institution" that was at the heart of the South's economy, social system and polity: slavery. Bagby characterized the flag motif as the "Southern Cross" - the constellation, not a religious symbol - and hailed it for pointing "the destiny of the Southern master and his African slave" southward to "the banks of the Amazon," a reference to the desire among many Southerners to expand Confederate territory into Latin America. In contrast, the editor of the Savannah, Ga., Morning News focused on the white field on which the Southern Cross was emblazoned. "As a people, we are fighting to maintain the heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored races. A White Flag would be thus emblematical of our cause." He dubbed the new flag "the White Man's Flag," a sobriquet that never gained traction.
The Confederacy's rejection of the Stars and Bars as its national flag and embrace of the battle flag as the central emblem of its "confirmed independence" continues to have great significance today. With the adoption of the "Stainless Banner" in 1863, the battle flag became more than a soldier's flag; it became a political flag, associated with the Confederate government, nation and cause.
Echoes and ironies abound. Consider the modern history of the Georgia state flag. In 2004, after decades of debate, Georgians ratified a new state flag that was clearly modeled after the Confederate Stars and Bars. The most vocal protest came (and still comes) from Confederate heritage activists, who steadfastly hold on to the 1956 state flag, which bears the Southern Cross battle flag. African-American leaders, though fully aware that the new state flag is based on the first Confederate national flag, said they did not find it troubling; the real Stars and Bars does not carry the baggage that the battle flag (the one the headline writers so often mistakenly dub the "Stars and Bars") did, and does. 
In other words, the real Stars and Bars, the original Confederate flag, is acceptable to them for the same reason that it was not acceptable to Confederates in 1863, and to Confederate heritage activists today: it's not Confederate enough.

HEADLINE: Cuccinelli's Déjà Vu Tax Plan

BYLINE: JULIET LAPIDOS


HIGHLIGHT: In a new ad, he says he wants to cut taxes for middle-class families. But how will he pay for that? By closing unspecified loopholes, of course. 

 BODY:
Ken Cuccinelli, the Republican candidate for governor of Virginia and current state attorney general, has been running a classically aggressive, Nobama sort of campaign. In his book, "The Last Line of Defense," he calls the Obama administration "the biggest set of lawbreakers in America," and the E.P.A. an "agency of mass destruction." He is perhaps most notorious for trying to reinstate Virginia's "Crimes Against Nature" law, which made both oral and anal sex a felony. 
His newest T.V. spot, released today, casts him in a softer light, with soft lighting. It's called "Your Side" and it features the candidate talking directly to the camera in a hardware store. "Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, but they're being overtaxed and overregulated," he says. "I have a plan to make Virginia an engine for job growth. It starts with closing tax loopholes and putting an end to special interest giveaways. We'll use the savings to cut taxes for those who've earned it: Job creating small businesses and middle-class families."


If you're thinking, haven't I heard this somewhere before? Yes, you have. The whole "close loopholes to cut taxes" thing was a mainstay of the Romney campaign.
Mr. Romney promised to reduce marginal tax rates by 20 percent, eliminate the estate and the alternative minimum tax, and spare middle-income earners from capital gains taxes-without lowering overall revenue. He claimed he could accomplish this minor miracle by ending loopholes, but declined to specify which ones. Economists who didn't happen to work for Mr. Romney came to the conclusion that the plan was either a mathematical impossibility, or that it would result in a higher tax burden on the not-rich.
Mr. Cuccinelli, it seems, thinks that was a great strategy. The ad builds on a hazy plan from last week to cut the state corporate income tax from 6 percent to 4 percent over four years, while reducing the individual income tax rate from 5.75 percent to 5 percent. That would cost Virginia about $1.4 billion a year, according to the Washington Post, which Mr. Cuccinelli would offset "by eliminating tax exemptions and loopholes." Naturally he didn't mention which exemptions and loopholes. Democrats say such deep cuts would lead to equally deep cuts to state services.

HEADLINE: Ex-Hedge Fund Manager Sentenced in Insider Trading Case

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Anthony Chiasson, a founder of Level Global Investors, was ordered to pay a $5 million fine and forfeit illegally obtained proceeds of as much as $2 million. 

 BODY:
During the sentencing of the former hedge fund manager Anthony Chiasson on Monday, Judge Richard J. Sullivan marveled at his prodigious wealth, ticking off the annual income listed on his tax returns. "$16 million, $10 million, $23 million," he said.
 "That's just staggering," the judge said. "It's hard to imagine why someone would risk all that to engage in a crime like this."
 The crime is insider trading, and Judge Sullivan, of Federal District Court in Manhattan, handed down one of the stiffest sentences yet in the government's vast campaign to root out wrongdoing on Wall Street trading floors. He sentenced Mr. Chiasson, a founder of Level Global Investors, to six and a half years in prison after a jury found him guilty last December of illegally trading technology stocks.
"This kind of conduct can't go unpunished," Judge Sullivan said. 
Mr. Chiasson, 39, who did not address the court, was ordered to pay a $5 million fine and forfeit illegally obtained proceeds of as much as $2 million. He must report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 90 days.
His legal team, led by Reid H. Weingarten of Steptoe & Johnson and Gregory Morvillo of Morvillo Law, is appealing his conviction. They have brought on Mark F. Pomerantz, a lawyer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, to handle the appeal.
Mr. Chiasson was tried last year alongside Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management. The government accused them of being the two most-senior Wall Street traders in an eight-member "criminal club" that made $72 million in profits by trading shares of Dell Inc. and Nvidia based on corporate secrets obtained from inside those companies.
After a six-week trial, a jury convicted Mr. Chiasson and Mr. Newman. Earlier this month, Judge Sullivan sentenced Mr. Newman to four and a half years in prison.
The sentencing of Mr. Chiasson caps an ignominious end to a high-flying Wall Street career.
The youngest of four children, Mr. Chiasson grew up in Portland, Me., and pursued a career in finance after graduating from Babson College. In 1999, as a young technology industry analyst, Mr. Chiasson joined SAC Capital Advisors, the giant hedge fund owned by the billionaire stock picker Steven A. Cohen. Working under David Ganek, one of Mr. Cohen's star traders, Mr. Chiasson made a name for himself by making a large, negative bet against Internet stocks just before the dot-com bubble burst.
He also met his wife, Sandra Janson, at SAC. Ms. Janson worked as an assistant controller at the fund, and according to a court filing, their relationship started when Mr. Chiasson wandered into her office and playfully complained about the candy selection in a dish she kept on her desk.
"The next time Anthony visited the accounting department, the dish contained tiny, single-serving boxes of Junior Mints - Anthony's favorite candy," Mr. Chiasson's lawyers wrote. The couple lives in Manhattan with their young son and baby daughter, but they are moving to the suburbs.
"I'm so sorry for your family and I'm so sorry for your wife," Judge Sullivan said.
A decade ago, Mr. Chiasson left SAC along with Mr. Ganek to start Level Global Investors. The firm flourished, attracting marquee investors like Aetna and Cornell University. At it peak, the firm managed $4.2 billion and had 75 employees. In April 2010, Goldman Sachs bought a minority stake in the fund.
Just a few months later, Level Global's ascent came to a crashing halt when F.B.I. agents raided the firm's offices. The government investigation into Level Global came as part of an inquiry into hedge funds' use of expert network firms, which are research shops that connect money managers to public company employees.
Mr. Chiasson became ensnared in the case after a junior analyst at Level Global, Spyridon Adondakis, turned state's evidence. He told investigators - and later testified at trial - that he shared with Mr. Chiasson secret information gleaned from a source inside Dell.
Lawyers for Mr. Chiasson had some success in arguing that their client should receive a sentence shorter than the one recommended under federal guidelines, which was for as much as 10 years.
The guideline sentence was so stiff because the government said that Mr. Chiasson caused Level Global to earn about $40 million in profits as a result of the improper trades, and the profit amount primarily drives the guideline sentence. Mr. Chiasson's lawyers said that adhering to the guidelines "would be as draconian as it would be unwarranted."
Judge Sullivan, though, disparaged one aspect of the defense's argument that Mr. Chiasson should receive a lenient sentence because he lived an otherwise honorable life beside the crimes for which he was convicted - an argument commonly made by insider trading defendants.
Mr. Morvillo described Mr. Chiasson as "an extraordinary man," almost entirely focusing on his becoming a trustee at both his secondary school, Cheverus High School in Portland, Me., and alma mater, Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., at such a young age. After Mr. Morvillo suggested that those appointments had nothing to do with money and were a function of his character, Judge Sullivan cut him off.
"You think money had nothing to do with it?" the judge asked, referring to the trusteeships. "Do I have to suspend my disbelief this much?"
Mr. Chiasson's case is one of several insider trading prosecutions that have touched SAC, which has become a central target of the government's investigation. Prosecutors charged two former SAC employees with participating in the insider trading ring involving Mr. Chiasson. Jon Horvath, a former SAC technology stock analyst, has admitted being a part of the scheme. In March, Mr. Horvath's boss, Michael S. Steinberg, was indicted. He is fighting the charges and is scheduled to go on trial in November before Judge Sullivan.
Mr. Ganek was not charged as part of the case, either criminally or civilly. But he figured prominently at the trial because he executed some of the questionable Dell trades. Although Mr. Adondakis testified that he did not tell Mr. Ganek about the source inside Dell, Judge Sullivan deemed Mr. Ganek an unindicted co-conspirator in the case.
Federal prosecutors took an aggressive stance toward Mr. Ganek in their court papers connected to Mr. Chiasson's sentencing.
"The evidence demonstrated that Mr. Ganek was aware that Adondakis's information on Dell came from a source inside the company, and Ganek was a co-conspirator with Chiasson," prosecutors wrote. "That evidence included a number of instant messages and e-mails between Ganek and others that indicated that Ganek was kept apprised of Adondakis's updates and the source of the information."
John K. Carroll, a lawyer for Mr. Ganek at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, blasted the prosecutors' comments about his client.
"The government's conclusory statements about my client are unsubstantiated and unfair," Mr. Carroll said. "It's particularly unfair that prosecutors continue to defame my client with patched-together innuendo when they well know that they have comprehensively investigated his conduct and concluded that no charges should be brought."
An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Anthony Chiasson joined SAC Capital Advisors. It was 1999, not 1995.

HEADLINE: A Social Security Site for Smartphone Users

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: The Social Security Administration says a little more than 6 percent of people using its Web site come via smartphones. 

 BODY:
The Social Security Administration is now offering a version of its Web site that is designed specifically for smartphones.
But wait. Most of those who are interested in Social Security are older Americans who may not be technology-savvy smartphone users, right? 
Not necessarily, the agency says. About 35 million page views of Social Security Web pages each year, out of roughly 540 million total, come via smartphones - just over 6 percent.
The agency cannot determine whether those visitors to its Web site - either the previous version or the new mobile version - are receiving benefits or not, an agency spokesman, Mark Hinkle, said in an e-mail. But visitors probably include younger recipients receiving disability or survivor benefits, as well as older people nearing retirement age, he said.
Working Americans can go online, using a "mySocialSecurity" account, to check the accuracy of their earnings information, on which future benefits are based. (Bucks has written previously about these accounts).
Now, smartphone users can gain access to much of the information available on the main Web site via the new mobile site, which makes it easier to view the information. Anyone using a smartphone to go to socialsecurity.gov will be automatically directed to the mobile site.
"With significant budget cuts of nearly a billion dollars each year over the last few years, we must continue to leverage technology and find more innovative ways to meet the evolving needs of the American public without compromising service," said Carolyn W. Colvin, acting commissioner of Social Security, in a prepared statement about the mobile site.
Mr. Hinkle said the agency aimed to include content that would most likely be of value to mobile users, and tested the mobile site with agency employees, advocates and members of the public.
I took a quick look at the site Monday morning on my iPhone (the site also works for Android, Blackberry and Windows devices).
The mobile site does allow access to an account to check benefits, or creates an account if you do not have one already. But that function does not seem to be fully optimized, saying that it is "best viewed on a desktop." I logged onto my account anyway, and was able to see my estimated monthly retirement benefit and my last reported earnings information. The type can be made bigger so it is easier to see, but that requires scrolling around a bit more to see all the information on the page.
There is information about obtaining a replacement Social Security card, frequently asked questions and a tool for locating Social Security offices.
There is also a feature that prospective parents can have fun with: a list of the top baby names, compiled annually by the agency. (No. 1 for boys in 2012 was Jacob; for girls, Sophia, as a colleague on the Economix blog has noted.)
Take a look at the mobile site and let us know what you think in the comments section. Is it helpful?

HEADLINE: Forging Its Own Path, British Hedge Fund Finds Success

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Cantab Capital Partners has been turning heads in London and New York with a new fund that aggressively undercuts its competitors on fees. 

 BODY:
Ewan M. Kirk never quite fit the Wall Street mold.
As a partner at Goldman Sachs, he wore a kilt to the firm's annual black-tie dinner in New York. After leaving Goldman, Mr. Kirk, an astrophysicist by training, set up a hedge fund in Cambridge, England, a world away from the fashionable neighborhood of Mayfair in London where many hedge funds are based.
 But Mr. Kirk's firm, Cantab Capital Partners, has been turning heads recently in London and New York with a new fund that aggressively undercuts its competitors on fees. The fund, which uses computer models to trade on trends in markets around the world, opened to outside investors in the first quarter and grew to more than $600 million by the beginning of April.
Unlike rival funds, in which the price of investing is often 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of profits, Cantab charges a 0.5 percent fee and 10 percent of profits for its new fund. That structure has generated buzz in Mayfair at a time when lackluster returns have some big investors wondering whether hedge funds are worth the expense. 
"They've lowered the fees to a point that not everybody can afford to do," said Phillip G. Chapple, an executive director at KB Associates, a consulting firm that advises London hedge funds. "It's quite scary."
Cantab is not the only fund to lower its fees. Since the financial crisis, some other hedge funds have also moved to lower the cost of investing. The Children's Investment Fund, which is based in London, charges performance fees of 15 percent to 16.5 percent, with hurdles that must be cleared before fees are paid, according to a person close to the fund. Two funds run by Renaissance Technologies, in East Setauket, N.Y., have performance fees of 10 percent, a person close to the firm said.
About 11 percent of hedge funds in Europe charge performance fees less than 20 percent, compared with 5.7 percent of hedge funds in the United States, according to Hedge Fund Intelligence.
To Mr. Kirk, 52, who founded Cantab in 2006 with Erich Schlaikjer, a colleague from Goldman, the new product is a logical outgrowth of his primary investing strategy. With the technological infrastructure in place, it was relatively inexpensive for Cantab to introduce the new program, which takes a more conservative approach with lower volatility.
That technology puts Cantab - a relatively small firm with about 40 employees and $5.3 billion under management - in a position to shake up the market.
"Do I think that another random hedge fund is going to suddenly decide to cut their fees to a half and 10? No, I don't," Mr. Kirk said. "That would effectively destroy their business model."
Run by scientists and mathematicians with ties to the nearby University of Cambridge, Cantab fosters an eccentric laboratory atmosphere. Certain devices, like a 3-D printer and a rice cooker powered by a neural network, are in the office simply to amuse the employees.
A technophile, Mr. Kirk claims to have no view on the political and economic dramas that obsess some money managers. Even his Friday lunch order is steeped in science: the office uses an algorithm to determine what type of food to buy.
But almost despite himself, Mr. Kirk is gaining recognition as a financier. Last year, Cantab's flagship fund returned 15.3 percent when comparable funds in London suffered losses. In 2008, with the financial crisis gathering, Cantab returned 48.7 percent.
Though the firm's record is mixed - it lost 9.2 percent in 2009 - it has attracted billions of dollars to manage, growing from just $30 million. Last November, with investors clamoring to get in, Cantab determined it had reached capacity and shut the doors on its fund.
As if to signal his arrival among the Mayfair elite, Mr. Kirk made his debut in April on a ranking of the wealthiest hedge fund managers in Britain published by The Sunday Times, which estimated his net worth at £280 million, or $433.3 million.
Born in Swindon, England, and brought up in Glasgow, Mr. Kirk did not set out to work in finance. He developed a model of gravitational radiation for his Ph.D at the University of Southampton and started a career in computer systems design. When he landed at Goldman in 1992, he devoured books on futures and options to get himself up to speed.
"I couldn't balance my own checkbook," he told an audience of Ph.D mathematics students at the University of Cambridge several years ago.
But Mr. Kirk learned finance quickly, rising to become the head of the strategies group in Europe, where he oversaw Goldman's quantitative technology.
"Ewan was known to be very - at Goldman, we used the term 'commercial,' " said Jay S. Dweck, a former head of equities strategies at Goldman, who was in Mr. Kirk's partnership class. "He was good at generating profit for the business."
Mr. Kirk's success helped him secure a deal on his departure to pay for continued access to Goldman's in-house software - what Mr. Dweck called the "magic that every firm wanted to try to reproduce."
That deal, according to Mr. Dweck, who was involved in the negotiations, was "unique." A spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment.
Cantab said in a letter to investors in December that it had been making progress in developing its own information-technology infrastructure. As part of that transition, the hedge fund revised its deal with Goldman last year; instead of fees, Goldman now has a small ownership stake in Cantab.
As the only prominent hedge fund in a region dominated by technology companies, Cantab can make a unique pitch to university students who might not have considered finance as a career. One such hire, Tom Howat, now a partner at the firm, hurried to finish his Ph.D in mathematical biology so he could join Cantab on its first day.
During the job interview in a local pub, Mr. Kirk described Cantab as a "start-up technology company that happens to apply itself to finance," Mr. Howat, 31, recalled in a recent essay.
That entrepreneurial spirit means Cantab can have some fun. Last year, in the Cambridge Dragon Boat Festival, a race on the River Cam, the team from Cantab finished second in the mixed division.
The team also won best dressed, outfitted in the style of Noah's Ark with zebra, giraffe and meerkat costumes.
Such self-expression wasn't part of the culture at Goldman, as Mr. Kirk learned the hard way.
He wore the kilt only once, "given the slightly strange looks I got turning up at a fancy New York partners' dinner wearing a dress," he recalled. "It certainly created a little bit of a stir."

HIGHLIGHT: Critics of the Texas model say corporate relocations have had a microscopic impact on the state&#8217;s economy. 

 BODY:
In a blog post on Monday for our colleagues at Economix, Nancy Folbre talks about economic development and the comparative advantages for states that "hunt" for existing jobs and those that "garden" for new jobs. An economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Ms. Folbre writes: 
The state of Texas touts its success in luring large companies from other states, offering generous tax subsidies financed by cuts in spending on local education, infrastructure and other public services. But critics of the Texas model contend that corporate relocations have had a "microscopic" impact on the state's economy.
Meanwhile, alternative economic development strategies are gradually gaining traction. Littleton, Colo., a suburb of Denver, has pioneered an "economic gardening" approach that rejects a "hunting" model in favor of growing its own small businesses, providing supportive services and planning assistance. Its success has inspired pilot projects in several states, including Florida, Iowa, Kansas and Louisiana. The Colorado legislature is currently considering a statewide pilot project.
Which approach do you think is more effective?

HEADLINE: Poverty as a Childhood Disease

BYLINE: PERRI KLASS, M.D.


HIGHLIGHT: More doctors are growing concerned about the effects of childhood poverty in an age when income inequality is increasing and social mobility is declining. 

 BODY:
Poverty is an exam room familiar. From Bellevue Hospital in New York to the neighborhood health center in Boston where I used to work, poverty has filtered through many of my interactions with parents and their children.
I ask about sleeping arrangements. Mother, father, older child and new baby live in one bedroom that they're renting in an apartment, worrying that if the baby cries too much, they'll be asked to leave.
I encourage an overweight 9-year-old who loves karate, and his mother says, "We had to stop; too expensive." I talk to a new mother who is going back to work too soon, leaving her baby with the cheapest sitter she can find. 
Is your housing situation secure? Can you afford groceries? Do you go with the cheapest fast food? Can you get the prescription filled? Raising children in poverty means that everything is more complicated.
Me, I'm one generation out. My mother will tell you about her Depression childhood, the social worker who checked the family's pots to see whether they were secretly able to afford meat, the landlord who put the furniture out on the street. It wasn't character-building or noble, she says. It was soul-destroying, grinding and cruel.
And it's even crueller, now that social mobility has decreased and children who grow up poor are more likely to stay poor.
At the annual meeting of the Pediatric Academic Societies last week, there was a new call for pediatricians to address childhood poverty as a national problem, rather than wrestling with its consequences case by case in the exam room.
Poverty damages children's dispositions and blunts their brains. We've seen articles about the language deficit in poorer homes and the gaps in school achievement. These remind us that - more so than in my mother's generation - poverty in this country is now likely to define many children's life trajectories in the harshest terms: poor academic achievement, high dropout rates, and health problems from obesity and diabetes to heart disease, substance abuse and mental illness.
Recently, there has been a lot of focus on the idea of toxic stress, in which a young child's body and brain may be damaged by too much exposure to so-called stress hormones, like cortisol and norepinephrine. When this level of stress is experienced at an early age, and without sufficient protection, it may actually reset the neurological and hormonal systems, permanently affecting children's brains and even, we are learning, their genes.
Toxic stress is the heavy hand of early poverty, scripting a child's life not in the Horatio Alger scenario of determination and drive, but in the patterns of disappointment and deprivation that shape a life of limitations.
At the meeting, my colleague Dr. Benard P. Dreyer, professor of pediatrics at New York University and a past president of the Academic Pediatric Association, called on pediatricians to take on poverty as a serious underlying threat to children's health. He was prompted, he told me later, by the widening disparities between rich and poor, and the gathering weight of evidence about the importance of early childhood, and the ways that deprivation and stress in the early years of life can reduce the chances of educational and life success.
"After the first three, four, five years of life, if you have neglected that child's brain development, you can't go back," he said. In the middle of the 20th century, our society made a decision to take care of the elderly, once the poorest demographic group in the United States. Now, with Medicare and Social Security, only 9 percent of older people live in poverty. Children are now our poorest group, with almost 25 percent of children under 5 living below the federal poverty level.
When Tony Blair became prime minister of Britain, amid growing socioeconomic disparities, he made it a national goal to cut child poverty in half in 10 years. It took a coalition of political support and a combination of measures that increased income, especially in families with young children (minimum wage, paid maternity and paternity leaves, tax credits), and better services - especially universal preschool programs. By 2010, reducing child poverty had become a goal across the British political spectrum, and child poverty had fallen to 10.6 percent of children below the absolute poverty line (similar to the measure used in the United States), down from 26.1 percent in 1999.
"Poor families who benefited from the reform were able to spend more money on items for children: books and toys, children's clothing and footwear, fresh fruits and vegetables," said Jane Waldfogel, a professor of social work at Columbia who has studied the British war on childhood poverty.
Dr. Dreyer said: "Income matters. You get people above the poverty level, and they actually are better parents. It's critical to get people out of poverty, but in addition our focus has to be on also giving families supports for other aspects of their lives - parenting, interventions in primary care, universal preschool."
At the Pediatric Academic Societies meeting, the most unexpected speaker - to a room full of pediatricians - was Robert H. Dugger, managing partner of Hanover Investment Group, who made the economic case for investing in young children. "History shows that productivity increases when people are able to access their rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," Mr. Dugger told me. "There is no economic recovery strategy stronger than committing to early childhood and K-through-12 investment."
Think for a moment of poverty as a disease, thwarting growth and development, robbing children of the healthy, happy futures they might otherwise expect. In the exam room, we try to mitigate the pain and suffering that are its pernicious symptoms. But our patients' well-being depends on more, on public health measures and prevention that lift the darkness so all children can grow toward the light.
An earlier version of this article misstated the title of Jane Waldfogel. She is a professor of social work at Columbia, not a sociologist.

HEADLINE: I.R.S. Targeting of Conservative Groups Could Resonate in 2014

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: The admission by the Internal Revenue Service that it targeted conservative organizations when they applied for tax-exempt status could motivate a strong turnout from the Republican base. 

 BODY:
My rule of thumb is that a vast majority of alleged political scandals will have less electoral impact than the conventional wisdom initially holds.
There are two main reasons for this. First, voters weigh major issues like economic performance and the conduct of foreign wars heavily in making their decisions, leaving relatively little room for everything else. Second, the news media may overplay the lead story, scandalous or otherwise, on any given day, even though it may turn out to be relatively unimportant in the context of a multiyear political cycle.
But the recent admission by the Internal Revenue Service that it targeted conservative organizations with terms like "Tea Party" or "Patriot" in their names when they applied for tax-exempt status could be an exception. It has the potential to harm Democrats' performance in next year's midterm elections, partly by motivating a strong turnout from the Republican base. 
Political scandals do not lend themselves especially well to data-driven analysis. But several years ago, I developed a series of five questions meant to determine whether a potential scandal "has legs." Some of the questions have support in empirical literature, while others are more subjective. The exercise is modeled after Bill James's "Keltner list," a series of gut-check questions that were meant to test a baseball player's suitability for the Hall of Fame.
The questions, with some minor wording differences from their original versions, are posed below. My conclusion, as you'll see, is that the I.R.S. story scores relatively high, meaning it could have a substantial political impact.
 1. Can the potential scandal be described with one sentence, but not easily refuted with one sentence? 
In this case, the gist of the scandal can be expressed in 140 characters, as The Associated Press did on Twitter last week: "IRS apologizes for inappropriately targeting conservative political groups in 2012 election." Subsequent reports have found that the I.R.S.'s scrutiny of the conservative groups began even earlier, in 2010. That detail notwithstanding, throw the words "I.R.S.," "inappropriately," "targeting" and "conservatives" into the same sentence and the news story is evident.
The potential explanation or defense of the I.R.S.'s actions, however, would be more long-winded. It is possible to ask questions about who within the I.R.S. authorized and had knowledge of the targeting, whether anyone sought to stop it, whether liberal groups were also targeted to any meaningful extent, what the tangible impact of the targeting was and whether political groups misuse 501(c)(4) laws for tax exemption. My purpose here is not to evaluate the credibility of these questions. But they rely on a series of relatively technical arguments.
This contrasts with the controversy surrounding the White House's handling of the attacks on the United States's diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya. In that case, the claims made by Republicans are often technical and detail-oriented. Such claims are not necessarily unwarranted - the world can be a complicated place - but relatively simple claims usually do better as they are litigated by voters and the news media, who have many demands competing for their attention. Simplicity seems to be on the Republicans' side in the I.R.S. case in a way it hasn't been on Benghazi.
 2. Does the scandal cut against a core element of the candidate's brand? 
"Candidate" in this case should be interpreted loosely, since President Obama will not be on the ballot again and has not been linked directly with any wrongdoing at this point. However, the I.R.S. story has the potential to affect perceptions of the executive branch, the Democratic Party and the United States government as a whole, and Mr. Obama by implication, since he is the head of each of those institutions.
The intent of this question is to evaluate whether a potential scandal undermines the core of a politician's claim to credibility. For instance, a candidate who campaigned as a moral crusader might be more affected by a sex scandal than one who ran as a policy expert, while the policy expert might be more threatened by an accusation of a forged research finding.
In a basic sense, scandals that reduce trust in government have the potential to harm those who argue for more government. Mr. Obama has predicated much of his agenda on the idea that Americans can and should trust the government to take action on health care, gun legislation and other issues. An issue like the I.R.S. scandal could be seized upon by those who argue that background checks for gun purchases will lead to a national registry, or that information the government collects in implementing the health care law will be abused, even if the government promises it will not.
In 2008, Mr. Obama ran partly as a "post-partisan" candidate, a claim that might be undermined if there was partisan targeting of conservative groups under his watch. And in the past six to eight years, Democrats have sometimes campaigned on what they said were superior standards of ethics, transparency and honesty in government. However, these themes were not as pertinent in the 2012 elections, which were contested mostly on economic policy.
 3. Does the scandal reinforce a core negative perception about the candidate? 
A scandal can be equally dangerous if, rather than undermining a candidate's strengths, it reminds voters of what they like least about him.
President Obama's opponents have long accused him of using rough-and-tumble, "Chicago-style" political tactics. However, he is a polarizing figure who has been accused of all sorts of things, and it would be hard to narrow what his opponents dislike about him to any one characteristic or issue.
But when it comes to the grievances of Tea Party voters in particular, the I.R.S.'s actions could hardly be more substantively or symbolically resonant. Tea Party groups were explicitly targeted by the I.R.S. The Tea Party takes its name from the historical protests against unfair tax policy. And the I.R.S.'s admissions confirm longstanding reporting and complaints by conservative websites like The Blaze. The scandal could put the Tea Party back in the spotlight.
There could be some risks to Republicans in a re-energized Tea Party, but energy can go a long way in midterm elections, when turnout is otherwise fairly low. In addition, the scandal could make the Tea Party appear more sympathetic and legitimate to voters who had come to take an increasingly negative view of it. On balance, that seems like a favorable trade for Republicans.
 4. Can the scandal be employed readily by the opposition without their looking hypocritical, risking retribution or giving life to a damaging counter-claim? 
One problem Republicans have had in framing the politics around Benghazi is that they are taking on some relatively popular opponents - in particular Hillary Rodham Clinton, in her former role as secretary of state. In addition, the executive branch may have the upper hand in debates surrounding national security, as Mitt Romney discovered when he pressed Mr. Obama ineffectually on Benghazi in the final presidential debate last year.
The I.R.S., although it is not quite as unpopular as you might think, is a much better target for Republicans. Moreover, some Democrats are also starting to call for an investigation into the I.R.S.'s activities. Republicans could overplay their hand, but this scandal has the potential to be seen as more than an ordinary partisan squabble, and Republicans may have a lot of leeway before they risk a backlash.
 5. Is the potential scandal occurring amid an otherwise slow news cycle? 
According to research by Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College, the news media's attention to potential scandals tends to rise during a president's second term, and has historically been especially high toward the beginning of his second term.
This could be partly a natural occurrence, if administrations become sloppier or more corrupt the longer they hold office. However, another factor may be that the early years of a president's second term are fairly slow for political news. During this period, the next presidential election is still a few years away, but the president generally does not have as ambitious a legislative agenda as during the first term. This condition certainly seems to hold now: by one relatively crude measure, Google searches for the term "political news," Americans' interest in political news stories is close to an eight-year low.
I want to be clear that the I.R.S.'s targeting of conservative groups is not, in my view, a "media-created scandal." However, the degree to which voters will give it precedence over other issues in 2014 may be affected by how much time the news media spends covering it, and that, in turn, will be affected by how many other news stories it is competing against.
In the near term, the I.R.S. scandal will be competing against news coverage of the Congressional hearings on Benghazi, which were the major political story late last week. In my view, however, this is a no-lose proposition for Republicans. The news media could portray the Benghazi and I.R.S. stories as "joint scandals," meaning that both would get plenty of coverage at the expense of other issues like immigration reform. Or, the news media could focus on the I.R.S. case instead of Benghazi - but for the reasons I've outlined here, the I.R.S. story probably entails much more political downside for Democrats.

HEADLINE: Is Canada's Oil Too Dirty for Europe?

BYLINE: CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE


HIGHLIGHT: As the American debate over the Keystone XL pipeline continues, Canadian politicians are waging a vigorous campaign to argue that oil from its tar sands shouldn&#8217;t be classified as dirtier than oil from other sources. 

 BODY:
As the debate over the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline continues in the United States, a Canadian trade delegation is insisting that Canadian oil extracted from tar sands - the product that would be transported by an expanded pipeline - should not be classified as being dirtier than other types of oil.
Last week Canada's natural resource minster, Joe Oliver, threatened to take the European Union to the World Trade Organization over its plans to classify oil harvested from tar sands as "highly polluting." 
"We are going to take whatever action we need to, and we may well go to the W.T.O.," Mr. Oliver said at a news conference in Brussels. "We will defend our interests vigorously." 
Mr. Oliver made the comments on a visit to Brussels to negotiate an unrelated bilateral trade agreement.
Although the minister eventually backed away from his threat to take the issue to the top trade arbiter, the Canadian government is worried that the classification under the European Commission's fuel quality directive could affect markets for the Canadian export.
"Canada's oil sands are a major global resource - a resource that will make an increasingly strategic contribution to energy security and economic stability," Mr. Oliver said in a ministry statement.
Both the Canadian hydrocarbon industry and government have been lobbying against the European fuel quality directive for years, according to a report by Reuters published this week.
The Canadian government argues that the directive unfairly penalizes Canadian oil.
The rules, which aim to help European countries reach greenhouse gas emission targets, classify global fuel sources by the emissions caused by their production and transportation.
Last week, a study commissioned by the provincial government of Alberta reported that oil extracted from the oil sands emit 12 percent more emissions than oil produced in Europe. Others estimate that oil coming from the oil sands is as much as 23 percent more polluting than other sources.
While Mr. Oliver was talking up Canadian oil last week, a Canadian-led group of climate scientists wrote an open letter to him criticizing the government's energy plans. In one section, they write:
In short, we are not convinced that your advocacy in support of new pipelines and expanded fossil fuel production takes climate change into account in a meaningful way.
Avoiding further levels of dangerous climate change will require significantly reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and making a transition to cleaner energy.
The infrastructure we build today will shape future choices about energy. If we invest in expanding fossil fuel production, we risk locking ourselves in to a high carbon pathway that increases greenhouse gas emissions for years and decades to come.
Mr. Oliver's European goodwill tour is directed to audiences on both sides of the Atlantic. With most of Canada's oil exports currently going to the United States, the European bloc's decision on how to classify the oil could affect Canada's image as much as it does its bottom line.
"We don't want the potential stigmatization and we're quite concerned about that issue," Mr. Oliver told Reuters last year.
This week, Mr. Oliver's boss, Prime Minster Stephen Harper, is in New York to promote Canadian oil.
In an e-mail published by the Canadian press, Andrew MacDougall, the prime minister's communication director, wrote: "As the prime minister has said before, the project will create jobs and economic growth on both sides of the border, and will provide a secure and stable supply of oil to the United States from a reliable partner and friend."
What do you think? Does the pollution created by the extraction of oil from the Canadian tar sands mean that the European Union and other countries should avoid using it?

HEADLINE: New Amtrak Engines Unveiled for Northeast

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Amtrak rolled out three new locomotives on Monday, the first step in the railroad's plan to modernize its aging fleet of trains.
The three are the first of 70 new locomotives the railroad is buying to operate on the Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston. Amtrak said they would operate at speeds up to 125 miles per hour on the Northeast route, matching the top speed of its current regional trains. 
The trains also will operate on Amtrak's Keystone route between Philadelphia and Harrisburg, Pa., where they will run as fast as 110 m.p.h., officials at the railroad said.
The new locomotives will be on regular trains, not the railroad's high-speed Acela line, which reaches top speeds of 150 m.p.h.
''The new Amtrak locomotives will help power the economic future of the Northeast region, provide more reliable and efficient service for passengers, and support the rebirth of rail manufacturing in America,'' said Joseph H. Boardman, Amtrak's president and chief executive.
The locomotives are part of a $466 million contract with Siemens. They will replace engines that have been in service for 25 to 35 years and have run an average of more than 3.5 million miles. Some of them have logged nearly 4.5 million miles.
The engines are being paid for with a $532 million loan from the Federal Railroad Administration, money that Amtrak said it would recoup with ticket revenue from the Northeast Corridor. The company also estimates that the new locomotives will save it more than $300 million in energy costs.
Amtrak said the new engines would also help improve the railroad's on-time performance. Additionally, Amtrak and federal transportation officials said that areas where the trains were manufactured and assembled would see economic benefits in the form of jobs.
''We are committed to connecting people, communities and jobs,'' said Karen Hedlund, deputy administrator at the Federal Railroad Administration. ''This project does all three.''
''Investing in manufacturing these 70 new locomotives are creating and preserving jobs in 60 cities across the country,'' she said, ''while meeting the growing demand for improved reliability and service along the Northeast and Keystone Corridors.''
It will be some time before the engines are put into service. Amtrak will begin testing the first three this summer, two at a Transportation Department site in Pueblo, Colo., and one on the Northeast Corridor.
Once they have been tested and commissioned, the remaining locomotives will be delivered monthly beginning in November and running through 2016, the railroad said.
The Northeast Corridor is not the only area that will see new trains in the near future. Amtrak has a $298 million contract with CAF USA of Elmira, N.Y., to build 130 single-level long-distance rail cars, including diners, sleepers and baggage cars. They will replace some of the oldest equipment in Amtrak's fleet, dating to the 1940s and '50s. CAF USA will begin delivering the cars this fall.

HEADLINE: Global Retailers Join Safety Plan For Bangladesh

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and JIM YARDLEY; Steven Greenhouse reported from New York, and Jim Yardley from New Delhi. Julfikar Ali Manik contributed reporting from Dhaka, Bangladesh.

 BODY:
Under mounting pressure to improve working conditions in Bangladesh's garment factories, several of the world's largest apparel companies agreed on Monday to a landmark plan to help pay for fire safety and building improvements after the collapse last month of the Rana Plaza factory complex, which killed more than 1,100 people.
The agreement, hailed by labor and consumer groups as a major breakthrough, came as the Bangladeshi government also took steps to respond to the April 24 disaster at Rana Plaza outside Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital. In the last two days, the government has pledged to raise wages for garment workers and change labor laws to make it easier to form trade unions.
The parallel announcements by global brands and the Bangladeshi government were a significant shift: For years, Bangladesh has seen some of the worst practices in the global garment industry. Wages are the lowest in the world, starting at roughly $37 a month. Factory conditions are often unsafe. Yet global brands have often sought to deflect any direct responsibility for the problems, while the government has often been tepid in protecting worker rights. 
But the Rana Plaza disaster, the deadliest in the garment industry's history, has created tremendous pressure for change. On Monday morning, the Swedish retail giant H&M and Inditex, owner of the popular Zara chain, endorsed the safety plan. Within hours, the large Dutch retailer C&A also joined the agreement, as did the low-cost British retailers Primark and Tesco.
''Fire and building safety are extremely important issues for us, and we put a lot of effort and resources within this area,'' said Helena Helmersson, head of sustainability at H&M. ''With this commitment we can now influence even more in this issue. We hope for a broad coalition of signatures in order for the agreement to work effectively on the ground.''
H&M is the largest purchaser of garments from Bangladesh, and its endorsement was seen as influential to other brands. The agreement calls for independent, rigorous factory safety inspections with public accountability and mandatory repairs and renovations underwritten by Western retailers. It also enhances the roles played by workers and unions to ensure factory safety.
''H&M's decision to sign the accord is crucial,'' said Scott Nova, the executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a factory-monitoring group in Washington that is backed by 175 American colleges and universities. ''They are the single largest producer of apparel in Bangladesh, ahead even of Walmart. This accord now has tremendous momentum.''
Labor groups and others were already trying to pressure other big brands, including Walmart and Gap, to sign onto the agreement. ''We call on these companies to do the right thing on behalf of the more than 1,250 textile workers killed in Bangladesh factory disasters in the last six months, including Rana Plaza, where the tragedy is still unfolding,'' said Philip J. Jennings, the general secretary of the UNI Global Union, the international association of trade unions. ''This is black and white, life and death.''
Gap has been the target of an online petition that obtained more than 900,000 signatures in support of the agreement. But the company has resisted signing on, objecting to the agreement's legally binding nature and arguing that it had already hired a fire inspector and promised $22 million in loans for factory improvements.
PVH, the parent company of Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Izod, announced it would sign the deal, an expanded version of a proposal that PVH had already signed. The new plan lasts five years, while the previous one was to last only two. PVH also announced on Monday that it would contribute $2.5 million to underwrite factory safety improvements as part of the new plan.
Meanwhile, Bangladesh's cabinet on Monday approved changes in labor laws. Gowher Rizvi, a top adviser to Bangladesh's prime minister, said the changes -- which still require approval by Parliament -- are part of a broader government effort to come into compliance with international labor standards and improve on-the-job conditions.
''Worker safety and worker welfare have now been brought into the forefront,'' Mr. Rizvi said in a telephone interview. He said discussions on these changes predated the Rana Plaza collapse but agreed that the disaster had intensified the pressure for reforms.
''This is the goose that lays the golden egg,'' he said of the garment industry's importance to Bangladesh. ''Don't kill it. We have to strengthen it. We have to nurture it. Nurturing it means fair treatment of the workers.''
Bangladesh is now the world's second-leading garment exporter, trailing China. Its low wages and lack of regulation have helped it attract billions of dollars in orders from Western retailers and apparel brands. Not only are wages the lowest in the world, but labor unions, which face impediments in organizing, are largely absent in garment factories. Some workers who have tried to organize unions have been dismissed or harassed.
Mikail Shipar, the country's labor secretary, said one onerous restriction was removed by the cabinet on Monday. Under the current rules, organizers must present the government with a list of names showing that at least 30 percent of workers in a factory want a union. But that list is then turned over to the factory's owner to verify the authenticity of the names -- a step that some owners have used to engage in union busting and firing union supporters.
The list will no longer be turned over to factory owners, Mr. Shipar said, removing ''a major barrier in getting registration of a trade union in a factory.''
Other changes involve benefits. Severance and retirement payments will be increased for workers with longer tenures; annual payments under a welfare fund will be equalized so that every garment worker, regardless of the size of the factory he or she works in, will receive the same amounts.
Government officials also are creating a wage board that would begin discussions between labor and management on setting a new minimum wage for garment workers. Mr. Shipar said the process might take six months, but officials have said that changes would be retroactive to May 1.
Bangladesh has roughly 5,000 garment factories, employing more than 4.5 million people. Nearly 80 percent are women, many poorly educated and from rural villages. In the past, even the low factory wages were better than working in the fields. But as inflation has risen in the last two years, garment workers have grown increasingly angry about low wages. On Sunday, at least 100 garment factories had to be closed as workers staged protests, demanding higher pay.
By Monday afternoon, the death toll at Rana Plaza had reached 1,127 people. Work crews have almost completed clearing debris and searching for the victims -- yet families of missing workers continue to linger.
Local labor groups sifting through the rubble have found labels or documents of brands that were being produced by factories in the building. Several investor, religious, consumer and labor groups are pressing these companies to sign the new safety deal. Companies known to have obtained clothes from the factories include Benetton, Cato Fashions, Children's Place, el Corte Ingles and Loblaws.

HEADLINE: A Colorful Bolivian Bastion, Floating Above It All

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN; Mónica Machicao Pacheco contributed reporting.

 BODY:
EL ALTO, Bolivia -- Turn a corner in this sprawling, bustling, fast-growing city and the Ovando family home suddenly bursts into view, a party-colored mirage floating above the drab, brick-red metropolis like a beacon of an alternate Andean future.
''We didn't want it to be just another brick house,'' said Karen Ovando, 26, a government customs lawyer, standing on the terrace of her parents' bright yellow, orange and red penthouse, six stories above the street. ''They're all matchboxes here, all the same. We wanted to show something about ourselves, something about our family.''
But the Ovando home and others like it -- popularly called chalets for their size and extravagance -- also have a lot to say about the unbridled energy, aspirations and political contradictions of this churning, whirligig city and its place in a changing Bolivia.
Rising incongruously above much poorer dwellings, these urban, Andean versions of the suburban McMansion reflect the economic growth that Bolivia has been able to achieve in recent years -- and how unevenly it is often distributed. But rather than stir widespread resentment in this bastion of rebellious politics, these open displays of wealth are often embraced by El Alto's residents, an illustration of the city's unusual mix of leftist uprisings and capitalist strivings. 
''El Alto is simultaneously the most revolutionary city, perhaps in all of Latin America, at the same time as it's the most neoliberal city, the most individualistic city in all of Latin America,'' said Benjamin H. Kohl, an associate professor of urban studies at Temple University in Philadelphia.
El Alto sits at about 13,150 feet on the barren altiplano. Directly below it, Bolivia's capital, La Paz, spills down the slopes of a steep valley, with the towering snow-covered peaks of the Andes as backdrop.
La Paz has long had a clear geography of status. The wealthiest residents live at the bottom of the valley, and the poorer ones live higher up. On top of everything is El Alto, whose name means ''the Heights.'' For years a slum appendage of La Paz, it became an independent city in 1988.
El Alto's location is also the source of its power. The airport is here, and the main highways connecting La Paz to the rest of the country pass through El Alto. In times of unrest, El Alto can lay siege to the capital. The model was set by Tupac Katari, an Aymara Indian leader who led a late-18th-century rebellion against the Spanish colonialists, using El Alto's position to cut off La Paz.
Centuries later, in 2003, a similar strategy was used by the modern residents of El Alto, who rose up against a government proposal to export natural gas to the United States through a port in neighboring Chile, Bolivia's traditional enemy. Scores of people died in the unrest, and President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada was forced to flee the country.
El Alto residents then became a key source of support for the leftist president, Evo Morales, supporting him overwhelmingly when he was elected in 2005 and again in 2009. But even Mr. Morales found that he was not immune to the anger of El Alto. In 2010, when his government proposed changes to subsidies that would have led to a sharp rise in the price of gasoline, El Alto's residents again blockaded the capital and forced Mr. Morales to back down.
Still, for all its rebellious spirit, El Alto is far from being a typical bastion of the left. It is a hive of commerce, small-scale manufacturing, international trade and contraband.
''Lots of people describe El Alto as a revolutionary city, but it's the capital of capitalism,'' said Mario Durán, an activist who works to improve Internet access.
Home to about 220,000 residents in 1985, the city swelled as poor farmers and out-of-work miners poured in from the countryside. It is now bigger than La Paz, with an estimated size of well over one million. The population is overwhelmingly Aymara, one of the country's main indigenous groups, and the immigrants have brought with them a fierce work ethic and a laissez-faire zest for business.
The most prominent feature of El Alto is its vast open-air market, which fills mile upon mile of city streets every Sunday and Thursday. Here vendors by the thousands offer a huge array of goods: piles of used T-shirts and other clothing that arrive in bales from the United States; cars, new or used (and sometimes stolen); neatly arranged arms, legs and heads from broken Barbie dolls; electric guitars; mummified baby llamas; pickax handles; and myriad other items. Each week, millions of dollars pour through the market, which operates in an almost total vacuum of government intervention, taxes or regulations.
Residents describe El Alto as a nonstop city financed by immigrant dreams of a better life. Beyond the market, there are thousands of small businesses, including importers, manufacturers and garment shops that make knockoff brand-label clothing. The city seems to be in a constant state of construction, fueled by the commerce and, locals said, by money from Bolivia's drug trade. And there are language academies that give courses in Chinese for El Alto entrepreneurs.
''El Alto can be Hong Kong in the middle of the altiplano,'' Mr. Durán said. ''Or it can be a slum. You're in the exact point where you need to establish the foundations for the city's development.''
The other key aspect of El Alto is its indigenous character. Bolivia is a majority indigenous country, but El Alto is special, scholars say, because of the way it has developed. It has no old colonial town center with a plaza, church and government buildings, a significant departure in a country that still struggles with the legacy of conquest.
''It is the first indigenous city since the colonial period,'' said Félix Muruchi, a professor of pre-Columbian culture at the Public University of El Alto. ''A Spaniard didn't make it. A Creole, a descendant of the Spanish, didn't make it. It was the indigenous people themselves, the Aymaras, who made it.''
Now El Alto's brightly colored buildings topped with luxury chalets have become a symbol of this vibrant, dynamic city, representing a homegrown architectural style with a crazy quilt of building materials and decorative motifs, including some copied from pre-Columbian ruins.
Some have giant diamonds raised in bas-relief on the stucco facade, or plaster lions or a condor perched on a penthouse terrace railing. Some look like castles; others have slashing diagonal swaths of reflective or colored glass. Most buildings have stores or restaurants on the ground floor and often a large event hall on the second and third floors, for weddings or parties. At the top sits the chalet, often with gabled roof and many-tiered chimney.
But most of all they are oases of color: electric greens, blues, yellows, reds. Other buildings here are made from brick and concrete, and few are painted, creating a subfusc cityscape exacerbated by the dust blowing across the altiplano. Paint is expensive, and Bolivians are poor. And residents believe their property taxes will rise once a home is finished and painted. Government officials say that is no longer true, but the belief, and the lack of paint, persist.
In that context, there is no surer sign of wealth than a painted house, and the brighter the paint the better.
''We came from zero,'' Ms. Ovando said, recalling how her family used to live in a single room behind her parents' restaurant. The family now runs two restaurants, a cattle ranch and other businesses. Now, she said, she can drive around El Alto and see copies of her family's home popping up all around.

HEADLINE: As British Prime Minister Visits Washington, His Party Splits Over European Union

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
LONDON -- His visit to the White House overshadowed by toxic divisions at home over Europe, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain won the support of President Obama on Monday in seeking to calm a clamor within the Conservative Party for further and faster moves toward an exit from the European Union.
Speaking after hosting talks with Mr. Cameron, Mr. Obama urged Britons not to give up on their membership in the union without first seeking to improve it. ''You probably want to see if you can fix what is broken in a very important relationship before you break it off -- that makes sense to me,'' Mr. Obama said, while stressing that any decision was for the British people. 
The statement reflected growing worries that one of America's closest allies is moving toward leaving the 27-nation bloc.
Britain holds the G-8 presidency, and Mr. Cameron will lead the annual gathering of the group next month in Northern Ireland. His meeting with Mr. Obama was part of his preparations for that gathering.
But on Sunday, two members of Mr. Cameron's own cabinet provoked fresh controversy over European policy by saying they would favor withdrawal from the European Union if a vote were held ''tomorrow.''
At the news conference in Washington, Mr. Cameron repeated his strategy of renegotiating Britain's ties with the union before holding a vote on membership in 2017. He insisted that there was ''not going to be a referendum tomorrow,'' saying that to hold one now would present a ''false choice between the status quo and leaving, and I don't think that's the choice the British public wants or the British public deserves.''
Earlier, Mr. Cameron said other critics within his party who dismissed his prospects of renegotiating a new deal with the union were taking an ''extraordinary'' position and ''throwing in the towel before the negotiations even started.''
The debate in the Conservative Party was particularly awkward for Mr. Cameron, who used his visit to Washington to push for a free-trade area for the European Union and the United States, a long-cherished objective of policy makers, and one that the British prime minister said would benefit the global economy.
''This deal could add as much as £10 billion to the British economy and £63 billion ($97 billion) to U.S. GDP,'' he wrote in The Wall Street Journal. ''But the rest of the world would benefit, too, with gains that could generate 100 billion euros ($132 billion) worldwide.''
Yet Mr. Cameron's advocacy of such a pact is hardly strengthened by doubts over Britain's commitment to remain part of the European Union.
Such strains in British politics are nothing new, and deep divisions over Europe have afflicted the Conservative Party on and off for a quarter of a century, contributing to the downfall of the party's two last prime ministers.
In 2006, soon after he took over the leadership of his party, Mr. Cameron warned colleagues that they had alienated voters by ''banging on'' about Europe and tax cuts.
When the issue refused to go away, Mr. Cameron had hoped that, by going further than any of his predecessors in offering Britain's first referendum on Europe since 1975, he would persuade his party to unite behind his strategy.
Though surveys show Britons to be highly skeptical about the European Union, it tends to be an issue well down their list of priorities. But the rise of the populist U.K. Independence Party, which wants Britain to quit the union, has sent shock waves through the ranks of Conservative lawmakers.
The idea of quitting the bloc, which was once seen as the preserve of a tiny, extreme faction of the party, is gaining growing respectability after endorsement by two former cabinet ministers last week. Meanwhile, ministers seeking support on the right of the party have been stressing their euroskeptic credentials.
In interviews on Sunday, Education Minister Michael Gove and Defense Minister Philip Hammond indicated that they would vote to leave the European Union if a referendum were held tomorrow.
Worried by the advances of the U.K. Independence Party, many Conservative lawmakers want Mr. Cameron to go beyond his promise of an ''in-out'' referendum on membership of the European Union by 2017 -- if he wins the next election in 2015 -- by enshrining his pledge in law immediately.
Late Monday, British news media reported that Mr. Cameron was about to make a gesture by publishing draft legislation on the referendum. However, because his coalition partners do not support the idea of such a vote, this will not be given the backing of the government, making it less likely to become law.
On Wednesday, lawmakers are due to vote on a motion criticizing the government's program for legislating through a referendum -- a move certain to advertise Conservative divisions.
Knowing the strength of feeling within his party, Mr. Cameron has allowed ministers to abstain and his party's other lawmakers to vote against if they choose, a rare and unusual concession on such vote.
The prime minister's spokesman put a brave face on the decision, arguing that it was no bad thing for a ''spotlight to be shone'' on his commitment to hold a referendum if he is re-elected.
But Emma Reynolds, a spokeswoman on Europe for the opposition Labour party, told the BBC that the Conservatives were demonstrating their well-known divisions over Europe. ''It is history repeating itself,'' she said. ''We have seen this for the last 20 years -- they are in complete chaos and disarray.''

HEADLINE: Dr. Joyce Brothers, On-Air Psychologist Who Made TV House Calls, Dies at 85

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Joyce Brothers, a former academic psychologist who, long before Drs. Ruth, Phil and Laura, was counseling millions over the airwaves, died on Monday at her home in Fort Lee, N.J. She was 85.
Her daughter, Lisa Brothers Arbisser, confirmed the death.
Dr. Joyce Brothers, as she was always known professionally -- a full-name hallmark of the more formal times in which she began her career -- was widely described as the mother of mass-media psychology because of the firm, pragmatic and homiletic guidance she administered for decades via radio and television.
Historically, she was a bridge between advice columnists like Dear Abby and Ann Landers, who got their start in the mid-1950s, and the self-help advocates of the 1970s and afterward.
Throughout the 1960s, and long beyond, one could scarcely turn on the television or open a newspaper without encountering her. She was the host of her own nationally syndicated TV shows, starting in the late 1950s with ''The Dr. Joyce Brothers Show'' and over the years including ''Ask Dr. Brothers,'' ''Consult Dr. Brothers'' and ''Living Easy With Dr. Joyce Brothers.'' 
She was also a ubiquitous guest on talk shows like ''The Tonight Show'' and on variety shows like ''The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour.''
She was a panelist on many game shows, including ''What's My Line?'' and ''The Hollywood Squares.'' These appearances had a fitting symmetry: It was as a game-show contestant that Dr. Brothers had received her first television exposure.
Playing herself, or a character very much like herself, she had guest roles on a blizzard of TV series, from ''The Jack Benny Program'' to ''Happy Days,'' ''Taxi,'' ''Baywatch,'' ''Entourage'' and ''The Simpsons.''
She also lectured widely; had a call-in radio show, a syndicated newspaper column and a regular column in Good Housekeeping magazine; and wrote books.
Dr. Brothers arrived in the American consciousness (or, more precisely, the American unconscious) at a serendipitous time: the exact historical moment when cold war anxiety, a greater acceptance of talk therapy and the widespread ownership of television sets converged. Looking crisply capable yet eminently approachable in her pastel suits and pale blond pageboy, she offered gentle, nonthreatening advice on sex, relationships, family and all manner of decent behavior.
It is noteworthy, then, that her public life began with fisticuffs. The demure-looking, scholarly Dr. Brothers had first come to wide attention as a contestant on ''The $64,000 Question,'' where she triumphed as an improbable authority on boxing.
Joyce Diane Bauer was born in Brooklyn on Oct. 20, 1927, and reared in Queens and Manhattan. She earned a bachelor's degree from Cornell, with a double major in home economics and psychology, followed by a Ph.D. in psychology from Columbia.
In the late 1940s and early '50s, Dr. Brothers taught psychology at Hunter College. By the mid-'50s, while her husband, Milton J. Brothers, was pursuing a medical residency, she had left the academy to stay home with their baby daughter.
Milton Brothers's residency paid $50 a month. Joyce Brothers, who had a steel-trap memory, decided to supplement their income by appearing on a quiz show. She settled on ''The $64,000 Question,'' produced in New York and broadcast on CBS. On the show, contestants answered a string of increasingly difficult questions in fields of their choosing.
Dr. Brothers quickly saw that the show prized incongruous matches of contestant and subject: the straight-backed Marine officer who was an expert on gastronomy; the cobbler who knew all about opera. What she decided, would be more improbable than a petite psychologist who was a pundit of pugilism?
She embarked on weeks of intensive study, a process little different, she later said, from preparing to write a doctoral dissertation. She made her first appearance on the show in late 1955, returning week after week until she had won the top prize, $64,000 -- only the second person, and the first woman, to do so. She later won the same amount, also for boxing knowledge, on a spinoff show, ''The $64,000 Challenge.''
In the late 1950s, amid the quiz-show scandals (which included revelations that contestants on some shows, ''The $64,000 Question'' among them, had been fed correct answers), Dr. Brothers was called before a grand jury. In an exercise that was curiously reminiscent of her appearances on the shows, she was peppered with arcane boxing questions to test her authentic knowledge of the subject. She passed handily, and no taint of the scandal attached to her.
In 1956, as a result of her performance on ''The $64,000 Question,'' Dr. Brothers was invited to be a commentator on ''Sports Showcase,'' a television show on Channel 13 in New York, which had not yet become a noncommercial station. One show led to another, and before the decade was out she was a television star.
If, in later, years, Dr. Brothers's public image had acquired the faint aura of camp, it was leavened by her obvious awareness of that fact -- and her corresponding ability to laugh at herself in public. (Who without such self-knowledge would have agreed, as she did, to appear on both ''The David Frost Show'' and ''The $1.98 Beauty Show,'' a late-'70s Chuck Barris game show-cum-parody?)
But for the most part, Dr. Brothers displayed a far more serious side: More than once, she dissuaded suicidal callers to her radio show from ending their lives, keeping them on the line with encouraging talk until their phone numbers could be traced and help dispatched.
In her book ''Widowed'' (1990), she wrote candidly of her own suicidal despair after her husband's death from cancer, and her eventual resolve to go on with her life.
Milton Brothers, an internist who specialized in diabetes treatment, died in 1989. Besides her daughter, an ophthalmic surgeon, Dr. Brothers is survived by a sister, Elaine Goldsmith; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
Her other books include ''The Brothers System for Liberated Love and Marriage'' (1972) and ''How to Get Whatever You Want Out of Life'' (1978). Had it not been for ''The $64,000 Question,'' Dr. Brothers might well have remained a scholar whose publications ran toward ''An Investigation of Avoidance, Anxiety, and Escape Behavior in Human Subjects as Measured by Action Potentials in Muscle,'' as her doctoral dissertation was titled.
But in an era when few women managed to have high-profile public careers, Dr. Brothers was able to transform a single night -- Dec. 6, 1955, the night of her $64,000 question -- into more than five decades of celebrity.
The question was a multipart interrogation that caused the show to run 30 seconds long. Her responses, given from an isolation booth, conveyed the agility of her mind, the capacity of her memory and the ferocity of her determination.
That night Dr. Brothers supplied, among other impeccable answers, the name of the glove Roman gladiators wore (cestus), Primo Carnera's opponent in his heavyweight title defense of 1933 (Paolino Uzcudun) and the name of the essayist (William Hazlitt) who wrote about having seen Bill Neat defeat Thomas Hickman on Dec. 11, 1821.

HEADLINE: Our Ceaseless Circus

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI. 
Joe Nocera is off today.

 BODY:
Four Americans died in Benghazi, Libya: people with unrealized hopes, unfinished plans, relatives who loved them and friends who will miss them.
But let's focus on what really matters about the attack and its aftermath. Did Hillary Clinton's presumed 2016 presidential campaign take a hit?
We live in a country lousy with guns and bloody with gun-related violence, manifest two weeks ago in a Kentucky 5-year-old's fatal shooting of his 2-year-old sister, evident over the weekend in a hail of bullets at a Mother's Day parade in New Orleans. 
But let's cut to the chase. Did Kelly Ayotte, the New Hampshire senator, safeguard or endanger her political future by casting one of the votes that doomed gun-control legislation in the Senate? An d does the law's failure mean that it's time to write the obituary for Barack Obama's presidency, which has more than 1,300 days to go, or can we wait -- I don't know -- a week or maybe even two to do that?
Now we have a scandal at the Internal Revenue Service to factor in. And a scandal it is, in urgent need of a thorough investigation, which President Obama pledged at his news conference on Monday and which we're very much owed.
But before we get a full account, let's by all means pivot to the possible political fallout, politics being all that seems to matter these days. Will Republicans ever trust and be able to work with the administration again? (This is being asked as if there were all that much trust and cooperation in the first place.) Have they finally been handed the cudgel that can whack Obama and his crew into oblivion? Assess, discuss and please don't forget to make predictions about the 2014 midterms.
It never gets better and may in fact be getting worse: the translation of all of the news and of all of Washington's responses into a ledger of electoral pluses and minuses, a graph of rising and falling political fortunes, a narrative of competition between not just the parties but the would-be potentates within a party. On issue after issue, the sideshow swallows the substance, as politicians and the seemingly infinite ranks of political handlers join us journalists in gaming everything out, ad infinitum.
To follow the debate over immigration reform is to lose sight at times of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in limbo and the challenge of finding the most economically fruitful and morally sound way to deal with them and their successors. No, the real stakes are United States Senator Marco Rubio's presidential aspirations. Will he pay a high price with the Republican base for pushing a path to citizenship? Or will he earn necessary centrist credentials?
And where does it leave him vis-à-vis Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, who are fellow Republican senators itching for prominence and are also hypothetical primary rivals? The next presidential election is three and a half years away -- an eternity, really -- but instead of putting a damper on speculation, that time span has encouraged it, letting a thousand theories and nearly as many contenders bloom.
We can wonder: if Clinton decided not to run, would a door open for another woman, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of the New York? Just how well has Gillibrand positioned herself for such a turn? That story is already out there, and in it her record is framed largely in terms of her prospects for national office, as if one exists in the service of the other, as if the point of a Congressional seat is leveraging it into an even better, more regal throne.
What about the actual business of governing? Between all the preening, partisan cross-fire and of course fund-raising that consumes members of Congress, is there any space and energy for that?
Not much, to judge from either the sclerosis that now defines the institution or the obsessions of those of us in the media. Our quickness to publicize skirmishes and divine political jockeying abet both. Actors tend to do whatever keeps the audience rapt.
At Obama's news conference, he breezed past the I.R.S. debacle too quickly, and I'm not sure why he'd stayed mum until then. He flashed too much self-righteous anger about the scrutiny of the Benghazi talking points, which strike to important matters of accountability and credibility.
But however self-servingly, Obama got one thing about Benghazi exactly right: what's most vital, and what's being obscured, is how we improve diplomatic security.
After all, the fates altered most profoundly by the attack weren't his or Clinton's or any other pol's, but rather those of the four lost Americans: Christopher Stevens, Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods and Sean Smith.
''We dishonor them,'' Obama said, ''when we turn things like this into a political circus.'' Indeed. But it's what we turn almost everything into.

HEADLINE: Farm-to-Hotel Dining

BYLINE: By MARTHA C. WHITE

 BODY:
For years, most hotel restaurants could easily be dismissed as unremarkable and unsurprising, their menus seemingly unchanged from year to year. But lately, they have been following the lead of upscale restaurants and offering ingredients grown or produced nearby.
''Most hotels for years tried to cater to a mass market,'' said Charles D. Dorn, managing director of the Dorn Group, a hospitality consulting firm. ''Now, in fact, they've all kind of realized that doesn't work anymore.''
Mr. Dorn said hotels' embrace of the locally sourced trend is an evolution of hotels' increasing focus on environmentally minded practices. It also helps them differentiate themselves in a crowded marketplace, where catering to business travelers is a priority. According to the Global Business Travel Association, business travel spending is expected to climb by more than 5 percent this year. 
Janeen Driscoll is one of those traveling foodies. She stays at chain hotels once or twice a month for her job as a director at a public relations agency, she said, and she is often too busy to venture past the hotel lobby for meals.
''While chain hotels offer great value, they're usually and typically not places where you are eating,'' she said. For food aficionados like her, she said, ''They just don't offer a lot of local flavor.''
When she does spot local ingredients on a hotel restaurant menu, she said, ''I like it immediately. I know that that hotel has done its homework to source local products.''
At a visit last winter to the Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel in Alberta, Canada, Ms. Driscoll said she was happy to discover a French fries dish called poutine, made with Alberta beef, that was served in the hotel's lounge. ''It gave me a unique feeling of a sense of place,'' she said. ''Local foods give you a great feeling of culture in a very short period of time, especially when you're traveling on business.''
That's the reaction hotel food and beverage managers are trying to elicit.
''We want our hotel guests to feel like the restaurant in our hotel is a local experience,'' said Mike DeFrino, executive vice president for hotel operations at Kimpton Hotels and Restaurants. About 70 percent of those guests across Kimpton's portfolio are business travelers, he said.
''We really think if the restaurant is popular with the locals, if you will, it's going to feel to the hotel guest that they're eating in an authentic restaurant, not a corporate-configured stereotype,'' Mr. DeFrino said.
Last May, the Hyatt Hotels Corporation started a food initiative across its brands, requiring in part that chefs at its roughly 120 full-service hotels in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean incorporate at least five local ingredients in their menus. Susan Santiago, vice president for food and beverage at Hyatt, said that ''local'' was defined, for the most part, as within 50 miles.
The practice of highlighting local food has a distinctly American flavor, though. In many parts of the world, ingredients prepared and served at hotels come from nearby because large distribution networks do not exist or operate on the same scale as in the United States.
''In Europe, you don't have these national purchasing groups,'' Ms. Santiago said.
Although sourcing local food has its charms, its also has challenges.
Cost can be a concern. Some hotel chefs say that buying local ingredients is more expensive since small farmers, ranchers and fishermen do not have the same economies of scale as their larger counterparts. But that is not always the case. Local food may cost less, in part because the cost of shipping ingredients hundreds or thousands of miles is eliminated. Ryan Littman, the chef at the 18 Oaks restaurant at the JW Marriott San Antonio Hill Country Resort and Spa, working with a local cattle ranch, cut his beef costs by about a third.
Maintaining an authentic supply of ingredients can be difficult, especially if a big corporate or social group wants to feature ingredients that are typically associated with the destination, but because of poor weather, the time of year or other circumstances, they are not available locally. Chefs use phrases like ''seasonal vegetables'' on menus, which allows them to serve whatever is freshest and most readily available.
Big catering orders are especially hard because they require hundreds of portions at the same time, said Keith Roberts, executive chef at the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel. ''The volume is a difficult challenge for us, especially on a banquet menu that doesn't change seasonally,'' he added.
Louis Martorano, executive chef at the Hilton Orlando, says that while event planners were now ''a lot more flexible'' on variations in the menu, he still gets requests for out-of-season ingredients or items that cannot be obtained locally.
When the Hilton Orlando opened in 2009, one of its four restaurants was based on a ''farm to fork'' concept, and Mr. Martorano said his use of local suppliers expanded from there. ''It's something we work on constantly. I'd like to see it grow more.''
''Planning with them is huge,'' Mr. Martorano added, since 80 percent of the farms that provide him with ingredients are within 100 miles of the hotel. ''I have to talk to my farmers.''
The ranch that provides the grass-fed beef served at 18 Oaks sells almost all of the beef it produces to the JW Marriott. Several Fairmont hotels in the United States and Canada have joined with local craft breweries to brew beers specifically for each hotel. Last year, Mr. Roberts in Santa Monica bought out one farmer's entire crop of black currants and froze them to use in a sauce for a duck dish throughout the winter.
Hyatt even persuades farmers to come regularly to one of its big-city Andaz brand hotels. Three years ago, the Andaz Wall Street in Lower Manhattan started a farmers' market that runs through the summer and fall.
Ultimately, this focus benefits travelers, said Dan Simons, principal at the consulting firm Vucurevich Simons Advisory Group. ''People still like to form some memories when they travel,'' he said. ''People want to know where they are and that they're not just hamsters on a wheel.''

HEADLINE: Disappointing Fans Since '64

BYLINE: By JOHN HYDUK. 
John Hyduk was a finalist for a National Magazine Award in 2012.

 BODY:
CLEVELAND -- As a Cleveland sports fan, I hold these truths to be self-evident: no matter how promising the plan or how high the draft pick, someone will screw it up.
I work the graveyard shift for a beverage distributor outside the city, loading soda from dusk till dawn. We eat lunch in the small hours, in a break room where the reading material runs to day-old sports pages and a dog-eared copy of ''God's Plan for You.'' The recent news has been enough to try one's soul.
Our new N.F.L. owner, a truck stop billionaire named Jimmy Haslam, is being investigated by assorted federal agencies for fuel rebate hanky-panky. The Cavaliers lost 58 games: they would have lost more, but the season ended. That collapse cost Coach Byron Scott his job and the new/old hire Mike Brown any hope of a happy retirement. The Miami Heat, however, roll largely downhill toward another N.B.A. title. This is particularly grating because a Heat player has a Cleveland connection. (No bitterness from me -- much love, Norris Cole.) The Indians perform in a cloister. 
These are not the worst of times, only the latest. The Fumble, the Drive, the Shot, the curse of Rocky Colavito -- library shelves groan with the agony of Cleveland fans. A generation fights from a crouch. I'm no Cooperstown, but I caught my share of Indians games at the old Municipal Stadium. I was there watching the Kardiac Kids drive when Coach Sam Rutigliano called Red Right 88. What's needed now, I know, is distance.
Distance is hard.
We are sports people. The N.F.L. was founded in 1920 in a Hupmobile showroom down the road in Canton, Ohio. We welcomed boys from small towns and swampy places, and gave them nicknames like Automatic Otto and Rapid Robert and the Mudcat. We built an 81,000-seat horseshoe with public money -- in the midst of the Great Depression, no less -- wherein neighbors could watch these adopted sons perform. We turned the dials on our car radios on the ride home from the swing shift at Republic Steel or Fisher Body, found the announcer Jimmy Dudley's honey drawl and heard music.
The Indians took the World Series in 1948; in '64 the Browns were crowned kings of professional football. Since then, nothing. It has been a particularly potent kind of futility. Not a cuddly incompetence like the Chicago Cubs', each collapse covered in ivy, or the celebrated struggles of the Boston Red Sox. No ''Sweet Caroline'' here. Our ballpark singalong is ''Eve of Destruction.''
Periodically, wizards arrived to break the curse. They were an oddly bloodless bunch, for conjurers, but spoke well and seemed to understand salary caps. They lectured us on the constraints of a small market, failed, and left. Somehow, misfortune always found a roster spot.
Contrast them with Bill Veeck, who owned the '48 Indians. Veeck was a peg-legged Barnum and a brazen hustler: as a game-day promotion, he once gave away ice. When a proposed trade of a popular player brought out peasants with pitchforks, Veeck squashed the deal. Then, the story goes, Veeck went across town from watering hole to watering hole, apologizing. Imagine that.
To watch the Cavaliers' brain trust explain Scott's firing is to be entertained by sock puppets.
The children will be spared. It's becoming harder to pass down that homegrown pain. Satellite dishes, streaming Internet -- the young live vicariously in a world that technology creates, down the block but far from any sense of disloyalty or shame. They wear Yankees caps and Cowboys jerseys. That splayed-leg figure dunking on their hoodies isn't Luke Witte. We grown-ups take victory, like work, wherever we find it. I, for one, sleep well in the knowledge that my car will never be overturned in a championship celebration.
Mojo or moxie: when the factories left, we lost more than a manufacturing base; we lost our strut. Which makes us not that different from you. Vexed by Washington gridlock or a stalled economy? Had the best-laid plans of wizards crash around your ears? It doesn't matter where you were born: you are here. ''Ich bin ein Clevelander.''
And yet.
The first pitch of spring slaps leather, the Indians hang around first place in May, and sports again becomes something beyond a balance sheet. A kickoff sails high into the autumn air, and for a moment, anything's possible. This year will be different. And for a few hours, you hardly notice the days of your life piling up at your feet.
The local consensus regarding Haslam: wait and see. I hope he has a little of Veeck about him, or a good lawyer. Winning would fix everything. For some, any championship would be like the Rapture. I don't shop that aisle. Oh, various talking heads will tote metaphorical lunch pails for a while, and the adjective ''long-suffering'' will be worn transparent. Then we will go back to work.
A truck yard on a spring night is the greatest place on earth. It's the last few minutes of that lunch break, and the shop radio is pulling in the final inning of an Indians road game, the signal fading in and out, each pitch bouncing off the moon. We chew on Haslam's woes for a while, then weigh in on whether a certain Heat player (not Cole) will ever return. The conversation drifts, as conversations will, to South Beach and to warm oceans, and to the fortune floating in said oceans.
My co-worker Ray trails dreadlocks, speaks fluent Bob Marley and always surprises. Ray is a cabbage wizard, and if there's a rarer bird than a Rastafarian who cooks Bavarian, I haven't found one. Ray read somewhere that whale vomit, or ambergris, is more precious than gold. He proposes to get a boat and fetch that treasure. Someday. What he lacks is a crew.
I sign on. As a Cleveland sports fan, I know I will not be busy during the playoffs. Any playoffs. As for that other Heat player -- the one who took his talents to South Beach: he'll be back. Terry the Driver's adult daughter moved back home recently, a victim of a tough economy.
''They always come home,'' Terry says.
And then we go back to work.

HEADLINE: Young Americans Lead Trend to Less Driving

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Dan Mauney keeps misplacing his car.
Mr. Mauney, 42, lives in an apartment tower in this city's Uptown neighborhood, a pedestrian-friendly quarter with new office buildings, sparkling museums and ambitious restaurants. He so seldom needs to drive that when he does go to retrieve his car in his building's garage, he said, ''I always forget where I parked it.''
Charlotte and other American cities have not abandoned their cars or their sprawling growth. But people like Mr. Mauney are part of the reason that American driving patterns have downshifted -- perhaps for years to come.
For six decades, Americans have tended to drive more every year. But in the middle of the last decade, the number of miles driven -- both over all and per capita -- began to drop, notes a report to be published on Tuesday by U.S. Pirg, a nonprofit advocacy organization. 
People tend to drive less during recessions, since fewer people are working (and commuting), and most are looking for ways to save money. But Phineas Baxandall, an author of the report and senior analyst for U.S. Pirg, said the changes preceded the recent recession and appeared to be part of a structural shift that is largely rooted in changing demographics, especially the rise of so-called millennials -- today's teenagers and twentysomethings. ''Millennials aren't driving cars,'' he said.
In fact, younger people are less likely to drive -- or even to have driver's licenses -- than past generations for whom driving was a birthright and the open road a symbol of freedom. Research by Michael Sivak of the Transportation Research Institute at the University of Michigan found that young people are getting driver's licenses in smaller numbers than previous generations.
Online life might have something to do with the change, he suggested. ''A higher proportion of Internet users was associated with a lower licensure rate,'' he wrote in a recent study. ''This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that access to virtual contact reduces the need for actual contact among young people.''
Baby boomers, too, are aging out of the daily work force and need to commute less. If the decline continues, the U.S. Pirg report states, driving could remain below its 2007 peak through 2040, even though the population is expected to grow by 21 percent.
If Jacob Curtis is any indication, the change in driving habits should be with us for some time to come. Mr. Curtis, 29, moved to Charlotte in recent months to take a job as a cameraman at a local television station, and was pleased to find a home close to rail and bus lines, and that he could ride his bike to the office along a no-traffic greenway. He can shower when he gets to work, and drives to assignments in one of the station's vans.
During his off hours, he finds Charlotte easy to navigate thanks to his smartphone, which helps him plot routes that blend biking and mass transit options. ''You don't have a lot to figure out,'' he said. ''We all have navigators in our pockets.''
Ted Boyd, whose job involves helping develop the city's South End into a Brooklynesque neighborhood -- Mr. Mauney is opening two stores there, one to sell women's shoes and another men's underwear -- often rides the bus to work. He decided to drive less after a trip to New York, with its extensive options for mass transit, but admits ''it's a little trickier in Charlotte.'' Office wear still stands out on the city buses, and ''you get some interesting looks sometimes,'' he said, that seem to assume an unpleasant reason for why he isn't behind the wheel: ''Is this a D.U.I.?''
Charlotte, whose success as a financial center has helped its population grow toward 800,000, takes transit seriously, said David Howard, a member of the City Council and chairman of its transportation and planning committee. The city tries to channel growth into manageable areas, he said, by filling in the urban core with new development and encouraging new construction along major transportation corridors, including an expanding rail line. ''It didn't happen by mistake,'' he said.
The rail line was projected to reach a ridership of 12,000 people within 7 to 10 years; it hit that level in the first month and a half, he said. President Obama has nominated the city's mayor, Anthony R. Foxx, to be the next transportation secretary.
The drop-off in driving is already having wide-reaching effects across the country. It means that gasoline taxes, which help finance transportation investment, are bringing in less revenue. The U.S. Pirg report suggests that the nation's shift in driving trends calls for a change in the things the nation spends that money on. ''When dollars are so scarce, we need to be sure we're not building highways that aren't really needed -- especially if doing so means neglecting repairs of existing highways, and neglecting to build transit projects when transit ridership is soaring,'' Mr. Baxandall said
Kenneth Orski, a transportation consultant, offered a skeptical view of the permanence of the driving trend. ''When twentysomethings get older and start having kids, they move to the more affordable suburbs in search of more space and better schools -- and start driving,'' he said.
Robert W. Poole Jr., director of transportation policy for the Reason Foundation, a libertarian research organization, also viewed the new report with a measure of incredulity, calling its conclusions ''exaggerated.''
Young people have been slow to buy cars, he said, in part because of ''the very large degree of youth unemployment and underemployment,'' a situation that might change with an improving economy. He added that the emergence of self-driving vehicles ''may re-empower elderly people to continue using cars far into their last years,'' offsetting any potential decline from younger adults.
Arguments about the future of transportation will continue as the demographics and economics play out. But at the moment, Mr. Curtis had a more pressing problem. He was showing off his bright red Diamondback bicycle to a visitor and suddenly said, ''Whoa -- a flat!'' A construction nail had pierced the tire, a common problem in the booming city. In an earlier time, it would have meant an irksome trip home. But not in Charlotte.
''Guess I'll take the bus,'' he said.
He walked the bike to the city's transit center, and chained it onto one of the racks that can be found on every bus in Charlotte and many other cities. The digital route readout repeated the same message over and over: ''Route 9-S Central Avenue to Sav-A-Lot.''

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Rise Slightly, Lifting Hope For Rebound

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- After dropping in March, retail sales unexpectedly eked out a 0.1 percent gain in April, pointing to underlying strength in the economy and leading forecasters to raise estimates of second-quarter growth. 
The gain in retail sales, which account for about 30 percent of consumer spending, was the latest sign of resilience in an economy that has been hit by belt-tightening in Washington as the government tries to cut the budget deficit.
''It's more indication that our economy is growing,'' said Thomas Hall, an economics professor at Miami University's Farmer School of Business in Oxford, Ohio. ''It's not growing as rapidly as a lot of people would like, but things are improving.''
Retail sales rose after a 0.5 percent drop in March as consumers bought cars, building materials and a variety of other goods, the Commerce Department said on Monday. Economists had expected a decrease of 0.3 percent.
Core sales, which exclude automobiles, gasoline and building materials, were up 0.5 percent after an upwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in March. Core sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of the government's tally of gross domestic product. February core sales also were revised higher.
On the heels of data showing relatively sturdy job growth in the last three months, the increase in core sales helped to allay fears of an abrupt economic slowdown. Several economists raised second-quarter growth estimates based on the fairly strong number. Goldman Sachs lifted its forecast by three-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.1 percent annual rate, while JPMorgan raised its estimate by half a point to 2 percent.
The Commerce Department also reported, however, that business inventories in March were flat for a second consecutive month, suggesting that restocking was probably not as big an addition to growth in the first three months of the year as initially thought. But the lack of inventory accumulation could add to second-quarter growth as businesses are likely to restock to meet steady demand.
Growth is being limited by the end of a 2 percent payroll tax cut and higher tax rates on large incomes, which began on Jan. 1. Widespread government spending cuts worth $85 billion also are weighing on consumption.
But gasoline prices, which fell 14 cents in April, helped to offset the drag on household income, freeing money for discretionary spending.
Economists also said the Federal Reserve's campaign to keep interest rates low was helping households, in part by raising stock prices and home values.
''Those who doubt that the Federal Reserve is making an impact just need to look at debt restructuring and wealth effects on spending,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. ''There is no way the consumer would be holding up so well without the support of lower interest rates.''
The components of the retail sales report were mostly firm. Receipts at auto dealerships rose 1 percent after falling 0.6 percent in March. Though falling gas prices reduced receipts at gas stations, sales excluding gasoline had their largest increase since December. Without gas and autos, sales rose 0.6 percent.

HEADLINE: Forging Its Own Path, British Hedge Fund Finds Success

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ALDEN

 BODY:
Ewan M. Kirk never quite fit the Wall Street mold.
As a partner at Goldman Sachs, he wore a kilt to the firm's annual black-tie dinner in New York. After leaving Goldman, Mr. Kirk, an astrophysicist by training, set up a hedge fund in Cambridge, England, a world away from the fashionable neighborhood of Mayfair in London where many hedge funds are based.
But Mr. Kirk's firm, Cantab Capital Partners, has been turning heads recently in London and New York with a new fund that aggressively undercuts its competitors on fees. The fund, which uses computer models to trade on trends in markets around the world, opened to outside investors in the first quarter and grew to more than $600 million by the beginning of April.
Unlike rival funds, in which the price of investing is often 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of profits, Cantab charges a 0.5 percent fee and 10 percent of profits for its new fund. That structure has generated buzz in Mayfair at a time when lackluster returns have some big investors wondering whether hedge funds are worth the expense. 
''They've lowered the fees to a point that not everybody can afford to do,'' said Phillip G. Chapple, an executive director at KB Associates, a consulting firm that advises London hedge funds. ''It's quite scary.''
Cantab is not the only fund to lower its fees. Since the financial crisis, some other hedge funds have also moved to lower the cost of investing. The Children's Investment Fund, which is based in London, charges performance fees of 15 percent to 16.5 percent, with hurdles that must be cleared before fees are paid, according to a person close to the fund. Two funds run by Renaissance Technologies, in East Setauket, N.Y., have performance fees of 10 percent, a person close to the firm said.
About 11 percent of hedge funds in Europe charge performance fees less than 20 percent, compared with 5.7 percent of hedge funds in the United States, according to Hedge Fund Intelligence.
To Mr. Kirk, 52, who founded Cantab in 2006 with Erich Schlaikjer, a colleague from Goldman, the new product is a logical outgrowth of his primary investing strategy. With the technological infrastructure in place, it was relatively inexpensive for Cantab to introduce the new program, which takes a more conservative approach with lower volatility.
That technology puts Cantab -- a relatively small firm with about 40 employees and $5.3 billion under management -- in a position to shake up the market.
''Do I think that another random hedge fund is going to suddenly decide to cut their fees to a half and 10? No, I don't,'' Mr. Kirk said. ''That would effectively destroy their business model.''
Run by scientists and mathematicians with ties to the nearby University of Cambridge, Cantab fosters an eccentric laboratory atmosphere. Certain devices, like a 3-D printer and a rice cooker powered by a neural network, are in the office simply to amuse the employees.
A technophile, Mr. Kirk claims to have no view on the political and economic dramas that obsess some money managers. Even his Friday lunch order is steeped in science: the office uses an algorithm to determine what type of food to buy.
But almost despite himself, Mr. Kirk is gaining recognition as a financier. Last year, Cantab's flagship fund returned 15.3 percent when comparable funds in London suffered losses. In 2008, with the financial crisis gathering, Cantab returned 48.7 percent.
Though the firm's record is mixed -- it lost 9.2 percent in 2009 -- it has attracted billions of dollars to manage, growing from just $30 million. Last November, with investors clamoring to get in, Cantab determined it had reached capacity and shut the doors on its fund.
As if to signal his arrival among the Mayfair elite, Mr. Kirk made his debut in April on a ranking of the wealthiest hedge fund managers in Britain published by The Sunday Times, which estimated his net worth at £280 million, or $433.3 million.
Born in Swindon, England, and brought up in Glasgow, Mr. Kirk did not set out to work in finance. He developed a model of gravitational radiation for his Ph.D at the University of Southampton and started a career in computer systems design. When he landed at Goldman in 1992, he devoured books on futures and options to get himself up to speed.
''I couldn't balance my own checkbook,'' he told an audience of Ph.D mathematics students at the University of Cambridge several years ago.
But Mr. Kirk learned finance quickly, rising to become the head of the strategies group in Europe, where he oversaw Goldman's quantitative technology.
''Ewan was known to be very -- at Goldman, we used the term 'commercial,' '' said Jay S. Dweck, a former head of equities strategies at Goldman, who was in Mr. Kirk's partnership class. ''He was good at generating profit for the business.''
Mr. Kirk's success helped him secure a deal on his departure to pay for continued access to Goldman's in-house software -- what Mr. Dweck called the ''magic that every firm wanted to try to reproduce.''
That deal, according to Mr. Dweck, who was involved in the negotiations, was ''unique.'' A spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment.
Cantab said in a letter to investors in December that it had been making progress in developing its own information-technology infrastructure. As part of that transition, the hedge fund revised its deal with Goldman last year; instead of fees, Goldman now has a small ownership stake in Cantab.
As the only prominent hedge fund in a region dominated by technology companies, Cantab can make a unique pitch to university students who might not have considered finance as a career. One such hire, Tom Howat, now a partner at the firm, hurried to finish his Ph.D in mathematical biology so he could join Cantab on its first day.
During the job interview in a local pub, Mr. Kirk described Cantab as a ''start-up technology company that happens to apply itself to finance,'' Mr. Howat, 31, recalled in a recent essay.
That entrepreneurial spirit means Cantab can have some fun. Last year, in the Cambridge Dragon Boat Festival, a race on the River Cam, the team from Cantab finished second in the mixed division.
The team also won best dressed, outfitted in the style of Noah's Ark with zebra, giraffe and meerkat costumes.
Such self-expression wasn't part of the culture at Goldman, as Mr. Kirk learned the hard way.
He wore the kilt only once, ''given the slightly strange looks I got turning up at a fancy New York partners' dinner wearing a dress,'' he recalled. ''It certainly created a little bit of a stir.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Hands Across the Melting Ice

BYLINE: By JAMES F. COLLINS, ROSS A. VIRGINIA and KENNETH YALOWITZ

 BODY:
With global warming rapidly melting Arctic sea ice and glaciers making valuable stores of energy and minerals more accessible, voices of doom are warning of inevitable competition and potential conflict -- a new ''Great Game'' among the five Arctic coastal nations.
In fact, the Arctic states of North America, Europe and Russia, working with indigenous peoples and a number of non-Arctic states, already have taken steps to ensure just the opposite: that the Arctic remains a zone of cooperation, peace and stable, sustainable development. 
The Arctic Council -- the intergovernmental organization for the eight Arctic states: Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States -- has created a forum for cooperation and momentum toward a responsible approach to the region's issues.
However, on Wednesday a ministerial meeting of the council in Sweden will face urgent issues dealing with the environment, shipping and governance.
In anticipation of this meeting, more than 40 leading Arctic scholars, government officials, industry leaders and representatives for indigenous peoples met in Washington in February under the auspices of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Dartmouth College, the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the University of the Arctic to examine issues facing the region -- Arctic energy, health, commercial shipping, security and governance -- and to make recommendations for action to the Arctic Council.
Arctic energy and mineral riches eventually will be developed, but harsh weather conditions will persist and fluctuating world prices will make the timing of development uncertain.
The shale gas revolution is already delaying some Arctic energy projects. Arctic shipping, although increasing as seasonal sea ice declines, will remain largely regional, dedicated to the transport of Arctic energy and mineral resources and the supply of local populations and industry. Difficult sea ice conditions and the consequent unpredictability of shipping schedules will severely limit interest in developing trans-Arctic Ocean container shipping.
The Arctic states have addressed potentially divisive issues in an orderly manner, and the prospects for resolving issues in the region by force are presently slight. The most accessible Arctic oil and gas resources are located within state borders or the universally agreed upon 200-nautical-mile Exclusive Economic Zone of the coastal states and thus not subject to dispute.
The Arctic coastal states are pursuing claims for territorial shelf extension beyond 200 miles for exclusive access to additional oil and gas reserves, but they have agreed their differences will be settled under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and through diplomatic channels.
The Arctic Council is in a unique position to strengthen this trend. The United States can help greatly by ratifying the Law of the Sea Convention, giving more policy level attention to U.S. interests in the Arctic and using the U.S. chairmanship of the council, beginning in 2015, to build on the work the council has done.
In 2011, a binding search-and-rescue accord was reached by the Arctic Council. The upcoming ministerial meeting is an opportunity to strengthen the security and wellbeing of the region. This can be accomplished by encouraging cooperation of the region's militaries and coast guards in emergency/disaster response, providing better situational awareness for Arctic Ocean shipping safety and prevention of illegal activities, and the establishment of a forum to share maritime information.
The ministerial meeting should also urge the International Maritime Organization to adopt a mandatory polar code for ships operating in polar waters, and regulations for safe operations of cruise ships; establish an Arctic economic forum to promote public/private partnerships and help resolve issues such as environmental pollution; establish a clearinghouse for public and private data on oil spill preparedness, prevention and remediation; and provide more capacity for indigenous peoples and their organizations to research and develop a health care system consonant with their culture.
One key governance issue facing the ministerial council is the requests from several non-Arctic states and the European Union to become permanent Arctic Council observers. Bringing them in would open up council proceedings and underscore that many Arctic issues, such as environmental pollutants, are global in nature.
At the same time, there would be little benefit to Arctic governance from making the council a formal international organization; nor is there a perceived need for a comprehensive Arctic treaty.
Dangerous conflict in the region over valuable resources remains a remote possibility, but the council must take constructive steps to ensure that the Arctic continues to develop as a venue for cooperation among Russia and the Arctic states of Europe and North America.

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and MELISSA EDDY

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Record youth unemployment is emerging as the most urgent problem in the euro zone, if the political rhetoric of recent days is any measure. But leaders are struggling to come up with effective ways to prevent jobless young people in countries like Spain and Greece from becoming a lost generation and source of social upheaval.
One proposal, floated in a German news report Monday, would use a development bank owned by the European Union to funnel credit to companies that create jobs for young people in the euro zone, nearly a quarter of whom are without jobs. 
Officials in Berlin quickly played down the report published in the online version of the Rheinische Post newspaper, based in Düsseldorf. But it is clear that policy makers are seriously worried that millions of frustrated young job seekers pose as much of a threat to the euro zone as excessive government debt or weak banks. The issue is likely to come up when finance and economy ministers of the 17 euro zone countries meet Tuesday in Brussels.
Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, considers youth unemployment to be Europe's biggest challenge, her spokesman said Monday.
''The issue is on the agenda of every European meeting, whether at the ministerial level or among leaders,'' Steffen Seibert, Ms. Merkel's spokesman, said in Berlin.
Mr. Seibert's comments came a few days after Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, warned that youth joblessness could undermine faith in European institutions.
''We will have to speed up in fighting youth unemployment, because otherwise we will lose the support, in a democratic way, in some populations of the European Union,'' Mr. Schäuble said, shortly before meeting with his counterparts from the United States and other Group of 7 countries last weekend.
And Louis Gallois, former head of European Aeronautic Defense & Space and the French government's commissioner for investment, told a gathering at the German Finance Ministry in Berlin that more investment should be directed toward getting people back to work, if the European project was to succeed.
''Support to Europe is more and more limited because Europe is seen more and more by European citizens only as a constraint,'' Mr. Gallois said.
There is little doubt that youth unemployment is a grave problem in Europe, a result not only of weak economic growth but also of inflexible labor regulations that make it hard for newcomers to break into the work force. ''If people don't work for several years after graduation it affects their whole lives,'' said Zsolt Darvas, a research fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels.
The jobless rate among Europeans aged 15 through 24 in the euro area was 24 percent in March, according to official figures, up from 22.5 percent a year earlier. In Greece, 59 percent of young people are unemployed, while in Spain 56 percent of youths are without work. Portugal and Italy also have extremely high youth unemployment rates, in both cases above 38 percent, according to Eurostat, the E.U. statistics agency.
Youth unemployment is much lower in Germany and Austria, in both cases 7.6 percent, though still substantially higher than the overall jobless rates. The relatively low rates of youth joblessness reflect those countries' stronger economies, as well as a long-established apprenticeship system that combines secondary school classroom education with on-the-job training at private companies. There is talk of exporting the apprenticeship systems to other countries.
But leaders in Germany and Austria are also acutely sensitive to the dangers to society posed by mass unemployment, which was a major factor in the rise of the Nazis in the 1930s. There may be more political support in Germany to grant aid earmarked for programs that would help jobless youth than there is for extending further financial support to governments in Italy or Greece that many Germans consider unreliable and unstable.
Jens Flosdorff, a spokesman for Ursula von der Leyen, the German labor minister, said that European officials were considering a raft of different programs, including some that would involve credits for companies to help them hire more young people.
The Rheinische Post on Monday described the program as a ''New Deal'' for jobless youth, saying it would use the European Investment Bank to grant the credits. Mr. Flosdorff portrayed it in more modest terms, saying it was among a number of proposals that could be discussed by Ms. Von der Leyen and other top European leaders at a conference in Paris May 28. The conference is being organized by the Berggruen Institute, funded by Nicolas Berggruen, a wealthy investor.
''Many ideas are being discussed at the moment,'' Mr. Flosdorff said.
A spokesman for the European Investment Bank in Luxembourg declined to comment.
The sums being floated -- about &#x20ac;6 billion, or $7.8 billion -- are not likely to make a huge dent in unemployment among young people, though. ''It is a practical, technical question of how this money can be used most effectively, so that it really makes a difference for those who need it most,'' Mr. Seibert, the spokesman for Ms. Merkel, said.
But Mr. Darvas of Bruegel said a program of that size was unlikely to have much impact. ''These schemes can be helpful,'' he said. ''But the amount of money is very small compared to the magnitude of the problem.''
It is unlikely, in any case, that money alone would solve the problem.
Ultimately, the best thing that could happen for jobless young people is for the overall euro zone economy to break out of recession. When economies recover, youth unemployment tends to fall more quickly than the overall unemployment rate because young people are cheaper and more flexible than older workers.
''If there is no economic growth, we shouldn't expect any major improvement in employment in general or youth unemployment,'' Mr. Darvas said.
Melissa Eddy reported from Berlin. David Jolly and Nicola Clark contributed reporting from Paris.

HEADLINE: After Vote In Pakistan, Some Hope In India

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS; Hari Kumar contributed reporting.

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- The bitter and sometimes violent rivalry between India and Pakistan shows no signs of abating, but many in New Delhi greeted Sunday's election results in Pakistan with measured optimism on Monday.
Nawaz Sharif, who is poised to become the next prime minister of Pakistan, has often said he would like to improve ties with India. Indians who closely follow diplomatic developments believe that Mr. Sharif will have to reach out to his giant neighbor if he hopes to turn Pakistan's moribund economy around and improve vital services like electricity generation.
But analysts in India disagree about whether Pakistan's powerful military and intelligence services are likely to allow Mr. Sharif to make lasting peace with India. K.C. Singh, a former counterterrorism coordinator and former Indian ambassador to Iran, said the greatest danger to progress may lie in Mr. Sharif's making an overture before he has a solid hold on his country's powerful security infrastructure. 
''The risk is that he will go too fast, and the military will undertake a strike against India and set everything back,'' Mr. Singh said. ''Sharif has a lot of work to do before he can fundamentally change the relationship with India.''
Lalit Mansingh, a former Indian foreign secretary and former ambassador to the United States, said he was pleased with Mr. Sharif's victory, even though he did not expect any rapid changes. ''Looking at the range of candidates in Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif was definitely our best bet,'' he said.
Relations between India and Pakistan nose-dived after a militant group based in Pakistan carried out terrorist attacks in Mumbai in 2008, killing 164 people. Pakistan initially denied that any of its citizens had taken part in the attacks, and the country has done little to prosecute those who helped plan it. A result has been a long cold spell with India.
But Pakistan's growing problems with its militant groups, including the Taliban, suggest to many in India that the sword Pakistan had hoped to use against India now threatens Pakistan as well. The hope here is that Pakistani leaders will conclude that all terrorist groups must be eliminated, even those whose mission is to attack India.
''I'm guardedly optimistic,'' said Gopalaswami Parthasarathy, a former Indian ambassador to Pakistan.
Mr. Parthasarathy said that neither government had had the will or the credibility to attempt an ambitious reset of relations. India's government is hindered by corruption scandals and a slowing economy, while Mr. Sharif faces the need to tame his generals, he said. Even so, incremental progress is possible on economic cooperation, eased visa restrictions and some power deals, he said.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India congratulated Mr. Sharif on his victory Sunday. ''The people of India also welcome your publicly articulated commitment to a relationship between India and Pakistan that is defined by peace, friendship and cooperation,'' he wrote.
An editorial in The Hindustan Times on Monday stated that ''India has genuine reason to be pleased'' with the results of Pakistan's election.
''India should not expect a Kashmir settlement or the arrest of Hafiz Saeed in a few months' time,'' the editorial stated, referring to a leader of a militant group linked to multiple terrorist attacks in India. ''What it can hope for is a government,'' it continued, ''that will understand that cutting dependence on the United States and China is only possible if Pakistan has a modus vivendi with India.''
Still, some in India were dismissive of the idea that Mr. Sharif or any elected politician in Pakistan could change the decades of animosity between the nuclear-armed neighbors.
''I've always believed it's ultimately the generals who decide on Pakistan's security policies,'' said Vivek Katju, a former Indian ambassador to Afghanistan. ''And they have not changed.''

HEADLINE: A Breather for a Day, as Health Care Stocks Do the Heavy Lifting

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks changed little on Monday, pausing after hitting highs last week, though strength in health care shares helped keep declines in check.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 26.81 points, or 0.18 percent, at 15,091.68. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was very slightly up, by 0.07 point, at 1,633.77. The Nasdaq composite index was up 2.21 points, or 0.06 percent, at 3,438.79.
The S.& P. 500 health care sector climbed 0.7 percent and was the day's best performer. 
Shares of the biopharmaceutical company Theravance jumped 17.9 percent, to $41.20, after the Irish drugmaker Elan agreed to a $1 billion deal to buy 21 percent of the royalties that Theravance receives from GlaxoSmithKline for its respiratory drugs.
Other big health sector gainers included Pfizer, up 2.3 percent, at $29.37; Gilead, up 3.1 percent, at $54.47; and Biogen Idec, up 4.5 percent, at $222.74. The day's flat close came after a third straight week of gains on the major indexes, with both the Dow and S.& P. 500 setting record closing highs last week. The S.& P. 500 remains up 14.5 percent for the year so far.
While some analysts argue the long-term trend is still higher, many see momentum for stocks waning in the near term without more positive catalysts. Trading volume has been lighter than average, and volatility has been low in recent days.
''Intraday volatility has essentially been nonexistent. I think it means people are really sitting on the sidelines right now seeing which way it's going to go,'' said Uri Landesman, president of Platinum Partners in New York. He expects the rally to top out in the next two weeks.
The CBOE Volatility index, or VIX, a measure of market expectations and stability, ended down 0.3 percent.
Among the day's declining issues, the fast-food chain operator Yum Brands fell 2 percent, to $68.92. After the market closed on Friday, Yum posted a steep decline in April sales in China.
Retail sales rose 0.1 percent in April, better than the 0.3 percent drop that had been expected and a return to growth after a decline in March, which helped buoy markets on Monday. Excluding autos, gasoline and building materials, core sales rose 0.5 percent. Retail sales account for about 30 percent of American consumer spending.
Investors are at odds over whether positive economic data can help the market rise further, or whether it will spell the end of the Federal Reserve's monetary stimulus, which could derail the rally, said Joseph S. Tanious, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds.
Other economic data released on Monday showed business inventories were unchanged in March for a second straight month, versus expectations of a 0.3 percent rise, suggesting that restocking could help second-quarter economic growth.
Earnings have been mostly better than expected. With 90 percent of the S.& P. 500 having reported, 67.2 percent of companies topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. Only 46.9 percent have beaten revenue expectations, below the 52 percent average over the last four quarters.
Shares of the Israeli Internet company Perion Network listed in the United States surged 10.6 percent, to $13.94, after it posted quarterly earnings.
Volume was roughly 5.3 billion shares traded on the New York markets, well below the average daily closing volume of about 6.4 billion this year.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 5/32 to 98 16/32, pushing the yield up to 1.92, from 1.90 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Sharif vs. Army, Round 3

BYLINE: By DECLAN WALSH

 BODY:
LONDON -- The last time that Nawaz Sharif had close dealings with the Pakistani Army, soldiers handcuffed him and imprisoned him in an ancient fort overlooking the Indus River, physically dragging him from office in a coup.
Now that Mr. Sharif is poised to return as prime minister of Pakistan for the third time in 20 years, the success of his relationship with the generals will revolve around two related questions: Has he changed? And have they?
Many analysts believe he has new tools at his disposal, and in recent days he has played down the prospect of conflict with the army. Much of the hopeful talk surrounding his landslide victory on Saturday is focused on how Mr. Sharif seems different -- more mellow, less authoritarian -- than during his two previous stints as prime minister in the 1990s. And he returns to power with a mandate from Pakistani voters who have apparently given his party a near outright majority in Parliament. 
When the military deposed him in 1999, he had earned the displeasure of its leadership for his outreach to India -- which this week he promised to renew -- as well as his clumsy attempt to fire the army chief, Gen. Pervez Musharraf. Since then, the military has faced several humiliations, including the American commando raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, that have hurt its public image. And under Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the army has shown little public appetite for openly meddling in politics, much less mounting another coup.
Against that backdrop, the success -- and perhaps length -- of Mr. Sharif's tenure will be determined by how he negotiates the relationship with Pakistan's unelected power players. They include the United States, an ally with whom he has a long and sometimes unhappy history and that has worried about his vigor in fighting Islamist militants. There is a newly crusading judiciary to gauge. And above all loom the generals, and his tense history with them.
His career was midwifed in the mid-1980s by Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, the military dictator, then cut short by the 1999 coup that brought General Musharraf to power. Mr. Sharif spent years in exile in Saudi Arabia.
Bitterness from that painful episode was widely believed to have colored Mr. Sharif's attitude to the army after he returned to Pakistan in 2007. For a time, he regularly hurled rhetorical broadsides at the military that made even members of his own party, who are pro-military by inclination, uncomfortable.
In recent months, Mr. Sharif has adopted a more conciliatory tone. On Monday, he glossed over any differences, telling reporters that his problem had been with General Musharraf's coup, not with the military as a whole.
''I think the rest of the army resented Mr. Musharraf's decision,'' he said. ''So I don't hold the rest of the army responsible for that.''
Still, there are hints that Mr. Sharif will insist on asserting his authority in ways that could put the generals on edge. In interviews with the Indian news media in recent days, Mr. Sharif stressed his desire to normalize relations with New Delhi -- a subject that the army, which has fought three major wars with India -- views as its central concern.
''Those statements might seem normal to outsiders,'' said Cyril Almeida of Dawn, a leading English-language newspaper in Pakistan. ''But inside the army it could set alarm bells ringing.''
On a different front, the country's newly assertive Supreme Court also presents Mr. Sharif with a challenge, and perhaps some opportunity.
The previous government found itself embroiled in legal battles with the buccaneering chief justice, Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, who conducted his longstanding rivalry with President Asif Ali Zardari and his Pakistan Peoples Party through a series of high-profile court cases.
At the same time, judges have been relatively lenient with Mr. Sharif. Cases related to bank loans that his family defaulted on in the 1990s, and payments that Mr. Sharif received from military intelligence about the same time, all received relatively light treatment.
''The Supreme Court only had one eye, and it was trained on the Peoples Party,'' said Ayaz Amir, a former lawmaker from Mr. Sharif's party.
But now that he is in power, Mr. Sharif's cozy relationship with the courts could come under strain. Under Justice Chaudhry, the courts have amassed new powers, hauling senior government officials before judges to account for their failings on matters ranging from blatant corruption to the weaknesses of the traffic system.
Analysts say Mr. Sharif, who also has a stubborn streak, could find himself drawn into a clash with Justice Chaudhry.
''Sharif might look at this court and find it a bit too activist for his liking, with its tendency to push government up against the wall,'' said Mr. Almeida, the journalist. ''I don't think he would look on it very benignly.''
Still, the potential for conflict may be limited: Justice Chaudhry is set to retire in December, which leaves relatively little time for a battle between the courts and Mr. Sharif.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Sharif played to populist sentiment by condemning C.I.A. drone strikes in the tribal belt and suggesting, in vague terms, that he would seek to avoid bowing to American dictates. But the perilous state of Pakistan's economy means that he may require American support for a bailout by the International Monetary Fund -- one that economists believe will be necessary in the coming months.
Behind the scenes, American diplomats are likely to pressure him for stronger action against militants. Mr. Sharif was measured in the campaign in his criticism of the Taliban, which notably did not attack his party's election events as they did those of more secular parties. Indeed, the perception that Mr. Sharif had an ambiguous view, at best, toward militants was a constant source of tension with American officials during his first stints in office.
Mr. Sharif may now come under pressure -- from the army as well as the United States -- to clamp down on militant havens in his home province of Punjab, parts of which have become hotbeds of sectarian violence led by Sunni extremist groups.
But in foreign policy, Mr. Sharif has another source of support: his close relationship with Saudi Arabia, where he whiled away his exile. King Abdullah helped broker Mr. Sharif's return to Pakistan in 2007, and Mr. Sharif maintains close ties with Riyadh. That relationship, although discreet, could provide an alternative source of economic aid, as well as a powerful ally.
As Mr. Sharif welcomed foreign reporters on Monday to his palatial home outside Lahore, replete with stuffed lions and gilded furniture, he spoke with the confidence of a leader holding crucial cards.
A measure of that confidence, and a test of his intent, are close at hand.
His old nemesis, General Musharraf, is under house arrest at his villa outside Islamabad over several judicial prosecutions. The Supreme Court has decreed that Mr. Sharif's administration will have to decide whether the former army ruler should face treason charges, which carry a possible death penalty.
A steel baron by background, and conservative by inclination, Mr. Sharif has long had a reputation as a man who does not forgive or forget. The Musharraf case presents him with an obvious opportunity for revenge. But even critics say he has softened over the years, and is more likely to take a lenient approach in the interest of avoiding an unnecessary confrontation with the army.
''He's a more mature person now, less impulsive than before,'' Mr. Amir said. ''It would be very foolish to start settling scores. I think the Musharraf case will be a major test of that.''

HEADLINE: A Paternal Pull, Found Unexpectedly in Uganda

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
Here is the kind of life that Johnny O'Callaghan used to lead. When he broke up with his boyfriend (he came home to find him having sex with twins) he rushed to Chateau Marmont to get drunk, slept with an actress (''whose work I don't respect'') and woke up to find a Post-it that said, ''Gone to Pilates.'' End of relationship. 
But goodbye to all that. In the Irish Repertory Theater production of ''Who's Your Daddy?,'' Mr. O'Callaghan's seductive solo show in the theater's minuscule basement space, he agrees to accompany a female friend on a mission of mercy and documentary filmmaking to a Ugandan orphanage. Maybe, he theorizes, he will get lucky and be crushed by a rhino or something. As an unemployed actor whose dog just disappeared, he is feeling suicidal anyway.
Instead he falls in love at first hug with a 3-year-old African boy -- an AIDS orphan, he is told -- and spends the longest time finding a way to adopt him.
I didn't always care for Mr. O'Callaghan's onstage persona, which frequently dips into arrogance. And that has nothing to do with the fact that when he needed an audience member to illustrate his tendency to be attracted to the most screwed-up person in the room, he chose me. But it is impossible not to love his story.
If even half the narrative is true, this man went through hell to bring that little boy to his new life in America. And although it is a foregone conclusion that this effort will succeed, Mr. O'Callaghan's performance and Tom Ormeny's lively direction work up considerable suspense and occasional outrage. The Ugandan judge expressing his opinions with a single, repeated, indecipherable sound effect is memorable. When the American Embassy's printer breaks down, with only hours before father and son are due at the airport with the boy's new visa, it almost feels like the final minutes of ''Argo.''
And in the background is Mr. O'Callaghan's horrified family, including his chain-smoking Irish mother, who throws in her vote of support: ''I wouldn't give you a goldfish to look after.''
''Who's Your Daddy?'' continues through May 26 at the Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org.

HEADLINE: Ex-Hedge Fund Manager Sentenced in Insider Trading Case

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
During the sentencing of the former hedge fund manager Anthony Chiasson on Monday, Judge Richard J. Sullivan marveled at his prodigious wealth, ticking off the annual income listed on his tax returns. ''$16 million, $10 million, $23 million,'' he said.
''That's just staggering,'' the judge said. ''It's hard to imagine why someone would risk all that to engage in a crime like this.''
The crime is insider trading, and Judge Sullivan, of Federal District Court in Manhattan, handed down one of the stiffest sentences yet in the government's vast campaign to root out wrongdoing on Wall Street trading floors. He sentenced Mr. Chiasson, a founder of Level Global Investors, to six and a half years in prison after a jury found him guilty last December of illegally trading technology stocks.
''This kind of conduct can't go unpunished,'' Judge Sullivan said. 
Mr. Chiasson, 39, who did not address the court, was ordered to pay a $5 million fine and forfeit illegally obtained proceeds of as much as $2 million. He must report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 90 days.
His legal team, led by Reid H. Weingarten of Steptoe & Johnson and Gregory Morvillo of Morvillo Law, is appealing his conviction. They have brought on Mark F. Pomerantz, a lawyer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, to handle the appeal.
Mr. Chiasson was tried last year alongside Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management. The government accused them of being the two most-senior Wall Street traders in an eight-member ''criminal club'' that made $72 million in profits by trading shares of Dell Inc. and Nvidia based on corporate secrets obtained from inside those companies.
After a six-week trial, a jury convicted Mr. Chiasson and Mr. Newman. Earlier this month, Judge Sullivan sentenced Mr. Newman to four and a half years in prison.
The sentencing of Mr. Chiasson caps an ignominious end to a high-flying Wall Street career.
The youngest of four children, Mr. Chiasson grew up in Portland, Me., and pursued a career in finance after graduating from Babson College. In 1999, as a young technology industry analyst, Mr. Chiasson joined SAC Capital Advisors, the giant hedge fund owned by the billionaire stock picker Steven A. Cohen. Working under David Ganek, one of Mr. Cohen's star traders, Mr. Chiasson made a name for himself by making a large, negative bet against Internet stocks just before the dot-com bubble burst.
He also met his wife, Sandra Janson, at SAC. Ms. Janson worked as an assistant controller at the fund, and according to a court filing, their relationship started when Mr. Chiasson wandered into her office and playfully complained about the candy selection in a dish she kept on her desk.
''The next time Anthony visited the accounting department, the dish contained tiny, single-serving boxes of Junior Mints -- Anthony's favorite candy,'' Mr. Chiasson's lawyers wrote. The couple lives in Manhattan with their young son and baby daughter, but they are moving to the suburbs.
''I'm so sorry for your family and I'm so sorry for your wife,'' Judge Sullivan said.
A decade ago, Mr. Chiasson left SAC along with Mr. Ganek to start Level Global Investors. The firm flourished, attracting marquee investors like Aetna and Cornell University. At it peak, the firm managed $4.2 billion and had 75 employees. In April 2010, Goldman Sachs bought a minority stake in the fund.
Just a few months later, Level Global's ascent came to a crashing halt when F.B.I. agents raided the firm's offices. The government investigation into Level Global came as part of an inquiry into hedge funds' use of expert network firms, which are research shops that connect money managers to public company employees.
Mr. Chiasson became ensnared in the case after a junior analyst at Level Global, Spyridon Adondakis, turned state's evidence. He told investigators -- and later testified at trial -- that he shared with Mr. Chiasson secret information gleaned from a source inside Dell.
Lawyers for Mr. Chiasson had some success in arguing that their client should receive a sentence shorter than the one recommended under federal guidelines, which was for as much as 10 years.
The guideline sentence was so stiff because the government said that Mr. Chiasson caused Level Global to earn about $40 million in profits as a result of the improper trades, and the profit amount primarily drives the guideline sentence. Mr. Chiasson's lawyers said that adhering to the guidelines ''would be as draconian as it would be unwarranted.''
Judge Sullivan, though, disparaged one aspect of the defense's argument that Mr. Chiasson should receive a lenient sentence because he lived an otherwise honorable life beside the crimes for which he was convicted -- an argument commonly made by insider trading defendants.
Mr. Morvillo described Mr. Chiasson as ''an extraordinary man,'' almost entirely focusing on his becoming a trustee at both his secondary school, Cheverus High School in Portland, Me., and alma mater, Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., at such a young age. After Mr. Morvillo suggested that those appointments had nothing to do with money and were a function of his character, Judge Sullivan cut him off.
''You think money had nothing to do with it?'' the judge asked, referring to the trusteeships. ''Do I have to suspend my disbelief this much?''
Mr. Chiasson's case is one of several insider trading prosecutions that have touched SAC, which has become a central target of the government's investigation. Prosecutors charged two former SAC employees with participating in the insider trading ring involving Mr. Chiasson. Jon Horvath, a former SAC technology stock analyst, has admitted being a part of the scheme. In March, Mr. Horvath's boss, Michael S. Steinberg, was indicted. He is fighting the charges and is scheduled to go on trial in November before Judge Sullivan.
Mr. Ganek was not charged as part of the case, either criminally or civilly. But he figured prominently at the trial because he executed some of the questionable Dell trades. Although Mr. Adondakis testified that he did not tell Mr. Ganek about the source inside Dell, Judge Sullivan deemed Mr. Ganek an unindicted co-conspirator in the case.
Federal prosecutors took an aggressive stance toward Mr. Ganek in their court papers connected to Mr. Chiasson's sentencing.
''The evidence demonstrated that Mr. Ganek was aware that Adondakis's information on Dell came from a source inside the company, and Ganek was a co-conspirator with Chiasson,'' prosecutors wrote. ''That evidence included a number of instant messages and e-mails between Ganek and others that indicated that Ganek was kept apprised of Adondakis's updates and the source of the information.''
John K. Carroll, a lawyer for Mr. Ganek at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, blasted the prosecutors' comments about his client.
''The government's conclusory statements about my client are unsubstantiated and unfair,'' Mr. Carroll said. ''It's particularly unfair that prosecutors continue to defame my client with patched-together innuendo when they well know that they have comprehensively investigated his conduct and concluded that no charges should be brought.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Poverty's Lasting Ills

BYLINE: By PERRI KLASS, M.D.

 BODY:
Poverty is an exam room familiar. From Bellevue Hospital in New York to the neighborhood health center in Boston where I used to work, poverty has filtered through many of my interactions with parents and their children.
I ask about sleeping arrangements. Mother, father, older child and new baby live in one bedroom that they're renting in an apartment, worrying that if the baby cries too much, they'll be asked to leave.
I encourage an overweight 9-year-old who loves karate, and his mother says, ''We had to stop; too expensive.'' I talk to a new mother who is going back to work too soon, leaving her baby with the cheapest sitter she can find. 
Is your housing situation secure? Can you afford groceries? Do you go with the cheapest fast food? Can you get the prescription filled? Raising children in poverty means that everything is more complicated.
Me, I'm one generation out. My mother will tell you about her Depression childhood, the social worker who checked the family's pots to see whether they were secretly able to afford meat, the landlord who put the furniture out on the street. It wasn't character-building or noble, she says. It was soul-destroying, grinding and cruel.
And it's even crueller, now that social mobility has decreased and children who grow up poor are more likely to stay poor.
At the annual meeting of the Pediatric Academic Societies last week, there was a new call for pediatricians to address childhood poverty as a national problem, rather than wrestling with its consequences case by case in the exam room.
Poverty damages children's dispositions and blunts their brains. We've seen articles about the language deficit in poorer homes and the gaps in school achievement. These remind us that -- more so than in my mother's generation -- poverty in this country is now likely to define many children's life trajectories in the harshest terms: poor academic achievement, high dropout rates, and health problems from obesity and diabetes to heart disease, substance abuse and mental illness.
Recently, there has been a lot of focus on the idea of toxic stress, in which a young child's body and brain may be damaged by too much exposure to so-called stress hormones, like cortisol and norepinephrine. When this level of stress is experienced at an early age, and without sufficient protection, it may actually reset the neurological and hormonal systems, permanently affecting children's brains and even, we are learning, their genes.
Toxic stress is the heavy hand of early poverty, scripting a child's life not in the Horatio Alger scenario of determination and drive, but in the patterns of disappointment and deprivation that shape a life of limitations.
At the meeting, my colleague Dr. Benard P. Dreyer, professor of pediatrics at New York University and a past president of the Academic Pediatric Association, called on pediatricians to take on poverty as a serious underlying threat to children's health. He was prompted, he told me later, by the widening disparities between rich and poor, and the gathering weight of evidence about the importance of early childhood, and the ways that deprivation and stress in the early years of life can reduce the chances of educational and life success.
''After the first three, four, five years of life, if you have neglected that child's brain development, you can't go back,'' he said. In the middle of the 20th century, our society made a decision to take care of the elderly, once the poorest demographic group in the United States. Now, with Medicare and Social Security, only 9 percent of older people live in poverty. Children are now our poorest group, with almost 25 percent of children under 5 living below the federal poverty level.
When Tony Blair became prime minister of Britain, amid growing socioeconomic disparities, he made it a national goal to cut child poverty in half in 10 years. It took a coalition of political support and a combination of measures that increased income, especially in families with young children (minimum wage, paid maternity and paternity leaves, tax credits), and better services -- especially universal preschool programs. By 2010, reducing child poverty had become a goal across the British political spectrum, and child poverty had fallen to 10.6 percent of children below the absolute poverty line (similar to the measure used in the United States), down from 26.1 percent in 1999.
''Poor families who benefited from the reform were able to spend more money on items for children: books and toys, children's clothing and footwear, fresh fruits and vegetables,'' said Jane Waldfogel, a professor of social work at Columbia who has studied the British war on childhood poverty.
Dr. Dreyer said: ''Income matters. You get people above the poverty level, and they actually are better parents. It's critical to get people out of poverty, but in addition our focus has to be on also giving families supports for other aspects of their lives -- parenting, interventions in primary care, universal preschool.''
At the Pediatric Academic Societies meeting, the most unexpected speaker -- to a room full of pediatricians -- was Robert H. Dugger, managing partner of Hanover Investment Group, who made the economic case for investing in young children. ''History shows that productivity increases when people are able to access their rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,'' Mr. Dugger told me. ''There is no economic recovery strategy stronger than committing to early childhood and K-through-12 investment.''
Think for a moment of poverty as a disease, thwarting growth and development, robbing children of the healthy, happy futures they might otherwise expect. In the exam room, we try to mitigate the pain and suffering that are its pernicious symptoms. But our patients' well-being depends on more, on public health measures and prevention that lift the darkness so all children can grow toward the light.

HEADLINE: Keynes and Keynesianism

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Rather than being for or against Keynesianism, policy makers should pragmatically try to respond to the most pressing economic issues, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
Before the recent brouhaha about John Maynard Keynes fades from memory, I'd like to make a few final comments about Keynesian economics.
When I began studying economics in the early 1970s, the term "Keynesian" was already losing its luster. In fact, one can date the precise moment when it became passé: Jan. 4, 1971. On that day, President Richard Nixon gave a joint interview to several television journalists. After the cameras were off, he made an offhand comment to Howard K. Smith of ABC News that he was "now a Keynesian in economics." The New York Times reported this statement in a brief article on Jan. 7, 1971. 
The article says Mr. Smith was taken aback by Nixon's statement, because Keynes was viewed as being well to the left, politically and economically, and Nixon was viewed as an arch-conservative. Mr. Smith said it was as if a Christian had said, "All things considered, I think Mohammad was right," referring to the prophet who founded Islam.
The Times's economics columnist Leonard Silk quickly noted the significance of Nixon's remark and said the president was actually carrying out Keynesian policies at that moment. His budget for the next fiscal year, which would be released in a few weeks, would be "expansionary," Nixon had said in his television interview. Instead of aiming for budgetary balance in nominal dollar terms, Nixon said he would aim to balance the budget on a "full employment" basis.
This statement was really no less controversial than the one Nixon made about Keynesian economics. Conservatives viewed it as a license to run budget deficits forever. The idea, now called the "cyclically adjusted deficit," is to separate the share of the budget deficit resulting from a downturn in the economy, which automatically raises spending and reduces revenue, from its "structural" component, which is a function of the basic nature of the budget itself.

The point of looking at the deficit on a cyclically adjusted basis, which the Congressional Budget Office calculates regularly, is to avoid cutting spending that is only temporarily high and will fall automatically as the economy expands, or raising taxes that will automatically rise. Such actions would exacerbate the economic downturn.
According to the C.B.O., the economic downturn has increased the budget deficit by about 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product annually since 2009. It also calculates that if the economy were operating at its potential based on its productive capacity - what used to be called "full employment," a term now in disuse among economists - G.D.P. would be $1 trillion larger this year.
Conservatives still don't like calculating the deficit any way except literally. All adjustments are assumed to be tricks to make it look smaller, they believe. But back in 1971, having a Republican president talk about an expansionary budget policy and balancing the budget on a full employment basis was radical stuff indeed.
The irony, of course, is that Keynesian economics, which had dominated macroeconomic thinking since the war, was already dying. For decades it had been under intellectual assault by economists associated with the University of Chicago known as "monetarists." Their most well-known spokesman was Milton Friedman, who argued against the Keynesians' focus on fiscal policy - federal spending and taxing policy - and their inattention to monetary policy, which is conducted by the Federal Reserve.
As it happens, Friedman had said in 1965 that "we're all Keynesians now" in the Dec. 31 issue of Time magazine. He later complained that his quote had been taken out of context. His full statement was, "In one sense, we are all Keynesian now; in another, nobody is any longer a Keynesian." Friedman said the second half of his quote was as important as the first half.
But it wasn't only those on the right, such as Friedman, who were abandoning Keynes; so were those on the left such as the Harvard economist John Kenneth Galbraith, an early and energetic supporter of Keynesian economics. In July 1971, he said that Keynes was obsolete because big business and big labor so controlled the economy that Keynesian economics didn't work.
Galbraith said that it was "sad that Mr. Nixon has proclaimed himself a Keynesian at the very moment in history when Keynes has become obsolete."
By 1976, it was common to hear world leaders denigrate Keynesian economics as primarily responsible for the problem of inflation. That year, Prime Minister James Callaghan of Britain, leader of the left-wing Labor Party, gave a speech to a party conference that repudiated the core Keynesian idea of a countercyclical fiscal policy. It only worked, he said, by injecting higher doses of inflation that eventually led to higher unemployment.
The following year, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, of West Germany's left-wing Social Democratic Party, likewise repudiated Keynesian economics. The German economy, he said, had avoided inflation by resisting the temptation to implement countercyclical fiscal policies during economic downturns. "The time for Keynesian economics is past," Mr. Schmidt explained, "because the problem of the world today is inflation."
On his blog last week, Paul Krugman took me to task for misconstruing the generality of Keynesian theory. My point was that policy makers in the early postwar era routinely accepted the idea that Keynesian stimulus was justified whenever the economy wasn't doing as well as they wanted.
I acknowledge that this view derived mainly from economists who called themselves Keynesians rather than Keynes himself. He was, in fact, a strong opponent of inflation who would have opposed many "Keynesian policies" of the 1950s and 1960s, which contributed to the problem of stagflation in the 1970s that ultimately discredited those policies.
Economists and policy makers mostly forgot that Keynes prescribed budget surpluses during economic upswings to offset the deficits that he correctly advocated during downturns. In his 1940 book, "How to Pay for the War," he advocated balancing the budget over the business cycle.
I think Milton Friedman was right that in a sense we are all Keynesians and not Keynesians at the same time. What I think he meant is that no one advocates Keynesian stimulus at all times, but that there are times, like now, when it is desperately needed. At other times we may need to be monetarists, institutionalists or whatever. We should avoid dogmatic attachment to any particular school of economic thought and use proper analysis to figure out the nature of our economic problem at that particular moment and the proper policy to deal with it.

HIGHLIGHT: Outside the specific context of mental illness, &#8220;schizophrenic&#8221; is usually a good word to avoid. Besides the misconception that it suggest a split personality, using the word lightly or metaphorically can seem insensitive. But as a reader noted recently, we still do it occasionally: 

 BODY:
We should be careful about casual uses of words associated with mental illness. Here's what The Times's stylebook says about one:
 schizophrenia is a mental illness often characterized by episodic disorientation, delusions and hallucinations. It is not characterized by a split personality, and the word schizophrenic does not mean two-faced, of two minds or self-contradictory.
Outside the specific context of mental illness, "schizophrenic" is usually a good word to avoid. Besides the misconception that it suggests a split personality, using the word lightly or metaphorically can seem insensitive. But as a reader noted recently, we still do it occasionally:
 A recipe from the restaurant in Greenwich Village seems schizophrenic but tastes terrific. 
 Conducting Ives's symphony, with its vast forces often subdivided into groups playing in different meters and keys, requires courage. In fact, the Philharmonic brought in a second conductor, Case Scaglione, to lead certain sections in some of the work's more schizophrenic moments, a strategy common in performances of this piece. 
 But the Nation piece, which was written by Eric Alterman and went online in late March, also raised the specter of an almost schizophrenic political pragmatist whose progressive agenda stands in stark contrast to his low opinion of new taxes, which Mr. Alterman said made Mr. Cuomo "the soul brother to Grover Norquist." 
 
 And Another One 
We should also take care with "bipolar." Given its primary sense of "having two poles or charges," it can legitimately be used to mean "having two opposite or contradictory ideas or natures," as the American Heritage Dictionary says. But avoid using it as a jocular or figurative description of someone's mental state. Here's one we should have thought twice about:
 The Sundance Film Festival has long had a dual personality. The atmosphere is typically fun and fizzy - Stars! Swag! Hot tub hopping! - while the films are dark and depressing, sometimes to the point of self-parody. This year, however, Sundance is looking a lot less bipolar. 
 
 In a Word 
This week's grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.
 "Some were able to survive," said Lidia Fischer, 38, a blonde-haired descendant of a family that was among Nueva Germania's first settlers. ... 
 While there are still a few blond-haired children running around, after generations of intermarriage, many of the town's 4,300 residents have German surnames but are indiscernible from other Paraguayans. 
As the stylebook says, use "blonde" only as a noun, referring to a woman or a girl. The adjective is always "blond." And "blond-haired" is redundant.
 [Caption] Mary McCartney, a daughter of Sir Paul and the author of a vegetarian cookbook called "Food," preparing an eggplant wrap during a visit to New York. 
As the stylebook notes, we don't generally use "Sir" or "Lord" for people already well known as pop stars, business leaders, etc.
 Even as the speeches ground on in a huge meeting hall, thousands of members were downstairs, where acre-upon-acre of kiosks displayed the latest in hunting and camping equipment, and weaponry, from futuristic black-matte rifles to six-shooters to knives that would have made Jim Bowie envious. 
Why the hyphens?
 But as productivity has slowed substantially in recent years, doubts have re-emerged about whether information technology can power economic growth like the steam engine and the internal combustion engine did in the past. 
Avoid this use of "like" as a conjunction. Here, make it "as" or "the way."
 Ms. van Doten said later that while she appreciated the mayor's recognition of her son, she did not want her son to be "part of a political battle, a pawn," in the debate over stop-and-frisk tactics, which she generally supports through she believes there needs to be adjustments. 
"Though," of course, not "through." Also, make it "there need to be adjustments"; the plural "adjustments" is the subject of "need."
 Under the agreement, once the Malkins achieve the 80 percent approval, anyone who voted against it has 10 days to switch, or they could receive only $100 for their share. 
The plural "they" doesn't go with the singular "anyone." One simple fix: "investors who voted against it have 10 days ... or they could receive ..."
 Mark Williams-Thomas, a former detective who amassed much of the evidence against Mr. Savile in a documentary that touched off the scandal and police investigation last year, said that he has been continuing to help the police in coaxing people who might have been victimized years ago to come forward. 
After the past-tense "said," sequence-of-tense rules require "had been continuing" or "was continuing."
 The investigators also referenced an April 2011 e-mail in which Ms. Masters ordered a "rewrite" of an internal document that raised questions about whether the bank had run afoul of the law. 
Avoid this jargony use of "reference" as a verb. Make it something like "cited."
 The library's budget for the year has declined to $598.4 million, a 4 percent cut that is likely to slow its digitalization effort and has already caused copyright applications to back up. 
Make it "digitization," formed from the verb "digitize." ("Digitalization" is formed from "digitalize," which actually means to administer digitalis drugs to a heart patient. Really.)
 As the malicious Abigaille, her diva act was as delicious as it was in the role at the Met recently, and on Saturday she was in even better voice, some passages worn but others - including many of the high notes and softer, gentler lines - secure. 
Dangler; her diva act wasn't the malicious Abigaille.
 And Apple itself provided an opening for competitors when it changed the way its phones connect to other devices, aggravating both its business partners and consumers. 
As the stylebook notes, in precise usage, "aggravate" means to make worse, not anger or irritate.
 At this point, the transition from public disgrace to college lectern is so familiar that when Mr. Galliano merely stepped foot on the campus of Central Saint Martins, an art and design school in London, speculation rippled around the world - incorrectly - that he would soon be teaching there. 
Make it either "set foot" or "stepped." 
 The move to appeal the court ruling came just a day after the F.D.A. staked out a new position, setting the age restriction on nonprescription access to the most well-known brand of emergency contraception - Plan B One-Step - at 15 years old and telling pharmacies to stock the product on display shelves rather than behind the counter. 
A common mistake; make it "best-known." 
 During an interview, he proudly declared that "I am a good capitalist." 
"That" is not needed to introduce a full clause in a direct quote. Omit it and put a comma after "declared."
 Before the new edition is in anyone's hands, however, we have pre-emptive strikes against it in the form of two industrious and perfervid new books, Gary Greenberg's "Book of Woe" and Dr. Allen Frances's "Saving Normal." 
An often-overlooked rule from the stylebook. After two sibilant sounds, form the possessive with just the apostrophe, not yet another "s": Frances'. 
 The city has been particularly hard hit by the shrinking of the financial services industry, which, much like in Midtown Manhattan, had been a primary driver of growth. 
"Like" is a preposition that should be followed by a noun or pronoun. Here, make it "as in Midtown Manhattan."
 Americans are exhibiting an isolationist streak, with majorities across party lines decidedly opposed to American intervention in North Korea or Syria, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. 
The description seems overblown. An "isolationist" opposes all foreign intervention; these questions just related to policies on North Korea and Syria.

HEADLINE: BlackBerry Messaging Is Set for iPhones and Android

BYLINE: IAN AUSTEN


HIGHLIGHT: At a marketing conference, the company said it would extend its BlackBerry Messenger service to other platforms while trying to turn the instant messaging system into a competitor of Twitter. 

 BODY:
BlackBerry said on Tuesday that it would open its BlackBerry Messenger service to users of iPhones and phones running the Android operating system while it also tries to turn the instant messaging system into a competitor of Twitter.
Thorsten Heins, BlackBerry's president and chief executive, made the announcement at an annual marketing conference in Orlando, Fla., that offered relatively few new product announcements.
When carriers charged high fees for text messaging, BBM was a powerful selling tool for BlackBerry. Because it operates through BlackBerry's own private network, BBM avoids fees from cellphone service providers and offers several technical advantages. But as the number of BlackBerry users in the United States fell drastically, the attractiveness and utility of a service that only connected BlackBerry phones also declined. 
"Why is BlackBerry doing this now?" Mr. Heins asked at the meeting. "We are confident that the time is right for BlackBerry Messenger to become an independent, multiplatform service."
Exactly what the expanded availability, which will begin on a limited basis this summer, will bring BlackBerry in business terms was unclear from the presentation. Mr. Heins said there would be no charge to download either the Apple iOS or Google Android apps.
Charles Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research who was at the conference, said any financial gain would be indirect. BlackBerry, he said, appears to be hoping that people who find BBM useful on competitors' phones will then consider changing brands.
The plan also appears intended to expand the audience for a new BlackBerry Messenger feature, BBM Channels, which Mr. Heins compared to Twitter during the company's announcement.
In his presentation, Mr. Heins cast the feature as one that would be used mainly by corporations and public figures like musicians to create feeds of messages, although individuals would also be able to set up channels. BBM users, in turn, will be able to subscribe to those channels in much the same way they follow people and companies on Twitter.
Again, Mr. Heins offered no information about the potential financial impact of the new service, which became available in a prototype form on Tuesday.
Mr. Golvin said the BBM Channels service combined some features of both Twitter and Facebook, which corporations may find very attractive. The downside, he added, "is that its reach is teeny-tiny compared to Twitter."
Given that BlackBerry has yet to start selling one of two previously announced phones based on the new BlackBerry 10 operating system in some important markets, including the United States, the lack of major announcements was not a surprise.
Mr. Heins did show off a new handset with a physical keyboard, the Q5, which resembles the Q10 phone that will go on sale in the United States next month. Unlike the Q10, which comes only in black or white, the Q5 will be available in a variety of colors, including pink.
But Mr. Heins said the Q5 was a lower-cost model that would be sold only in developing countries, which have become an increasingly important part of BlackBerry's business.
The company also announced some additional features that would be available in an upgrade to the BlackBerry 10 operating system as well as in the software that information technology departments use to manage BlackBerrys and, now, iPhones and Android phones.
Over the past year, Mr. Heins has repeatedly said that BlackBerry hopes, with its new operating system, to take over a wide variety of computing tasks, including many now performed by desktops and laptops.
The BlackBerry subsidiary that developed the operating system, QNX Software Systems of Ottawa, has long been a supplier to automakers. So at last year's conference, Mr. Heins showed off a Porsche convertible fitted with several BlackBerry PlayBook tablets to illustrate his plan.
This year, there was no mention of the PlayBook, which has been notably unsuccessful and sold at heavily discounted prices. But Mr. Heins had a new luxury car to display: a Bentley Continental convertible that was specially equipped with an unusually large touch screen.
The screen displayed a variety of car controls and information from a computer that Mr. Heins said used the BlackBerry 10 operating system.
Its display bore little resemblance to the user interface on BlackBerry 10 phones. But Mr. Heins and a QNX executive used it to make a BBM video call to another BlackBerry executive. Perhaps anticipating obvious concerns, Mr. Heins emphasized that the feature automatically switches to voice-only calling when the Bentley is in motion.

HEADLINE: Corporate Irresponsibility? Fashion's Hidden Cost in Bangladesh's Garment Industry

BYLINE: MICHAEL GONCHAR and TOM MARSHALL


HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson students imagine they are executives at major American clothing retailers who are researching and negotiating what policy changes, if any, their company should take in light of the recent human disasters in Bangladeshi garment factories. 

 BODY:
A look at two companies with different responses to the building collapse in Bangladesh.
 Overview | Do American companies have a responsibility to ensure the health and safety of the workers who manufacture the clothing they sell? Do American consumers have any responsibility for workers in other countries who make their clothing?
In this lesson, students will first imagine they are executives at major American clothing retailers who are researching and negotiating what policy changes, if any, their company should take in light of the recent disasters in Bangladeshi garment factories. Then, students will write their own persuasive letters to their favorite clothing brand advocating a course of action to improve safety standards for workers around the world. 

 Materials | Computer with Internet connection and projector to display articles and video, computers with Internet connection for individual students or groups to use online resources, or copies of stories or documents as needed. 
 Warm-Up | Ask students to take a few moments to look at the labels on their clothing. Where was the their clothing made? (You can also assign this question for homework the night before so students don't have to find tags in awkward places.) Write the names of the countries on the board, and keep track of how many times a country is named. 
Ask students: What do you notice about where our clothing is made? Are you surprised? Why do you think so much of our clothing is made in these countries, instead of in the United States?
Then, ask students if they have heard about the recent tragedies that have taken place in garment factories in Bangladesh. After they share what they know, make sure that students are aware that a factory building collapse in Bangladesh in late April caused the deaths of more than 1,100 people, in one of the worst manufacturing disasters in history. And in November, a fire in a Bangladeshi garment factory killed 112 people. 
 Related | Watch this brief video "Divided Over Bangladesh" about how two different clothing companies are responding to the recent building collapse in Bangladesh.
 Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:

        
What responsibility do Western companies have to ensure the health and safety of the workers who manufacture the clothing they sell?
        
Which response is better: the Walt Disney Company's decision to stop manufacturing in Bangladesh or Loblaw's decision to stay in Bangladesh and push for tougher safety standards? Why?
        
Do we as consumers have any responsibility for the workers in other countries who make our clothing? If yes, how do we exercise that responsibility? What should or can we do? 
 Activity | In this activity students will first take on the role of business executives from a major Western clothing company making a decision about how to respond to the recent disasters in Bangladesh's garment industry. Working in pairs or small groups, students will research worker safety and rights, along with the history of the garment industry, before deciding on the best course of action. Then, students will write their company's proposal, identifying the problems in the garment industry and recommending solutions. 
Next, the class will simulate a world conference on international labor standards. Together, the executives from the various companies represented will try to agree on unified standards for garment manufacturing around the world.
Finally, students will write their own personal persuasive letters to their favorite company, or the company they represented in the simulation, advocating a course of action to improve worker safety and rights around the world. 
While this lesson uses Bangladesh as a case study for students to research, the company proposals and culminating labor standards conference are intended to address the international garment industry.
You can let students select which brand they will represent for the project, or you can assign them one from the list below. We selected these companies because they were mentioned in the articles we linked to in this lesson, but you might select different clothing brands based on your students' interests.

 Part I: Research Your Company 
Begin this project by exploring the corporate or social responsibility page on your company's Web site if they have one (links included in the list above), and do a search on their site for keywords like "Bangladesh," "Pakistan," "labor" or "safety." You can also search Google using the company's name and similar terms, and see how their statements are handled in media reports. 
Does your company have an official policy about making sure that its clothing is manufactured in factories that are safe? Has it joined efforts aimed at maintaining high workplace standards? Has your company issued statements in the wake of the Bangladesh building collapse or other garment factory disasters? 
Take notes on what you learn about your company. You will use these notes later during this project when you draft your company's proposal and then represent your company in an international conference.
 Part II: Research the Issues and History 
The second step in this project is for students to research issues in the Bangladeshi garment industry, and to understand how Bangladesh fits into a long history of the evolving apparel trade. 
We have created three research topics: fire and building safety, wages and worker rights, and historical parallels. If students have enough time, they can research all three topics. Or groups may want to assign students to research different issues, and then report back to one another when they finish their research. Students may want to use our "Problem-Solution" graphic organizer (PDF) to take notes as they research.
 1. Fire and Building Safety. The April 24 building collapse in Bangladesh was one of the worst disasters in the history of the world's garment industry, killing more than 1,100 people. In November, a fire in another Bangladeshi garment factory killed 112 people. And these were just a few disasters in a string of calamities that have killed and injured thousands of Bangladeshi garment workers. 
Why are garment factories in Bangladesh so dangerous? What kinds of safety codes exist? How are they enforced by the Bangladeshi government? And what role do Western companies play in making sure the workers who manufacture their clothing are safe?
In addition to the articles linked above, below are four more articles that shed light on these questions:

        
"Horrific Fire Revealed a Gap in Safety for Global Brands"
        
"Documents Indicate Walmart Blocked Safety Push in Bangladesh"
        
"Fatal Fire in Bangladesh Highlights the Dangers Facing Garment Workers"
        
"Factory in Bangladesh Lost Fire Clearance Before Blaze"
 2. Wages and Worker Rights. Bangladesh's garment industry is a global powerhouse - second only to China in the value of apparel exports. The industry is worth $18 billion, and accounts for 80 percent of Bangladesh's total export earnings. It employs more than 3.2 million workers, 80 percent of whom are women. Yet workers earn as little as $37 a month, the country's minimum wage, and reports of unpaid wages and abusive bosses are common. Yet when workers protest, they can face riot police with tear gas and rubber bullets. Labor organizers can face intimidation and torture.
But the not-so-secret formula to Bangladesh's thriving garment industry is that the country offers the world's lowest wages and lowest cost of production for clothing brands. Will shoppers at H&M or Walmart be willing to pay more to ensure that the workers who make their clothing earn a decent wage? Will companies flock elsewhere if doing business in Bangladesh gets more expensive? And would an exodus of foreign capital and jobs harm the country in the long run, now that the garment industry has helped raise living standards for millions of Bangladeshis? 
Below are Times articles that will help students conduct research on the complicated questions above:

        
"Export Powerhouse Feels Pangs of Labor Strife"
        
"Labor Unrest in Bangladesh's Garment Industry" (Slide show)
        
"Fighting for Bangladesh Labor, and Ending Up in Pauper's Grave"
        
"Bangladesh Needs Strong Unions, Not Outside Pressure"
        
"Wages and Poverty Among Top Apparel Exporters" (2010 Graphic)
 3. Historical Parallels. Read about one of America's most notorious workplace disasters, the Triangle Shirtwaist Company fire of 1911 or explore a PBS video on the topic. Keep track of the similarities and differences between the fire and recent disasters in Bangladesh or Pakistan. 
What changes did the Triangle fire prompt in the United States? And why do you think such accidents continue happening in some countries but not in others? Make a list of possible reasons, and then decide whether this video, "Triangle Returns "by the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights, offers reasonable explanations for the disparity. (Note: teachers should preview these resources to make sure they're appropriate for students.)
Read the Op-Ed article "Clothed in Misery" and the analysis piece "Economic Recovery, Made in Bangladesh?" to help decide where Bangladesh fits within the history of the garment industry, and what the current moment might mean for Bangladesh's future. 
 Part III: Research the Solutions 
After students have a more complete picture of the issues involved with the Bangladeshi garment industry, they should then research how their company might try to address worker safety and rights in Bangladesh and around the world. 
 1. Stop Doing Business in Countries With Poor Safety Records. Will your company decide to stop all production until safety conditions are improved, like the Walt Disney Company recently announced in Bangladesh? Does Disney's move abandon poor workers? Or is it just smart business for a company that is very protective of its image? Alternatively, does Disney's early announcement actually place well-timed pressure on Bangladesh's government, forcing political leaders and business owners to recognize that more companies might follow Disney's lead if they don't act fast?
 2. Improve Safety and Working Conditions. Will your company decide to stay in Bangladesh and join a "legally binding plan that requires retailers to help finance fire safety and building improvements"? So far, the brands H&M, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Izod have signed onto the agreement, but other major companies are still reluctant. 
Will your company agree to similar agreements for the garment industry around the world? Do you agree with this piece by Kalpona Akter, a former child laborer in Bangladesh, that states "...more tragedies can be prevented only if the multinational corporations and retailers whose goods are produced at these factories are willing to stand up and do what is right"?
 3. Increase Transparency About Clothing Origins. Will your company seek to distance themselves from unsafe garment factories in Bangladesh or elsewhere, or will they acknowledge their connection when disasters occur? 
Will your company provide compensation to families who lost loved ones in factory accidents, or will they insist that all responsibility falls on local manufacturers and governments? 
And will they follow the lead of some brands that provide customers with "information about exactly how, and where, their products were made"? In fact, new research suggests that consumers are willing to pay more for fair-labor clothing.
 Part IV: Write a Company Proposal 
Students should write a company proposal detailing the problems they have identified with clothing manufacturing, as well as their recommendations for addressing those problems in Bangladesh and around the world. In their proposals, students should:

        
Introduce their company along with its policies and history regarding worker safety and rights.
        
Explain the problems they have identified in the garment industry, using Bangladesh as a case study.
        
Propose solutions for how their company can respond to the recent disasters in garment factories to improve conditions for workers in Bangladesh and around the world.
In their proposals, students should cite their sources to identify where they found their evidence.
 Part V: International Conference for Fair Labor Standards 
After the April building collapse in Bangladesh, several multinational companies met in Germany to hammer out an agreement to improve worker safety in Bangladesh. 
For this class simulation, we are imagining that companies hold a follow-up conference to address labor standards around the world. Students should use the information they researched and the ideas in their company proposals to provide talking points for the conference.
Here are two ways a class could simulate a world conference:

        
 A Jigsaw: Each company can send one of its representatives to a different group that holds its own separate negotiations. For example, if the group representing Benetton has three students, each of those students participates in a different mini-conference, so that there are three sets of negotiations going on in the classroom. Then, after a set period of time, the three mini-conferences present the terms they negotiated to the whole class. Finally, the class tries to agree on a single set of fair labor standards that all, or most, companies can agree on.
        
 Whole Class: Each company has a few minutes to present its proposal to the class, and then the class discusses which recommendations the companies are willing to adopt.
When the conference concludes, each student should write a reflection about the process of representing a clothing company and the challenge of negotiating a set of fair labor standards with other companies.
 Part VI: Persuasive Letter 
Students choose their favorite clothing brand, or the one they represented in the simulation above, and write a persuasive letter urging the company to adopt a set of labor standards, either based on the ones they offered in their company proposal or the ones adopted by the class in the labor standards conference.
In these letters students can:

        
Introduce themselves and why they like the brand.
        
Explain the issues they identified in their research.
        
Advocate for a particular policy to address problems in the garment industry.
Even before the tragedy in Bangladesh, pressure was growing on retailers to balance Americans' appetite for cheap clothes with the human costs of making them, the author Elizabeth Cline says.
 Going Further | Below are three additional activities you can do with your class related to the recent disasters in Bangladeshi garment factories:
 1. Taking Personal Responsibility. Alecia Simmonds, a law school lecturer at the University of New South Wales in Australia, felt a very personal response to the Bangladesh factory collapse. She checked the labels of the clothes lying in her bedroom. "My floor was littered with dresses and T-shirts that had been run through the sewing machines of people working in prison conditions or even possibly now dead," she wrote in an opinion piece for the Sydney Morning Herald. 
Consider the lessons Ms. Simmonds reaches about her own role as a consumer. Do you agree with her conclusions about what consumers must do to prevent future factory disasters? Write your own personal response to the Bangladesh building collapse, or to Ms. Simmonds's article, proposing your own set of lessons to guide consumer behavior. 
 2. Child Labor. Do children still work in dangerous jobs in America or other countries, despite laws and treaties designed to protect them? Research coverage on child labor issues in the archives of The New York Times, and design a world map highlighting recent incidents. Then design an action plan to publicize or challenge recent examples of child labor that you find particularly troubling. Hold a school competition to see which student or class can design and implement the most effective effort to publicize and challenge illegal child labor.
 3. Jobs Versus Safety. In 2009, pressure by workers' rights and environmental groups nearly shut down the dangerous ship-breaking industry in Bangladesh. But after local business owners pressured the government, the industry came back to life and continues to compete with countries like India for the lucrative scrap metal trade. (Last year the Exxon Valdez, an oil tanker that ran aground in Alaska in 1989 and caused widespread oil pollution, was sent to a ship-breaking yard in Gujarat, India.) 
Critics say ship-breakers in Bangladesh continue to allow dangerous working conditions and lax environmental standards, and a proposal by the European Union would ban its ships from being recycled under such conditions. Can such regulations work, or will companies continue to seek unregulated shores to break up their ships at the lowest possible cost? Consider the evidence and then formulate a policy paper designed to ensure that ships from all nations are recycled in a safe manner.

HIGHLIGHT: Japan has traditionally been hostile to Western investors. How the country and Sony react to demands from Daniel S. Loeb could test Japan&#8217;s commitment to welcoming foreign investment and, more important, economic change. 

 BODY:
 TOKYO - Devil. Vulture. Saboteur.
All these words have been used to greet Western investors who have agitated for change in Japan's clubby and complacent corporate culture. As the hedge fund billionaire Daniel S. Loeb prepares to take on Sony, he may find the same hostility from the company that at one time single-handedly defined premium quality in entertainment and electronics.
How Sony, and Japan, react to the demands brought by Mr. Loeb on Tuesday could become a test of how far the country has come in making good on promises to open up to more foreign investment and, more important, change. 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who took office in December, has promised to shake up corporate Japan by removing onerous regulations, protections and inflexibilities that have sapped profitability and hampered serious revamping.
Investors initially are cheering Mr. Loeb's efforts. Sony's shares rose nearly 10 percent in the United States to close at $20.76 on Tuesday. The reaction among those who matter - Sony's managers - has been muted.
Almost no local media outlets carried the story of Mr. Loeb's hand-delivered list of demands to Sony on Tuesday, hours after those demands had been made public. Sony itself issued only a curt statement, saying its entertainment businesses were "not for sale."
"Sony is an icon. Until now, it hasn't had a fellow like this coming in and making demands in public," said Nicholas Benes, a former Wall Street banker who now advises Japanese companies on corporate governance. "But now he comes in with guns blazing. This hasn't quite started off right, you might say."
Activist investors like Mr. Loeb's fund, Third Point, might seem like natural allies in that mission to prod Japan's corporations toward change. Mr. Loeb's demands for Sony's management center on bringing more focus to its sprawling business, something analysts have long called for, partly by spinning off a part of its entertainment arm. And Mr. Loeb cites Mr. Abe's promised economic reforms as a big reason behind his recent interest in Japan.
Nowhere has revamping been so painfully needed as in Japan's electronics industry, where six major manufacturers, including Sony, still produce flat-panel televisions, mostly at a loss. Better labor mobility might make companies more reluctant to close or spin off money-losing operations and focus on profitable lines of business.
American activist investors have, however, met with frustration in the efforts to add value at other companies. T. Boone Pickens, who acquired a minority stake in the auto parts company Koito Manufacturing in 1989, pressed its management for better dividends and a seat on its board. But the little manufacturer dug in its heels. Shareholders heckled him with anti-American taunts at its annual shareholders meeting; the press branded him an opportunistic vulture. Koito's president refused even to meet the Texan magnate.
"O.K., Koito; I give up," Mr. Pickens declared in an editorial two contentious years later, before selling his entire stake. "The heck with Japanese business."
Mr. Loeb is unlikely to get such openly hostile treatment from Sony, now that he is a significant investor with a 6.5 percent stake in the company. After all, it is 2013, and Sony, unlike Koito, is a global, savvy firm.
Gerhard Fasol, president of the Tokyo technology consulting firm Eurotechnology Japan, said Mr. Loeb had probably studied past unsuccessful approaches to Japanese companies.
"My guess is that he learned from the mistakes those activist investors made and was advised to tone things down," Mr. Fasol said. Mr. Loeb makes a point of starting the note with praise for Mr. Hirai and his commitment to change.
Mr. Loeb has suggested that Sony take 15 to 20 percent of the entertainment unit public by offering current Sony shareholders the opportunity to buy shares. The unit includes a leading film studio and one of the largest music labels in the world, featuring artists like Taylor Swift. A spinoff could lead to higher profit margins, while helping to revive the core electronics business, Mr. Loeb argues.
Yet even though many inside and outside Japan recognize that Sony's divisions need some shaking up, a hedge fund manager like Mr. Loeb may not be the one who is ultimately successful.
Active investing has long been seen in Japan as a dangerous, alien practice led by foreigners, or cheeky locals who dare imitate them. And in past cases, lenders, bureaucrats, other shareholders and even rivals have swooped in to rescue companies from investors' talons. Of the 23 hostile takeover bids in Japan since 2000, only 7 have been successful, according to Dealogic
The cross-shareholdings of Japanese companies - with close ties to their main bank and other companies, known as keiretsu - have helped foster an environment where hostile takeovers are rare and shareholders are docile supporters.
But in the mid-2000s, when Japan seemed to stage a nascent recovery, the country attracted a wave of what company executives came to call "investors who say things."
In 2006, when Steel Partners, an American fund, took out a stake in the noodle maker Myojo Foods, the company flatly refused to entertain a proposal for a management buyout, accusing the fund of trying to sabotage the company's future for short-term gain. When Steel Partners instead started a takeover bid, Myojo ran into the arms of its noodle archrival, Nissin Foods, which bought it out.
Undeterred, Steel Partners aimed at another food company, this time a condiment maker called Bull-Dog Sauce, and accumulated a 10 percent stake in 2007. Not satisfied with the management's reluctance to expand overseas to make up for a waning domestic market, the fund started a tender bid for the rest of the company. This time, it was thwarted by a landmark ruling by Japan's Supreme Court supporting the use of "poison pill" defenses in Japan.
The media followed the food companies' tribulations with much gusto, berating the brash manners of Warren Lichtenstein, chief of Steel Partners. The public broadcaster, NHK, showed a drama series, "Vulture," about an American investment firm that snaps up troubled companies.
"Is he a devil, or a savior?" the narrator asked in a booming voice.
An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Taylor Swift as a Sony artist, and published her picture in error. Ms. Swift records for the Big Machine label, not a Sony label.

HEADLINE: Sony Meets Outspoken Activist Investor, but Courtesy Reigns

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Daniel S. Loeb, often caustic dealing with others, had a polite meeting in Tokyo with executives of Sony, where he is trying to engineer a major shake-up. 

 BODY:
For a hedge fund manager whose fame first came on writing invective-filled letters, Daniel S. Loeb's latest missive was a model of politeness.
After a roughly two-hour meeting in Tokyo on Tuesday with senior management at Sony, the American billionaire handed a letter to the company's chief executive, calling for a shake-up of the electronics giant.
However polite the note - Mr. Loeb says he wants to be a partner to Sony - it has started the biggest fight of the activist investor's career to date. 
Mr. Loeb's campaign is just the latest in a recent swell of corporate activism, as investors take on management at moribund companies and demand shifts in corporate strategy.
Flush with cash from eager investors, these hedge fund managers are taking on ever larger targets. Companies as big as the Hess Corporation, Procter & Gamble and even Apple have found themselves in the sights of investors upset with what they see as waste and a disregard for shareholders' fortunes.
In his 18-year career as a financial manager, Mr. Loeb has become one of the biggest stars in the world of hedge fund activists. His firm, Third Point, controls nearly $13 billion in assets and it was up 13.3 percent for the year so far through last week.
Before Sony, Mr. Loeb's biggest target was Yahoo, where he waged a war to oust Scott Thompson as chief executive. Soon after winning that fight, Mr. Loeb successfully poached Marissa Mayer from Google to serve as the embattled Web pioneer's new leader.
Since the investor first began agitating at Yahoo, the company's shares have soared 81 percent.
"You can see Dan's fingerprints all over the turnaround," said Eric Jackson, a fellow hedge fund manager and Yahoo investor. "He's brought an assurance to other Wall Street investors that there's an owner in the boardroom. That's what this company needed."
A California native who began his career at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus and Citigroup, Mr. Loeb, 51, made his name through his investment acumen and the caustic humor often in his correspondence. Over the years, aficionados have collected his writings, from one executive's "imminent involuntary extraction" to another's "seemingly perpetual failure."
Among his most famous epistles was his 2005 letter to the chief executive of Star Gas, a heating oil distributor. In 2,000 words, Mr. Loeb berated the official, Irik P. Sevin, for his "ineptitude" and for using the company as his "personal 'honey pot.' "
"It is time for you to step down from your role as C.E.O. and director so that you can do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites," he wrote.
Mr. Sevin resigned soon afterward.
Mr. Loeb's aggressiveness extended beyond companies as well. His 2005 exchange with an applicant from Britain went viral around Wall Street for lines like "I love the idea of a French/English unemployed guy whose fund just blew up telling me that I am going to fail."
That same year, Mr. Loeb battled with another hedge fund titan, Kenneth C. Griffin of Citadel, over poaching employees from other firms. "You are surrounded by sycophants but even you must know that the people who work for you despise and resent you," Mr. Loeb scoffed. (The two have since become friends.)
As his success grew, Mr. Loeb branched out beyond activism into less confrontational strategies. Third Point reaped a $500 million profit last year by betting that Greece's government bonds would regain value after that country's debt crisis.
He was also one of several investors to reap big gains from wagering on home loans after the financial crisis of 2008. And he profited from bets on bankrupt companies like Delphi, the auto parts maker.
Mr. Loeb has had his share of stumbles as well. He fought for a seat at Massey Energy in 2006, deriding the coal miner for its inefficiencies and poor risk management. But he resigned a year later after his activist skills failed to lead to the ouster of Don L. Blankenship as chief executive and a sale of the company.
The financial crisis also weighed down on Third Point in 2008, as the firm's main fund sank about 33 percent.
Over all, however, Mr. Loeb retains the power to move stocks simply by revealing his presence. Earlier this year, he announced an 8.2 percent stake in Herbalife, a nutritional supplements company locked in combat with his friend and fellow billionaire, William A. Ackman.
Third Point rode the subsequent rise in Herbalife's stock and sold out after a few months, pocketing an estimated $50 million profit.
Among his recent big bets are Morgan Stanley, whose compensation practices he has admonished, and Murphy Oil, which he has said should consider shedding assets.
The largest of these is now Sony, which he believes can trim its way to prosperity. It is likely to be a long campaign, especially given Japan's historic aversion to foreign interlopers. But Mr. Loeb appears to have won over at least a few fans for now.
"We think Mr. Loeb's bold proposal bears consideration," analysts at Macquarie wrote in a research note on Tuesday, agreeing that a spinoff of the entertainment unit could propel Sony's stock by 60 percent. "We recognize this latent value may indeed exist."

HEADLINE: In Role Reversal, Goldman Chief Advises Dimon

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: It is now Jamie Dimon, not Lloyd Blankfein, who is caught in a harsh public spotlight, seemingly at odds with regulators. 

 BODY:
Jamie Dimon has consulted lawyers, public relation experts and bankers as JPMorgan Chase wrestles with the fallout from a multibillion-dollar trading loss. But the bank chief has received advice from an unexpected corner: Lloyd C. Blankfein of rival Goldman Sachs.
 The two executives have talked privately a number of times in recent months about the challenges that Mr. Dimon is facing, people with knowledge of the relationship but not authorized to speak on the matter, have said. 
 JPMorgan is battling a shareholder vote on whether to separate Mr. Dimon's positions as chief executive and chairman, and is also dealing with a number of regulatory investigations. The vote is coming to a head. Within the last week shareholders have been casting their ballots, but at least a handful of major shareholders have yet to vote, according to others briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record.
The conversations between Wall Street's two most powerful chieftains represent a reversal of roles. It is now Mr. Dimon who is in a harsh public spotlight, seemingly at odds with regulators. It was not long ago that Mr. Blankfein was being questioned by Congress over accusations that Goldman had misled investors during the financial crisis over the sale of mortgage-backed securities. 
Now, with Goldman cleared of crisis-era investigations and its profits rising, Mr. Blankfein is enjoying something of a renaissance as an elder statesman of Wall Street. 
"I would call them foul weather friends," said one person with knowledge of the relationship who was not authorized to speak on the record. 
Foxhole buddies might be a better metaphor. Both executives steered their firms through the tumult and panic of the financial crisis.
Yet while the JPMorgan chieftain emerged from the crisis hailed as Washington's favorite banker, Goldman's chief was cast by many as a villain. 
Having survived that trial by fire, Mr. Blankfein is advising Mr. Dimon that the current storm will eventually pass, just as it appears to have done so for Goldman, the people with knowledge of the relationship said. 
Goldman's experiences does offer lessons. At a recent meeting of top financial services industry executives, Mr. Dimon asked a small group of people, which included a top-ranking Goldman executive but not Mr. Blankfein, how Goldman managed to avoid having to put forward to shareholders a vote on whether to split the job of chairman and chief executive, according to one attendee and others briefed on the conversation. 
Goldman, one person explained to Mr. Dimon, worked hard behind the scenes with its shareholders to head off such a vote, persuading them that the firm had a strong, independent lead director on its board. 
While the consultations may be recent, the two men - both native New Yorkers - have long had a cordial relationship. Both are members of the Financial Services Roundtable and they have crossed paths at Manhattan fund-raisers, like the annual dinner of the Robin Hood Foundation, which raises money to fight poverty in New York City. 
When together, they often try to outwit each other, said one person who has seen the two in action. At a meeting a few years ago, the person recalled, Mr. Dimon responded to a comment by Mr. Blankfein by asking, "Lloyd, are you still trying to do God's work?" a reference to an oft-quoted remark the Goldman chief executive made to a reporter in 2009.
 People close to Mr. Blankfein, who turns 59 in September, and Mr. Dimon, who is 57, emphasize that when the executives talk it is typically on a variety of issues, and it would be unusual for a call to be focused solely on Mr. Dimon's current situation.
The shareholder vote and questions about Mr. Dimon's leadership have come about even as the bank has generated a string of record quarterly profits. On Tuesday, a JPMorgan executive told a conference that trading revenue was running 10 to 15 percent higher this quarter, compared with the second quarter a year ago. 
Yet the bank continues to be haunted by the trading losses at its chief investment office in London more than a year ago. JPMorgan has moved to put the problem behind it, firing traders at the center of the disastrous bet, seeking to regain millions of dollars in compensation and reshuffling its executive ranks.
But investigations and a Senate report and hearing that accused the bank of misleading investors and regulators have kept the spotlight on the bank. Other investigations have raised questions about the bank's controls and relations with regulators.
Paul A. Argenti, a professor of corporate communications at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, said that while JPMorgan did an excellent public relations job handling the trading losses, the bank's public relations strategy is not enough to tackle the broader issues. 
"This has ceased to be about the 'Whale' and it's become about whether you can trust this institution and this executive again," he said. Now, Mr. Dimon is bracing for the outcome of a looming vote that could threaten his position as JPMorgan's chairman and chief executive, dual roles he has held since 2006. The nonbinding vote, which will be announced on May 21 at JPMorgan's annual meeting in Tampa, Fla., is expected to be close. In 2012, 40 percent of shareholders voted to split the two roles. 
Still, JPMorgan says despite the travails of the last year, surveys show customers are still happy with the bank. JPMorgan ranked No. 4 in the nation for customer service, in J.D. Power's latest tally, and top among the nation's largest banks.
And the bank may take comfort in Mr. Blankfein's counsel that Mr. Dimon will cycle out of the headlines.
Mr. Blankfein has had a public image makeover, thanks in part to initiatives by Goldman. After the financial crisis, Goldman announced new charitable efforts, started an advertising campaign and showed an increased willingness to engage with the media. 
Then, earlier in 2012, it hired Richard Siewert Jr., a former White House spokesman and counselor to former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.

HEADLINE: Should India Provide Direct Military Aid to Afghanistan?

BYLINE: JAVID AHMAD


HIGHLIGHT: New Delhi could provide stability in Afghanistan through military assistance after international forces leave, a foreign policy analyst argues. 

 BODY:
Over the past decade, India has invested heavily in Afghanistan's reconstruction. Recognizing India's significant economic and development contributions, the United States has called on New Delhi to play an important role in the new Silk Road initiative aimed at transforming Afghanistan into a regional trade hub.
At the same time, New Delhi has been reluctant to become directly involved in supporting Afghanistan's nascent security sector. The many uncertainties surrounding next year's security transition from international to Afghan leadership raise further questions about New Delhi's role in the Afghan endgame. 
India's decision-makers acknowledge that India's own internal security would be at risk if the international drawdown from Afghanistan leaves behind a security vacuum that is filled by Pakistan-backed militant groups. New Delhi can no longer ignore the related consequences. And while some of the Pakistan-related sensitivities are important for India, it should not approach its relations with Afghanistan, a sovereign nation, solely from a Pakistan angle.
One way for New Delhi to overcome its anxieties and further cement ties with Kabul is to consider providing direct military assistance to the Afghan government and training support to the burgeoning Afghan National Security Forces. The India-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement signed in October 2011 already provides the staging ground for an increased military cooperation with Afghanistan. Under the agreement, India provides - though to a limited extent - training support and light military equipment to Afghan forces.
However, because of New Delhi's hesitation to put military personnel on the ground, all trainings of Afghan forces are conducted inside India. Although New Delhi has deployed a small number of paramilitary forces to guard its diplomatic facilities and aid workers in Afghanistan after a number of attacks, the troops are not engaged in any combat or training missions. Looking ahead, India's decision-makers should consider anchoring these troops to support the Afghan forces and also consider establishing a military training academy in Afghanistan for Afghan forces.
More specifically, India should focus on propping up the Afghan air force, which remains largely reliant on international air support. India should bolster the ability of the Afghan air force to more ably operate its current fleet of 50 helicopters. For Afghan forces, the helicopters are an essential tool for operational air support and for resupplying remote military outposts, so New Delhi should particularly focus on training the technical and maintenance staff, on supplying the necessary spare parts and on improving the Afghan aircrew's medevac capability. By supplying an airbase support advisory team, India can augment the ability of the Afghan air force to support ground operations with troop and cargo movements and deploy Afghan forces across the country.
In addition to training support, India should consider providing the Afghan government with military hardware, including attack helicopters, a handful of fighter aircrafts, armored vehicles, artillery and tactical communication tools. New Delhi may boost these efforts by increasing its cooperation with Afghan intelligence services and provide specialized training to Afghan operatives in collecting technical and aerial intelligence.
Undeniably, these measures would come with important risks and constraints. For one, it would add further to Pakistan's many deep-rooted security concerns. Pakistan could derail the incipient peace talks with the Taliban, increase its support to the insurgent elements it hosts on its soil to spur further violence in Afghanistan or employ militant groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba to strike more frequently in India or on Indian assets inside Afghanistan.
However, a closer India-Afghan relationship would be intended to strengthen the Afghan government so it can remain functioning after 2014, and not to monitor Pakistan's activities. Pakistan must realize that India's assistance will go directly to the Afghan government, and not to any Afghan factions, as it has been in the past. Pakistan must also recognize that closer ties with India in Afghanistan better serves the interests of all parties.
Kabul does not choose sides in its relations with India and Pakistan, and, as it does with New Delhi, Kabul can also work with Islamabad in security and other sectors, but Pakistan must first show a sincere effort that it is not working toward sinister strategic objectives in Afghanistan.
Looking ahead, India is expected to stay the course and stick to training the Afghan forces inside India to avoid any backlash. But Afghanistan would welcome greater military assistance from India. Growing frustration with Pakistan has also prompted Washington to seek more Indian engagement after former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, during a visit to New Delhi, called on India to continue training the Afghan forces.
India is uniquely placed to provide such support. It leads the world's fourth-largest and modernized military force with extraordinary experience in training missions. India's military could use the services of many India-trained Afghan security personnel buoyed by people-to-people contacts and linguistic affinity within Afghanistan.
A politically and economically stable Afghanistan is of a strategic significance to India, but more collaboration is necessary. Despite little support among India's policy makers for greater military cooperation with Afghanistan, the lingering ambiguity around Afghanistan's future after 2014 provides a good opportunity for New Delhi to step up its efforts to be a force for stability in the country. Afghanistan values its relations with India, and any future direct military and training support to Afghan forces would not only strengthen bilateral relations but would also play a significant role in enhancing Afghanistan's security after international forces leave the country.

HEADLINE: Making a Move Abroad, and Working There, Too

BYLINE: By KERRY HANNON

 BODY:
WHEN Patrice Wynne shuttered her independent bookstore, Gaia, in Berkeley, Calif., and retired, she knew three things. She wanted to move to a place where she could slow down the tempo of her life, and it was cheaper to live, but where she could continue to work in some fashion.
''I promised myself -- I'm not going to slip into going to cocktail parties and playing tennis,'' Ms. Wynne, 61, said. ''I wanted engagement.''
And that's what she got. Three years ago, along a cobblestone street in the center of San Miguel de Allende in Mexico, she opened Abrazos, a 650-square-foot retail shop selling colorful Mexican-themed fabric aprons, kitchen and cooking accessories, handbags and clothing, all sewn by a dozen local seamstresses. 
Simply retiring abroad has become old news, as people seek cheaper places to live and to slash health care costs while enjoying more temperate climes. But now enjoying a ''working retirement,'' like Ms. Wynne's, appears to be gaining traction with expats, as it has in the United States.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, an increasing number of retirees, who can expect to live longer, healthier lives, are choosing to work in retirement, at least part-time, typically for fear of outliving their money or to keep active and engaged.
Despite a dearth of hard numbers on American retirees abroad, the same seems to be true for them, to judge from the rising number of Social Security checks sent to Americans living in inexpensive retirement havens in Latin America and the Caribbean, and from much anecdotal evidence from expatriate retiree-entrepreneurs like Ms. Wynne and others.
''It seems that the factors that are driving continued work later in life, including part-time work, would be the same for Americans at home and abroad,'' said Kevin Cahill, an economist with the Sloan Center on Aging and Work at Boston College. ''So I think it's fair to say that, if the employment opportunities exist, we shouldn't be surprised to see similar trends with respect to part-time employment for U.S. retirees living abroad.''
There's a wide range of jobs that globe trotters may consider. Of course, there's the possibility of accepting contract assignments from former employers. And there are often positions available to teach English, work as a translator, lead English-speaking tours, or work at hotels that cater to English-speaking travelers, according to Betsy Burlingame, founder of ExpatExchange.com, a leading Web site on international living.
In many countries, though, you are required to have a work permit for certain jobs and prove there are not citizens there who could fill the position, she added. In Panama, for example, you can't work as a doctor or nurse unless you are a Panamanian citizen.
Many expats, like Ms. Wynne, start their own businesses like restaurants, shops, real estate agencies, art galleries, bed-and-breakfasts and small hotels.
For those with an entrepreneurial bent, International Living, a magazine and Web site specializing in retirement abroad, has published an index of the countries with the best conditions for starting a business. The index factors in things like visa requirements, the ease of setting up a bank account, expenses, local taxes and language barriers. In the most recent survey, Panama was the winner, followed by Belize, Ecuador, Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic.
For Ms. Wynne, Mexico appealed for several reasons. It was a country she had visited frequently over the years and where she spoke the language. There were also plenty of expats, the weather was appealing, and it was affordable.
For $105,000, Ms. Wynne bought a single-family home with vistas of the entire city of San Miguel de Allende, a cultural hub in central Mexico, and the surrounding countryside. She spent about $35,000 to modernize it and found happy surprises along the way. ''Everything from food to flowers to medical care were considerably less than anything I had known for the last 25 years in California,'' she said.
But her ability to inexpensively start a small business, initially in her home, was critical.
Ms. Wynne's start-up costs for Abrazos totaled about $12,400 for the basics, including inventory, lighting, advertising and computers. And since opening the shop in January 2010, her monthly rent of $600 is a fraction of the $8,000 she was paying for her bookshop space in Berkeley.
Over all, rents in San Miguel de Allende are 72.6 percent lower than in San Francisco, according to Numbeo, an online database of user-contributed information about the cost of living in cities around the world. Restaurant prices there are 54.4 percent lower than the Bay Area.
Steady retail sales, which have increased 25 percent since the year the shop opened, provide enough income to allow Ms. Wynne to live a comfortable lifestyle with plenty of time to travel and even visit her parents in Pennsylvania, without having to tap into her retirement accounts. And she has no plans to start the clock on her Social Security payments when she becomes eligible next year.
But her decision to open a business and keep working goes deeper than the monetary reward.
''When you make a decision to live abroad, there's never a singular reason,'' Ms. Wynne said. ''There's always a complexity of reasons. Yes, it has to do with affordability and having your retirement income be expanded. But like other expats working here, I wanted to be adventurous and have new learning opportunities.''
Moreover, she feels ''jazzed on life,'' she said. ''By opening my store, I place myself in the pulse of the community. We're on a main thoroughfare so people drop in and talk to me. My life is a touchstone into other lives in the community. I feel healthier and more alive because I am embedded in these social networks.''
Still, for many who work in the Internet age, it does not matter much where you live these days, and this can be especially true for retirees abroad.
Dan Prescher, International Living's special projects editor, and his wife, Suzan Haskins, are both writers living in Cotacachi, a tiny town in Ecuador, since closing their marketing and public relations firm in Omaha.
If you have a job that you can do online, ''you can do it from anywhere on the planet,'' Mr. Prescher said. ''You don't have to pick a place depending on whether there's a job opportunity there.''
His advice: Take your profession and turn it into a business you can do online. For example, if you have been a dietitian, you can be a consulting dietitian online. You can be a proofreader online, an editor online.
''All my wife and I need is a laptop and an Internet connection,'' he said. ''We can send in our stories and our photographs to editors anywhere in the world. Instead of retiring, we retried our lives.''
Turalu Brady Murdock, a lawyer who specializes in title insurance, has also discovered the allure of virtual work in retirement.
Ms. Murdock, 68, and her husband live in El Tránsito, a small fishing town just off the Pacific coast of Central Nicaragua, in a 10,000-square-foot house (interior patios included) perched on a hillside 200 feet above the rolling ocean waves.
In 2010, she retired as vice president in charge of Latin America and the Caribbean for First American Title Insurance Company, based in Washington, where she had worked for more than three decades. Her primary duties had been to help individuals and companies obtain title insurance for properties they were buying in those regions.
While she lived in many places during her First American career, including New Orleans, St. Thomas, Puerto Rico and Miami, her final posting was in Nicaragua.
When her employer closed the office, she chose to stay in Nicaragua. ''I didn't think I was going to actually work.'' Ms. Murdock said. ''But people kept asking me the same questions they had for years when I worked at First American. So with a former employee, I started a consulting business.''
Her firm, Title Coordination Services, is based in Managua, the Nicaraguan capital, but Ms. Murdock does not have an office, and the two women do everything by e-mail and phone, so there is no overhead cost.
There are a few downsides. For instance, the Internet connection goes in and out at times, and the electricity has been known to fail for six hours at a time.
Ms. Murdock charges an hourly fee of $150 for advice, as well as a flat fee of $250 for specific searches, like setting someone up with a local lawyer or surveyor. The online consulting business brings in roughly $30,000 a year, which the women split.
''What's nice about it is that I can put in as few or as many hours as I want,'' she said. ''A typical week might mean seven or eight hours of work.''
As with Ms. Wynne, there's more to the work than the financial appeal. ''I really like being connected with people,'' Ms. Murdock said. ''I love learning about the new laws and the intellectual fun of it, trying to figure out how to get something done, how to work with a particular attorney in a particular country.''
Working abroad may sound swell, especially if you can be gazing off at the sand and surf and padding around in your flip-flops while you do it. But it can be complicated.
For example, making mistakes on taxes is common.
''If you're going to work overseas and earn even a modest salary, you must find a tax adviser expert in international tax issues,'' said Olivia S. Mitchell, a risk management professor who focuses on retirement policy and serves as the executive director of the Pension Research Council at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
''You should make sure you're doing everything right because there are some tricky tax laws for Americans living overseas,'' Professor Mitchell said. ''Both the United States and an expat's country of residence could try to tax your earned income while living overseas.''
The United States government requires American citizens living and working abroad to file an American tax return annually. Americans working abroad, however, are eligible for the foreign earned income exclusion, which in 2013 exempts the first $97,600 from tax. If you earn much more than this threshold and you pay income taxes to a foreign government, you may be able to take a foreign tax credit. In any event, this can require working with a tax adviser aware of the ins and outs of these policies.
''People who are moving abroad and plan to work need to go in with their eyes wide open,'' Professor Mitchell said.
''Before I would decide to settle anywhere, I would certainly want to go visit for six months or a year, not take a lot of money and not try to buy property right away,'' she added. ''You want make sure it's the kind of environment that is conducive to letting you do what you want to do.''
Hiring a bilingual person who can help you navigate the operational challenges you're likely to face is crucial for many expat small-business operators. ''Independence is hubris in a foreign country,'' Ms. Wynne said.
Learning proper etiquette for a business relationship is also important. In Mexico, for example, even a simple business call takes extra time. You need to ask about the other person's family, their day.
And even if you are fluent in the language, to understand even the first paragraph of a business contract, it's essential to have a legal adviser or skilled translator. And, of course, there's the challenge of operating in two currencies.
''If you're going to work abroad, the challenges are going to be exasperating, so don't just do it because you like it or you're good at it; do it because you really, really love it and enjoy every minute of doing it,'' Ms. Wynne counseled.

HEADLINE: Gone, but Still Linked To the Home Office

BYLINE: By AMY ZIPKIN

 BODY:
A FEW years after John McGowan, a former contracts negotiator at Hewlett-Packard, took early retirement in 2006 at age 59, a friend persuaded him to join the H.P. Agilent Retired Employees Club-Bay Area, one of more than a dozen H.P. retiree clubs in the United States and abroad. Last fall he became president of the 1,300-member group, whose activities include lunches, hikes, bowling, golf outings and community service.
''The club is an opportunity to stay connected with former colleagues,'' he said. 
As baby boomers approach retirement and consider their future, some are forging ties with their former colleagues and employers for social and philanthropic activities, and some for work, rather than devoting time to traditional civic and religious groups.
''For some individuals, where they found meaning, satisfaction, fulfillment and identity is in the work environment,'' said James Hinterlong, dean of the School of Social Work at Virginia Commonwealth University.
Companies including Hallmark, Ford Motor, Alcoa and FirstEnergy, as well as H.P., have extended the welcome mat for retirees, acknowledging that retiree relations can be good for business. Paula Davis, president of the Alcoa Foundation, called the company's retirees ''our brand ambassadors.''
Besides the volunteer-run clubs, some retirees participate in corporate-sponsored volunteer activities. Last August H.P. started Continuum, a social networking site that allows retirees to interact with each other; www.Alcoa.com/retirees provides news and information for that company's retirees.
While their reasons vary, retirees who stay connected to their former employers and each other say the experience is worthwhile.
Howard Freers, a former Ford chief engineer, is chairman of the 500-member Ford Retired Engineering Executives, in southeast Michigan. (Ford clubs are organized in 22 states, Canada and Britain.) The group's monthly lunches draw Ford executives as speakers and offer an opportunity to gauge the fiscal health of the company. ''We have a monetary interest,'' Mr. Freers said. ''A great number of us own Ford stock.''
Some experts question the long-term viability of retiree clubs if employees don't spend decades at an employer. John Rother, chief executive and president of the National Coalition on Health Care, an advocacy group in Washington, said, ''Fewer people work for a lifetime employer and don't identify with the company.'' According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a research group, the median tenure of workers in 2012 was 5.4 years, up from five years in 1983. Mr. Rother said changing employment practices toward more flexible work arrangements and an increasingly geographically diverse work force could also diminish the clubs' appeal.
Larry Greenberg, who is 61 and retired two years ago from Hallmark, has built sculptures from canned goods to promote employees' contributions to a food bank in the Kansas City area and created life-size gorillas from papier-mâché for an annual artists' project at the Kansas City Zoo. ''I love building something and exploring the edges of construction,'' he said. This year he is overseeing the decoration of bowling pins to resemble penguins; they will be raffle prizes and donor gifts when a penguin exhibit opens in the fall.
Others venture farther afield.
When Alan Nemeth, 65, was an H.P. Fellow, he was responsible for orchestrating the technology infrastructure for the Hôpital Universitaire de Mirebalais, a new hospital about 30 miles outside Port-au-Prince, Haiti, that was developed by Partners in Health, a health advocacy organization based in Boston.
When the H.P. organizing team first met in July 2010, Mr. Nemeth was working at the company full time. He identified 50 volunteer colleagues who could judge how much room a server would need, what the air-conditioning requirements were and which hardware was essential. The project had setbacks. The hospital opening was delayed several times. In June 2012, he was offered and took early retirement from H.P. and increased his participation in the Haiti project to about 40 hours a month; last month, he made his first trip to Haiti in April for an opening celebration.
Increasingly, would-be retirees want to continue working, perhaps in tandem with philanthropy.
Nicole Maestas, an economist at the RAND Corporation, has studied what she calls ''unretirement.'' In ''Back to Work,'' a paper published in The Journal of Human Resources in 2010, she found individuals went through multistage retirement transitions, and as many as half the youngest retirees returned to work. (As the data was collected before the recession, there was little evidence of financial shocks, poor planning or lower levels of wealth to influence the decision.)
Some retirees find their corporate ties can provide opportunities for entrepreneurship.
Patricia A. Flaherty retired in April 2010 at age 57 from Ford Motor as human resources director of Ford Learning and Development. She soon volunteered at Starfish Family Services, a center for families in metro Detroit, where she said she helped administrators review and refine management processes, and also formed a consulting firm, PF Enterprises. Within three months of leaving Ford, she landed her first assignment when former colleagues asked her to help complete and teach a module in leadership development and strategic planning. More recently, she has been approved by Ford as a leadership coach.
Ken Williams started KRBK Industries in December 2012, when he retired as director of manufacturing for transmissions and axles at Ford. While he anticipated that it might take longer, he signed his first client, a previous supplier to his plant, in less than a month and has since signed a second contract. ''My experience, network and knowledge at Ford helped me launch the business,'' he said.
And Mr. McGowan, the president of the Bay Area club, is also doing part-time consulting with a training company in Marin Country, Calif, where he is working with clients to develop custom training materials for sales and procurement professionals.
''There is a diversity of adaptations, as older men and women seek to extend their working lives,'' said Ms. Maestas at RAND. ''It's an adaptive process from both sides.''

HEADLINE: 4% Rule for Retirement Withdrawals Is Golden No More

BYLINE: By EILENE ZIMMERMAN

 BODY:
ONE thing most retirees want to avoid is outliving their money. Since the mid-1990s many of them have relied on a staple of retirement planning known as the 4 percent rule to avoid that. Although the name says 4 percent, the rule is that if retirees withdraw 4.5 percent of their savings every year, adjusted for inflation, their nest egg should last 30 years, the length of time generally used for retirement planning.
That percentage was calculated at a time when portfolios were earning about 8 percent. Not so anymore. Today portfolios generally earn much less, about 3.5 percent to 4 percent, and stocks are high-priced, which is linked historically to below-average future performance. Many financial advisers are rejecting the 4 percent rule as out of touch with present realities. 
The rule was created in 1993 by Bill Bengen, owner of Bengen Financial Services in San Diego, who examined every 30-year retirement period since 1926, reconstructing market conditions and inflation. He identified 1969 as the worst year for retirees because a combination of low returns and high inflation had eroded the value of savings. Using that as his worst case, Mr. Bengen tested different withdrawal percentages to see which one would allow savings to last 30 years. At first 4 percent worked, he says, based on a portfolio with a 60/40 split between large-cap stocks and intermediate-term government bonds. After research, Mr. Bengen decided to add small-cap stocks to the mix and revised his recommendation to 4.5 percent. The 4 percent name, however, stuck.
Michael Finke, a professor in the department of personal financial planning at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, is a co-author of a paper critical of the rule, ''The 4 Percent Rule Is Not Safe in a Low-Yield World.'' He says Mr. Bengen's rule doesn't acknowledge the new economic reality of prolonged low returns. ''There haven't been any historical periods that look like today,'' Mr. Finke said. ''We've never had an extended period where rates of returns on bonds have been so low and valuation on stocks so high.''
Strict application of the rule also does not factor in how important returns are in the early years of retirement, something known as the sequence of returns. ''The first years of returns have an outsize impact on your retirement savings sustainability,'' Mr. Finke said. He used an example of $500,000 in savings earning zero for the first five years of retirement. Applying the 4 percent rule (that is, 4.5 percent), you will withdraw $22,500 a year. At the end of five years, your portfolio is left with $387,500. If returns go up, they are being earned on a smaller amount of savings than if you had gotten positive returns those first five years or had withdrawn less, Mr. Finke said. ''You have less money to use to earn money for the next 25 years.''
High inflation early in retirement can have a similar impact, especially if earnings are also low. Taking out more money just to keep up with the rising cost of living will accelerate the depletion of savings, Mr. Finke said. Although the inflation rate today is 1.5 percent, historically it has been about 5 percent, he said.
Many advisers recommend maximizing earnings by moving away from the 60 /40 portfolio allocation on which the 4 percent rule is based, says Jay Wertz, director of wealth advisory services at Johnson Investment Counsel, a wealth management firm in Cincinnati: As interest rates have fallen and stayed low, ''earning 2 to 3 percent on 40 percent of your assets for the next several decades doesn't really make sense.''
Retirees wanting more certainty in the future might consider investing in a deferred income annuity, Mr. Finke said. Deferred income annuities pay a yearly income that kicks in later in life -- usually starting about age 80 or 85. Rather than an investment, Mr. Finke says, it is essentially ''an insurance product you buy so that you won't run out of money in old age.''
Steve Vernon, a retirement consultant with the Institutional Retirement Income Council and author of ''Money for Life: Turn Your IRA and 401(k) Into a Lifetime Retirement Paycheck,'' advises investing up to half of retirement savings in an immediate fixed annuity, which starts payouts when you retire. The annual income usually ranges from 5 to 6 percent of the amount paid for the annuity, and those payouts, together with Social Security, should be used to cover basic living expenses, he said, and ''the remainder of savings should be invested and systematically withdrawn to cover everything else.'' Another option is a managed payout fund, especially for people who do not want to actively manage their money. These funds, offered by Vanguard and Schwab among others, invest savings for you and send out a check each month that is a combination of investment income and a return of principal.
Because it is based on how much the investments earn, the payout can vary, Mr. Vernon said. Some funds have target dates when they will end, and others aim to pay indefinitely. (They can even be inherited.) But none come with payment guarantees. If the market goes south, the money in a managed payout fund can run out prematurely. It also can be withdrawn at any time.
Mr. Bengen still feels his rule is a good benchmark, but advises clients to spend more conservatively. When he first came up with the 4 percent rule, ''people said, 'How can anyone live on so little?' Now they are saying it's too high. I think it's a lot to ask people who have saved their whole lives to live on 3 percent.'' But Mr. Wertz says the 4.5 percent withdrawal rate may really be too high, especially for those heavily invested in bonds. Those retirees ''are likely to fail miserably using the 4 percent rule,'' he says. ''They aren't generating the returns to fuel it.''

HEADLINE: How They Do It Elsewhere

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
THE United States can boast that it has the world's best basketball players, fighter jets and country and western singers. But hardly anyone would ever boast that the United States has the world's best retirement system.
Fifty-eight percent of American workers are not even in a pension or 401(k) plan. The Social Security system faces the threat of a huge shortfall. One-third of America's retirees get at least 90 percent of their retirement income from Social Security, with annual benefits averaging a modest $15,000 for an individual. And just ask any participant in a 401(k) plan about the scary roller-coaster ride of the last six years.
Scores of other countries have elaborate retirement systems, and some of them avoid the biggest pitfalls of America's retirement system.
In Australia, there is nearly universal participation among workers in a 401(k)-type retirement plan because of a government mandate. In the Netherlands, pension laws require that workers' 401(k)-like plans be converted into lifetime annuities to ensure they do not spend down all their savings before they turn 75 or 80. 
In Britain, the government has pressed retirement fund managers to keep administrative fees on many plans to less than half the average in the United States.
A new report ranking various countries' retirement systems gives the United States a C, considerably worse than the A received by Denmark and the B-plus given to the Netherlands and Australia. The study, by the Mercer consulting firm and the Australian Center for Financial Services, weighs adequacy of benefits, breadth of coverage and other factors, and points to numerous weaknesses in the American system.
Those shortcomings include contribution rates too low to assure adequate retirements for middle-class Americans and many workers withdrawing large sums from their 401(k)'s before they retire.
The report also cites poverty-level retirement benefits for many low-income workers and pensions that fail to keep up with inflation. It also points to the common practice of retirees withdrawing large sums from their 401(k)'s soon after retiring, leaving many without an adequate income stream if they live past 80.
Lia van Wijk, 58, the chief financial officer at a policy research center in Amsterdam, praises the Dutch retirement system, which combines a Social Security-like fund with a nearly universal pension system to which employers contribute.
''It's rather a good system,'' she said, noting that she had at first worried that she would not have a large enough pension because she had once spent many years traveling abroad. But now she feels reassured, having steered additional money into her pension fund.
Ms. Van Wijk likes the Dutch system of converting workers' pension reserves into an annuity upon retirement. ''There are real advantages to taking an annuity,'' she said.
She complained, however, that the Netherlands had increased its retirement age from 65 to 66 1/2. Fearing budget deficits and large unfunded retirement liabilities, the Netherlands has joined Britain, Italy, the United States and other countries in raising its retirement age, a move that increases contributions to the system while holding down outlays.
''The Dutch realize that there can be too much leakage,'' said Peter Kiveron, director of the Holland Financial Center, a research group, insisting that the United States and other countries make it too easy for people to take large amounts out of their 401(k)'s long before they retire and as soon as they retire, causing people to run out of funds well before they turn 75 or 80. ''The Dutch have learned their lessons and have a very rigid system.''
Even a cursory study of retirement systems abroad makes clear that many countries are far more willing than the United States to mandate painful steps by employers and workers.
Chile requires workers to contribute 10 percent of each paycheck to a 401(k)-type fund. In Australia, employers must contribute 9 percent of each worker's salary into a retirement fund, and that contribution is set to rise to 12 percent in 2020. Australia's politicians, conservative and liberal, concluded that the country's version of social security was providing retirees with too paltry a basic retirement check.
In the United States, such moves would prompt many to denounce heavy-handed grabs of workers' pay and expensive burdens on employers. But experts say it would be wise to study other nations' systems for tips on strengthening America's system.
John A. Turner, director of the Pension Policy Center in Washington, said some foreign features might not fit American culture, like mandated participation in the pension system as in Australia and Chile. He does not advocate such a mandate.
''We're quite different from many other countries,'' he said. ''There's an emphasis on individual freedoms and rights and responsibilities versus collectivism -- although I admit we will never have high pension coverage without some form of mandate.''
''In the United States, collective is a four-letter word,'' agreed Harry Smorenberg, head of a Netherlands-based consulting firm on pensions and founder of the World Pension Summit.
The United States does have some mandates, although they are often overlooked. Employers must pay 6.2 percent of each employee's salary into Social Security, and every employee must also contribute that amount.
A second pillar of America's retirement system -- 401(k)'s -- is voluntary, although some employers have embraced automatic enrollment for their employees while giving them the right to opt out. The third pillar is individual savings, including individual retirement accounts or I.R.A.'s. The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College warned that 53 percent of American households were at risk of not having enough to maintain their living standards in retirement.
Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economics at the New School, said America's voluntary system was badly broken because nearly six out of 10 workers were not in pension or 401(k) plans. She favors an Australia-type mandate.
''We use our tax code far more than other countries to try to encourage socially beneficial behavior,'' she said. ''We're spending hundreds of billions of dollars to incent people to save for retirement through 401(k)'s and I.R.A.'s. That costs us a huge amount of money without much effect on getting people to save for retirement.''
Other countries' systems offer a variety of contrasts:
¶ In France, the retirement age is 60, rising to 62 in 2017. In Britain, it is 67, with some calling that callously high. (Americans born from 1943 to 1959 qualify for full retirement benefits at age 66, and those born in 1960 or later qualify at 67, although people can begin receiving reduced retirement benefits at age 62.)
¶ In Chile, when women give birth, the government makes a special bonus contribution into their 401(k)-type plan to compensate for the months away from their job when they would not be contributing to those plans.
¶ In Sweden, if the nation's overall social security financing worsens from one year to the next, that country's fiscal guardians -- to prevent huge, unfunded liabilities -- set a slightly lower annual retirement benefit for all who reach retirement age that year (remaining unchanged until they die). And if Sweden's social security finances improve the following year, there is a recalculation, and those who reach retirement age the next year will receive slightly higher benefits throughout retirement.
¶ In Britain, when young workers first sign up for a 401(k)-type plan, the default option in the government's main new savings plan has them investing mainly in bonds -- while in the United States young workers are advised to invest mainly in stocks.
''In the U.K., they say first-time savers are very sensitive to losing money early on, so they put them in bond funds so they'll have positive returns,'' said David C. John, an economist at the AARP's Public Policy Institute. ''As time goes on, they'll be moved more into equities.''
¶ In the Netherlands, if a company is deemed unable to finance its long-term pension obligations, the central bank can order reduced benefits for current and future retirees to help keep the company afloat. United States law bars companies from reducing pension benefits they have contractually agreed to.
''We took drastic action to get these plans back into a safety zone,'' Mr. Smorenberg, the Dutch pension consultant, said.
¶ Singapore requires employees to contribute 20 percent of their pay and employers 16 percent toward a savings fund for retirement, health care and housing. The government guarantees a 2.5 annual return. Despite the high percentage contributed, many Singaporeans end up without enough money for retirement because they withdraw large sums to buy houses.
Despite such disparate strategies, many countries have similar worries. ''Every country is worried about workers saving enough and about increasing longevity,'' Professor Ghilarducci said. ''Every country is worried about investing retirement funds correctly, and every country wants to minimize risks to the taxpayer so there aren't large, unknown bills in the future.''
In 1986, when Australia's social security program provided average retirement benefits of just one-third of preretirement pay, Parliament, pushed by labor unions, began requiring employers to contribute 3 percent of employee earnings into a 401(k)-like fund. When that still left many Australians near poverty in retirement, legislators increased the contribution to 9 percent.
Alan Matheson, 75, a retired social worker and minister who lives near Melbourne, said the Australian system had been good to him and his wife, Barbara, 69, a retired nurse. Both receive social security benefits while drawing from their retirement savings. ''The system works well if you own a house,'' he said. ''But if you don't own your own house or if you're single, things will be more difficult for you.''
He said Australians backed the plan to raise retirement contributions to 9 percent and then 12 percent because ''there's a widespread acceptance by the population that with the aging of the population, the government is not going to be able to pay its Age Pension,'' the Australian name for the social security system.
Australian workers have several investment options, including investment funds set up by companies and unions, and ''retail'' funds, much like mutual funds. Experts estimated that an Australian worker who contributes for 30 years into such a fund will have retirement income equal to 70 percent of preretirement pay -- the percentage that many experts recommend.
''Before compulsion we found that most people didn't save enough for retirement,'' said Ian Silk, chief executive of AustralianSuper, a multi-employer pension fund. He called the mandate ''the single most important feature of the Australian system.''
Dana M. Muir, a pension expert at the University of Michigan, opposes a compulsory plan like Australia's, but she said the United States should borrow one aspect of the Australian system: no legal liability if a company makes imprudent decisions in setting up a 401(k)-type plan. The risk of legal liability, Professor Muir said, is a big reason many American businesses decide not to set up 401(k) plans -- and a major reason the American participation rate is so low.
Although Australia's plan is praised, experts say it has one major flaw. It does not provide an annuity option for most retirees, meaning many run the risk of emptying out their retirement fund long before they die.
In 2007, New Zealand created the world's first nationwide, government-sponsored savings plan that automatically enrolls workers, while giving them the option not to participate.
The''KiwiSaver'' plan -- built alongside the basic social security-type system -- gives employees the option of contributing 3, 4 or 8 percent of their pay, with employers required to contribute 3 percent. Workers choose which investment funds to put KiwiSaver money in, and those who do not choose are steered into six conservatively invested funds.
To encourage participation, the government provides a $1,000 tax-free ''kick-start'' contribution for each new participant upon enrollment, as well as a housing down payment of up to $5,000 after someone has participated in the program for three years.
The government determines investment offerings, but there are not dozens, as in the United States. ''If you look at the U.S. experience,'' said Mr. John of the AARP, ''having tons of investment alternatives drives some people away from participating.''
Chile reformed its retirement system during the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet. In 1981, he largely replaced the country's traditional social security-type plan with a 401(k)-type plan for everyone who entered the work force from that year onward.
Under the plan, 10 percent of each employee's salary was automatically deposited into a 401(k)-type retirement fund, with workers having a choice of investment options. Today more than 90 percent of Chilean workers are in the system, which resembles, but goes further than, the partial Social Security privatization that President George W. Bush pushed unsuccessfully.
Patricio Navia, a professor of political science at the Diego Portales University in Chile, said the system was effective in getting most Chileans to save significant amounts for retirement. But he said there were shortcomings. The number of major investment funds has shrunk to six, from 15, leaving limited competition that has resulted in high fees.
And those unemployed for long stretches or working in the informal economy often did not save enough for retirement, causing the government to adopt a supplementary system in 2008 to top up the retirement funds of low-income retirees.
Another problem: As many Chileans paid into their new 401(k)-type plans instead of social security, that strained the financing of the pay-as-you-go social security plan. ''For the U.S., making such a transition would be extremely costly,'' Professor Navia said. ''You can't meet all your obligations in the pay-as-you-go system without receiving the money from people who are still working.''
In Britain, the government long had a voluntary savings program to supplement its main social security system. But officials grew alarmed that just a third of Britain's workers were participating, so it enacted a 401(k)-type program that all employers must participate in unless they already have pension plans.
Under the program, employers must enroll all their employees in a retirement plan, although workers can opt out. The employer contributes 3 percent of each worker's pay, the worker contributes 4 percent and the government 1 percent. The goal is to raise the worker participation rate to at least 70 percent.
''So far the opt-out rate is low -- that's very encouraging,'' said Jane Vass, director of public policy at Age UK, Britain's version of the AARP.
Many participants are not even choosing from the array of investment options. ''The research shows that many employees didn't want a large amount of choice because that makes decisions more difficult,'' Ms. Vass said. ''So the vast bulk of people go for the default scheme,'' often a target date fund.
Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, has proposed creating a mandatory retirement savings plan much like Britain's, with modest contributions by employers and employees. But in a country with a distaste for government mandates, his proposal could face rough going.
Mr. John of AARP said the United States could borrow only so much from other countries' ideas. ''Each country's retirement system reflects their culture, their identity and their history,'' he said. ''It would be a mistake to assume that because something works in country 'X' it will work in the United States.''

HEADLINE: St. Louis Development Makes a Play for a Home Team Advantage

BYLINE: By JOE GOSE

 BODY:
When the new Busch Stadium opened in 2006, the occasional mudhole along adjacent property symbolized the failure of a planned companion project aimed at revitalizing downtown St. Louis.
The St. Louis Cardinals had proposed the $650 million mixed-use project, known as Ballpark Village, for the 10 acres north of the new stadium. But those grand plans were thwarted by the combination of the financial crisis, the recession and a soft real estate market, making development feasible for only a softball field and a parking lot, leaving bare ground that became the object of widespread ridicule.
By next season's opening day, however, the Cardinals and their development partner, the Baltimore-based Cordish Companies, hope to open the first phase of Ballpark Village -- a $100 million entertainment, restaurant and retail project -- just beyond the stadium's left center field wall. 
''I always have said that if we could just get it going, all the heartache would be worth it,'' said William O. DeWitt III, president of the Cardinals. ''I still feel that way.''
The project has a chance to provide downtown St. Louis with one more reason to cheer outside the ballpark. Population in the urban center has grown to 14,000, from 9,600 in 2005, and apartment occupancy exceeds 90 percent, according to the Partnership for Downtown St. Louis.
In turn, that is spurring more residential and retail development. An affiliate of Spinnaker Real Estate Partners of Norwalk, Conn., for example, has largely completed a $250 million conversion of an old mall and surrounding buildings into an entertainment, retail, residential and hotel district, Mercantile Exchange, that is a 10-minute walk from Busch Stadium.
By taking advantage of the Cardinals as an anchor tenant and creating a buzz with the first phase, Ballpark Village could help encourage additional renewal in the city, said Andrew S. Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., who specializes in economic development and sports economics.
He pointed to Petco Park in San Diego, which helped attract billions of dollars in private investment in the surrounding area over the last few years.
''None of these projects are exactly alike,'' Mr. Zimbalist said. ''But the general notion is that a sports facility can regenerate economic life in an area if it's developed properly, put in the right place and has private capital committed to build around it.''
The 100,000-square-foot first phase of Ballpark Village will feature a fresh-air pavilion with a retractable canopy for year-round events.
The retail and restaurant portion is building on St. Louis institutions: the Cardinals, of course, and Budweiser, the signature beer of Anheuser-Busch, part of Belgian-based Anheuser-Busch InBev.
Both organizations will showcase their brands in themed restaurants: Cardinals Nation and Budweiser Brew House. Cardinals Nation will also feature a hall of fame and museum. Additionally, both restaurants will include rooftop decks that look into Busch Stadium.
Creating a development that provided such views was uppermost in the minds of Cardinals officials as they planned the new stadium and Ballpark Village, Mr. DeWitt said.
The vision stemmed from the residential rooftops that overlook Wrigley Field in Chicago, he added, which to him seemed to integrate the stadium into the fabric of the city.
''We wanted that interaction,'' said Mr. DeWitt, whose father bought the Cardinals in 1995. ''I've always been fascinated by having something across the street and creating a window into the ballpark.''
Later phases call for office, residential and hotel development.
The way that the first phase was financed may ensure construction of later phases, said Chase Martin, development director for Cordish, whichhas completed entertainment-oriented and mixed-use projects in Kansas City, Mo.; Louisville, Ky.; Philadelphia; and other markets.
While the city and state approved a plan using new taxes generated at the site to pay for the sewers, utilities and streets needed on the entire 10-acre lot, St. Louis would not guarantee bonds to finance the deal. So the Cardinals and Cordish ultimately decided to buy them, leaving more of the project's finances in their own hands.
''Obviously, this upfront investment in future phase infrastructure speaks to our confidence in the future of Ballpark Village and the downtown in general,'' said Mr. Martin, who is overseeing the project.
How deep that confidence extends to the office market remains to be seen, however. The downtown office vacancy rate, 25.2 percent, and an average lease rate of $15.06 a square foot rank as the worst fundamentals of any St. Louis submarket, said Jeff Kaiser, managing director in the St. Louis office of the brokerage firm CBRE.
''Leasing activity has been pretty stagnant over the past several years -- there's no migration out to the suburbs and no new growth coming in,'' he said. ''It really doesn't justify building any new office supply.''
While Mr. Kaiser suggests that future office growth could occur in the financial and technical sectors, for now he's more bullish on residential development downtown.
Developers have completed $1.6 billion worth of new housing since 1999, according to the Partnership for Downtown, and $168 million is currently in development.
Much of the activity has centered on the conversion of old office buildings into apartments with the help of historic preservation tax credits, Mr. Kaiser said.
Ballpark Village plans include a residential tower that would look into Busch Stadium, and the Cardinals and Cordish officials are keeping a close watch on downtown's residential market. If it continues to be strong, they acknowledge, construction could begin sooner than anticipated.
Downtown promoters suggest that the baseball team's admirers alone may provide more than enough demand.
''There are enough passionate St. Louis Cardinals fans in the area that they will pay the money to be there, whether the units are rented or sold as condos,'' said Matt Schindler, senior manager of community development with the Partnership for Downtown. ''It would do very well.''

HEADLINE: In Role Reversal, Goldman Chief Advises Dimon

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
Jamie Dimon has consulted lawyers, public relation experts and bankers as JPMorgan Chase wrestles with the fallout from a multibillion-dollar trading loss. But the bank chief has received advice from an unexpected corner: Lloyd C. Blankfein of rival Goldman Sachs.
The two executives have talked privately a number of times in recent months about the challenges that Mr. Dimon is facing, people with knowledge of the relationship but not authorized to speak on the matter, have said. 
JPMorgan is battling a shareholder vote on whether to separate Mr. Dimon's positions as chief executive and chairman, and is also dealing with a number of regulatory investigations. The vote is coming to a head. Within the last week shareholders have been casting their ballots, but at least a handful of major shareholders have yet to vote, according to others briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak on the record.
The conversations between Wall Street's two most powerful chieftains represent a reversal of roles. It is now Mr. Dimon who is in a harsh public spotlight, seemingly at odds with regulators. It was not long ago that Mr. Blankfein was being questioned by Congress over accusations that Goldman had misled investors during the financial crisis over the sale of mortgage-backed securities.
Now, with Goldman cleared of crisis-era investigations and its profits rising, Mr. Blankfein is enjoying something of a renaissance as an elder statesman of Wall Street.
''I would call them foul weather friends,'' said one person with knowledge of the relationship who was not authorized to speak on the record.
Foxhole buddies might be a better metaphor. Both executives steered their firms through the tumult and panic of the financial crisis.
Yet while the JPMorgan chieftain emerged from the crisis hailed as Washington's favorite banker, Goldman's chief was cast by many as a villain.
Having survived that trial by fire, Mr. Blankfein is advising Mr. Dimon that the current storm will eventually pass, just as it appears to have done so for Goldman, the people with knowledge of the relationship said.
Goldman's experiences does offer lessons. At a recent meeting of top financial services industry executives, Mr. Dimon asked a small group of people, which included a top-ranking Goldman executive but not Mr. Blankfein, how Goldman managed to avoid having to put forward to shareholders a vote on whether to split the job of chairman and chief executive, according to one attendee and others briefed on the conversation.
Goldman, one person explained to Mr. Dimon, worked hard behind the scenes with its shareholders to head off such a vote, persuading them that the firm had a strong, independent lead director on its board.
While the consultations may be recent, the two men -- both native New Yorkers -- have long had a cordial relationship. Both are members of the Financial Services Roundtable and they have crossed paths at Manhattan fund-raisers, like the annual dinner of the Robin Hood Foundation, which raises money to fight poverty in New York City.
When together, they often try to outwit each other, said one person who has seen the two in action. At a meeting a few years ago, the person recalled, Mr. Dimon responded to a comment by Mr. Blankfein by asking, ''Lloyd, are you still trying to do God's work?'' a reference to an oft-quoted remark the Goldman chief executive made to a reporter in 2009.
People close to Mr. Blankfein, who turns 59 in September, and Mr. Dimon, who is 57, emphasize that when the executives talk it is typically on a variety of issues, and it would be unusual for a call to be focused solely on Mr. Dimon's current situation.
The shareholder vote and questions about Mr. Dimon's leadership have come about even as the bank has generated a string of record quarterly profits. On Tuesday, a JPMorgan executive told a conference that trading revenue was running 10 to 15 percent higher this quarter, compared with the second quarter a year ago.
Yet the bank continues to be haunted by the trading losses at its chief investment office in London more than a year ago. JPMorgan has moved to put the problem behind it, firing traders at the center of the disastrous bet, seeking to regain millions of dollars in compensation and reshuffling its executive ranks.
But investigations and a Senate report and hearing that accused the bank of misleading investors and regulators have kept the spotlight on the bank. Other investigations have raised questions about the bank's controls and relations with regulators.
Paul A. Argenti, a professor of corporate communications at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, said that while JPMorgan did an excellent public relations job handling the trading losses, the bank's public relations strategy is not enough to tackle the broader issues.
''This has ceased to be about the 'Whale' and it's become about whether you can trust this institution and this executive again,'' he said. Now, Mr. Dimon is bracing for the outcome of a looming vote that could threaten his position as JPMorgan's chairman and chief executive, dual roles he has held since 2006. The nonbinding vote, which will be announced on May 21 at JPMorgan's annual meeting in Tampa, Fla., is expected to be close. In 2012, 40 percent of shareholders voted to split the two roles.
Still, JPMorgan says despite the travails of the last year, surveys show customers are still happy with the bank. JPMorgan ranked No. 4 in the nation for customer service, in J.D. Power's latest tally, and top among the nation's largest banks.
And the bank may take comfort in Mr. Blankfein's counsel that Mr. Dimon will cycle out of the headlines.
Mr. Blankfein has had a public image makeover, thanks in part to initiatives by Goldman. After the financial crisis, Goldman announced new charitable efforts, started an advertising campaign and showed an increased willingness to engage with the media.
Then, earlier in 2012, it hired Richard Siewert Jr., a former White House spokesman and counselor to former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Budget Deficit Shrinks Faster Than Expected

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Since the recession ended four years ago, the federal budget deficit has topped $1 trillion every year. But now the government's annual deficit is shrinking far faster than anyone in Washington expected, and perhaps even faster than many economists think is advisable for the health of the economy.
That is the thrust of a new report released Tuesday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, estimating that the deficit for this fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, will fall to about $642 billion, or 4 percent of the nation's annual economic output, about $200 billion lower than the agency estimated just three months ago. 
The agency forecast that the deficit, which topped 10 percent of gross domestic product in 2009, could shrink to as little as 2.1 percent of gross domestic product by 2015 -- a level that most analysts say would be easily sustainable over the long run -- before beginning to climb gradually through the rest of the decade.
"Revenues have been strong as the economy has outperformed a bit," said Joel Prakken, a founder of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm based in St. Louis.
Over all, the figures demonstrate how the economic recovery has begun to refill the government's coffers. At the same time, Washington, despite its political paralysis, has proved remarkably successful at slashing the deficit through a variety of tax increases and cuts in domestic and military programs.
Perhaps too successful. Given that the economy continues to perform well below its potential and that unemployment has so far failed to fall below 7.5 percent, many economists are cautioning that the deficit is coming down too fast, too soon.
''It's good news for the budget deficit and bad news for the jobs deficit,'' said Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-of-center research group in Washington. ''I'm more worried about the latter.''
Others, however, are warning that the deficit -- even if it looks manageable over the next decade -- still remains a major long-term challenge, given that rising health care spending on the elderly and debt service payments are projected to eat up a bigger and bigger portion of the budget as the baby boom generation enters retirement.
''It takes a little heat off, and undercuts the sense of fiscal panic that prevailed one or two years ago when the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio was climbing,'' said Mr. Prakken, of referring to the growth of the country's debt relative to the size of the economy. ''These revisions probably release some pressure to reach a longer-term deal, which is too bad, because the longer-term problem hasn't gone away.''
With the government running a hefty $113 billion surplus in the tax payment month of April, according to the Treasury, analysts now do not expect the country to run out of room under its debt ceiling -- a statutory borrowing limit Congress needs to raise to avoid default -- until sometime in the fall. That has left both Democrats and Republicans hesitant to enter another round of negotiations over painful cuts to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, and tax increases on a broader swath of Americans, despite the still-heated rhetoric on both sides.
For the moment, the deficit is largely repairing itself. Just three months ago, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the current-year deficit would be $845 billion, or about 5.3 percent of economic output.
The $200 billion reduction to the estimated deficit comes not from the $85 billion in mandatory cuts known as sequestration, nor from the package of tax increases that Congress passed this winter to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff. The office had already incorporated those policy changes into its February forecasts.
Rather, it comes from higher-than-expected tax payments from businesses and individuals, as well as an increase in payments from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance companies the government took over as part of the wave of bailouts thrust upon Washington in the darkest days of the financial crisis.
The C.B.O. said it had bumped up its estimates of current-year tax receipts from individuals by about $69 billion and from corporations by about $40 billion. The office said the factors lifting tax payments seemed to be ''largely temporary,'' due in part, probably, to higher-income households realizing gains from investments before tax rates went up in the 2013 calendar year.
It also reduced its estimated outlays on Fannie and Freddie by about $95 billion. The mortgage giants, which have required more than $180 billion in taxpayer financing since the government rescued them in 2008, have returned to profitability in recent quarters on the back of a stronger housing market and have begun to repay the Treasury for the loans.
But there is a darker side to the brighter outlook for the deficit. The immediate spending cuts and tax increases Congress agreed to for this year are serving as a partial brake on the recovery, cutting government jobs and preventing growth from accelerating to a more robust pace, many economists have warned. The International Monetary Fund has called the country's pace of deficit reduction ''overly strong,'' arguing that Washington should delay some of its budget cuts while adopting a longer-term strategy to hold down future deficits.
In revising its estimates for the current year, the budget office also cut its projections of the 10-year cumulative deficit by $618 billion. Those longer-term adjustments are mostly a result of smaller projected outlays for the entitlement programs of Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare, as well as smaller interest payments on the debt.
The report noted that the growth in health care costs seemed to have slowed -- a trend that, if it lasted, would eliminate much of the budget pressure and probably help restore a stronger economy as well. The C.B.O. has quietly erased hundreds of billions of dollars in projected government health spending over the last few years.
It did so again on Tuesday. In February, the budget office projected that the United States would spend about $8.1 trillion on Medicare and $4.4 trillion on Medicaid over the next 10 fiscal years. It now projects it will spend $7.9 trillion on Medicare and $4.3 trillion on Medicaid.

HEADLINE: 'Cleopatra' and Her Jewels Shine Again

BYLINE: By DAVID BELCHER

 BODY:
CANNES -- Of all the grand excesses in cinematic history -- the production budgets that spun out of control, the rewrites, the love affairs -- one movie stands out as the ultimate example of Hollywood ambition gone bust. ''Cleopatra,'' the 1963 film that nearly bankrupted 20th Century Fox and ignited the Elizabeth Taylor-Richard Burton firestorm, a love affair draped in jewels and scandal, is being shown in a restored version at the Cannes International Film Festival this month.
From there it will go on to open at more than 200 cinemas worldwide May 22 before being released in a special-edition Blu-ray on May 28. A half-century later, this ''Cleopatra'' is still the most misunderstood -- albeit somewhat long-winded and over-dressed -- gal in Hollywood. 
''Cleopatra'' -- and the Taylor-Burton scandal that became every bit as infamous -- is also a rich and somewhat mysterious slice of jewelry history. In addition to producing several pieces of jewelry inspired by Taylor's collection over the years, Bulgari is buying back some of her most famous pieces for its permanent Heritage Collection, several of which will be displayed during the Cannes festival, along with many of the costumes from ''Cleopatra.'' (Taylor was reported to have had 65 costume changes, and virtually all of the jewelry she wore in the movie was costume jewelry, including the serpent armband reminiscent of the Bulgari motif.)
Many of Taylor's jewels from those years are now steeped in folklore. And there's the unanswered question of just how Burton paid for them all.
''I introduced Elizabeth to beer. She introduced me to Bulgari,'' Burton once said. ''The only word Elizabeth knows in Italian is Bulgari.''
As Burton's mistress and wife, Taylor was lavished with gobs of Bulgari -- in addition to other jewelers, most famously the Taylor-Burton diamond ring by Harry Winston and a pearl, ruby and diamond necklace by Cartier that sold for nearly $12 million at Christie's two years ago in New York, which also auctioned many of Taylor's clothes, including her yellow chiffon wedding dress from 1964.
Her most famous Bulgari pieces include an emerald-and-diamond necklace and detachable brooch that had been her engagement gift from Burton, the 18.6-carat emerald ring surrounded by pear-cut diamonds for their 1964 wedding day and the sapphire necklace he gave Taylor for her 40th birthday in 1972 (Burton bought it for an estimated $600,000 to $800,000; Bulgari bought it back at auction for nearly $6 million).
Amanda Triossi, curator of the Bulgari Heritage Collection, has been in charge of buying back Taylor's Bulgari pieces -- 7 of about 20 so far -- as well as gathering information about their history. She researched the Bulgari archives and media coverage and even interviewed a long-term employee who worked at the time at the flagship store on the Via del Condotti in Rome.
''Apparently Liz summoned Bulgari to the Cinecittà studios and tried on an emerald ring almost identical to the one Sybil Burton had tried on earlier,'' said Ms. Triossi, referring to Richard Burton's wife (soon to be former wife). ''Richard Burton later gave Elizabeth Taylor that very ring.''
But Bulgari also had a role in the life of another jilted partner in this saga: the singer Eddie Fisher, who was married to Taylor at the time. ''In February 1962 Eddie Fisher went to Bulgari in Rome and purchased quite a few yellow diamond jewels, drop earrings, a ring and a flower-spray brooch to try to woo her back,'' Ms. Triossi said. ''Eddie decided to try the Bulgari card.''
Anyone who is familiar with Taylor's grocery list of husbands knows how that ended.
''Elizabeth joked in her book 'My Love Affair With Jewelry' that when she didn't come back to him, Fisher presented her with a bill,'' Ms. Triossi said.
But a few of Taylor's pieces are veiled in mystery, including the Bulgari serpent watch, a design that has become popular over the years and was featured prominently in Bulgari's ad campaign last year featuring the actress Rachel Weisz.
''One of our first serpent watches appears on her in a photo from the set of 'Cleopatra.' We know it was sold in 1962, but there's no record accounting for who purchased it,'' Ms. Triossi said. ''It's a question mark. Who gave it to her?''
Ms. Triossi said Taylor never wrote about that piece, nor a Bulgari diamond necklace with Byzantine coins that she wore in 1976 when she announced her engagement to Senator John Warner. It is almost identical to a current Bulgari piece, a pink gold sautoir necklace with mother of pearl, antique silver coins and pavé diamonds.
Bulgari pieces inspired over the years by Taylor's collection include a necklace of emeralds, white gold, diamonds and sapphires that has a decidedly Egyptian motif, as well as a diamond and emerald brooch inspired by the famous engagement gift from Burton.
Taylor's Bulgari jewels -- either documented or not -- have made the 50th anniversary of ''Cleopatra'' a cause célèbre that nobody could have imagined 50 years after the love affair of the century upstaged the movie bomb of the century.
''Cleopatra'' cost an astounding $44 million -- more than $300 million today, adjusted for inflation -- and the Vatican publicly denounced the Burton-Taylor love affair, calling Taylor an unfit mother and ''social vagrant.'' Top that, Angelina Jolie, who is slated to play ''Cleopatra'' in a new film version.
''It's a paradox, really. The director of 'Cleopatra' once said the movie was conceived in a state of emergency, shot in confusion and wound up in a blind panic,'' said Ms. Triossi, referring to the famous quote by the director, Joseph L. Mankiewicz. ''But Cleopatra the queen holds great mystery, as does the Taylor and Burton affair. The fiasco of the film has ended up being an ongoing media sensation.''

HEADLINE: French Plan Would Tax Electronics, For Culture

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- France's ''cultural exception'' -- the policy that creative works like books, music and movies deserve protection beyond what is accorded ordinary goods -- is in line for a digital update.
A government adviser has suggested that manufacturers pay a 1 percent levy on the price of smartphones and tablet computers to help keep funding for such works alive, as more and more end up online and beyond the reach of existing taxes. 
The tax, ''painless for the consumer,'' could also be used to ensure that artists are remunerated at a time when so much is downloaded free, said the report, which was presented Monday to President François Hollande and his culture minister, Aurélie Filippetti.
''Considering the weight of cultural content in connected devices, it is legitimate that those who make and distribute the equipment contribute to the financing of its creation,'' according to the report, produced under the guidance of a former television executive and journalist, Pierre Lescure.
''L'exception culturelle'' is no trifling matter: Nicole Bricq, the French trade minister, warned in March that it was ''a red line'' that could not be crossed in talks with the United States on a proposed free-trade area. France and 13 other European Union member nations insisted in a letter this week that the audiovisual sector must be left out of those talks, setting up a possible confrontation with the British prime minister, David Cameron, who has said that everything should be on the table.
In practice, the cultural exception means broadcasters must meet quotas for French music and television programming, for example, and prices for books are set by regulators. The effort stretches throughout the economy, requiring a system of taxes and subsidies for its upkeep, perhaps most visibly in the country's film industry, which gets hundreds of million euros each year in subsidies -- raised from taxes on movie tickets, television stations and Internet service providers -- to defend itself from the Hollywood juggernaut.
But technology threatens to render such measures irrelevant, the report noted. The nature of Internet commerce means foreigners can have access to the French market without having to pay the levies that support French culture. And as more content is streamed online or stored in the cloud, a tax on recording media like blank compact discs and memory sticks will raise less money -- and that is where the smartphone tax comes in.
Gilles Vercken, an intellectual property lawyer, acknowledged that streaming and the cloud would bring down those levies, which he estimated currently raise about &#x20ac;200 million, or $260 million, a year to support French authors, composers, actors, musicians and the like. But he expressed skepticism that the smartphone tax would see the light of day.
''I wonder what could be the legal grounds for such taxes,'' he said, noting that the connection between hardware manufacturers and end users might prove a difficult one to defend in court. ''I really don't see it.''
Monica Horten, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics who studies the politics of intellectual property rights, said that, in principle, such levies were possible under E.U. law, but that ''the problem is in the implementation.''
The first issue would be drafting a law acceptable to the European Court of Justice, while another would be in actually getting device makers on board to pay the tax. ''I think you can expect them to filibuster,'' she said.
The report seeks to address a problem that is as old as the Internet, which has shifted the balance of power away from content creators in favor of newer actors like Google, Amazon and peer-to-peer downloading services, even as it gives creators previously unimagined opportunities to be seen or heard.
In addressing such matters, France has sometimes chosen to fight battles that other governments have shied away from. For instance, Google agreed in February to set up a &#x20ac;60 million fund to help French newspaper and magazine publishers develop their digital business, though it managed to fend off demands that it pay for the right to link to their content.
And the Lescure report comes less than two weeks after Arnaud Montebourg, the minister for industrial renewal, put the kibosh on a sale to Yahoo of a majority stake in Dailymotion, a French rival to YouTube, because the government had singled out the company as a national champion and did not want control falling into foreign hands.
The Lescure report also suggests that France throw out a ''three-strikes'' anti-piracy law that Nicolas Sarkozy, Mr. Hollande's predecessor, had held up as one of his signature achievements and one that had been hailed by the global entertainment industry. Under the Hadopi Law, as it is known, illegal downloaders were to have their Internet access cut off if they failed to heed three warnings; violators were also to be subject to criminal sanctions and large fines. In practice, there has been little enforcement action, though proponents credit the law with helping to reduce Internet piracy.
If Mr. Lescure's recommendations are followed, law enforcement will focus on the worst violators, and most people would face minimal fines. A proposed ''Hadopi authority'' would be eliminated, and responsibility for enforcement would revert to the national media regulator, the Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel.

HEADLINE: R. Donahue Peebles

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Peebles, 53, is the chairman and chief executive of the Peebles Corporation, one of the largest African-American-owned development companies in the country. The company, which has its headquarters in Coral Gables, Fla., specializes in residential and hospitality developments.
Interview conducted and condensed by 
VIVIAN MARINO
Q. Tell me a little more about your business.
A. We're a national local developer. We have done developments in Miami, Washington, San Francisco, Las Vegas and New York. In each of those key markets we have an on-the-ground presence, and generally speaking, I go to those markets, live there and build a business. So we organically grow the business.
One of the criteria is I have to like the place -- I enjoy being there myself. I'm from Washington, and in 1996 I went to Miami on vacation, liked it, saw an opportunity, and in '98 moved there and built a business there.
Q. You recently bought a home in Manhattan. Is New York your focus now?
A. New York is the greatest city in the world -- it's got lots and lots of energy. We have offices in New York, and I'm spending more of my time in New York. I live here and in Florida. My son goes to Columbia.
Q. So New York is important to your current business strategy.
A. Tremendously so.
Q. How many projects are you working on?
A. Right now we have four active in Manhattan, two active in Miami, one in Nevada and then we're exploring some opportunities in a couple of other markets.
So we have 346 Broadway, which is in TriBeCa on Leonard Street. That's about 400,000 square feet. We have a $350 million restoration.
We are also pursuing an opportunity in Harlem. We are negotiating on a project that will be in Queens and about 600,000 square feet of ground-up development, and we are pursuing a site downtown that would be ground up.
Q. What's the status of 346 Broadway?
A. 346 Broadway is a repositioning -- residential with potentially some hospitality. There will be condominiums -- somewhere around 200 and less. No affordable housing, but we are providing 15,000 square feet of community space for visual arts and community arts, and that will be on the ground floor.
It's a landmark building designed by one of the most prominent architects of their time. It's very Gothic.
We're doing the predevelopment work now -- the design and so forth -- and we're down to four premiere New York-based architects.
Q. What kind of prices per square foot are you looking to get for the condos?
A. I would see us starting in the mid- to upper teens, then going up from there. So about $1,500 to $1,600 and for the premier units north of $3,000.
Q. What else are you working on?
A. There's a series of properties that the city is going to be having a competition for and we're going to bid on those as well. This is on the Lower East Side. We're working with the local development authority in Jamaica, Queens, and that's a competitive process. The public-private process is a good way for a company like ours to enter the market.
We are currently working on assemblages in Harlem privately, for residential and commercial.
Q. You've dealt with a lot of foreign buyers in South Florida. Are you hoping to tap into these connections when it comes time to sell in New York?
A. Yes, to a degree. And we have experience in that. Miami's market has been driven by international buyers. In the last two recessions Miami came back fast because of these international buyers. Miami has become more of a global market, and New York is a global market.
Strategically, New York and Miami are very well connected. When you look at the last real estate cycle, much of the big boom in Miami took place because New York entrepreneurs and developers came to Miami to develop. And that's a very complicated market to build. The New York City government is a business-friendly organization, and Miami is the inverse. They don't want to see development, so they're reluctantly partners, especially in Miami Beach.
Q. You've been a major fund-raiser for President Obama. Who do you see yourself supporting for 2016?
A. No one can underestimate Joe Biden. He's been an amazing vice president, but Hillary Clinton would be a transformational president. It's about time for a woman to be president. She's superqualified. I think the country will be very well served to have her as president, and I would help her.

HEADLINE: South Korea Proposes Meeting With North

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea proposed on Tuesday to hold a border meeting with North Korea to discuss bringing finished goods and raw materials from an industrial park that the two countries jointly operated until last month. 
The Kaesong Industrial Complex has been idle since North Korea withdrew all its 53,000 workers, accusing the United States and South Korea of plotting to invade the North. South Korea pulled out the last of its citizens from Kaesong on May 3, severing the last economic ties between the Koreas.
Neither the North nor the South has officially closed the eight-year-old complex, the best-known symbol of inter-Korean cooperation. But its fate has become a test for inter-Korean relations.
President Park Geun-hye insisted that South Korea would not reward the North's bad behavior over Kaesong with compromises. But she said she was open to dialogue with North Korea to ''build trust.''
As a token of good faith, she said North Korea should allow South Korean factory owners to return to Kaesong in order to ship out millions of dollars' worth of finished goods stranded there.
''We call for a positive response from the North,'' Kim Hyung-suk, a spokesman for the South's Unification Ministry, said in a statement.
There was no immediate reaction from the North. It has rejected the South's two previous offers of dialogue over the fate of the Kaesong complex. It has indicated that it is willing to sacrifice the complex, and $90 million in badly needed hard currency that its workers earn annually, to show its anger at South Korea's policy toward the North.
The industrial park, where 123 South Korean factories had hired low-cost North Korean labor, was originally conceived as an experiment that its supporters hoped would help advance the economic integration -- and eventual reunification -- of the two Koreas.
Ms. Park said on Tuesday that South Korea wanted to reopen Kaesong. But she said North Korea must first promise broad changes in the complex to make it globally competitive and must guarantee that it would not use the economic project as a political bargaining chip again.
Meanwhile, Glyn T. Davies, the top American envoy on North Korea, met with South Korean officials in Seoul. He said the United States and its allies wanted the North to get ''back on the path of denuclearization by taking concrete steps to demonstrate that they have obligations.''
The United Nations Security Council has tightened sanctions on North Korea for its rocket and nuclear tests. The North said it was abandoning its commitments to denuclearization.

HEADLINE: Sony Meets With an Outspoken Activist Investor, but Courtesy Reigns

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
For a hedge fund manager whose fame first came on writing invective-filled letters, Daniel S. Loeb's latest missive was a model of politeness.
After a roughly two-hour meeting in Tokyo on Tuesday with senior management at Sony, the American billionaire handed a letter to the company's chief executive, calling for a shake-up of the electronics giant.
However polite the note -- Mr. Loeb says he wants to be a partner to Sony -- it has started the biggest fight of the activist investor's career to date. 
Mr. Loeb's campaign is just the latest in a recent swell of corporate activism, as investors take on management at moribund companies and demand shifts in corporate strategy.
Flush with cash from eager investors, these hedge fund managers are taking on ever larger targets. Companies as big as the Hess Corporation, Procter & Gamble and even Apple have found themselves in the sights of investors upset with what they see as waste and a disregard for shareholders' fortunes.
In his 18-year career as a financial manager, Mr. Loeb has become one of the biggest stars in the world of hedge fund activists. His firm, Third Point, controls nearly $13 billion in assets and it was up 13.3 percent for the year so far through last week.
Before Sony, Mr. Loeb's biggest target was Yahoo, where he waged a war to oust Scott Thompson as chief executive. Soon after winning that fight, Mr. Loeb successfully poached Marissa Mayer from Google to serve as the embattled Web pioneer's new leader.
Since the investor first began agitating at Yahoo, the company's shares have soared 81 percent.
''You can see Dan's fingerprints all over the turnaround,'' said Eric Jackson, a fellow hedge fund manager and Yahoo investor. ''He's brought an assurance to other Wall Street investors that there's an owner in the boardroom. That's what this company needed.''
A California native who began his career at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus and Citigroup, Mr. Loeb, 51, made his name through his investment acumen and the caustic humor often in his correspondence. Over the years, aficionados have collected his writings, from one executive's ''imminent involuntary extraction'' to another's ''seemingly perpetual failure.''
Among his most famous epistles was his 2005 letter to the chief executive of Star Gas, a heating oil distributor. In 2,000 words, Mr. Loeb berated the official, Irik P. Sevin, for his ''ineptitude'' and for using the company as his ''personal 'honey pot.' ''
''It is time for you to step down from your role as C.E.O. and director so that you can do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites,'' he wrote.
Mr. Sevin resigned soon afterward.
Mr. Loeb's aggressiveness extended beyond companies as well. His 2005 exchange with an applicant from Britain went viral around Wall Street for lines like ''I love the idea of a French/English unemployed guy whose fund just blew up telling me that I am going to fail.''
That same year, Mr. Loeb battled with another hedge fund titan, Kenneth C. Griffin of Citadel, over poaching employees from other firms. ''You are surrounded by sycophants but even you must know that the people who work for you despise and resent you,'' Mr. Loeb scoffed. (The two have since become friends.)
As his success grew, Mr. Loeb branched out beyond activism into less confrontational strategies. Third Point reaped a $500 million profit last year by betting that Greece's government bonds would regain value after that country's debt crisis.
He was also one of several investors to reap big gains from wagering on home loans after the financial crisis of 2008. And he profited from bets on bankrupt companies like Delphi, the auto parts maker.
Mr. Loeb has had his share of stumbles as well. He fought for a seat at Massey Energy in 2006, deriding the coal miner for its inefficiencies and poor risk management. But he resigned a year later after his activist skills failed to lead to the ouster of Don L. Blankenship as chief executive and a sale of the company.
The financial crisis also weighed down on Third Point in 2008, as the firm's main fund sank about 33 percent.
Over all, however, Mr. Loeb retains the power to move stocks simply by revealing his presence. Earlier this year, he announced an 8.2 percent stake in Herbalife, a nutritional supplements company locked in combat with his friend and fellow billionaire, William A. Ackman.
Third Point rode the subsequent rise in Herbalife's stock and sold out after a few months, pocketing an estimated $50 million profit.
Among his recent big bets are Morgan Stanley, whose compensation practices he has admonished, and Murphy Oil, which he has said should consider shedding assets.
The largest of these is now Sony, which he believes can trim its way to prosperity. It is likely to be a long campaign, especially given Japan's historic aversion to foreign interlopers. But Mr. Loeb appears to have won over at least a few fans for now.
''We think Mr. Loeb's bold proposal bears consideration,'' analysts at Macquarie wrote in a research note on Tuesday, agreeing that a spinoff of the entertainment unit could propel Sony's stock by 60 percent. ''We recognize this latent value may indeed exist.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Sony Swings to a Profit: Sony, the Japanese giant that an American hedge fund manager is seeking to shake up, has been trying to turn around its unprofitable electronics business. Last week, the company reported its first annual profit in five years, thanks to cuts, a weaker yen and revenue from its financial services unit.

HEADLINE: Big Companies Lead 3 Major Indexes to Highs

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks rallied to new highs on Tuesday as investors picked up large companies' shares on the expectation that stimulus by the Federal Reserve would help propel the rally further.
Gains were broad, but growth sectors outperformed their peers, with bank stocks leading the way. Bank of America, up 2.8 percent, at $13.34, was the Dow's biggest percentage gainer, and Citigroup rose 2.4 percent, to $50.09.
Wall Street has rallied without a significant correction since the beginning of the year, pushing major indexes to highs and pushing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up almost 16 percent for 2013. 
The ascent has been driven in large part by the Federal Reserve's easy monetary policy, intended to stimulate the economy, though investors' focus has turned to when the Fed may start to rein in its bond-buying program.
''The developed economies of the world are all easing aggressively, the money is looking for a home and it's ending up in the stock markets,'' said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Ala.
For now, investors are betting that the central bank will be careful not to remove its support too soon, to keep from disrupting the economic recovery it is trying to foster, Mr. Hellwig said.
So far, declines in the market have been met with buying, and investors are trying to gauge how long that can last.
''People are, indeed, trying to participate in the rally, but at the same time, they're trying to be cautious,'' said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer of Commonwealth Financial, based in Waltham, Mass.
The S.& P. 500 financial sector index rose 1.7 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 123.57 points, or 0.82 percent, to close at 15,215.25. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 16.57 points, or 1.01 percent, to end at 1,650.34. Both indexes hit highs, without adjusting for inflation. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 23.82 points, or 0.69 percent, to 3,462.61, its highest close since November 2000.
During the session, the Dow hit an intraday high, not adjusted for inflation, of 15,219.55, while the S.& P. 500 climbed to a similar intraday high of 1,651.10.
The Nasdaq touched a 52-week intraday high of 3,468.67.
The market traded sideways for the last three sessions, gaining just 0.07 percent as the winding down of the quarterly earnings season and a light economic calendar left investors without a strong catalyst for further gains.
The Dow's gains were limited by weakness in Intel, down 1 percent at $23.84, and the UnitedHealth Group, off 1.1 percent at $61.73.
Sony shares listed in the United States rose 9.9 percent, to $20.76, after the hedge fund investor Daniel Loeb called on the company to spin off its lucrative entertainment arm.
Nokia unveiled a new version of its Lumia smartphone line, but its shares fell 5.2 percent, to $3.64, on the New York Stock Exchange. The research company Gartner said Nokia lost 5 percentage points of market share in the first quarter, to 14.8 percent.
Solar power companies' shares fell after Trina Solar lowered a previous estimate for panel shipments and said its results would be hurt by a foreign currency exchange loss. The stock fell 8.8 percent to $5.41, while Yingli Green Energy slid 6.4 percent to $2.36.
Most corporate earnings have exceeded expectations this quarter. With 90 percent of the S.& P. 500 companies having reported results, 67.2 percent have topped earnings expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, even with the average over the last four quarters. However, only 46.9 percent have exceeded revenue estimates, below the 52 percent average over the same period.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 19/32 to 97 29/32, pushing the yield up to 1.98 from 1.92 on Monday.

HEADLINE: For Republicans, Incentives to Strike a Budget Deal With Obama

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Ask around the White House and the Capitol, and you will quickly find reasons to doubt that Republicans will compromise with President Obama on a budget deal that includes more tax increases and spending cuts in social programs.
So why does Mr. Obama keep talking to them about a deal? Because Republicans still have powerful incentives to strike one.
Delaying steps to rein in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the subjects of Republican doomsday warnings for years, means delaying significant attempts to curb the size of the government. The longer the delay, the sharper and more immediate the changes Washington must eventually make to ease the long-term fiscal squeeze.
Even if Republicans take control of Congress and the White House in the next two elections -- allowing them to put in place a budget plan without major compromises -- they would then shoulder the political responsibility for the inevitable pain that comes from curbing those huge and popular programs. Much as Republicans may dislike Mr. Obama and his policies, a Democratic president can provide them a measure of political cover. 
''There are Republicans who believe that we should wait,'' Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said at a fiscal meeting held by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation last week. ''If we wait until 2017, which in essence is what they're saying, I think we're taking a huge risk.''
That may be precisely what happens. For one thing, a new Congressional Budget Office report on Tuesday eased one source of pressure for a deal. Because of higher-than-expected revenues and slower-than-expected spending growth, the budget office projected that the 2013 deficit would be $642 billion -- $200 billion less than projected just three months ago, and less than half its size from four years ago as a proportion of the economy.
For another, events of recent years have repeatedly proven the political difficulty of overhauling benefit programs. President George W. Bush tried in 2005 to restructure Social Security through partial privatization, and a Republican Congress, frightened of political fallout, refused. After Republicans fueled by Tea Party fervor recaptured the House in 2010, conservatives had new hopes of trimming social programs.
But Congressional Republicans, while winning cuts in ''discretionary'' spending, failed to strike a ''grand bargain'' curbing entitlements. Mr. Obama won re-election over a Republican ticket that, as Mr. Bush had done, proposed a fundamental restructuring in the nature of a major entitlement program benefiting older Americans.
This time it was Medicare. Mr. Obama derided the Republican proposal as a ''voucher'' plan that would shift financial burdens onto elderly beneficiaries.
''The notion of large-scale entitlement reform has lost its appeal,'' said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a Republican economist, citing a shift in attention toward overhauling the tax code. ''You can't fix it with this Congress and this president.''
President Obama, having accepted many more spending cuts than tax increases since Republicans won the House in 2010, has set additional tax increases as the price of an entitlement deal. The House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, having acquiesced to end most of the high-end Bush tax cuts late last year, have ruled out further tax increases.
Substantively, opponents of a compromise argue that further tax increases would harm the economy. Mr. Obama and Senate Democrats, the opponents say, will never accept the structural changes needed for the government's long-term solvency anyway.
Politically, resisting tax increases would shield Republican incumbents from primary challenges. A recovering economy is already shrinking near-term deficits. And deferring unpopular cuts on entitlements could help Republicans win back the Senate in 2014 and the White House in 2016.
Yet other Republicans fear that stepping away from the bargaining table could saddle the party with a different problem. Without cuts in entitlement programs, which can only come through a deal with Mr. Obama, Republican leaders will have trouble making Congress do something they acknowledge it must do -- raise the debt limit.
Two years ago, Republicans approached a similar moment lifted by two significant tail winds. Jittery financial markets joined voters in backing Republican demands for spending cuts. Mr. Obama needed to negotiate deep ones -- now known as sequestration -- to defer the threat of a government default past his re-election campaign.
Those winds have shifted. Safely re-elected, Mr. Obama has promised not to negotiate any further on the debt limit. He and his advisers believe that House Republicans, who face re-election next year, have more to lose politically over a showdown.
Some Republicans agree with them.
''The president's not at risk -- our majority's at risk,'' said Representative Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican who serves on the House Budget and Appropriations Committees. ''You plunge the country into economic crisis, you lose your majority.''
He predicted ''a very substantial'' compromise with the White House this year, pushing debt limit votes past the 2014 election.
Many Republicans fault Mr. Obama for resisting structural changes to entitlements as well as lesser changes, like raising the Medicare eligibility age, which he entertained in 2011. But Mr. Cole, like Mr. Portman, credits the president for proposing or signaling that he will bargain on reduced inflation adjustments for Social Security benefits and other government programs; additional ''means testing'' for Medicare, which would reduce benefits for high-income recipients; and increased out-of-pocket costs for some beneficiaries.
''Those are all worthwhile steps, and we should grab every one of them,'' said R. Glenn Hubbard, who advised Mr. Bush's administration and Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign.
Having seen both fall short in seeking far-reaching entitlement changes, Mr. Hubbard endorsed the idea of a narrower compromise so long as the tax increases it contained did not raise marginal rates, which he considers most harmful to economic growth.
''This notion that you're going to wait for a grand bargain -- in our process, you could wait an awful lot of time for that to happen,'' said Mr. Hubbard, now the dean of Columbia University's Business School. ''The longer we wait, the greater the risk that current beneficiaries will have to be cut.''
As for the political calculus of entitlement curbs, he added, ''It's much better for Republicans to have it happen on President Obama's watch.''
Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman and a leading Republican advocate of entitlement changes, appears to be trying to keep the possibility of such a limited deal alive through slowly developing negotiations with his Senate Budget Committee counterpart, Senator Patty Murray of Washington. It hinges on tax code changes -- and politically consequential word-parsing over whether additional revenue would come from tax increases or economic growth.
''The question is, can we make divided government work?'' Mr. Ryan asked at the Peterson Foundation session. ''Can we get a down payment on the problem?''
For all the resistance on the right to compromise, some conservative economists still hope so.
''The problem will be so much worse in four years,'' said Joseph Antos, a former official in President Ronald Reagan's administration who is now at the American Enterprise Institute. He predicted that Congressional Republicans would ultimately accept a bargain including modest additional tax increases, but only after ''the maximum amount of political hell.''
But to call this approach a strategy, Mr. Antos added, is ''very generous.''

HEADLINE: Europe Raids 3 Companies In an Inquiry On Oil Prices

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED

 BODY:
LONDON -- The authorities on Tuesday raided the offices of several oil companies and an industry data provider as part of a broader inquiry by the European Commission into potential price manipulation.
In what the commission termed ''unannounced inspections,'' investigators descended on some European offices of BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Platts, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies that specializes in providing pricing for the oil industry. The European authorities are looking into whether the companies may have ''colluded in reporting distorted prices'' in an effort ''to manipulate the published prices of a number of oil and biofuel products.''
All of the companies said they were cooperating with the inquiry. 
Shell said it was ''assisting the European Commission in an inquiry into trading activities.'' A spokesman said that the company's offices in Rotterdam and London were ''visited.''
Platts said that the European Commission had ''undertaken a review'' at its offices, at Canary Wharf in London. The authorities also raided BP's oil trading operations on the lower floors of the same building. BP said in a statement that the company was ''subject to an investigation.''
Regulators in Europe and the United States have long been worried about the system by which oil and gas prices are set, which can affect the prices consumers pay as well as costs for airline and trucking companies. The concerns reached a frenzied pitch in 2008 when oil prices hit record highs and then quickly plunged. At the time, lawmakers in the United States and elsewhere questioned whether the prices were being distorted.
The authorities are focused in part on the price reporting system for oil and other petroleum products, which is dominated by a small group of companies like Platts. Such companies determine prices by polling traders and using other industry data.
In recent years, Platts has instituted a so-called electronic window through which a significant amount of oil is traded. At the end of each day, Platts determines prices based on the trades that go through this system, rather than by simply relying on polling companies.
There are concerns in the industry that companies could distort the prices through a blizzard of last-minute trades. ''If you want access to liquidity you are forced to use the window,'' said a senior oil trader. But he also said that the window, in theory, should be more accurate than prices determined just by polling traders because the prices were determined by actual trades.
The benchmarks, notably Brent crude, are enormously influential. Much of the world's oil, particularly outside the United States, is priced in relation to Brent, which is made up of a basket of North Sea crudes. These benchmarks are also often used in the large derivatives markets.
As production in the North Sea has dwindled, the Brent price has been based on lower volumes of oil, prompting fears that it could be manipulated, possibly by major players in the region. The Brent price is determined through assessing prices of a blend of four North Sea crudes.
In recent years, various regulatory agencies have investigated price setting but seem to have come up with little evidence of manipulation. People in the industry say, however, that the controversy around oil and gas prices has made companies increasingly reluctant to supply prices for fear of becoming the targets of regulators or lawsuits.
In 2010, the Group of 20 economically most developed nations asked the International Organization of Securities Commissions to look into the potential for manipulation and whether tighter regulation was needed. After a two-year investigation, the price reporting agencies last fall agreed to adopt a series of principles to deal with conflicts of interests and other issues.
An 18-month trial period is under way. Compliance is to be monitored by an independent auditor. If the companies don't go along, regulators may bar them from providing pricing benchmarks to exchanges, which is a source of revenue.

HEADLINE: Celebrating, in Spite of the Risk

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON and KATY RECKDAHL

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- Each year in the weeks leading up to Mother's Day, when the members of the Original Big 7 Social Aid and Pleasure Club drew up the sheet outlining their parade's route through the back streets of town, they would include a warning: ''Leave your guns and foolishness at home.''
Each year, that is, until this year. Things seemed to have gotten better, they figured. Maybe the warning was no longer necessary.
Only 20 minutes into the parade, as legs had begun to loosen and the members in their cream-colored suits danced before a brass band, it became terrifyingly clear that it still was. A young man, identified by the police as 19-year-old Akein Scott, stepped away from a street corner and fired with seeming indifference into the crowd, leaving 19 people on the ground with gunshot wounds, 3 of them in critical condition. 
The police have released no motive, but people here by and large figured that it was the same old story: a young man with gun and a complaint spotted a rival and attacked.
When shootings like this happened in the past -- and they have, sometimes deadly but almost never as brazenly -- they often prompted a debate about street culture and violence, about the rolling crowds that form on such occasions and how much they may be to blame for what goes on in their orbit.
Several years ago, prompted by one of those shootings, the New Orleans police raised security fees for marching clubs so high that it seemed the tradition of these parades, put on for more than a century by black working-class New Orleanians, might be seriously curtailed, or end for good.
This time seems as if it will be different. Since Sunday afternoon, the mayor and the police chief have repeatedly and emphatically divorced the shooting from the occasion that it ruined. They have called the parades a crucial part of the city's culture and even a bulwark against its seemingly ceaseless violence, an argument marchers have been making for years.
''The layers of this thing are really important, and that's to understand what the origin of the violence is, what it's connected to and what it's not connected to,'' said Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who has long made a case for what he calls the city's cultural economy. ''This didn't have anything to do with second lines, and it didn't have anything to do with the rich cultural heritage of New Orleans.''
Sunday's event was a so-called second line parade, the ''second line'' referring to all those who join in along the route and follow behind the band, making more of a rolling party than the kind of parade one simply watches. They take place nearly every Sunday between September and May, in the poor and working-class back streets of the city.
Such parades are put on by social aid and pleasure clubs, which function as inner-city relief societies, delivering groceries to shut-ins, buying football uniforms and pooling resources to pay for life's unexpected invoices, like medical emergencies and funeral costs. They also put on parades once a year in the neighborhood they represent, with the brass bands, Technicolor suits and stops at drinking holes along the way. The parades can cost thousands of dollars, even tens of thousands.
For decades, they happened off the bureaucratic radar, without permits and largely unknown to anyone not directly attached to the marchers. For many New Orleanians -- black and white -- the parades were, and still are, surrounded by an air of menace.
''I never got involved in second lines,'' said Willie Green, the drummer for the Neville Brothers, who grew up just outside New Orleans. ''It was always too scary for me.''
But club members, who mostly live in the neighborhoods they parade in, are intimately familiar with how dangerous New Orleans can be. Edward Buckner, the president of the Original Big 7, lost a 26-year-old son to gun violence four years ago. Joe Henry, who started the Original Pigeontown Steppers, parades in a wheelchair, having been shot on Mardi Gras Day when he was 12. A cousin of his was murdered.
''The list goes on and on,'' said Tamara Jackson, the president of the city's Social Aid and Pleasure Club Task Force, who lost her father to gun violence. Neither Ms. Jackson nor others deny that violence has marred the parades, but they say this is a function of where the parades take place.
''We try to nurture our neighborhoods, but that's also where drugs and crime exist,'' she said. Before her club's given Sunday, she walks the route with a plea: ''If anyone has scores to settle, please don't settle them around our parade.''
In the first years after Hurricane Katrina, when the city was reconstituting itself and violence was spiking, the police and the clubs tangled. After shootings near or at two processions in 2006, the police raised fees to 5 and in some cases 10 times the $750 charged for Mardi Gras parades. The second line clubs sued.
While this battle went on, however, the city was changing.
Outsiders moved here with an appetite for an amorphous thing one might call ''authentic New Orleans,'' and they met residents newly appreciative of traditions that, without effort, could have died out. The HBO series ''Treme'' gave a primer to people who had no idea what a second line was. Parade routes were publicized online, so outsiders no longer needed to rely on luck or inside connections to know where they were happening.
Journalists also championed second line culture, among the most ardent of them a woman named Deborah Cotton, who arrived from Los Angeles months before the storm but began diligently chronicling the city's street traditions, mostly for The Gambit, the city's alternative weekly. She also has fought claims that violence is tied to second lines, pointing out that shootings have happened at Mardi Gras parades with few people making a similar connection.
The second line clubs themselves, which had reached an agreement with the city over the fees, began banding together more closely. In a post-Katrina survey conducted by Frederick Weil, a professor of sociology at Louisiana State University, members of social aid clubs were found to be ''more civically active, service oriented, and trusting than even the rich or well educated.''
Negotiations with the city and the police began to go more smoothly under the Landrieu administration, club members said.
''We actually sit down with the members and we negotiate,'' said Cmdr. Bob Bardy of the Police Department's Sixth District, a part of town where relationships with parade promoters had historically been tense.
Richard Anderson, president of the Single Men social aid club, said that Commander Bardy had suggested that his club's parade avoid certain bad spots altogether or that it keep moving in dangerous places where they might have planned a stop. The strategy has largely worked.
''We hadn't had a shooting in a while,'' Mr. Anderson said.
Then Sunday.
One of the most seriously injured in the shooting, Ms. Cotton remains in the hospital in critical but stable condition. Mr. Buckner, for his part, wants to march again, after some time for healing. ''It breaks your heart, man,'' he said.

HEADLINE: For Insurers, No Doubts On Climate Change

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
If there were one American industry that would be particularly worried about climate change it would have to be insurance, right?
From Hurricane Sandy's devastating blow to the Northeast to the protracted drought that hit the Midwest Corn Belt, natural catastrophes across the United States pounded insurers last year, generating $35 billion in privately insured property losses, $11 billion more than the average over the last decade.
And the industry expects the situation will get worse. ''Numerous studies assume a rise in summer drought periods in North America in the future and an increasing probability of severe cyclones relatively far north along the U.S. East Coast in the long term,'' said Peter Höppe, who heads Geo Risks Research at the reinsurance giant Munich Re. ''The rise in sea level caused by climate change will further increase the risk of storm surge.'' Most insurers, including the reinsurance companies that bear much of the ultimate risk in the industry, have little time for the arguments heard in some right-wing circles that climate change isn't happening, and are quite comfortable with the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels is the main culprit of global warming. 
''Insurance is heavily dependent on scientific thought,'' Frank Nutter, president of the Reinsurance Association of America, told me last week. ''It is not as amenable to politicized scientific thought.''
Yet when I asked Mr. Nutter what the American insurance industry was doing to combat global warming, his answer was surprising: nothing much. ''The industry has really not been engaged in advocacy related to carbon taxes or proposals addressing carbon,'' he said. While some big European reinsurers like Munich Re and Swiss Re support efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, ''in the United States the household names really have not engaged at all.'' Instead, the focus of insurers' advocacy efforts is zoning rules and disaster mitigation.
Last week, scientists announced that the concentration of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had reached 400 parts per million -- its highest level in at least three million years, before humans appeared on the scene. Back then, mastodons roamed the earth, the polar ice caps were smaller and the sea level was as much as 60 to 80 feet higher.
The milestone puts the earth nearer a point of no return, many scientists think, when vast, disruptive climate change is baked into our future. Pietr P. Tans, who runs the monitoring program at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told my colleague Justin Gillis: ''It symbolizes that so far we have failed miserably in tackling this problem.'' And it raises a perplexing question: why hasn't corporate America done more to sway its allies in the Republican Party to try to avert a disaster that would clearly be devastating to its own interests?
Mr. Nutter argues that the insurance industry's reluctance is born of hesitation to become embroiled in controversies over energy policy. But perhaps its executives simply don't feel so vulnerable. Like farmers, who are largely protected from the ravages of climate change by government-financed crop insurance, insurers also have less to fear than it might at first appear.
The federal government covers flood insurance, among the riskiest kind in this time of crazy weather. And insurers can raise premiums or even drop coverage to adjust to higher risks. Indeed, despite Sandy and drought, property and casualty insurance in the United States was more profitable in 2012 than in 2011, according to the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America.
But the industry's analysis of the risks it faces is evolving. One sign of that is how some top American insurers responded to a billboard taken out by the conservative Heartland Institute, a prominent climate change denier that has received support from the insurance industry.
The billboard had a picture of Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, who asked: ''I still believe in global warming. Do you?''
Concerned about global warming and angry to be equated with a murderous psychopath, insurance companies like Allied World, Renaissance Re, State Farm and XL Group dropped their support for Heartland.
Even more telling, Eli Lehrer, a Heartland vice president who at the time led an insurance-financed project, left the group and helped start the R Street Institute, a standard conservative organization in all respects but one: it believes in climate change and supports a carbon tax to combat it. And it is financed largely with insurance industry money.
Mr. Lehrer points out that a carbon tax fits conservative orthodoxy. It is a broad and flat tax, whose revenue can be used to do away with the corporate income tax -- a favorite target of the right. It provides a market-friendly signal, forcing polluters to bear the cost imposed on the rest of us and encouraging them to pollute less. And it is much preferable to a parade of new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency.
''We are having a debate on the right about a carbon tax for the first time in a long time,'' Mr. Lehrer said.
Bob Inglis, formerly a Republican congressman from South Carolina who lost his seat in the 2010 primary to a Tea Party-supported challenger, is another member of this budding coalition. Before he left Congress, he proposed a revenue-neutral bill to create a carbon tax and cut payroll taxes.
Changing the political economy of a carbon tax remains an uphill slog especially in a stagnant economy. But Mr. Inglis notices a thaw. ''The best way to do this is in the context of a grand bargain on tax reform,'' he said. ''It could happen in 2015 or 2016, but probably not before.''
He lists a dozen Republicans in the House and eight in the Senate who would be open to legislation to help avert climate change. He notes that Exelon, the gas and electricity giant, is sympathetic to his efforts -- perhaps not least because a carbon tax would give an edge to gas over its dirtier rival, coal. Exxon, too, has also said a carbon tax would be the most effective way to reduce emissions. So why hasn't the insurance industry come on board?
Robert Muir-Wood is the chief research officer of Risk Management Solutions, one of two main companies the insurance industry relies on to crunch data and model future risks. He argues that insurers haven't changed their tune because -- with the exception of 2004 and 2005, when a string of hurricanes from Ivan to Katrina caused damage worth more than $200 billion -- they haven't yet experienced hefty, sustained losses attributable to climate change.
''Insurers were ready to sign up to all sorts of actions against climate change,'' Mr. Muir-Wood told me from his office in London. Then the weather calmed down.
Still, Mr. Muir-Wood notes that the insurance industry faces a different sort of risk: political action. ''That is the biggest threat,'' he said. When insurers canceled policies and raised premiums in Florida in 2006, politicians jumped on them. ''Insurers in Florida,'' he said, ''became Public Enemy No. 1.''
And that's the best hope for those concerned about climate change: that global warming isn't just devastating for society, but also bad for business.

HEADLINE: House to Vote Yet Again On Health Care Repeal

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS; Derek Willis contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The 37th time won't be the charm. But House Republicans are charging forward anyway this week on a vote to repeal President Obama's signature health care overhaul, which will put the number of times they have tried to eliminate, defund or curtail the law past the three-dozen mark.
''This is what, the 40th time they're going to do it?'' scoffed Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, confessing that she had lost count. ''Thirty-eight? 39? 40? 41?'' She eventually settled on ''high 30s'' as her best guess. 
Three dozen is a lot for a bill that currently has no prayer of becoming law. But the figure 37 actually understates the amount of time Republicans have devoted to litigating and trying to dismantle the president's biggest legislative accomplishment.
The repeal vote, which is likely to occur Thursday, will be at least the 43rd day since Republicans took over the House that they have devoted time to voting on the issue.
To put that in perspective, they have held votes on only 281 days since taking power in January 2011. (The House and Senate have pretty light legislative loads these days, typically voting only three or four days a week.)
That means that since 2011, Republicans have spent no less than 15 percent of their time on the House floor on repeal in some way.
Liberals mock Republicans for what they dismiss as a waste of time. It represents a fitting ordering of priorities, they say, for a body whose few accomplishments this year include passing a bill that kept the Federal Helium Reserve open, heading off a critical shortage of the gas, and another that modifies the requirements for gold and silver coins commemorating the National Baseball Hall of Fame.
Indeed, the Republican House leadership is sensitive to the perception that they are squandering even more time on a repeal vote that is going nowhere.
Predicting the cynical news media coverage that awaits them, Speaker John A. Boehner's office sent out a memorandum to reporters on Tuesday pointing out that the House had only voted twice before on a stand-alone bill to rescind the health care law. Many of the other votes, a spokesman for the speaker explained, were to defund or repeal smaller parts of the law, including seven signed into law by the president.
Michael Steel, the spokesman, said that spending 15 percent of their time on the issue was hardly a waste for Republicans. ''Given that the bill amounts to a takeover of roughly 15 percent of the American economy,'' he said, ''that sounds about right.''
By one measure, this House is the least productive one in a decade. As of Tuesday, it had cast just 146 roll-call votes since convening on Jan. 3. Compared with the same period in other Congresses -- early January through mid-May of the first session -- that is far lower.
The previous House, in which Republicans won control and Mr. Boehner was elected speaker, had cast about 300 roll-call votes at this point in 2011. In 2007 and 2009, when Democrats controlled the House, the number at this point was also near 300.
The only recent House with fewer votes was in the 107th Congress, in 2001, which had voted only about 110 times through mid-May.
Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University who studies Congress, said that the numbers led to an inescapable conclusion: ''There's very little legislating going on the House floor.''
Republican leadership put off scheduling a vote on an outright repeal of the health care law despite pleas from conservative members who believe it is an issue of paramount importance to voters back home. After losing the presidency and seats in both houses in Congress, the House leadership initially wanted to focus on pursuing an agenda crafted by Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, aimed at softening the party's image by moving off an almost myopic focus on deficit reduction and budgets.
They were able to hold off a vote for some time. At this point in 2011, House Republicans had already voted nine times on some form of repeal.
But conservatives pressed on, noting that their newly elected colleagues had not had a chance to vote on something that is a Republican rite of passage.
''The guys who've been up here the last year, we can go home and say, 'Listen, we voted 36 different times to repeal or replace Obamacare,' '' said Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina at a gathering of conservatives recently. ''Tell me what the new guys are supposed to say?'' In addition to this week's vote, there are also at least 15 separate Republican bills pending in Congress with titles like ''American Liberty Restoration Act'' and ''Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act'' that are either full or partial repeals.
But despite the criticism, there are some very tangible political benefits for Republicans' voting against the president. Repealing the health care law is an issue that unites their party, which has split over several major bills already this year.
And even after their electoral losses last year, more Republicans now come from conservative districts where health care remains as resonant an issue as it was in 2010.
''It's something that we wanted to move up on the list of priorities,'' said Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who leads an influential group of House conservatives who are often pushing their leadership to the right. ''And I'm glad they listened to us.''

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Race Grows; So Does Security

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
When New York Road Runners reinvented the Brooklyn Half Marathon, turning a sleepy March race into an event that will host about 25,000 competitors this weekend, it was meant as an economic boon to Coney Island. But recent events have turned it into something bigger, including a much larger security challenge in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings last month. 
Road Runners officials have been working with the New York Police Department to ramp up security, including a new, stringent bag check procedure, additional police officers along the course, secure runners-only areas and family reunion zones. Bomb-sniffing dogs will be out in force.
Runners who check a bag at the start, on Washington Avenue and Eastern Parkway, will be screened by security officials and will be required to use clear, race-issued bags for belongings. They will have to hand trash to race volunteers, because no trash cans will be placed along the course.
What officials do not expect is for runners to stay home. Online registration has been strong, and the event will draw its biggest field by a large margin. Two years ago, the race drew 7,000 runners.
''New Yorkers are a pretty tough bunch, and they're not going to let something like this sway them,'' said Peter Ciaccia, the executive vice president for event development for Road Runners. ''We learned that after 9/11. They're not going to stop running.''
In its new format, with a picturesque finish along the Coney Island Boardwalk, the race has grown into the second-largest half marathon in the country, according to New York Road Runners. It was reconfigured as a way to help that community economically, making it a gathering point for runners and spectators. The course was expanded to hold as many as 30,000 runners, it was moved from March to May, and Coney Island went from being the all-but-ignored start to the festive finish area. More than 15,000 competed last year on the new course.
After Hurricane Sandy hit in October -- which brought the cancellation of the Road Runners' premier event, the New York City Marathon -- the Brooklyn Half Marathon has gained a mission of raising money for storm relief charities and increasing good will. The organization weathered harsh criticism for its initial decision, made along with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, to stage the marathon before calling it off amid threats of protests.
Ciaccia said the organization was also close to announcing an event on Staten Island to raise money for that hard-hit community's relief.
After the Boston bombings, the primary concern for race organizers is security. Running courses are unique among sporting venues for their vulnerability -- they snake through communities and get much of their character from their proximity to spectators, who become part of the event.
''We've always worked very closely with the New York Police Department,'' Ciaccia said. ''Some of the things we did were to make our security more obvious. You'll see security zones clearly identified, when in the past, they were controlled but not as obviously. There will be more police presence at the finish line as well as along the course. We've always done this, but this year, it's just a little more involved.''

HEADLINE: Big Forum? For Cuomo, It's Always A 'Summit'

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Some call them conferences. Others prefer forums. For old-timers, of course, they were just meetings.
But over the last year, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has made it clear that his preferred word for a big get-together is ''summit.'' And he has summited again and again, including last week, when Mr. Cuomo used his executive drawing power and his unfettered access to state-owned conference rooms to hold a tourism summit meeting, his third such confab in the last nine months, following ballyhooed brainstorming sessions on the state's yogurt and alcohol industries.
''I love these summits,'' said Mr. Cuomo recently. ''It brings attention to an issue. It focuses the energy.'' 
It also focuses the publicity, of course. Politicians are always looking for new ways of pushing their agendas: Bill Clinton had town-hall meetings, for example, and President Obama has had Twitter chats. But, in many ways, Mr. Cuomo's summit meetings are perfectly suited to his political tastes, packed with point-by-point presentations and big plans, take-aways and talking points, and rooms full of supportive followers, some of whom are fast becoming regulars.
''I sat in the exact same seat last time,'' said one tourism summit meeting attendee, David Katleski, the president of the New York State Brewers Association, who also was a guest at the Wine, Beer and Spirits Summit in October.
Indeed, the tourism summit meeting confirmed both Mr. Cuomo's affection for the format and its strengths: the governor delivers remarks in the morning, listens to various invited speakers, lets participants gab among themselves, and then returns to announce a set of accomplishments and new programs in the afternoon, heralded in short order by a news release. The tourism summit meeting's big revelation, for instance, was nearly $60 million in new financing for advertising and other initiatives.
And while it may be pat, the one-problem-at-a-time approach has drawn praise from participants as well as some longtime Albany political professionals.
''There's been some snickering about the yogurt summit, but the rationale behind it is sophisticated,'' said Darren Dopp, who served in economic development and communications roles for two former governors, Mario M. Cuomo and Eliot Spitzer. ''Rather than have yet another meeting on the upstate economy, they decided to focus on a specific challenge in a specific sector.''
That said, some experts in event planning say that the governor's small-bore summit meetings may be stretching the formal definition of the word, which traditionally had described gatherings of heads of state dealing with détente or economic policy.
''There's a certain cachet in the name 'summit,' '' said Lewis R. Shomer, the executive director of the Society of Independent Show Organizers, whose members include companies that produce trade shows. ''And sometimes it's very misused.''
Semantic transgressions are probably understandable, particularly in an age of well-hyped highbrow events like TED Conferences (known by some as ''the ultimate brain spa'') and Renaissance Weekends (the ''granddaddy of ideas festivals''). According to the American Society of Association Executives, there are no fewer than 14 ''learning formats,'' including round tables (''a conference, discussion, or deliberation in which each participant has equal status, equal time to present views''), congresses (''a formal meeting or assembly of representatives for the discussion, arrangement, or promotion of some matter of common interest''), and conclaves (''an assembly or gathering, esp. one that has special authority, power, or influence; usually a closed or restricted event'').
Mr. Cuomo's summit meetings are press-friendly and open to scores of invited guests, something that probably never would have flown at Malta (or Yalta, for that matter). And there are freebies: the yogurt summit meeting in August ran out of spoons when visitors gobbled up samples, and the liquor summit meeting in October had a happy-hour tasting at the Governor's Mansion, complete with a vodka, bourbon, and, subsequently, some very friendly headlines. (''Booze Summit Serves Up Ideas,'' read one in The Buffalo News, ''And Much Applause for Cuomo.'') A visitor to last week's tourism summit meeting could have walked away with all manner of upstate swag, including biscotti from Niagara County, tubes of ''Visit Syracuse'' lip balm and a binder clip from outside Rochester.
While Mr. Shomer noted that most summit meetings draw only top-level officials -- ''Just the mere name 'summit' means the top,'' he said -- Mr. Cuomo casts a wider net: The tourism event drew representatives from Google and Delta Air Lines, as well as organizations like the Corning Museum of Glass and the theme park at Darien Lake, two upstate institutions that the governor would like more people to visit.
For some, the success of such summits remains to be seen. ''They are not really summits: they are séances,'' said Randy Credico, a comedian and New York City mayoral candidate. ''The governor, like a medium, is attempting to make contact with the dead, the dead in this case being the upstate economy.''
One of the bona fide movers and shakers attending the tourism summit meeting -- held on Wednesday in Albany -- was the chairwoman of the New York State Tourism Advisory Committee, Cristyne Nicholas, who said that the magic of summitry was actually very simple.
''It's the power of an invitation,'' Ms. Nicholas said. ''People want to feel welcomed, they want to feel invited, and this is the governor's way of inviting them to the table.''

HEADLINE: Invitation to a Dialogue: A Permanent Job Crisis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Where Have All the Jobs Gone?,'' by Jared Bernstein (Op-Ed, May 3):
Unemployment is staying high despite the end of the recession because we are now in a historic transition. Because of automation, globalization, efficiency and other factors, we no longer need the share of people working that we have had in the past. With these trends moving in only one direction, it is clear that the job crisis is permanent and will not go away with better economic times. 
We can see this shift in recent social patterns. Working ages, once routinely 21 to 65, are narrowing, with younger people dependent longer and those older, often thrown out of their careers, increasingly choosing different lifestyles. More Americans without realistic expectations of supporting themselves legally are falling into bad habits, a problem cutting across racial, regional and urban-rural lines.
The ''brain drain'' no longer refers to workers coming to the United States; it now means foreigners going home after being educated here, or even our citizens moving elsewhere. Since women have weathered the trends better as a group, we are having new tensions between the sexes, with unemployed, directionless men becoming more common.
Protectionist solutions will not solve this core problem. A more effective measure would be a Works Progress Administration-style infrastructure project, which with relatively low labor and material costs will never be cheaper than now. Also beneficial would be reducing work hours, to spread work around while improving our quality of life.
If we continue assuming that the job shortage will resolve itself, we risk dire consequences. More Americans will be without hope or purpose. Companies of all sizes may crash from lack of customers.
The challenge for our public policy as well as for Americans individually is to adapt to the permanent nature of what we are facing.
JAMES B. HUNTINGTON Eldred, N.Y., May 13, 2013
The writer is the author of ''Work's New Age: The End of Full Employment and What It Means to You.''
Editors' Note: We invite readers to respond by Thursday for the Sunday Dialogue. We plan to publish a sampling of responses, as well as Mr. Huntington's rejoinder, in the Sunday Review. E-mail: letters@nytimes.com

HEADLINE: Uninvited Guest Gives Japan a Jolt

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Devil. Vulture. Saboteur.
All these words have been used to greet Western investors who have agitated for change in Japan's clubby and complacent corporate culture. As the hedge fund billionaire Daniel S. Loeb prepares to take on Sony, he may find the same hostility from the company that at one time single-handedly defined premium quality in entertainment and electronics.
How Sony, and Japan, react to the demands brought by Mr. Loeb on Tuesday could become a test of how far the country has come in making good on promises to open up to more foreign investment and, more important, change. 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who took office in December, has promised to shake up corporate Japan by removing onerous regulations, protections and inflexibilities that have sapped profitability and hampered serious revamping.
Investors initially are cheering Mr. Loeb's efforts. Sony's shares rose nearly 10 percent in the United States to close at $20.76 on Tuesday. The reaction among those who matter -- Sony's managers -- has been muted.
Almost no local media outlets carried the story of Mr. Loeb's hand-delivered list of demands to Sony on Tuesday, hours after those demands had been made public. Sony itself issued only a curt statement, saying its entertainment businesses were ''not for sale.''
''Sony is an icon. Until now, it hasn't had a fellow like this coming in and making demands in public,'' said Nicholas Benes, a former Wall Street banker who now advises Japanese companies on corporate governance. ''But now he comes in with guns blazing. This hasn't quite started off right, you might say.''
Activist investors like Mr. Loeb's fund, Third Point, might seem like natural allies in that mission to prod Japan's corporations toward change. Mr. Loeb's demands for Sony's management center on bringing more focus to its sprawling business, something analysts have long called for, partly by spinning off a part of its entertainment arm. And Mr. Loeb cites Mr. Abe's promised economic reforms as a big reason behind his recent interest in Japan.
Nowhere has revamping been so painfully needed as in Japan's electronics industry, where six major manufacturers, including Sony, still produce flat-panel televisions, mostly at a loss. Better labor mobility might make companies more reluctant to close or spin off money-losing operations and focus on profitable lines of business.
American activist investors have, however, met with frustration in the efforts to add value at other companies. T. Boone Pickens, who acquired a minority stake in the auto parts company Koito Manufacturing in 1989, pressed its management for better dividends and a seat on its board. But the little manufacturer dug in its heels. Shareholders heckled him with anti-American taunts at its annual shareholders meeting; the press branded him an opportunistic vulture. Koito's president refused even to meet the Texan magnate.
''O.K., Koito; I give up,'' Mr. Pickens declared in an editorial two contentious years later, before selling his entire stake. ''The heck with Japanese business.''
Mr. Loeb is unlikely to get such openly hostile treatment from Sony, now that he is a significant investor with a 6.5 percent stake in the company. After all, it is 2013, and Sony, unlike Koito, is a global, savvy firm.
Gerhard Fasol, president of the Tokyo technology consulting firm Eurotechnology Japan, said Mr. Loeb had probably studied past unsuccessful approaches to Japanese companies.
''My guess is that he learned from the mistakes those activist investors made and was advised to tone things down,'' Mr. Fasol said. Mr. Loeb makes a point of starting the note with praise for Mr. Hirai and his commitment to change.
Mr. Loeb has suggested that Sony take 15 to 20 percent of the entertainment unit public by offering current Sony shareholders the opportunity to buy shares. The unit includes a leading film studio and one of the largest music labels in the world, featuring artists like Taylor Swift. A spinoff could lead to higher profit margins, while helping to revive the core electronics business, Mr. Loeb argues.
Yet even though many inside and outside Japan recognize that Sony's divisions need some shaking up, a hedge fund manager like Mr. Loeb may not be the one who is ultimately successful.
Active investing has long been seen in Japan as a dangerous, alien practice led by foreigners, or cheeky locals who dare imitate them. And in past cases, lenders, bureaucrats, other shareholders and even rivals have swooped in to rescue companies from investors' talons. Of the 23 hostile takeover bids in Japan since 2000, only 7 have been successful, according to Dealogic
The cross-shareholdings of Japanese companies -- with close ties to their main bank and other companies, known as keiretsu -- have helped foster an environment where hostile takeovers are rare and shareholders are docile supporters.
But in the mid-2000s, when Japan seemed to stage a nascent recovery, the country attracted a wave of what company executives came to call ''investors who say things.''
In 2006, when Steel Partners, an American fund, took out a stake in the noodle maker Myojo Foods, the company flatly refused to entertain a proposal for a management buyout, accusing the fund of trying to sabotage the company's future for short-term gain. When Steel Partners instead started a takeover bid, Myojo ran into the arms of its noodle archrival, Nissin Foods, which bought it out.
Undeterred, Steel Partners aimed at another food company, this time a condiment maker called Bull-Dog Sauce, and accumulated a 10 percent stake in 2007. Not satisfied with the management's reluctance to expand overseas to make up for a waning domestic market, the fund started a tender bid for the rest of the company. This time, it was thwarted by a landmark ruling by Japan's Supreme Court supporting the use of ''poison pill'' defenses in Japan.
The media followed the food companies' tribulations with much gusto, berating the brash manners of Warren Lichtenstein, chief of Steel Partners. The public broadcaster, NHK, showed a drama series, ''Vulture,'' about an American investment firm that snaps up troubled companies.
''Is he a devil, or a savior?'' the narrator asked in a booming voice.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 16, 2013 

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about an American hedge fund manager's push for a breakup of the entertainment and electronic giant Sony referred incorrectly to the recording label of a singer. The singer, Taylor Swift, records for the Big Machine label, not for a Sony label. (A Sony joint venture, Sony/ATV, is her music publisher.) The error was repeated in a Business Day article on Wednesday about the reaction in Japan to the hedge fund manager's move. Because of the error, a picture of Ms. Swift that accompanied the Wednesday article should not have been used.

HEADLINE: No, He's Not, but the Bullies Still Won't Give Him a Break

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
Every day of high school is a fresh hell for the unhappy young hero of ''queerSpawn,'' a slight but compassionate and bleakly funny play by Mallery Avidon that opened at Here Arts Center on Tuesday night. If one tormentor is not spray-painting a gay slur across his locker in vivid neon, another is shoving him in a big cardboard box and taping it shut.
The brutal joke is that our nameless hero, the Kid (David Rosenblatt), isn't gay. ''What I want to say to them is, I'm not gay,'' he wearily tells us. ''But a) it won't do any good, and b) I don't know how to say that without also saying, 'Not that I think there's anything wrong with it.' '' That morally necessary addendum, he glumly adds, ''would only make them think I'm gay even more than they already do.'' 
The reason for his persecution is simple enough: The hero of ''queerSpawn'' has two moms. In this small town in the middle of the country, the illogical assumption is that the child of gay parents is naturally gay. The Kid attempts to point out the flaws in this reasoning -- not to mention the statistical evidence proving otherwise -- but the brains of high school bullies aren't notably porous.
Ms. Avidon's comedy examines what may become an increasing problem for young men and women growing up with gay parents. It's no secret that high school is a big petri dish for prejudice and abuse, and the growing numbers of children of gay parents may soon (may already) find themselves the victimized vanguard of a new flavor of bullying.
As the Kid, Mr. Rosenblatt gives a winning, funny and moving performance, imbuing the character with a native intelligence and good sense that are continually under siege from the self-doubt that is a byproduct of ceaseless mockery. Friendless at school, the Kid has a brief spark of hope when a new student transfers in. But in the cruel social economy of high school, the new kid, the Nerd (Chris Perfetti), can't really afford to run the risk of taint by association, so he gives the Kid as wide a berth as possible.
''I'm allergic to spray paint,'' he explains, when he tells the Kid that he has asked to be given a new locker. In another of the play's darkly funny passages, the Nerd shows a flicker of compassion when he finds the Kid wrapped tightly up in one of those cardboard boxes. He's sort of in a hurry -- and he can't be seen coming to the rescue -- but he does briskly poke a few holes in the box to let in some air.
Absent any real companions, the Kid invents his own. Dreaming of the possibility of moving to Africa, he converses with a fantasy friend whose knowledge of that continent, unfortunately, cannot extend beyond the Kid's: elephants and poverty and, um, drumming and dancing? He also receives visits from the advice columnist Dan Savage, played with suavity by David Greenspan. Mr. Savage spearheaded the recent ''It Gets Better'' campaign on YouTube, after a spate of suicides by gay teenagers.
In one of the show's more pointedly funny moments, the Kid argues that it's not always that easy to forge a path to a less oppressive life. ''Most of you are rich,'' the Kid says, referring to the celebrities who piled on with more ''It Gets Better'' videos. ''And the world was different when you were young. When you were escaping wherever you were escaping. There were jobs. And college didn't cost a bazillion dollars.''
Directed with an appealingly light touch by Jesse Geiger for the company A Collection of Shiny Objects, ''queerSpawn'' isn't much more than a comic-strip portrait of the brutalities endured by a good kid dealt a tough hand. The actors -- who include Noel Joseph Allain as Brad Pitt and the hunky doctor played by Eric Dane in ''Grey's Anatomy,'' two more playmates in the Kid's yearning psyche -- all bring sharp, funny contours to their mostly small roles. J. Alexander Coe stands out, hilarious and repellent, as the Kid's various torturers. (Mr. Greenspan is sharp but definitely not funny in another role, the gay-hater Fred Phelps, who croons to the Kid, trapped in the box, that he's probably better off killing himself now.)
''QueerSpawn'' has little in the way of narrative arc. The poor Kid seems to suffer the same cruelties day in and day out. He lands in the hospital more than once, but remains steadfast in his unwillingness to tell his parents about the cause of his suffering. That's a moving note that rings achingly true: the pain of being bullied is compounded by the shame it brings. The shame breeds isolation, which brings more unhappiness.
The static nature of the story may be a mild dramatic drawback -- even though the show clocks in at a brisk 70 minutes -- but it's an all-too-apt expression of the interior world of a high school freshman looking at four years of the loneliness and despair that have become his everyday companions. How can you really believe that things will get better when they never seem to change?

HEADLINE: Patterns of Changes in Health Insurance

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Well-paid employees are likely to retain their employer-provided health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, and lower-paid employees are likely to be shifted to insurance exchanges, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
A number of industries can expect big changes in employee health insurance in the next year or two, while others will continue with business as usual.
Beginning next year, states and the federal government intend to create opportunities for families to purchase health insurance, separate from their employers, through insurance "exchanges" in the states. Insurers and the federal government will heavily advertise the new plans. Most important, middle- and low-income families may qualify for valuable federal subsidies that will serve to reduce premiums and out-of-pocket health costs. 
To qualify for subsidized exchange plans, workers cannot be offered affordable insurance by their employers. Paradoxically, employers will create subsidy opportunities for their middle- and low-income employees whenever they fail to offer health insurance.
On the other hand, an employer dropping its health insurance next year will put its high-income employees in a tough spot, because they will have to buy insurance on their own without the tax advantages they had in the past by obtaining health insurance through their employer. As a result, employers with relatively many high-income employees will be under pressure to keep their insurance, whereas an employer of middle- and low-income employees may find them asking for health insurance to be dropped from the employee benefit menu.
Administrative costs, rising premiums and other costs have already made a number of employers lukewarm about health insurance, but they offered it in order to attract employees who do not care to be uninsured or to end up on Medicaid. The new insurance opportunities that become available next year may give their employees enough of an alternative that the lukewarm employers can drop their plans.

Both of these situations are closely correlated across industries, which leaves me to suspect that we can readily predict the industries that will retain employer insurance and predict those that will drop whatever health benefits they currently have. The scatter diagram below displays Bureau of Labor Statistics data on several industries according to the percentage of their employees in families above three times the poverty line (horizontal axis) and the percentage of employers offering health benefits as of March 2012 (vertical axis).
I measured employees relative to three times the poverty line because that is the family income threshold beyond which the new exchange subsidies are less valuable than the income tax preference for employer-sponsored health insurance.
Industries like colleges, utilities and banking almost always offer health insurance, and about 80 percent of their employees will be getting a better deal on employer health insurance than they would from the exchange plans because their families are above three times the poverty line. For these reasons, I am confident that these industries will continue to offer health insurance to their employees in much the same way that they have in the past.
A couple of industries like "accommodation and food services" (i.e., restaurants), leisure and hospitality, administrative and waste services, and construction already have a mix of employers in terms of their health insurance offerings, so it would not be unusual from an industry perspective for those that currently have health plans to drop them during the next couple of years. 
Moreover, the diagram shows how 45 to 60 percent of their employees do not come from families above three times poverty and therefore will have a significant federal health insurance subsidy waiting for them as soon as their employers drop coverage.
Employers that do not offer health insurance may be subject to penalties, but the penalties are not levied based on part-time employees, or levied on small employers, and even the penalties levied will be less than the subsidy opportunities created by an employer of middle- and low-income people that fails to offer health insurance.
For these reasons, I suspect that the stories we will hear about employers dropping insurance will disproportionately come from the industries shown in the lower left part of the scatter diagram, which collectively employ about 25 million people. Some employers in these industries have already discussed such plans.

HEADLINE: Dimon and Blankfein, Foxhole Buddies

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase has received advice from Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs. | Activist investing has traditionally been greeted with hostility in Japan. | Daniel S. Loeb is taking a polite approach with Sony. | Bloomberg L.P. is growing to resemble the Wall Street firms that are its clients. 

 BODY:
Jamie Dimon, wrestling with the fallout from JPMorgan Chase's multibillion-dollar trading loss, has received advice from a rival, Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Susanne Craig and Jessica Silver-Greenberg report in DealBook. "The two executives have talked privately a number of times in recent months about the challenges that Mr. Dimon is facing, people with knowledge of the relationship but not authorized to speak on the matter, have said."
The conversations between the two chief executives underscore a role reversal. "It is now Mr. Dimon who is in a harsh public spotlight, seemingly at odds with regulators. It was not long ago that Mr. Blankfein was being questioned by Congress over accusations that Goldman had misled investors during the financial crisis over the sale of mortgage-backed securities," DealBook writes. "Now, with Goldman cleared of crisis-era investigations and its profits rising, Mr. Blankfein is enjoying something of a renaissance as an elder statesman of Wall Street." One person with knowledge of the relationship who was not authorized to speak on the record said: "I would call them foul weather friends." 
Mr. Dimon faces a test in the coming days, as shareholders vote on whether to separate his positions of chairman and chief executive. But the debate over that matter is "silly," Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. "People make mistakes, and whether having yet another voice supervising risk would make a difference is uncertain. With JPMorgan, an independent chairman is probably not going to bolster risk management in any meaningful way." Mr. Davidoff continues, "Given what can be realistically expected from separating the chairman and chief executive positions, this shareholder vote appears to be more about the uneasiness people feel about big banks."
AN UNINVITED GUEST IN JAPAN | In pushing for a breakup of Sony, Daniel S. Loeb is bringing an American style of investing to a clubby corporate culture where such activism has traditionally been greeted with hostility, Hiroko Tabuchi writes in DealBook. "How Sony, and Japan, react to the demands brought by Mr. Loeb on Tuesday could become a test of how far the country has come in making good on promises to open up to more foreign investment and, more important, change."
Investors initially cheered Mr. Loeb's efforts, as shares of Sony rose nearly 10 percent in the United States on Tuesday, to $20.76. But the reaction among Sony's managers has been muted. "Sony is an icon. Until now, it hasn't had a fellow like this coming in and making demands in public," said Nicholas Benes, a former Wall Street banker who now advises Japanese companies on corporate governance. In the past, American activist investors have met with frustration in their efforts to add value at Japanese companies.
So far, Mr. Loeb has been far more polite in this campaign than in his previous efforts, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced notes. In a letter hand-delivered to Sony's chief executive, Mr. Loeb said he wanted to be a partner to the company. But followers of the investor know he has made his name on his poison pen. In one example, a 2005 letter to the chief executive of Star Gas, a heating oil distributor, Mr. Loeb said: "It is time for you to step down from your role as C.E.O. and director so that you can do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites."
ON THE AGENDA | Hedge funds disclose their holdings in 13-F filings. Data on industrial production in the United States in April is out at 9:15 a.m. Macy's reports earnings before the market opens; Cisco Systems reports results Wednesday evening. A House Financial Services subcommittee has a hearing at 10 a.m. on too-big-to-fail institutions. Robert Wolf of 32 Advisors is on CNBC at 8 a.m. Gary D. Cohn of Goldman Sachs is on CNBC at 1:30 p.m.
BLOOMBERG L.P., WALL STREET PLAYER | "Long thought of as a company that serves the needs of Wall Street firms, Bloomberg L.P. is quietly becoming more like them, moving recently into businesses that have been the domain of the largest banks," Peter Eavis and Nathaniel Popper write in DealBook. "This relatively unheralded expansion by Bloomberg helps explain Wall Street's consternation at recent disclosures that some customer data was freely available to reporters and others inside the company. The fear inside banks is that Bloomberg could use that data not only to write negative news articles but also to compete directly."
"In recent years, Bloomberg has offered new ways to trade stocks, bonds and more complicated financial products, potentially taking revenue from subscribers to the ubiquitous Bloomberg desktop terminals, which contain a vast store of market data. The expansion is even leading Bloomberg to offer traditional Wall Street services like wealth management and research."

HEADLINE: About That Debt Crisis? Never Mind

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Message to the unemployed: &#8220;Oopsies!&#8221; 

 BODY:
OK, another toe dipped in reality. The new CBO numbers are out, and they scream "debt crisis? What debt crisis?" Here's the actual and projected ratio of federal debt to GDP: 
Yes, debt rose substantially in the face of economic crisis - which is what is supposed to happen. But runaway deficits? Not a hint.
Yes, there are longer-term issues of health costs and demographics. As always, however, these have no relevance to what we should be doing now - and it's far from clear why they should even be a priority for discussion. As I've written before, the VSP consensus seems to be that to avoid the possibility of future benefit cuts, we must commit ourselves now now now to ... future cuts in benefits. 
Why, it's almost as if the real goal was to make sure that benefits get cut even if the fiscal outlook improves.
Meanwhile, our policy discourse has been dominated for years by what turns out to be a false alarm. To the millions of Americans who are out of work and may never get another job thanks to premature fiscal austerity, the VSPs would like to say, "oopsies!"
Or maybe not even that. I'm happy to report that the Times does place this fiscal news on page 1. But correspondents tell me that at VSP Central, aka The Washington Post - where deficit panic has pervaded the news pages as well as the opinion section - the stunning new deficit report is buried as a small item deep inside the paper.
And Bowles and Simpson, who are now 26 months into their prediction of fiscal crisis within two years, will continue to be treated as revered gurus.

HEADLINE: A Team Approach to Get Students College Ready

BYLINE: DAVID BORNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: A group called Blue Engine that places recent college graduates as full-time teaching assistants in a few public high schools is showing promising results. 

 BODY:
When Parker Sheffy, a first-year teacher in the Bronx Leadership Academy II, a high school in the South Bronx, talks shop with friends who are also new teachers, he often hears about the problems they are facing: students not showing up to class on time, not understanding their work, not doing homework. "I'm thinking: I don't have that problem... I don't have that problem..." Sheffy recalled. In his ninth grade integrated algebra class, he estimates that 80 to 90 percent are on track to pass the Regents exam, more than double last year's figure.
"But I have to remind myself that this is not just because of me," Sheffy said. "I'm one of six people who have created this class." 
Sheffy's school is one of three New York City public schools working with an organization called Blue Engine, which recruits and places recent college graduates as full-time teaching assistants in high schools, helps teachers shift to a small-group classroom model with a ratio of one instructor for roughly every six students, uses data tracking to generate rapid-fire feedback so problems can be quickly addressed, and provides weekly instruction in "social cognition" classes, where students are introduced to skills and concepts - such as the difference between a "fixed" and a "growth" mind-set - that can help them grasp their untapped potential.
Blue Engine also targets algebra, geometry and English language arts in the ninth and 10th grades because performance in these so-called "gateway" courses is associated with college success.
Despite its modest size and short track record, Blue Engine has already seized the attention of educators and attracted notice from President Obama. Last year, in its schools, as a result of the program, the number of students who met the "college ready" standard - scoring above 80 on their Regents exams in algebra, geometry or English language arts - nearly tripled, from 49 to 140.
Katherine Callaghan, the principal of the Bronx Leadership Academy II, who has worked in the school for more than 10 years, said: "Blue Engine has moved a huge number of our students in a way that nothing else that we've ever tried has been able to do." She added: "Last year we had a 44 percent pass rate on the integrated algebra Regents, with two kids scoring above an 80. This year, we're on track for 75 or 80 percent passing, with 20 kids hitting the college-ready mark. We're close to doubling our pass rate and multiplying by a factor of 10 our college-ready rate."
Gains like this are not often seen in education. So it's worth taking note. What's happening?
Blue Engine was born in the wake of a disappointing eight-year educational intervention led by its founder, Nick Ehrmann. And it shows. There is a refreshing humility baked into its model - particularly in the core idea that teachers need lots more support than they are given to do what they are expected to do. Ehrmann got his own start in education as a Teach For America corps member, teaching fourth and fifth grades at Emery Elementary School, in a tough neighborhood in Washington, D.C. He wanted his students in class 312 to make it through college, so working with the "I Have a Dream Foundation," he raised over $1 million to provide them with tutoring, mentoring and scholarships over several years.
After he left teaching to pursue a doctorate in sociology at Princeton, Ehrmann's Project 312 became the basis for his thesis. For years, he tracked the students' progress against a comparison group from the same school. "I fully intended to arrogantly study what our nonprofit was getting right," he recalled. "After six years, I found that our work had not had a shred of impact on academic achievement."
Half of the students went on to graduate from high school; almost all of them enrolled in a higher education program; to date, not one has earned a bachelor's degree; only one has a certificate from a vocational program.
That experience led Ehrmann to redouble his efforts focusing on a question of paramount importance for social equity and the long-term economic health of the nation: How do we help low-income students succeed in college? The current unemployment rate tells a powerful story: it's 4.5 percent for college graduates, 8.3 percent for high school graduates, and 12.4 percent for those without a diploma. Now consider: only 8 students out of every 100 from the bottom income quartile in the United States earn bachelor's degrees by their mid-20s (pdf).
There are many causes. But in recent years, researchers have come to agree that a big one is a lack of rigor at the high school level. "The most important pre-collegiate indicator of your success in college is the academic intensity of your high school curriculum," says Clifford Adelman, a senior associate at the Institute for Higher Education Policy, who has conducted seminal research on the issue (pdf). "One step beyond Algebra 2 in high school will double the odds that you will finish college." 
David Conley, Director of the Center for Educational Policy Research at the University of Oregon, adds that the key is not just mastering material, but taking courses that teach you how to "organize and integrate information, think deeper and take ownership and control of learning."
How could we make traditional high schools more academically rigorous places for many more kids? Ehrmann researched a number of models, including the Match High School, a charter school in Boston that gets impressive results by providing two hours of tutoring in small groups each day. In 2010, Blue Engine began working to see if a similar approach could be integrated more broadly into public schools - to close the gap between students being college eligible and college ready.
"The biggest open secret in American education is that we are shoveling kids off to higher education without preparing them to succeed," Ehrmann said. Indeed, three quarters of students attending the City University of New York in 2011 required remedial instruction in reading, writing or math. That translates into a lot of dreams deferred, because students who are assigned remedial coursework in college - for which they earn no credit but pay full tuition - rarely complete their degrees (pdf, p. 63).
Parker Sheffy's ninth grade algebra class is divided into six groups. The class begins with 10 or 15 minutes of whole group instruction, then Sheffy and five Blue Engine Teaching Assistants (called BETAs) settle into small group work. The day I visited, during a class on probability, what was notable was simply that all the students were hunched over their desks, pencils and calculators in hand, hard at work, for the entire period. I scanned for students staring into space, but found none. For 45 minutes, there was a continuous flow of interactions between the students and BETAs, with scores of quiet questions and clarifications, and students often assisting one another. It was disturbing to realize that most of these questions wouldn't have been asked or answered in a traditional classroom. It also made me wonder: Why do we hold to the idea that one teacher should be responsible for meeting the learning needs of a whole class of students - particularly when some students arrive at school three or four years behind grade level?
One of the BETAs, Kym Scherbarth, is a recent graduate of the University of California, San Diego. Scherbarth had considered going into teaching out of college, but she didn't feel ready to lead a class. "I figured this was a good way to learn how to be an effective educator and decide if it was something I wanted to pursue," she said. Working closely with students in four classrooms every day, she's seen where and how students often struggle and learned how to give concise and specific feedback. She's also discovered that she has a gift for motivating students, particularly those who have not previously experienced success in school.
That's not just her intuition speaking. BETAs keep track of student performance on a daily basis - scoring things like attendance and homework effort and accuracy and mastery of the day's lesson (as indicated by mini exit tests). They meet with lead teachers twice a week to review the data and devise strategies to address problems. The numbers tell them where to focus, what's working, and what isn't. "Doing this regularly from the beginning of the year has been very encouraging," Scherbarth said. "From where they started, I don't think the students know how big of a jump they've made."
Scherbarth has signed on for another year with Blue Engine and now plans to become a teacher. This is a pathway that others are following and it's conceivable that Blue Engine could evolve into an alternative model for teacher preparation, one that provides more ramp-up time than programs like Teach For America. This spring, the organization received 578 applications from 187 universities and colleges for 43 teaching assistant slots; one-fifth came from Ivy League schools; more than two-fifths were from African-Americans and Latinos. And all of them are vying for jobs that have a starting salary of $14,400 per year (plus an AmeriCorps educational award of $5,550).
Blue Engine's model is still in its early stages. While the overall trend is upward, there remains considerable variation among classes. Some teachers have struggled to work effectively with BETAs (younger teachers have found the transition to team-teaching easier). And big literacy gains have so far proven more difficult to elicit than gains in math, with which the organization has more experience.
The model could not be more timely. In recent years, reformers have focused more on individual teacher accountability than on the potential gains that could come from supporting teachers in better ways. Consider the experience of Sheffy, who is clearly a motivated and caring teacher. In his ninth grade algebra class, he is having great success. More than 80 percent of the students regularly complete their homework. In his two other classes (without BETAs), homework completion is much lower, he said.
There is a team behind the good results, and a price tag, too. Katherine Callaghan, the principal, said it costs about $150,000 to have 10 BETAs in the school, money that comes from her discretionary budget. Time will tell if these expenditures translate into bachelor's degrees. But Callaghan says the effects have already spread to other classes. "Science pass rates are up, too," she notes. "With all the BETAs, every single student feels known by someone. And they are all telling students that it's important to be college ready. That's building a really strong base in our 9th grade." 
For Ehrmann, the big question is: How fast and how far can a group of young people go in the course of one year under the right circumstances? Most teachers recognize that they could achieve better outcomes if they could provide more personalized instruction, grade more work, answer more questions, and have more time to build relationships with students.
The current classroom model limits all this. "That model will be radically transformed over time," says Ehrmann. "It's going to become a combination of strong teachers at the center, new forms of human capital, and the right technologies. I don't think anyone knows what environments will be best for kids. We're in the process of inventing it right now."

HEADLINE: Why Retirement Savings Are Falling Short

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: The financial crisis is not the only reason Americans cite for &#8220;derailing&#8221; their retirement plans, a new survey from Ameriprise Financial says. 

 BODY:
It's not just the recession that has set back Americans' retirement savings, a new survey from Ameriprise Financial says.
Asked about events that have "derailed" their retirement plans, many said personal events had affected their ability to save. 
One fourth, for instance, said they were supporting a grown child or grandchild, and an equal proportion said their pension was not worth as much as they'd thought or had been discontinued.
"Expecting the unexpected is clearly more important than ever in preparing for retirement," Suzanna de Baca, vice president of wealth strategies at Ameriprise Financial, said in a statement.
The survey was conducted for Ameriprise Financial by Koski Research, which surveyed 1,000 employed and retired adults, age 50 to 70, by telephone. All participants had assets of at least $100,000, including employer retirement plans, but not real estate. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
The vast majority of older Americans who have saved at least $100,000 toward retirement have experienced some sort of "derailer," whether an economic event or a personal one, that has affected retirement saving goals, the survey found.
The average survey participants said they had experienced four such events, which set back their savings plans by $117,000 on average. Nearly 37 percent of the participants said they had experienced five such events, costing them roughly $144,000.
The most-cited events were recession-related. For instance, nearly two-thirds of participants said low interest rates had affected the growth of their investments. More than half said their savings were significantly lowered by market declines, and a third said their home equity was going to contribute less to their retirement than they had expected.
As a result, only a third of participants said they were fully confident that they would be able to afford an unexpected expense, like a large home repair, in retirement.
When asked what they would do differently, more than half say they would have started saving earlier.
What sort of events have you experienced that have thrown off your retirement savings plans? How are you getting back on track?

HEADLINE: Why Fund Managers May Be Right About the Fed

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: What hedge fund investors are expressing should trouble all of us: they have almost no confidence in the Federal Reserve or the economics profession. 

 BODY:
The economics world has been having a lot of fun with hedge fund managers.
After several such managers at a recent conference denounced the aggressive money-printing policies of Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, the economic blogosphere rose up to mock them.
Many hedge fund managers have been predicting that high inflation and fleeing creditors would send interest rates skyrocketing. Stanley Druckenmiller, Paul Singer, J. Kyle Bass and David Einhorn - all big names in the investing world - have warned against the supposedly runaway central banker. Mr. Druckenmiller said that Mr. Bernanke was "running the most inappropriate monetary policy in history."
And they have been wrong. Those silly hedge fund managers. They don't understand macroeconomics! As Paul Krugman (and many others) have explained, the lack of demand explains why there isn't any inflation and why interest rates haven't risen despite all the money-printing.
Economists and bloggers have been competing to figure out why these supposedly smart guys are so confused. In an astute post, a Berkeley economist, Brad DeLong, explained his theory: hedge fund managers thought they could muscle the Fed into caving on its big trade, much like they got JPMorgan Chase to cave on the "London Whale" trades. But they fought the Fed, and the Fed won. 
Or perhaps they are simply expressing class preferences. They are ideologues, worried about their tax bills and redistribution policies. Hedge fund managers are wealthy. Asset owners hate inflation because it destroys the value of their holdings.
Or, more subtly, maybe it's an expression of preferences in their narrow professional role. These fund managers get paid mainly to manage other people's money. It's much easier to do that when assets are more volatile and when the short-term interest rates are significantly lower than long-term rates. Fixed-income managers like Pimco used to make a decent return buying long-term Treasuries, essentially investing in risk-free assets and charging fees to do it. No longer. Mr. Bernanke has revealed many of these managers to be empty suits - and they are lashing out.
The Druckenmillers of the world have been and will continue to be wrong about a coming debt crisis and runaway inflation. A dose of moderate inflation would help the economy right now. It would spur spending and investment, and ease debtors' plight.
But what these investors are expressing should trouble all of us: they have almost no confidence in the Federal Reserve or the economics profession. And for good reason.
It's impressive that the Fed and many economists have successfully predicted the path of interest rates and inflation in the wake of the worst financial crisis in a generation. But neither the central bank nor academicians managed to predict or prevent the crisis in the first place. The failure dwarfs the accomplishment.
The Fed's track record is out-and-out abysmal. Fund managers remember only too well how Alan Greenspan encouraged the stock bubble of the late 1990s, convincing investors that he would bail them out if the stock market dropped severely. Worse, Mr. Greenspan urged people in 2004 to buy homes by taking out adjustable rate mortgages. Then the central bank did nothing to curtail the housing bubble. (Whether the Fed kept rates too low for too long is hotly debated; in Mr. Greenspan's defense, the credit bubble kept inflating after the Fed started raising rates.)
The Fed began its lender-of-last-resort role in 2007, but did little to avoid or minimize the financial crisis. Once it hit, it did the right thing to flood the markets with money, but - along with the Treasury and a passive Justice Department - let banks and top executives escape penalty. And now, asset prices are going wild. Junk bonds are up. Stocks are up. Housing in Phoenix and Brooklyn is going mad.
This prebubble euphoria only undermines the Federal Reserve's fragile credibility. It reinforces the notion that it seems to know only two things: how to inflate bubbles and how to studiously not recognize them.
Flush from their victory predicting inflation and interest rates, some economists discount the worrisome market activity. Mr. Krugman, a columnist for The New York Times, recently urged Mr. Bernanke to ignore bubble talk.
And lo and behold, the Fed chairman gave a talk on the very subject last week.
The Fed needs to convince the markets that it is on high alert for excesses that could cause the next crisis. And it has to come from the chairman. Encouragingly, Mr. Bernanke said the Fed was on the lookout for unusual valuations, high leverage, new and dangerous products and excessive risk-taking.
Alas, the speech had shortcomings. Right up at the top, Mr. Bernanke delivered this laugher: "Of course, the Fed has always paid close attention to financial markets, for both regulatory and monetary policy purposes."
Of course. With notably rare exceptions, as Mr. Greenspan might put it.
Then Mr. Bernanke scared hedge fund managers out of their open-collar shirts and fleeces by reiterating long-standing Fed dogma: that bubbles cannot be identified ahead of time and that "neither the Federal Reserve nor economists in general predicted the past crisis."
Answering questions, he gave an example of what the Fed might be looking for. "Microsoft's stock is worth well more than it was some time ago, and it could still prove to be a bubble," Mr. Bernanke said, "but so far, so good."
Microsoft? Hello 1999! Is this what state-of-the-art monitoring gets us?
But Mr. Bernanke hasn't spoken about what may be a deeper problem: What if the Fed's loose monetary policy, with its giant bond purchases, is harmful?
If the price of lower unemployment were that hedge fund managers get a little richer, of course, we'd take the jobs. And if the choice were between helping someone get a job today or curtailing a potential crisis in the future, you put people to work now (though it depends on how big the crisis is likely to be).
But that might not be the choice. It sure seems as if Fed policy is helping only the wealthy, and not doing much for the economy. The net worth of the top 7 percent of American households rose in the first two years of the recovery, while the net worth of the bottom 93 percent declined. The percentage of working-age people who have jobs is dangerously low. Median income was lower in 2011 than it was in 1999. This cannot all be laid at the feet of the financial crisis. Working-age male income has been squeezed for decades. The economy has deeper problems.
Maybe monetary policy is simply reinforcing these trends.
Professional investors see it that way.
"What a lot of hedge fund managers are worried about is the inflation in asset prices, not cost and wages," said James Chanos, a noted hedge fund manager who is left of center. "This is leading to recurring booms and busts, which in addition are exacerbating income inequality."
The Fed has explicitly welcomed rising asset prices as a sign that its monetary policies are working, as lower rates push investors to put their money to work. But something is wrong. Companies are sitting on their profits. Businesses aren't investing and hiring enough.
In fact, the Fed may be inadvertently making things worse. What if it succeeds in bringing average people back into the markets right at the top? Is the Fed setting these poor suckers up to come in to buy from the hedge fund managers?
"The people you are trying to help don't get the message till the end of move," Mr. Chanos said. "You keep impoverishing them."
Now, I'm not remotely suggesting that the hedge fund denunciations are motivated out of a desire to help the unemployed. Please.
But they can read markets, and they can see that the Fed isn't engineering the hiring, inflation and recovery it would like. Instead of dismissing the critiques, the Fed and economists would do well to pay heed.

HEADLINE: A Black Nurse, a German Soldier and an Unlikely WWII Romance

BYLINE: ALEXIS CLARK


HIGHLIGHT: Elinor Elizabeth Powell and Frederick Albert met in Arizona in 1944. Their paths may never have crossed if it weren&#8217;t for the government&#8217;s mistreatment of black women during World War II. 

 BODY:
The nurse and the soldier may never have met - and eventually married - had it not been for the American government's mistreatment of black women during World War II.
Elinor Elizabeth Powell was an African-American military nurse. Frederick Albert was a German prisoner of war. Their paths crossed in Arizona in 1944. It was a time when the Army was resisting enlisting black nurses and the relatively small number allowed entry tended to be assigned to the least desirable duties. 
 "They decided they were going to use African-Americans but in very small numbers and in segregated locations," said Charissa Threat, a history professor at Northeastern University who teaches race and gender studies. 
Ms. Powell was born in 1921 in Milton, Mass., and in, 1944, after completing basic training at Fort Huachuca, Ariz., she was sent, as some other black nurses were, to tend to German prisoners of war in Florence, Ariz. 
"I know the story of how they met," said Chris Albert, 59, the youngest son of Elinor and Frederick Albert. "It was in the officers' mess hall, and my father was working in the kitchen. He kind of boldly made his way straight for my mother and said: 'You should know my name. I'm the man who's going to marry you.'"
Frederick Karl Albert was born in 1925 in Oppeln, Germany. "He volunteered for the paratroops to impress his father, who served in WWI," Mr. Albert said. "His father was an engineer and not really interested in his children. My dad ended up getting captured in Italy."
He joined many other German prisoners who were detained in camps across the United States. With millions of American men away in combat or basic training, P.O.W.'s became a solution to the labor shortage. Under the Geneva Convention, enlisted prisoners of war could work for the detaining power, said Matthias Reiss, a professor at the University of Exeter, in England, who has researched the history of German P.O.W.'s. "So the idea was, bring them over to America and let them do the unskilled work."
In the camp in Arizona, Frederick Albert worked in the kitchen, where he prepared special meals for Elinor. A romance between the two blossomed but not without consequences. "My dad was severely beaten by a group of officers when they found out about my mom," Mr. Albert said, referring to American soldiers.
At Camp Florence, as well as other camps, the environment for black nurses could be particularly humiliating. The nurses were forced to eat in separate dining halls, apart from white officers on the base. 
"My mother mentioned that she was in a bar or some place that had food or drink and they refused to serve her," said Stephen Albert, 66, Elinor and Frederick's oldest son. 
The discrimination blacks encountered was not lost on the German P.O.W.'s. 
"You'd be hard-pressed to find a German soldier who was held captive in America who didn't speak about African-Americans," Professor Reiss said. "They were quite aware there was a major discrimination problem and that the Americans weren't really allowed to occupy the moral high ground on that matter."
By war's end, about 500 black nurses had served in World War II. All German P.O.W.'s, including Frederick Albert, were eventually sent to Germany.
The American military officially ended segregation after WWII, but for the Alberts, the issue of race would resurface throughout their lives. Their unlikely romance resulted in Stephen's birth in December 1946. After Frederick was able to return to the United States, he and Elinor married on June 26, 1947, in Manhattan.
"I would say the first 10 years for my parents were a struggle to find some kind of economic security and a safe haven for an interracial family," said Chris Albert, who plays the trumpet with the Duke Ellington Orchestra.
"They moved to Boston and my father worked several jobs,'' he said. "At some point, he decided it was best if they moved to Göttingen, Germany, where his parents lived. He could work for his father's cement manufacturing business."
But Kristina Brandner, 70, a niece of Frederick Albert, said life in Germany was difficult. "Göttingen is a small town,'' she said. "My grandmother never had contact with black people so it was strange and uncomfortable for her with Elinor. Kids used to ask me how come there was a black woman living with us, and why is your cousin another color. Sometimes, I saw Elinor in the kitchen crying."
In less than two years, Frederick, Elinor, Stephen and Chris, who was an infant, returned to the United States. 
"We came back and moved to Morton, Pa. And then they went through the school issue," Mr. Albert said.
That issue was the rejection of Stephen's attempt to enroll at a local public school after being told that the school was not open to black children. 
"My mother pitched a fit," Mr. Albert said, who still has a copy of the letter Elinor wrote to the school superintendent and a local branch of the N.A.A.C.P. 
In 1959, Mr. and Ms. Albert settled in Village Creek, an interracial neighborhood in Norwalk, Conn., where Elinor became an avid gardener and Frederick became a vice president at Pepperidge Farm. 
"We always had great music at home," said Mr. Albert, who resides in his childhood house in Norwalk. "My dad had this affinity for New Orleans jazz. I think it was a much larger representation for him. That lack of warmth he felt growing up, he found it in jazz and when he saw my mother."
Mr. Albert's father died in 2001, and his mother in 2005. 
"I now ask myself how come I never questioned my dad about Hitler or what he thought about the Nazi movement," said Mr. Albert, who will perform along with his band mates at the Blue Note Jazz Club in the West Village this month. 
"My mother didn't talk about it either,'' he said. "They didn't bring up the past. But what I do know about my parents, their story is a remarkable one."

HEADLINE: The Obama Synthesis, Vindicated?

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Does the improving deficit picture vindicate the White House&#8217;s policy approach? 

 BODY:
Having noted the ways in which the the recent scandals (and other developments) pose a challenge to this administration's distinctive political/policy synthesis, I should also take note of the piece of recent news that makes that synthesis look better than it sometimes has. That news would be the latest deficit projections, as summarized by my colleague Annie Lowrey:
 ... a new report released Tuesday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office [estimates] that the deficit for this fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, will fall to about $642 billion, or 4 percent of the nation's annual economic output, about $200 billion lower than the agency estimated just three months ago. 
The agency forecast that the deficit, which topped 10 percent of gross domestic product in 2009, could shrink to as little as 2.1 percent of gross domestic product by 2015 - a level that most analysts say would be easily sustainable over the long run - before beginning to climb gradually through the rest of the decade.
Of course, as the quotes in Lowrey's piece make clear, almost nobody is willing to break out the champagne on these estimates. The Keynesians think our shrinking deficit is a sign of the White House's foolish surrender to austerity at a time when the economy still needs more government spending, not less, to achieve real lift-off. The deficit hawks think a dropping deficit will only encourage Washington's fatal short-term thinking, by persuading policymakers to ignore the still-yawning gap between our long-term commitments and our revenues. Conservatives don't like the extent to which we're taxing our way to temporary fiscal stability (some of the unexpected deficit reduction reflected high-income tax filers paying extra for 2012 to avoid higher rates for 2013), while liberals have reason to fret that the White House's "fiscal cliff" strategy squandered an important opportunity to raise upper-income taxes even more. And anyone who worries about the American political system's ability to do structural reform can't be that encouraged by the path we've taken to this point - the crude cuts to discretionary spending that leave entitlements untouched, the higher marginal tax rates rather than a rate-lowering, deduction-capping tax reform, and of course the general inability to compromise in the absence of artificial deadlines and self-created crises.
But politics about the near-term as well as the long run, and in the possible as well as the ideal. And with these numbers coming on the heels of several months of decent job growth, you have to give the Obama administration credit for this much: The worst-case scenarios that the White House's critics feared and warned against - for deficit hawks, some sort of debt crisis; for more aggressive Keynesians, a double-dip recession - both look much more unlikely today than they did a couple of years ago. Which means that Obama's defenders can make a case that he steered a reasonably successful middle course - balancing pump-priming with fiscal responsibility, reaching for a grand bargain but accepting second-best compromises - and that given the political constraints it's hard to imagine anyone doing that much better. He got all the stimulus money that Congress was ever going to be willing to push out the door, his own party didn't give him that much room to maneuver on entitlements, the opposition party was too dysfunctional to cut a deal with on tax reform (or, really, anything)... and here we are, in much better economic shape than Europe and with more breathing room on debt than anyone expected. It isn't ideal, but it could have been a lot worse. 
I don't agree with a lot of this pitch, but I agree with the last line. I think the White House made bad choices on the stimulus and the health care bill that limited its flexibility on economic policy later on; I think Obama has never been interested in the kind of structural reforms that our entitlement system needs; and I think this White House's second term agenda is mostly non-responsive to these challenges. (The non-ideological case for electing Mitt Romney rested on this last reality, and the advantages of a fresh start.)
But these critiques and counterfactuals notwithstanding, Obama is currently presiding over an improving fiscal and economic picture, and the disasters that conservatives, in particular, descried on the horizon - default, hyper-inflation, Greece - seem increasingly remote. It's not the best possible news, but it's much better than some of the alternatives. And given what I'd probably be writing if the news were worse, it's important to give this White House some credit that it isn't.

HEADLINE: The Taxman Cometh

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Brooks and Collins on the I.R.S.&#8217;s attack on the Tea Party and the Justice Department&#8217;s disdain for the First Amendment. 

 BODY:
Gail Collins: David, as you know, I'm from Cincinnati. Some people may think of it as just another city in Ohio, but there has been a lot of drama coming out of Cincinnati over the years. One of the stars of the savings and loan scandal of the '80s, Charles Keating, used to lecture at the Catholic girls' high school I went to. The lectures were not about finance but rather on the sinfulness of wearing shorts in the summertime. However, my point is that stuff happens in Cincinnati.
David Brooks: Have I ever mentioned the fascinating Fed study that correlated the shortness of women's shorts with higher mortgage default rates? It was no coincidence that the vogue for Daisy Dukes immediately preceded the financial crisis.
O.K., I am completely making this up. I am merely trying to deflect attention away from my main association with Cincinnati. The Big Red Machine. The best baseball team of my lifetime (Bench, Rose, Perez, Foster, Morgan, etc.), which brought me much personal pain as a Mets fan. 
Gail: Now my poor hometown is being castigated as the center of an I.R.S. scandal. Humble workers at the Cincinnati office targeted Tea Party groups and other conservative organizations for special scrutiny when those groups applied for tax-exempt status. There's no conceivable excuse for that. It was deeply, deeply wrong.
David: Good news. It turns out the Washington office of the I.R.S. was also deeply involved in going after conservative groups. That's a relief. I've spent the last few days asking myself this question: Is it possible that a group of people were doing something completely vicious and stupid without somebody in Washington being involved? Thankfully, that matter has been resolved.
Gail: Yeah, at least Cincinnati did not sin alone. It's a pretty upright city. You'd have to figure it would need company. But Republicans quickly decided this was a plot on the part of the Obama administration, and I don't buy that part at all. I'm not happy proclaiming that we've discovered a big, huge case of nonpartisan ineptitude, but that looks like the story.
David: I don't know. Tuesday's Washington Post story makes it clear that people in Washington were pretty well aware. There are two possibilities. Either they targeted Tea Party groups because there were suddenly so many of them, and they were unaware that this might look like a politically motivated assault, in which case they are more oblivious than your average pebble, or else they targeted them for political reasons. It is not hard to believe that people in the biggest tax agency feel some animosity toward the nation's most virulently anti-tax people. You'd have to repeal human nature for this not to be the case.
Gail: I'm going for more oblivious than the average pebble. Sorry, Cincinnati.
David: By the way, can I just say that I'm amazed that this I.R.S. story is bigger news than the Justice Department's assault on The Associated Press and its reporters? I regard that intrusion as a much more egregious assault on the Constitution. I say that not just as a journalist, but because it is classic Big Brother behavior, making it impossible for journalism to function. To me this is the biggest scandal of the year, and the I.R.S. scandal is more like midlevel thuggery.
Gail: I agree, and that one troubles me much, much more because unlike the I.R.S. scandal - and the raft of other alleged scandals in Washington - I do suspect that the administration was complicit in seizing the Associated Press records. This is the sort of thing it's supported in the past. With strong Republican backing, I should add.
David: Both of these matters, of course, grow out of a culture of federal arrogance.
Gail: The A.P. record-poaching sprang from the mind-set that causes a president to lose all interest in the Bill of Rights once he's responsible for protecting the nation's security. I can understand that temptation, but the fact that even a former constitutional law professor is not immune is sort of disturbing.
But about the I.R.S. - both parties have taken advantage of the current law to form huge, tax-exempt fund-raising groups that are totally political. They're interested in the tax-exempt status mainly because it protects them from having to reveal their donors. The most famous one is Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS but the Democrats have them, too. I would argue that the Democrats started theirs only in self-defense but you can feel free to ignore that part.
David: I would argue that both parties started theirs only in self-defense. In fact when Obama outraised McCain by zillions of dollars, that was self-defense too, because a pair of Martian Koch brothers could have invaded Earth at any moment and infused the G.O.P. with cash.
I guess I agree that campaign finance is a mess, but when the I.R.S. starts targeting their political opponents, as they did here, I would say that is a real scandal.
Gail: There are probably going to be a trillion Congressional hearings on this. It would be nice if just one committee looked at the question of overhauling those tax rules so political fund-raisers had to disclose their donors. But that's probably too much to ask.
David: There are two ways to do oversight. There's the Henry Waxman way, when you get targets in the witness chair and you just go after them with indignation flying. Then there's the Tom Carper way. Carper is the senator from Delaware who is chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. He gets himself deeply enmeshed in the management of his agency on a detailed basis, works hard to make sure it is decently run, and tries to head off scandal with constant minute oversight. I guess I prefer the Carper method.
Gail: I don't argue with the desirability of the method, but Homeland Security generally tends toward nonpartisan. The Republican equivalent of Henry Waxman is Oversight chairman Darrell Issa, who is just flat-out terrible.
Now I'm envisioning a whole bunch of shrieking committee hearings that make it even more impossible for the I.R.S. to clamp down on political groups that disguise themselves as charities in order to let their big-bucks donors go incognito.
David: If they do it even-steven, I don't see why they should have difficulty doing that. I mean, don't you think you would've reacted differently if they had targeted women's groups or gun-control groups or environmental groups?
Gail: I honestly still think I would have wanted the reforms to include the big-bucks players, which will never happen now.
It's been a depressing few weeks on the political front, and this I.R.S. thing is going to make the next few even more so. The least they could have done was to leave poor Cincinnati out of it.
David. Look on the bright side. I bet they're really happy in Akron.

HEADLINE: In the Candy Cab, Sweets That Delight, and Heal

BYLINE: NATALIE KITROEFF


HIGHLIGHT: Mansoor Khalid has turned his taxi into a rolling party featuring confections, colored lights and a fancy sound system. Sometimes, it helps him forget. 

 BODY:
"No eating or drinking inside this car," reads a sign in Mansoor Khalid's cab, "Except candies."
There are plenty of them. Mr. Khalid keeps the back dashboard of his yellow cab stocked with a layer of candy thick enough to induce envy in the most successful trick-or-treater.
"Turn around; see what else is back there," Mr. Khalid recently told Legend Wilson, 7, who was riding in the cab with his mother, May Wilson. "There's a lot of options." 
Ms. Wilson said that her son had plenty of candy at home. "Come on, he can have some; he's in the candy cab!" Mr. Khalid insisted. "I'll call you when he has to go to the dentist," Ms. Wilson said as her son collected a small pile of treats.
Free candy isn't the only perk of riding with Mr. Khalid, a 37-year-old electrical engineer from Pakistan who has been driving a yellow cab since 1996. He also recently bought a $400 subwoofer that, in his words, makes "your heart go boom," and invites customers to plug their devices into the speakers. To complete the nightclub-in-a-cab experience, the car is also outfitted with an advanced lighting system that, when activated, flashes fluorescent reds, blues and purples.
"Everybody is depressed, stressed, New York City is not an easy life, so when New Yorkers see all the candies, chocolates," they cheer up, Mr. Khalid said. "Some people start screaming, they're so happy."
His altruism isn't bad for business, either. Mr. Khalid's cab has become an Internet celebrity, earning thousands of followers on Twitter, Instagram and . That loyal online following supplies a steady stream of customers for Mr. Khalid, who fields frequent requests for pickups from fans who send their locations to him via Twitter or Facebook.
Mr. Khalid also uses Twitter and Instagram to advertise his services, posting pictures of grinning couples with handfuls of candy.
This grassroots outreach is one way that yellow cabs can rise above the fray in an increasingly competitive market. Last month, the Uber app became the first service to allow New Yorkers to hail yellow cabs with their smartphones, though a pilot program for the apps remains mired in court.
With the candy cab, Mr. Khalid has essentially created his own personal Uber, with nothing more than his smartphone and social media savvy.
But don't expect the 13,000 other yellow taxis to follow suit any time soon. The $300 a month Mr. Khalid spends on candy would probably be a dealbreaker for most cabbies.
"If you think about it, you have to wonder why he does it," said Juan Miranda, who drives Mr. Khalid's cab during the day. "The way it is now, every time I brake, it falls forward."
Mr. Khalid's customers certainly appreciate the effort. One rider, Casandra Johnson, was quiet during the first few moments of her ride with Mr. Khalid a few weeks ago, but perked up once she saw the stash in the back seat. "I was in a bad mood because I've been lugging boxes all day," she said, "You just totally changed my Monday."
Another passenger wrote on Twitter, "Sweetest ride in fifteen years. Left my bag of knitting there, but gained so much at heart when I googled you. God bless."
She was referring to the somber back story of Mr. Khalid's generosity. His son, Saad, was born in 2010 with a congenital heart defect, and when Mr. Khalid visited him at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx after his night shift, he would bring coffee for the doctors and nurses there, who called him "coffee man."
"My average was 20 bucks every night, for coffee and sweets," he said.
Saad died last April, only 18 months old. When Mr. Khalid returned to work, he decided to turn his cab into a rolling celebration.
A year later, Mr. Khalid said that he still has not moved on. He still smells his son's old clothing, and has kept the boy's room untouched. But he learned from his time in the hospital that giving to others could at least hide, if not heal, his own feelings of loss.
"I like to buy something for people; I feel good," Mr. Khalid said. "When you give something from your hand, you feel very good when someone gives a smile."

HEADLINE: Cholesterol Levels No Longer Declining

BYLINE: NICHOLAS BAKALAR


HIGHLIGHT: Average levels of LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol, declined significantly in Americans from 2001 to 2008, but have remained steady ever since, a new study has found. 

 BODY:
Average levels of LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol, declined significantly in Americans from 2001 to 2008, but have remained steady ever since. No one knows why. 
Using the database of a medical testing company, researchers checked LDL values in the blood of almost 105 million men and women age 18 and older. After adjusting for age, they found that average LDL declined steadily at a rate of 2.05 milligrams per deciliter per year, to 104.7 in 2008 from 120 in 2001.
But the study, published in the May issue of PLoS One, found that over the next three years, there was almost no change, with levels in 2011 averaging 104.3. A reading under 100 is generally considered healthy, but some experts recommend getting to 70 or below, especially for people with heart disease.
The scientists offer three possible explanations. The recession that began in 2008 may have made people stop seeing doctors or buying cholesterol-lowering statins; the benefits of taking the drugs reached their maximum; or increasing obesity began to overwhelm the drugs' beneficial effects.
"We've raised a red flag that something dramatic happened," said the lead author, Dr. Harvey W. Kaufman, senior medical director at Quest Diagnostics, a medical testing company. "We laid out some theories, and it's now up to investigators to determine why."

HEADLINE: Big Banks Get Break in Rules to Limit Risks

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Lobbyists for the nation&#8217;s biggest banks have persuaded federal regulators to soften a proposed Dodd-Frank rule, a move that is expected to protect Wall Street&#8217;s control over the $700 trillion derivatives market. 

 BODY:
 9:33 p.m. | Updated 
Under pressure from Wall Street lobbyists, federal regulators have agreed to soften a rule intended to rein in the banking industry's domination of a risky market.
The changes to the rule, which will be announced on Thursday, could effectively empower a few big banks to continue controlling the derivatives market, a main culprit in the financial crisis.
The $700 trillion market for derivatives - contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset like a bond or an interest rate - allow companies to either speculate in the markets or protect against risk.
 It is a lucrative business that, until now, has operated in the shadows of Wall Street rather than in the light of public exchanges. Just five banks hold more than 90 percent of all derivatives contracts. 
Yet allowing such a large and important market to operate as a private club came under fire in 2008. Derivatives contracts pushed the insurance giant American International Group to the brink of collapse before it was rescued by the government.
In the aftermath of the crisis, regulators initially planned to force asset managers like Vanguard and Pimco to contact at least five banks when seeking a price for a derivatives contract, a requirement intended to bolster competition among the banks. Now, according to officials briefed on the matter, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has agreed to lower the standard to two banks.
About 15 months from now, the officials said, the standard will automatically rise to three banks. And under the trading commission's new rule, wide swaths of derivatives trading must shift from privately negotiated deals to regulated trading platforms that resemble exchanges.
But critics worry that the banks gained enough flexibility under the plan that it hews too closely to the "precrisis status."
"The rule is really on the edge of returning to the old, opaque way of doing business," said Marcus Stanley, the policy director of Americans for Financial Reform, a group that supports new rules for Wall Street.
Making such decisions on regulatory standards is a product of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which mandated that federal agencies write hundreds of new rules for Wall Street. Most of that effort is now complete at the trading commission. But across several other agencies, nearly two-thirds of the rules are unfinished, including some major measures like the Volcker Rule, which seeks to prevent banks from trading with their own money.
The deal over derivatives was forged from wrangling at the five-person commission, which was sharply divided. Gary Gensler, the agency's Democratic chairman, championed the stricter proposal. But he met opposition from the Republican members on the commission, as well as Mark Wetjen, a Democratic commissioner who has sided with Wall Street on other rules.
Mr. Wetjen argued that five banks was an arbitrary requirement, according to the officials briefed on the matter. In advocating the two-bank plan, he also noted that the agency would not prevent companies from seeking additional price quotes. Other regulators have proposed weaker standards.
Mr. Gensler, eager to rein in derivatives trading but lacking an elusive third vote, accepted the deal. By his reckoning, the compromise was better than no rule at all.
In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Gensler said that, even with the compromise, the rule will still push private derivatives trading onto regulated trading platforms, much like stock trading. He also argued that the agency plans to adopt two other rules on Thursday that will subject large swaths of trades to regulatory scrutiny.
"No longer will this be a closed, dark market," Mr. Gensler said. "I think what we're planning to do tomorrow fulfills the Congressional mandate and the president's commitment."
Yet the deal comes at an awkward time for the agency. Mr. Gensler, who was embraced by consumer advocates but scorned by some on Wall Street, is expected to leave the agency later this year now that his term has technically ended.
In preliminary talks about filling the spot, the White House is expected to consider Mr. Wetjen, a former aide to the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid. The administration, according to people briefed on the matter, is also looking at an outsider as a potential successor: Amanda Renteria, a former Goldman Sachs employee and Senate aide.
The prospect of someone other than Mr. Gensler completing the rules provided some momentum for the compromise, officials say. The officials also noted that Mr. Gensler had set a June 30 deadline for completing the plan.
The White House declined to comment. Mr. Gensler, who has not said whether he will seek a second term at the agency, declined to discuss his plans on Wednesday.
While the regulator defended the derivatives rule, consumer advocates say the agency gave up too much ground. To some, the compromise illustrated the financial industry's continued influence in Washington.
"The banks have all these ways to reverse the rules behind the scenes," Mr. Stanley said.
The compromise also alarmed Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the agency who has called for greater competition in the derivatives market. Still, Mr. Chilton signaled a willingness to vote for the rule.
"At the end of the day, we need a rule and that may mean some have to hold their noses," he said.
The push for competition follows concerns that a handful of select banks - JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs - control the market for derivatives contracts.
That grip, regulators and advocacy groups say, empowers those banks to overcharge some asset managers and companies that buy derivatives. It also raises concerns about the safety of the banks, some of which nearly toppled in 2008.
"It's important to remember that the Wall Street oligopoly brought us the financial crisis," said Dennis Kelleher, a former Senate aide that now runs Better Markets, an advocacy group critical of Wall Street.
With that history in mind, Congress inserted into Dodd-Frank a provision that forces derivatives trading onto regulated trading platforms. The platforms, known as swap execution facilities, were expected to open a window into the secretive world of derivatives trading. But Congress left it to Mr. Gensler's agency to explain how they would actually work.
There was a time when Mr. Gensler envisioned the strictest rule possible. In 2010, he pushed a plan that could, in essence, make all bids for derivatives contracts public. Facing complaints, the agency instead proposed a plan that would require at least five banks to quote a price for derivatives passing through a swap execution facility.
But even that plan prompted a full-court press from Wall Street lobbyists. Banks and other groups that opposed the plan held more than 80 meetings with agency officials over the last three years, an analysis of meeting records shows. Goldman Sachs attended 19 meetings; the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Wall Street's main lobbying group, was there for 11.
The banks also benefited from some unlikely allies, including large asset managers that buy derivatives contracts. While money managers may seem like natural supporters of Mr. Gensler's plan - and some in fact are - the industry's largest players already receive significant discounts from select banks, providing them an incentive to oppose Mr. Gensler's plan.
The companies cautioned that, because Mr. Gensler's plan would involve a broader universe of banks, it could cause leaks of private trading positions. The plan, the companies said, would not necessarily benefit the asset managers.
"If someone told me I needed to shop five different places for a pair of jeans, I don't see how that would help me," said Gabriel D. Rosenberg, a lawyer at Davis Polk, which represents Sifma and the banks.
The banks and asset managers also warned that many derivatives contracts are traded too infrequently to even generate attention from five banks.
Some regulators dispute that point. They point to the industry's own data, which shows that 85 percent of derivatives trading in a recent 10-day span occurred in four products that are arguably quite liquid. (Each traded more than 500 times.)
As such, according to officials briefed on the matter, Mr. Chilton proposed a plan to require quotes to be submitted to at least five banks for the most liquid contracts. Under his plan, contracts that were less liquid could still be subject to at least two.
Mr. Wetjen, who saw the effort as too complicated, continued to favor the two-bank plan. While the requirement jumps to three banks in about 15 months, the agency might also have to produce a study that could undermine that broader standard.
In an interview, Mr. Wetjen explained that he was seeking to grant more flexibility to the markets. "If flexibility means it's more beneficial to the banks, so be it," he said. "But it also means it's more flexible to all market participants and the marketplace as a whole."
Some consumer advocates have raised broader concerns about Mr. Wetjen, who once advocated a wider than expected exemption to part of a derivatives rule. They also complained that Mr. Wetjen has split with Mr. Gensler on aspects of a plan to apply Dodd-Frank to banks trading overseas. He has, however, voted with Mr. Gensler on every rule, unlike the other commissioners.
Mr. Wetjen also noted that his actions often upset the banks. On only a few issues, he happened to agree with them.
"I'm not driven by who wages the argument," he said. "It's about what policy makes sense."

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths STRICK, LOUIS

 BODY:
STRICK--Louis, died peacefully on May 12th at age 87 following a brief illness. He is survived by his wife of 41 years, Elizabeth, his three children, Ivy, Wesley and Charlotte, a stepson, Simon, seven grandchildren, and two younger brothers, Walter and Stanley. He was raised in Flatbush, the son of Rosalind and Charles Strick. 
Growing up near Ebbets Field, Strick was an ardent fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers. In 1940, he became a member of the first class of Midwood High School. Strick went on to attend Cornell University. His college education was interrupted by World War II, and at age 19 he served as a staff sergeant in occupied Italy. After the war, Strick completed his undergraduate studies and went on to Columbia to pursue a Master's in Economics. He then wrote a weekly column on the stock market for the Journal of Commerce. Next he worked as a financial analyst for the investor Fred Stafford. In the late 1950's he purchased H.M. Storms, a manufacturer of ink ribbons; the National Cash Register Company would become his primary customer. During this period, Strick bought a radio station in St. Louis; WAMV was the first American station to play the hit song "Volare." In the early 1960's Strick co-founded a pioneering quality paperback line, Meridian Books, publishing Philip Roth among others. After selling H.M. Storms, he acquired Artone Ink, whose distinctive bottle featured the letter "a" in the form of an ink drip, an idea of Strick's that was designed by Push Pin Studios and gave rise to a popular typeface. In the late 1960's Strick began importing calligraphic art supplies that he distributed through his Pentalic Corporation. By making special nibs, pens and instruction books widely available, Strick spearheaded a revival of the calligraphic movement in America; he also established the Calligraphy Workshop, a school on lower Fifth Avenue. In the late 1970's Strick purchased the Taplinger Publishing Company, bringing out works of literary fiction and volumes on modern art, reflecting two of his passions. Strick himself was an artist who focused on collage; several of his pieces were exhibited in juried shows in Westport, Connecticut where he lived with Elizabeth for his last 32 years.

HEADLINE: The Migrant Cash Lifeline

BYLINE: By MARIE ARANA. 
Marie Arana, a biographer of Simón Bolívar and a senior adviser to the librarian of Congress, is a guest columnist.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
Every month, Tanita Alfaro, a diminutive night-shift office cleaner in Rockville, Md., puts aside $150 to send to her parents in an impoverished village near the Salvadoran city of San Miguel. Her husband walked 1,700 miles from their war-torn land to the United States-Mexico border 25 years ago and, several years later, she followed.
Ms. Alfaro apportions the money ''right away, payday, before I buy so much as a stick of gum'' -- before she manages the budget that feeds their three young children. For her parents, it is a lifeline. ''Between my brothers and me -- all of us here, working hard -- we keep them alive,'' she told me. ''We pay our parents' rent, food, medicines. Everything.'' 
It's a scenario immigrants know well. Last year, according to the World Bank, migrants sent $401 billion to their families in developing countries. That's eight times the United States' budget for foreign aid, including military and economic assistance. It's roughly equivalent to the gross domestic product of Austria or South Africa. By 2015, the number could rise to $515 billion.
For India or China, which together receive nearly a third of the remittances, the cash flows have a negligible impact on their burgeoning economies.
But for Latin America and the Caribbean, immigrant largess means $62 billion a year the region wouldn't otherwise have, a bulwark against poverty. It suggests, rightly or wrongly, that emigrating -- for all its risks -- might be the best thing the poor can do for their countries.
Remittances account for at least one-fifth of Haiti's economy. In Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala -- the largest sources of undocumented migrants in the United States, apart from Mexico -- officials know that, without that financial windfall, they'd lose as much as 19 percent of their national income. With it, their governments can boost their credit ratings and borrow more. The $23 billion a year that Mexicans send home from the United States may amount to only 2 percent of Mexico's gross domestic product, but it has pulled whole villages out of poverty.
As colossal an economic engine as $401 billion represents, its true impact is probably even larger. What of the funds that are never counted: stealth dollars that bypass the system entirely? Unlike Ms. Alfaro, I don't send remittances through an international bank. The money I've sent for years to support an elderly aunt in my native city of Lima, Peru, is delivered by family members, in dollars. The Peruvian currency I mail to a 15-year-old girl I know in an Andean town near the border with Bolivia is tucked into packages containing shoes, clothes and school supplies. Remarkably, not one package has ever been stolen.
The money sent home from Maryland by Clara Gonzalez, a native of Venezuela, is paid in cash to a friend in Miami whose sister owns a beauty parlor in Caracas. The friend buys wholesale cosmetics in Miami and ships them to Venezuela. Bolivares, in return, appear magically on the doorstep of Ms. Gonzalez's shambling old family house in La Guaira. Economic relief flows in such novel ways.
But there is exploitation, too. Every Friday, lines of immigrants coil out the doors of Western Union, MoneyGram and other transfer services, which often charge exorbitant fees. Last year, the Justice Department reported that, between 2003 and 2009, rogue agents at MoneyGram tricked regular customers, including many migrant workers, into wiring them money, by posing as family members. The scheme robbed them of more than $100 million.
There's also the question of economic volatility. During the 2007-9 downturn, many migrants in the United States -- gardeners, busboys, construction workers, maids -- were the first to be let go. They were barely able to subsist, much less send money home. Ms. Alfaro's husband, then working in a convenience store, was laid off. The family's sudden impoverishment was felt keenly in a little village in El Salvador. Much the same is happening today to Latin Americans in Spain. Which raises the question, are remittances little more than Band-Aids? Or can they help build a foundation for lasting economic development?
The World Bank is bullish, especially in view of immigration reforms being debated in Congress. Over time, the bank says, legalizing 11 million unauthorized workers could have a huge positive economic impact on Latin America.
''It's all about the interconnection between countries,'' says Tamar Jacoby, director of ImmigrationWorks USA, an alliance of businesses that support an immigration overhaul. ''The outside knows us better than we know them. It's so asymmetrical.''
Certainly, the Salvadorans Ms. Alfaro grew up with see us Americans more clearly than we see them. The hemispheric lens is already pointed in both directions, even when we aren't looking.

HEADLINE: A Child of Two Lands

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
WE NEED NEW NAMESBy NoViolet Bulawayo
296 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $25.
''When things fall apart, the children of the land scurry and scatter like birds escaping a burning sky,'' NoViolet Bulawayo writes in her deeply felt and fiercely written debut novel. ''They flee their own wretched land so their hunger may be pacified in foreign lands, their tears wiped away in strange lands, the wounds of their despair bandaged in faraway lands, their blistered prayers muttered in the darkness of queer lands.'' They leave behind their mothers and fathers and ''the bones of their ancestors in the earth'' -- they leave behind ''everything that makes them who and what they are, leaving because it is no longer possible to stay.'' 
The place they are leaving, in this case, is Zimbabwe, that African nation brutalized by more than 30 years of malignity and neglect under the autocratic rule of Robert Mugabe -- a country reeling, as the journalist Peter Godwin noted in his powerful 2011 book ''The Fear'' from unemployment, hunger, inflation, AIDS and the government's torture and violent intimidation of all political opposition. The place many of them are hoping to flee to is the United States -- the destination of the novel's young narrator, Darling, who will begin a new life there with her aunt.
Darling is 10 when we first meet her, and the voice Ms. Bulawayo has fashioned for her is utterly distinctive -- by turns unsparing and lyrical, unsentimental and poetic, spiky and meditative. It is the voice, early on, of a child -- observant, skeptical and hardhearted in the way children can be. She pinches a sick baby she does not want to hold in church so that he will cry and she can hand him back to his mother, and she is coldly standoffish when her long-absent father returns home from South Africa, having become sick with AIDS.
Darling processes the misfortunes of Zimbabwe and its politics through the eyes of a child -- talk of elections and hopes of change are something grown-ups engage in; she and her friends are more concerned with filling their empty stomachs with stolen guavas and inventing games to pass the time. School belongs to the time Before -- before the police came and bulldozed their houses, before they were all forced to move into tin shacks, before their fathers lost their jobs and life changed.
Using her gift for pictorial language, Ms. Bulawayo gives us snapshots of Zimbabwe that have the indelible color and intensity of a folk art painting: ''men huddled like sheep and playing draughts under the lone jacaranda,'' the blooming purple flowers almost make them ''look beautiful in the shade without their shirts on,'' sitting there, ''crouched forward like tigers''; the women doing their best to look pretty, wearing ''a bangle made from rusty, twisted wire,'' a ''flower tucked behind an ear,'' ''earrings made from colorful seeds,'' ''bright patches of cloth sewn onto a skirt.''
There is desperation here, however. As it becomes clear that elections have failed to bring about any kind of change, as men leave home in search of work and families fracture, young and old alike dream of escape -- to America or Europe, or failing that, South Africa, or maybe Dubai or Botswana, someplace where ''at least life is better'' than in this ''terrible place of hunger and things falling apart.''
Thanks to her Aunt Fostalina, who lives in ''Destroyedmichygen'' (Detroit, Michigan), Darling does make it to the United States. At first she is surprised by the astonishing variety and plenitude of food, by the wealth of everyday choices (''Do you prefer this or that? Are you sure? -- as if I have become a real person'') and by the silent mystery of snow: it's like ''we're in the crazy parts of the Bible, there where God is busy punishing people for their sins and is making them miserable with all the weather.''
Once she is a teenager, she quickly adopts the habits of friends from school, even if she doesn't exactly care for them -- listening to Rihanna, trying on armfuls of clothing at the mall (and leaving them in huge messy piles in the dressing room) and watching pornography online. She acquires an American accent, gets A's in school (''because school is so easy in America even a donkey would pass'') but resists her aunt's efforts to goad her into pursuing a career in medicine.
Darling promises her mother that she will come home for a visit soon, even though she knows she won't because she doesn't have the proper paperwork to return to America again. She misses the friends she grew up with, but at the same time feels estranged from them. One of them, Chipo, tells her on a Skype call that she can't refer to Zimbabwe as her country anymore, since she treated it as a burning house and ran away from it instead of trying to put out the flames: ''Darling, my dear, you left the house burning and you have the guts to tell me, in that stupid accent that you were not even born with, that doesn't even suit you, that this is your country?''
Ms. Bulawayo gives us a sense of Darling's new life in staccato takes that show us both her immersion in and her alienation from American culture. We come to understand how stranded she often feels, uprooted from all the traditions and beliefs she grew up with, and at the same time detached from the hectic life of easy gratification in America. We hear her anger at white liberals who speak patronizingly about the troubles of ''Africa,'' lumping together all the countries on that continent as though they were interchangeable parts of one big mess. And we come to understand the bittersweet emotions involved in the choice that many immigrants make to give their children names that will ''make them belong in America.''
At one point, in an effort to make Darling's experiences broadly representative, Ms. Bulawayo writes an entire chapter using the plural pronoun ''we'' -- speaking of the move to America, and the bitterness so many immigrants feel, as they are forced to take menial jobs or find their hopes frustrated:
''When we got to America we took our dreams, looked at them tenderly as if they were newly born children, and put them away; we would not be pursuing them. We would never be the things we had wanted to be: doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers. No school for us, even though our visas were school visas. We knew we did not have the money for school to begin with, but we had applied for school visas because that was the only way out.''
Such generalizations are the one misstep in this otherwise stunning novel. Not only because they try to project one point of view onto the experiences of a wide and varied group of immigrants, but also because they are not always true. For instance, the remarkably talented author of this book, the novel's jacket tells us, was ''born and raised in Zimbabwe,'' and moved to the United States, where she earned an M.F.A. from Cornell and is now a Wallace Stegner Fellow at Stanford -- which sounds very much like a dream achieved.

HEADLINE: Cameron Survives Challenge on Europe Policies, but Vote Is Closer Than Expected

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and ALAN COWELL; Stephen Castle reported from London, and Alan Cowell from Paris.

 BODY:
LONDON -- Prime Minister David Cameron survived a potentially humiliating challenge to his policies toward the European Union on Wednesday by a closer margin in Parliament than had been forecast, illuminating the depth of dissent within his party over an issue that has divided it for decades. 
In a parliamentary ballot, 130 lawmakers, most of them from Mr. Cameron's Conservative Party, voted in favor of a resolution criticizing his handling of a burgeoning crisis over whether Britain should leave the 27-nation European bloc, which is seen as a cornerstone of the world's economic and political architecture. British analysts had forecast that around 80 legislators would support the resolution.
Mr. Cameron has promised an ''in-out'' referendum on British membership in the European Union by 2017 if he wins the next election in 2015. He has also pledged to renegotiate Britain's ties to the body. But many Conservative lawmakers want him to move faster and more decisively, and the ballot measure Wednesday criticized Mr. Cameron for not enshrining his European pledges immediately in law.
Mr. Cameron was not in Parliament for the vote on Wednesday evening because he was winding up a scheduled three-day visit to the United States with a debate on global issues of poverty and development at the United Nations.
Speaking in New York, Mr. Cameron sought to play down the impact of the vote, according to the Press Association news agency. ''I don't think people can read in anything really to the scale of that free vote, not least because only the Conservative Party has a very clear position and a very clear policy about what needs to happen in Europe,'' he said.
The rebellion among Conservative lawmakers nonetheless highlighted the party's vulnerability to decades of corrosive debate about its ties to a European bloc that British skeptics depict as a monstrous superstate devouring British sovereignty.
Even though Conservatives know how internal fights over Europe damaged their governments in the 1990s, the issue refuses to go away, leaving Mr. Cameron trapped between those in his party who want to move quickly to leave the union and his junior coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats, who want Britain to stay in.
The rebels' vote was largely symbolic. Though they will now try to promote a bill for a referendum, it will have almost no chance of passing Parliament without the official support of the government.
The debate has enabled opposition politicians to argue that Mr. Cameron has lost control of his party over the issue, just as the last Conservative prime minister, John Major, did in the 1990s. They argue that Conservative critics of the European Union are determined to quit the bloc and therefore will not be satisfied by any concessions short of an exit.
But Mr. Cameron rejected the charge.
''When the dust settles on this, what people will see is one party, the Conservative Party, offering this very clear, very compelling choice in the national interest, reforming the E.U., changing Britain's relationship with it and giving people the chance of an in-out referendum,'' he said.

HEADLINE: On the Plus Side ...

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Let's try to come up with some positive thoughts about the recent political fortunes of the Obama White House:
Economy's getting a little better. Deficit's dropping.
Bill Clinton had a really terrible second term and look how well things turned out for him.
Nobody in the administration has been caught driving to Canada with Bo the dog strapped to the car roof. 
It's been quite a week, what with the I.R.S. scandal, the Benghazi controversy and revelations about the Justice Department's sweep of The Associated Press's phone records. Plus, the Russians came up with an alleged American spy in a bad wig who they said was caught carrying a compass, an atlas of Moscow and a ridiculous traitor-recruitment letter. That one could be a set-up, but if it's real, then we are just going to have to cancel the summer.
Republicans were leaping joyfully through the capital like overcaffeinated gazelles. There is not a committee chairman in the House of Representatives who isn't planning hearings of outrage about something -- except maybe the poor woman John Boehner appointed to run the committee in charge of housekeeping.
Heads must roll! Senator James Inhofe announced that ''people may be starting to use the i-word before too long,'' having apparently missed all the prior calls for the president's impeachment for everything from failure to balance the budget to gun control.
Senator Marco Rubio demanded ''the I.R.S. commissioner's resignation,'' possibly unaware that the nation had not had an I.R.S. commissioner since last November. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid expressed doubt that the nation would be satisfied just with the head of ''some temporary guy'' and called for a permanent appointment. This was presumably due to Reid's desire for stability, not just a more rewarding target.
The acting commissioner did, indeed, get the ax on Wednesday, but the chances that the Senate is going to approve a new Internal Revenue Service commissioner are approximately as good as the odds it will include zombies under Social Security. Reid is still struggling with the nominations for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Environmental Protection Agency, which have been held up by the Republicans on the grounds that they don't really like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Environmental Protection Agency. The Labor Department appears likely to get a new leader the very second hell freezes over. Also, Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri has vowed to put a hold on E.P.A. nominee Gina McCarthy until he gets a new flood-way project.
Serious problem for Washington: How do you get heads to roll when there aren't any heads? Except for Attorney General Eric Holder, who's been running the Justice Department for what seems like 100 years, and appears linked to just about every disaster in the history of the Obama administration. I believe we may soon discover that he was the one who provided the would-be spy in Russia with a brown wig that looks like an obese cat.
People, this too shall pass. We're in a moment, not a map for the entire Obama second term. It is, of course, possible that things will get worse, and we'll discover the president's health care plan is, as Michele Bachmann claims, part of a plot to deny medical treatment to conservatives. Or things could get better. The White House seems to be getting some traction on the I.R.S. Maybe the economy will really improve, the scandals will run their course, and people will turn their attention to worthy causes like early childhood education or stopping climate change.
Admittedly, the last scenario is a long shot. And even if Barack Obama ascended into heaven, the Republicans would point out that before he went, the I.R.S. picked on the Tea Party.
Maybe, while he's crisis-managing, the president could also figure out a way to show people government working at something other than reorganizing troubled agencies. Maybe he could start off with passing a bill that's supereasy. I notice that in state legislatures, when times are tough, parties are sometimes able to get together in order to pick a new state thing. You know, state bird, state animal. Some states find this so relaxing they never stop. (New Mexico has an official state guitar, state tie and state aircraft, which, unfortunately, is the hot-air balloon.)
The United States has a few of these items, like a bird and an anthem, but there's plenty of territory to cover. The president could demand that Congress pick an official national rock. Committees could hold hearings about the relative merits of slate and granite. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell would threaten to filibuster unless his colleagues considered coal. But, in the end, I believe everybody would rally around a grand compromise for marble. And the country would feel much, much better.
Baby steps. Then we can get to the debt ceiling.

HEADLINE: Arctic Council Adds 6 Nations as Observer States, Including China

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
KIRUNA, Sweden -- The Arctic Council agreed on Wednesday to expand to include six new nations, including China, as observer states, as a changing climate opens the Arctic to increasing economic and political competition.
The inclusion of observer states to the council came after a spirited debate at its biennial meeting and reflected the growing prominence of the issues facing the region. The council is made up of the eight Arctic nations: Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States.
With the Arctic ice melting, the region's abundant supplies of oil, gas and minerals have become newly accessible, as have shortened shipping routes and open water for commercial fishing, setting off a global competition for influence and economic opportunities far beyond the nations that border the Arctic. 
''There is nothing that should unite quite like our concerns for both the promises and the challenges of the northernmost reaches of the earth,'' Secretary of State John Kerry, who brokered a compromise over the observer nations, said on Wednesday at the council's final session. He added, ''The consequences of our nations' decision don't stop at the 66th parallel.''
In addition to China, the other nations granted observer status to the Arctic Council were India, Italy, Japan, Singapore and South Korea.
All have sought economic opportunities in the region and viewed participation in the Arctic Council as a means of influencing the decisions of its permanent members. The European Union also applied as an observer, but its final status remained unresolved pending resolution of a dispute with Canada over trade in seal products.
Sweden's foreign minister, Carl Bildt, said the addition of the observers strengthened the council by recognizing the pre-eminence of the permanent nations' sovereignty in the Arctic.
''I would say it demonstrates the broad international acceptance of the role of the Arctic Council, because by being observer, these organizations and states, they accept the principles and the sovereignty of the Arctic Council on Arctic issues,'' he said when asked if adding participants threatened to dilute the council's effectiveness. ''As a matter of fact, it strengthens the position of the Arctic Council on the global scene.''
The council, created in 1996, has matured from a largely symbolic organization to one addressing the quickening pace and consequences of climate change in the Arctic, prompting what has already been called a new ''Great Game.'' Meeting here above the Arctic Circle in Sweden, the council adopted only its second legally binding agreement: one to prepare and coordinate a response to potential spills that could result from increasing oil and gas exploration.
Two years ago, in Greenland, the council adopted a similar agreement to coordinate search and rescue operations over 13 million square miles of ocean.
The ballooning interest has raised concerns of reckless development that could harm what is a fragile environment, as several scientific studies presented to the council made clear. Outside the municipal building here in Kiruna, where ministers from the council met, protesters called for restrictions on economic development. ''No Arctic Oil, Please,'' one banner said.
The council's final declaration, though, recognized ''the central role of business in the development of the Arctic,'' though it called for development to be conducted in ways that would sustain indigenous peoples and the environment.
The Northern Sea Route, once largely a wish, has become increasingly viable during longer stretches of the summer, allowing ships traveling from Asia to Europe to traverse the Arctic in far less time than they would on the traditional route through the Indian Ocean, the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean.
In 2010, only four ships carrying 111,000 tons of cargo made the northern passage; by last year, 46 did, carrying 1.26 million tons. Among those was China's first ship through the Arctic, an icebreaker called Xuelong, or Snow Dragon.
The United States had not previously taken a public position on the question of observer states at the Arctic Council, but after Mr. Kerry brokered a compromise during a debate over dinner on Tuesday night that became spirited, it joined the others in expanding the council's future participants.
The Arctic Council plans to hold its next meeting in 2015 in Canada.

HEADLINE: Wholesale Prices Fall Again, While Inflation Stays Low

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sharp drops in fuel and food costs reduced a measure of wholesale prices in April by the most in three years. Outside those volatile categories, inflation stayed tame. 
The producer price index, which measures price changes before they reach the consumer, fell a seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent in April from March, the Labor Department said Wednesday. It was the second straight monthly decline and the steepest since February 2010.
Lower inflation means the Federal Reserve has more leeway to continue its aggressive policies to bolster economic growth. If there were signs that inflation was picking up, the Fed might be forced to raise interest rates.
The index declined largely because gas prices dropped 6 percent, and the price of home heating oil fell by the most in almost four years.
Food prices also fell 0.8 percent, the most since May 2011. Half of the decline was because of lower vegetable prices, a highly volatile category. Meat prices dropped 2.3 percent.
Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices ticked up 0.1 percent in April, from March. Pharmaceutical costs also rose 0.1 percent.
Prices for cars and pickup trucks, men's clothing, tires and computers all declined.
Over all, wholesale prices have increased just 0.6 percent over the last 12 months. That is the smallest yearly gain since July and down from a 1.7 percent pace just two months ago.
Core prices have risen only 1.7 percent in the last 12 months and are just below the Fed's 2 percent inflation target.
Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, said wholesale prices may fall further as declining prices for many commodities work their way through the supply chain. Slowing manufacturing output could also weigh on prices.

HEADLINE: After Bangladesh, Seeking New Sources

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
SEMARANG, Indonesia -- Bennett Model helped pioneer the exporting of garments from China in 1975, the year before Mao Zedong died, and ever since, his New York fashion company has searched for other countries, from Guatemala to Vietnam to Indonesia, capable of supplying top retailers like Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus.
The relentless search for new locations has taken on more urgency after the deadliest industrial accident in the global garment industry's history, a multistory factory collapse in Bangladesh that left 1,127 people dead. Buying from Bangladesh, said Mr. Model, ''has been politically incorrect ever since problems started there, so a lot of major players had already been looking for alternatives.''
When a senior executive from one of the largest American mass-market retailers called him last week with worries about suppliers in Bangladesh and plans for a trip to Vietnam and Cambodia to seek alternatives, Mr. Model was ready with advice: ''I told him to add a stop in Indonesia.'' 
Many Western executives are taking such trips this spring. A lethal factory fire in Bangladesh last November, 33 regional or national strikes there since January, hundreds of deaths in factional street fighting there since February, and the Rana Plaza collapse in late April have left multinational corporations scrambling for other options.
''Right now, the name of Bangladesh just gives a bad rep to a company,'' said Mr. Model, the dapper chief executive of Joseph Model Associates, which designs and distributes the Annabelle New York brand of high-end apparel and also makes private-label brands for various department store chains.
Western executives are checking on potential new suppliers in southern Vietnam, central Cambodia and the hinterlands of Java in Indonesia. Yet safety problems could exist anywhere. The ceiling of a small factory that makes shoes in central Cambodia collapsed on Thursday morning, killing at least two people and injuring nine, three of them severely.
The JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, a favorite of Western garment buyers, is nonetheless so full these days that it is hard to book a room on short notice. Indonesian garment executives say they have seen a steady procession of arrivals in recent weeks and months, always asking the same questions about political stability, labor laws, safety compliance and wages.
''At first it was because of China getting too expensive, then came the Bangladesh fire tragedy, and then there have been so many steps in Bangladesh's troubles,'' said Ade Sudradjat, the chairman of the Indonesian Textile Association. ''Some buyers feel uncomfortable placing orders in Bangladesh.''
Many multinationals are exploring their options in case street clashes and politically motivated national strikes worsen in Bangladesh, which is the world's second-largest garment manufacturer after China. A new faction in the country's Islamist movement has staged more violent protests lately that have sometimes resulted in the temporary closure of factories.
Garment manufacturing makes up a fifth of the economy in Bangladesh and four-fifths of its exports, which means that one of the world's poorest, most densely populated countries is desperately dependent on continued export orders to stave off soaring unemployment and possibly further political unrest. Some executives say that many multinationals will continue buying from Bangladesh, although some may diversify their orders to more countries.
''People are on the one hand looking at contingency plans in case the unrest gets worse,'' said Bruce Rockowitz, the group president and chief executive of Hong Kong-based Li & Fung, one of the world's largest sourcing companies. ''There are some people who want to move completely away from Bangladesh, but there are only a few of them.''
Tessel Pauli, a spokeswoman for the Clean Clothes Campaign, dismissed retailers' worries about civil unrest as a disingenuous excuse to avoid improving safety standards there. ''Political turmoil has been existing in Bangladesh over the last decade,'' she said, while adding, ''Of course, they should make it clear to the government that bloodily suppressing street demonstrations should stop immediately.''
Dozens of impoverished countries make T-shirts and other very basic clothing. But only a few countries -- really just China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia and to some extent Cambodia and Pakistan -- have developed highly complex systems for producing and shipping tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of identical, high-quality shirts, blouses or trousers to a global retailer within several weeks of receiving an order.
The clothing needs to be labeled correctly so that it travels smoothly through a large retailer's distribution centers and arrives on schedule at each store around the world. The process requires formidable numbers of skilled workers who can oversee quality control as well as labeling and shipping of garments. Big retailers and fashion companies have repeatedly tried and failed to develop alternatives, experimenting in India, Africa and Latin America, only to run into infrastructure bottlenecks and shortages of skilled managers or workers.
Mr. Rockowitz said that all of the potential successors to Bangladesh for very large-scale garment exports were in Asia. Mr. Model said that India was not organized for large-scale, timely production, Africa did not have enough workers with the right skills for high-volume labeling and shipping, and Latin America did not have enough workers interested in operating sewing machines.
Two years ago, Mr. Model spoke enthusiastically about a factory that he had found in Guatemala, which he saw then as an alternative to China and Southeast Asia that was much closer to the United States, which could shorten delivery times.
But Mr. Model said in a telephone interview several days ago that he recently stopped buying from the factory in Guatemala and switched his orders to two factories in Vietnam instead; he also relies on production here in Semarang for knit dresses. In Guatemala, the quality was excellent, he said, but, ''They can't handle big orders and they're slow on delivery.''
By contrast, Mr. Model said that he had always refused to place orders in Bangladesh for his customers. He said that he and a couple of other suppliers of elite retail chains always worried about Bangladesh's reliance on high-rise factories, in which workers can be trapped on upper floors during a fire, instead of the single-story and two-story designs found in Southeast Asia.
Indonesia, for example, has had an industry code since the early 1990s that garment factories may not be more than two stories high so evacuation will be easier during fires, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Union leaders here say that only a few Indonesian garment factories are taller, because they predate the rule. Even factories with a second floor in Indonesia must make sure that the second floor is open to the first floor with a long balcony or courtyard for easy escape; although there are other labor abuses in Indonesia, local union leaders said that the rule was scrupulously followed.
Rubana Huq, the managing director of the Mohammadi Group, one of the largest garment makers in Bangladesh, said that the prevalence of high-rise factories in Bangladesh reflected the country's unusually high real estate prices combined with the difficulty of persuading utilities to install electricity and gas connections to larger sites.
What may save Bangladesh from a sharp, immediate drop in export orders is simply that most Southeast Asian factories are already fully booked with orders from multinationals fleeing China's ever-rising costs. ''For this year, it's impossible -- we're already full,'' said Suryadi Sasmita, the president of the Indonesian subsidiary of Wacoal, a big Japanese garment manufacturer.
''There are definitely customers who are looking for more capacity than we can offer them, because they want to move orders out of Bangladesh and out of China,'' said Sanjay Kumar Goyal, the chief financial officer of the Busana Apparel Group, a big Jakarta-based manufacturer.
Mr. Rockowitz estimated that even if political violence escalated sharply in Bangladesh, only 10 to 20 percent of its output, or $2 billion to $4 billion a year worth of goods, could be shifted in the next nine months or so to other countries.
Indonesia's national training center for seamstresses -- women make up 98 percent of the students -- is here in Semarang, producing 12,000 graduates a year. But even that isn't enough. Four factories with a combined employment of 30,000 are to open in the next year in Semarang, and many more factories are being built nearby.
Asked how these factories would find workers, Sumidi, the school's director, shook his head and said he hoped to send instructors to factories to train workers on sewing machines there. (Like many Javanese, he uses only one name.)
Newly opened factories have started competing for scarce seamstresses by offering free meals and free health insurance, said Nurdin Makruf, the vice general secretary of the Semarang chapter of the national union that mainly represents garment workers. Construction companies here are struggling to find enough workers to build all the garment factories now being carved out of the forests of coconut palms, banana trees and conifers that carpet central Java.
Mr. Model predicted that Bangladesh's lock on mass retailers' orders would erode.
''It's going to take time, but it's going to eventually filter out all over the place,'' he said. ''It'll take two or three years.''

HEADLINE: House Hunting in ... Argentina

BYLINE: By NINA ROBERTS

 BODY:
A THREE-BEDROOM HOUSE WITH A POOL OUTSIDE BUENOS AIRES
$1.35 MILLION (7,038,225 ARGENTINE PESOS)
This rectangular building, known as Molecule House for the system of interlocking aluminum rods and connectors that makes up its foundation, has 3,229 square feet of space over two floors. Its signature modular geometric structures also act as a decorative feature throughout the house -- in ceilings, along windows, even as table legs and balusters. It is being sold furnished.
The central living room has a double-height ceiling and two glass-paneled walls; like most of the house the floor is in a reclaimed wood called Incienso, with a heating system underneath. It is flanked on one side by the dining room, on the other by the kitchen, which has two freestanding counters topped with thick slabs of reclaimed pine. Appliances, among them an Ariston oven and stove, are stainless steel. 
Upstairs, the master suite has an air-conditioned bedroom, a white-tiled bath with a skylight and a walk-in closet. On the other side of the house, at the far end of an open walkway, are two bedrooms and a shared bath.
The property of almost 11,000 square feet is landscaped with palm and silk floss trees, flowering shrubs and a collection of cacti. A wooden deck leads back to the pool; a small geodesic dome provides a sculptural element.
Molecule House is in La Celina, a gated community of 70 homes on large lots. Polo fields are within 15 minutes' drive; Buenos Aires is about 45 minutes away.
MARKET OVERVIEW
The market in Buenos Aires, which traditionally uses American dollars, is stagnant, in part because the government recently restricted real estate transactions in foreign currencies. Wary of the Argentine peso with its history of high inflation and depreciation, many sellers are holding back.
Emiliano Pagnotta, an Argentine economist who teaches at New York University, described the market as ''essentially collapsing.''
''The number of sales in the main market, Buenos Aires, are down 40 to 50 percent compared to the previous year, which was not a great year to start with,'' he said.
But according to Martin Bricca, a managing partner of Buenos Aires Habitat, it's a good time to buy. Those who are selling, he said, are not averse to negotiation. ''Three years ago, if you offered 30 percent less than the asking price, the owners would say no,'' he said. Sellers today often accept offers 15 to 20 percent under asking price.
WHO BUYS IN THE BUENOS AIRES AREA
Most foreign buyers in the Buenos Aires area are from North America and Western Europe, typically Britain, Italy and France.
BUYING BASICS
There are no restrictions on foreign buyers, but financing must be obtained at home, as Argentine banks generally don't provide mortgages. Elias Kier Joffe, the managing partner of the Buenos Aires law firm Kier Joffe, described real estate transactions as straightforward, explaining that Argentines typically rely on notaries public and don't hire lawyers.
But given the recent restrictions on foreign currency, Mr. Joffe strongly suggested that foreign buyers hire a lawyer, even before contacting an agent for a property search. The lawyer, notary and closing costs together make up about 3 percent of the sale price, he said.
Foreign buyers usually wire their payments into the bank accounts that many sellers maintain abroad. The payment method must be stated in the purchase agreement and the account declared to Argentina's Federal Administration of Public Revenue.

LANGUAGES AND CURRENCY

TAXES AND FEES
The broker fee is 4 percent of the sale price; additionally, a transfer tax of 3.6 percent is typically split between buyer and seller. Property tax is $1,200 a year, maintenance $400 a month.

HEADLINE: Standing at the Center of China's War of Words

BYLINE: By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW

 BODY:
BEIJING -- ''They call me at home and leave abusive messages,'' said Mao Yushi, a prominent advocate of economic and political freedoms who inspires a passionate following among many Chinese, at a private event in Beijing this week.
''They'' are hard-core Maoists who have recently renewed their attacks on Mr. Mao, a magnet for their dissatisfaction, with small but aggressive demonstrations around the country, most recently in Changsha, in the central province of Hunan, in early May. ''When a traitor crosses the street, shout and beat!'' they chanted, holding up banners declaring the 2012 recipient of the Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty a ''Chinese traitor'' who had ''sold out to America.'' 
We had come to hear Mr. Mao talk about his new book, ''Where Does Chinese People's Anxiety Come From?'' But the conversation moved to how the 84-year-old engineer-turned-economist, first branded a political ''rightist'' by the Communist Party in the 1950s, was coping.
''Of course, we're being harassed at home, so my wife cannot sleep peacefully, and I've also been affected,'' said Mr. Mao.
''But I feel that is a small issue,'' he said. ''What's a truly big issue is how we as a society should view this bifurcation of opinion, how we can resolve this difference of positions.''
The differences speak of a society increasingly fractured into rich and poor, pro-state and pro-individual, a skewed left and right -- all the issues that Mr. Mao addressed at the gathering, kept deliberately small to maintain security.
There was only one way, he said. The Maoist legacy of identifying and destroying political enemies, the continued lying about history, had infected people's minds and language. China must undergo major cultural change to learn tolerance, to handle differences of opinion, to address growing challenges, including international ones, with calm and reason.
It was probably not lost on the audience, which included academics, lawyers and students, that last week, Guangming Daily, a Communist Party newspaper, reported that President Xi Jinping had apparently ruled out rejecting Mao's legacy, citing the risk that China could descend into chaos.
Mr. Mao has long been a figurehead for the pro-freedom, pro-market movement in China. In 2011, he wrote an essay criticizing Mao (the two men are not related), titled ''Returning Mao Zedong to Human Form.'' For many of Mao's supporters it crossed a line, provoking vicious verbal attacks.
The recent attacks have been more of the same, he said, describing them with his customary equanimity.
''They go to my house and to Tianze,'' the Chinese name of the Unirule Institute of Economics, of which he is a founder and the honorary president, he said. ''They harass me on the telephone and at home. They made up rumors that I took 50 million renminbi,'' the equivalent of about $8 million, ''from America and ran to them for asylum,'' he said.
''The rumors are just completely ridiculous,'' he said. ''They lack any common sense. Rumors, harassment, phone calls, visits, demonstrations. Yet I have never once cursed them.''
He recounted a recent visit to his home by a reporter from Global Times, a party-run newspaper, who asked him to produce evidence of the harassment, apparently not entirely believing it. Mr. Mao played him a recording of words that cannot be printed here. The reporter's skepticism disturbed him, he said. ''I feel that officialdom should have a fair standpoint.''
As for his attackers, he said, ''I tell them, 'Why do you do it?' That's how I treat them. I tell them, 'Don't make up rumors.' Things like that.''
His response is in keeping with his political philosophy. ''In a society with free speech, they all have the right to speak,'' he said. ''They support Mao Zedong. I don't support him.''
''We need to look for common ground. Is there common ground? I think so. Our goal is the same, we all want China to do well. They think that Mao Zedong is good for China. I think freedom will be good for China,'' he said.
''But we have to use logic, truth, to get the right answers. The Maoists use their methods, which include a lack of logic, putting labels on people. We need tolerance and calm.''
Then it was back to the main point of the event -- his book.
Yes, Chinese people are deeply anxious about the future, despite growing prosperity -- a puzzle, he said, asking, ''Why are we still so dissatisfied?''
He offered a concise answer. ''The government isn't reasonable,'' using a very Chinese phrase: ''bu jiang daoli.'' The legacy of authoritarianism sits too deep. The protests in Changsha and other cities, the harassing telephone calls, seemed to demonstrate that.
''What happened in Changsha is a danger to our country. Using Mao Zedong methods, without law or heaven, lacking any rules,'' he said. ''This is our poison. If everyone behaves like that, how can society improve?''
Positioned uncomfortably in the center of a war, so far only of words, Mr. Mao's lack of angry rhetoric is a trademark of the man.
Repeatedly, he used a Chinese idiom to express his hopes for the future: ''Wen liang gong jian rang'' -- ''kindness and moderation'' -- qualities he said were missing in social and political discourse. Echoed by other speakers, they became a catchphrase of the morning, words that lingered.

HEADLINE: Nikkei Index Breaks 15,000 for First Time Since 2007

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index, which has been on a tear for months amid optimism over government efforts to breathe life into Japan's listless economy, rose another 2.3 percent on Wednesday and closed above 15,000 points for the first time in five and a half years. 
Japanese stocks have soared since November, when Shinzo Abe, who took over as prime minister in December, vowed to pursue aggressive steps to combat persistent deflation and lift the economy out of years of feeble growth.
Adding to the momentum on Wednesday was a 10.6 percent surge in the shares of Sony; the company on Tuesday came under pressure from the investor and billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel S. Loeb to spin off part of its entertainment arm.
Mr. Loeb argued that the move would allow to sharpen its focus and lead to higher profit margins, while helping revive the core electronics business.
Sony shares, which have rallied strongly this year, in part because a weaker yen has improved its earnings prospects, were worth ¥2,072, or $20.28, apiece by the close of trading in Tokyo on Wednesday, more than twice where they began the year. That is the highest since July 2011.
The yen's fall on the currencies markets -- the Japanese currency has dropped about 17 percent against the U.S. dollar so far this year -- has been a major boon to Japanese exporters, whose goods and services have become cheaper for customers abroad as a result.
Numerous companies have in recent weeks cited the weaker yen as a reason for improved earnings, helping to lift the overall stock market.
Since the start of the year, the Nikkei 225 has risen more than 40 percent, and on Wednesday the index closed at 15,096 points.
The yen was trading at 102.37 to the dollar, compared with ¥86.67 per dollar at the start of the year.
Meanwhile, gross domestic product data for the first three months of 2013, due out Thursday, also are likely to illustrate Japan's improved prospects.
The figures are expected to show that the Japanese economy grew 0.7 percent from the previous quarter, according to analysts polled by Reuters.
Mr. Abe ''wasted no time launching the first two 'arrows' of his three-pronged economic agenda, delivering bold fiscal and monetary stimulus that has weakened the JPY and lifted equities to five year highs,'' Izumi Devalier, Japan economist at HSBC, wrote in a research note on Wednesday, referring to the Japanese currency.
But Ms. Devalier also struck a note of skepticism, saying the long-term success of what has been dubbed ''Abenomics'' hinged on ''the third and most important arrow -- structural reforms.''
''Deep reforms,'' she wrote, ''are in danger of being shelved due to push back from bureaucrats, unions, and even pockets of Abe's own party.''

HEADLINE: In Sign of Investor Confidence, Markets Stay Strong

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Wednesday, with the Dow and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rising to new highs in a broad market rally.
The Nasdaq also reached its highest point since November 2000, though gains were limited by a steep decline in Apple. Shares of the technology giant sold off in late afternoon trading after filings from hedge funds showed that the one-time Wall Street darling had been dropped by more hedge fund managers in the first quarter.
But shares of Apple's rival, Google, rose to a record high at $916.38 on news that it had adopted a business model for streaming music. 
The day's gains were broad, with nine of the S.& P. 500's 10 sectors ending higher. Among the top gainers were the consumer staples sector index, up 1 percent, and the financial sector, also up 1 percent. The only decliner was the energy sector index, down 0.4 percent.
The overall market showed further signs of strength as the S.& P. 500-stock index reached a high for the fourth session in a row. The broad index has recorded 15 nominal closing highs this year.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 60.44 points, or 0.40 percent, to 15,275.69 at the close on Wednesday. The S.& P. 500-stock index added 8.44 points, or 0.51 percent, to finish at 1,658.78. The Nasdaq composite index gained 9.01 points, or 0.26 percent, to close at 3,471.62.
During trading, the Dow touched a record intraday high at 15,301.34, while the S.& P. 500 reached a record intraday peak at 1,661.49. Earlier, the Nasdaq reached a 52-week high at 3,475.48.
In the latest assessments of the economy, activity in New York state's manufacturing sector unexpectedly contracted in May. Another report showed that industrial production in the United States fell more than expected in April.
''It's disconcerting that the data was so much lower than what we were looking for, but there's no reason for investors to sell,'' said Michael Binger, senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments in Minneapolis.
''The main things driving the market -- the Fed, earnings, consumer confidence -- are holding up, and people put money in the market on any down day. I still see a lot of value,'' he said.
In signs that the rally may strengthen from current levels, the Credit Suisse Fear Barometer, known as the CSFB Index, fell 11.4 points over the last two weeks -- the largest decline on record -- and was now at a one-year low of 21.73.
''A low CSFB reading is a constructive signal for the market,'' a Credit Suisse equity derivatives strategist, Mandy Xu, wrote in a note to clients.
Among Wednesday's top gainers was Agilent Tech, up 3.9 percent to $45.68, a day after the company posted adjusted earnings that beat expectations and doubled its stock buyback program to $1 billion.
Tech shares got a lift from Netflix, up 4 percent at $243.40, and from Yahoo, up 2.6 percent at $27.34. In contrast, the Computer Sciences Corporation was the S.& P. 500's biggest loser, dropping 9.7 percent to $44.71 after reporting results.
Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 5.1 percent to $44.34 in anticipation of favorable data from clinical trials of its melanoma drug.
In other data released on Wednesday, the producer price index recorded its largest drop in three years in April, falling a seasonally adjusted 0.7 percent.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 12/32 to 98 9/32, dropping the yield to 1.94 from 1.98 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: An Onset of Woes Raises Questions on Obama Vision

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Thwarted on Capitol Hill, stymied in the Middle East and now beset by scandal, President Obama has reached a point just six months after a heady re-election where the second term he had hoped for has collided with the second term he actually has.
Mr. Obama emerged from a heated campaign last November with renewed confidence that he could shape the next four years with a vision of activist government as a force for good in American society. But the controversies of recent days have reinforced fears of an overreaching government while calling into question Mr. Obama's ability to master his own presidency.
The challenges underscore a paradox about the 44th president. He presides over a government that to critics appears ever more intrusive, dictating health care choices, playing politics with the Internal Revenue Service and snooping into journalists' phone records. Yet at times, Mr. Obama comes across as something of a bystander occupying the most powerful office in the world, buffeted by partisanship and forces beyond his control.
On Wednesday, announcing the departure of the acting director of the I.R.S., he portrayed himself as an onlooker to the scandal, albeit one with the power to force changes. ''Americans have a right to be angry about it, and I'm angry about it,'' he said. 
He likewise had nothing to do with the Justice Department seizure of phone records of reporters for The Associated Press, aides say. The Benghazi dispute, he complains, is brazen politics, and the White House released e-mails Wednesday meant to show that the president's close aides had little involvement in its most hotly debated aspect. He has no way to force Congress to pass even a modest gun-control bill, aides say, while the slaughter in Syria defies American capacity to intervene.
All of which raises the question of how a president with grand ambitions and shrinking horizons can use his office. Mr. Obama may be right about some of the things he cannot do, but he has also struggled lately to present a vision of what he can do.
On Wednesday, the administration appeared to take a newly aggressive tack on three current imbroglios, pushing out the head of the I.R.S., releasing the Benghazi e-mails and announcing that it would revive legislation to protect journalists from legal jeopardy. The president also said he would hold a news conference Thursday.
The most obvious larger area for progress is immigration, where Republicans appear to want to reach a deal to improve their standing with Latino voters. Aides hold out hope for reaching a budget deal, resuscitating gun control and using executive authority to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. And Mr. Obama can shape policy by putting his health care program into effect, nominating federal judges and a Federal Reserve chairman, and withdrawing more troops from Afghanistan.
''I still think we have a chance to do some significant things,'' said David Plouffe, his longtime adviser. ''If we get immigration and something on economy and deficits, that would be a pretty banner year, given a divided Congress.''
He rejected the suggestion that Mr. Obama, who forced Republicans to accept higher taxes on the wealthy after re-election, has been too passive. ''The notion that there's some sort of easy leadership play that he hasn't called yet that would unlock gridlock, that's not a very sophisticated analysis,'' Mr. Plouffe said.
Second terms have long vexed presidents, whether it was the Iran-contra affair for Ronald Reagan or impeachment for Bill Clinton. Much as Mr. Obama failed to win his first big post-inaugural priority in gun control, President George W. Bush saw his effort to revamp Social Security in his fifth year go nowhere. With violence spiraling in Iraq, Mr. Bush found it hard to regain traction.
Yet presidents have made breakthroughs in their second term amid Congressional investigations. Reagan signed a nuclear-arms treaty with the dying Soviet Union, and Mr. Clinton balanced the budget. Mr. Bush defied broad opposition to a troop surge in Iraq, fueling a turnaround there.
For Mr. Obama, the sharp drop in the projected deficit, announced Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office, served as a reminder that if he finishes his term with a healthier economy, it may matter more to his legacy than this week's setbacks.
Still, the latest furors could harden an impression of an Obama presidency that has expanded the reach of government further than many Americans would like. And they can undermine a powerful tool of the presidency, the ability to focus public attention.
Mr. Obama recognized the dynamic while a senator, telling aides that a president could drive just 15 to 20 percent of the public agenda; the rest of the time, he had to react. In that light, aides say, Mr. Obama maintains his famed equanimity and, free of campaign pressures, takes a longer view.
''Being in office for nearly four and a half years gives the president some perspective -- it helps separate the signal from the noise,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, a White House senior adviser. ''When you have dealt with real life-and-death problems, the political ones seem much smaller and affect you less.''
Yet Mr. Obama also expresses exasperation. In private, he has talked longingly of ''going Bulworth,'' a reference to a little-remembered 1998 Warren Beatty movie about a senator who risked it all to say what he really thought. While Mr. Beatty's character had neither the power nor the platform of a president, the metaphor highlights Mr. Obama's desire to be liberated from what he sees as the hindrances on him.
''Probably every president says that from time to time,'' said David Axelrod, another longtime adviser who has heard Mr. Obama's movie-inspired aspiration. ''It's probably cathartic just to say it. But the reality is that while you want to be truthful, you want to be straightforward, you also want to be practical about whatever you're saying.''
The cinematic allusion seems striking given Mr. Obama's rejection of Hollywood's version of the White House, what one former aide calls ''the Harry Potter theory of the presidency,'' which suggests that he could wave a wand and make things happen. At the White House Correspondents Association dinner last month, he bristled at the idea that he should be pattern himself after Michael Douglas's assertive character in ''The American President.''
Turning to Mr. Douglas, who was in the audience, he jokingly asked what his secret was. ''Could it be that you were an actor in an Aaron Sorkin liberal fantasy?'' Mr. Obama asked. He added later, ''I get frustrated sometimes.''
Mr. Obama was more scornful a few days later when a reporter skeptically asked about his prospects for further legislation. ''As Mark Twain said, rumors of my demise may be a little exaggerated at this point,'' he said.
This week, as Mr. Obama confronted a scandal frenzy unlike any he has faced, he let his guard down during fund-raisers in New York. ''My thinking was after we beat them in 2012, well, that might break the fever,'' he told donors. ''And it's not quite broken yet.''
He sounded almost plaintive in wishing he had more ability to advance his agenda. ''I sure want to do some governing,'' he told another set of contributors. ''I want to get some stuff done. I don't have a lot of time.''
Still, as he was traveling on Marine One on Monday, Mr. Obama took note of news reports describing last Friday as a terrible day. ''You know what was actually a terrible day?'' an aide recalled him saying. ''The day Benghazi actually happened.''

HEADLINE: More Companies Adopt Online Recruiting Tools To Find Top Candidates

BYLINE: By MARK COHEN

 BODY:
It can seem improbable given the still-sluggish monthly unemployment reports, but in some sectors small businesses are desperate to find qualified candidates to fill jobs.
Opower, a 354-person software company that helps utility customers save on energy bills, is one of those businesses. In competition for engineering talent with technology companies small and large, Opower recently had 71 openings advertised on LinkedIn and the job-listings site Indeed. The company, based in Arlington, Va., plans to add 150 employees by the end of the year. ''I just found out today I have another five to fill,'' Jennifer Boulanger, Opower's head recruiter, said recently. ''I was, like, oh gosh. It's never ending.''
That Ms. Boulanger and her nine-person recruiting staff are able to keep up at all is a testament to their use of today's online hiring technologies. Stored inside the company's LinkedIn account are folders for various technology companies, each containing links to the profiles of potential candidates that the team is planning to approach through LinkedIn's internal ''InMail'' system. 
Each week, Ms. Boulanger hosts Talent Tuesday, in which Opower employees bring their laptops and, fueled by free pizza and blaring iTunes, comb through their personal LinkedIn networks for friends and former colleagues matching Opower openings. If a referral ends up being hired, the referring employee receives $1,000. Of the 165 jobs the company listed last year, only one was filled using an outside recruiting firm -- and that was an executive level search.
Companies that are just now getting in the market for talent are also using the new technologies. Steven Uster is chief executive of Eldridge Capital, an asset-backed lender based in Toronto. His company recently introduced an offshoot, Zillidy, that issues small loans to small businesses; the money is backed by personal assets like luxury watches, jewelry and fine art.
To get the venture off the ground, Mr. Uster needed a chief appraiser. He placed advertisements in local media and inquired at area gemology programs but after several weeks had failed to find viable candidates. Then he went on LinkedIn and typed ''gemologist or jewelry appraiser Toronto'' into the search bar. Within an hour of reading the profiles that appeared in the search results, he had four candidates, one of whom he hired a week later. ''I don't know why it didn't occur to me sooner,'' he said. ''It should have been obvious.''
Here are some tips from companies that have been trying new strategies.
ASSEMBLE THE RIGHT TOOLS LinkedIn, whose membership grew 25 percent last year, now exceeds 200 million members worldwide and has thoroughly insinuated itself into the fabric of professional life. That means employers have one centralized place to find the vast majority of qualified candidates. Most important, through LinkedIn, employers can reach ''passive'' candidates, or the estimated 80 percent of all candidates who are not actively looking but might be interested in the right opportunity.
Not all LinkedIn membership levels provide the same degree of access to such candidates. Mr. Uster used his free basic account to find the appraiser. Once he spotted the abbreviated listings for a handful of promising candidates, including their current and previous employers, he simply searched for them online to find out more. ''I'm a huge fan of LinkedIn for small-business owners,'' he said, ''and I've never paid them a dime.''
Ms. Boulanger, on the other hand, spends more than $50,000 a year for seven subscriptions to Recruiter, LinkedIn's high-end product. In addition to providing more search functionality and full access to every LinkedIn profile, it has become a powerful management system for storing and organizing searches -- something akin to Salesforce, the cloud-based business software. When Ms. Boulanger is ready to contact candidates, Recruiter can even draft the InMail messages for her, drawing on templates like ''Conversation Starter'' or ''Getting Back in Touch.''
To cast a wider net, Ms. Boulanger lists all openings on Indeed and pays to have them appear in the top half of the first page of search results. She also advertises on Glassdoor, the employee-generated site used by job seekers to research the work culture of potential employers. When candidates log on to find out about the salaries and free snacks at a competitor, Opower's job listings pop up.
All told, Ms. Boulanger estimated she spends $165,000 a year on online searches. ''It sounds like a lot,'' she said, ''but if we were still using search firms to fill most of our six-figure openings, we'd be spending millions.''
ESTABLISH YOUR BRAND When candidates come across listings they find interesting, one of the first things they do is click on the company's Web site to find out more about the company. That is why most online hiring experts recommend that you think about the image you want to project.
Tech companies competing for engineers do this well. The careers pages on their Web sites are often filled with photos of employees wearing funny hats and videos spoofing MTV Cribs or Star Trek in hopes of conveying the right quirky offbeat sensibility. One new jobs site now in a test phase, Good.co, is organized around helping both job seekers and employers find the right cultural fit.
To attract talent, many companies participate in the industry-specific group discussion forums that LinkedIn hosts for members. Others try guerilla-like tactics, like using Work With Us, a LinkedIn tool that shows your advertisement whenever a candidate matching one of your job descriptions views another company's job listing.
EXPERIMENT WITH KEY WORDS It is impressive to watch an experienced person using Recruiter narrow the search results in a hot field -- massaging search terms and adding filters for experience level and business schools or engineering programs. Whether you are using Recruiter or one of LinkedIn's less expensive options, try different combinations of key words and filters to see which produce the best results. There is an art to it.
PUT YOUR EMPLOYEES TO WORK Encourage your employees to keep their LinkedIn profiles current and to post your job openings as updates to their personal pages. After all, each update they post of a new title, account landed or project ripples out through their networks and draws attention to your company. When vetting candidates, look for those with connections to your employees and ask their opinions.
COMBINE HIGH TECH WITH HIGH TOUCH As much as LinkedIn and other online tools have automated and centralized the process, some argue that the fundamentals of hiring have not changed. ''Once you have your list of 30 or 40 profiles, it still comes down to getting people on the phone and getting a good feel for them,'' said Jerry Grady, a financial services marketing recruiter with the Ward Group in Boston, who, like many recruiters, uses LinkedIn to initiate his searches. ''What LinkedIn does is put a lot of this at your fingertips, but the process is the same,'' he added.
When you have a list of candidates you want to approach, think about what else you may be able to do to elicit a response. Table XI, a Chicago-based Web and mobile-app consulting firm, recently created a blog post on LinkedIn about a successful search that landed a coveted app developer. Before approaching the candidate, TableXI's chief operating officer, Mark Rickmeier, reviewed the candidate's personal Web site and saw that it was designed like a Dr. Seuss book, complete with art and rhymes. In crafting his initial InMail to the candidate, Mr. Rickmeier began:
You must forgive
This intro quite strange
You shouldn't think
That I'm odd or deranged ...
The developer is now employed by Table XI -- and no doubt popping up regularly in other companies' recruiting searches.

HEADLINE: A Conflict Is Seen in a Review of a Detective's Conduct

BYLINE: By FRANCES ROBLES

 BODY:
Alvena Jennette spent almost 21 years in prison, writing appeals that pointed out irregularities in his murder case, such as how the chief eyewitness changed her story and contradicted another onlooker. In each instance, the office of the Brooklyn district attorney fought back against his claims.
But now his is one of some 50 murder convictions that the office is reviewing after the lead detective, Louis Scarcella, was accused of misconduct that put at least one innocent man in prison for 23 years. ''The same people who were rejecting my arguments all those years are going to review them?'' said Mr. Jennette, 49, who was released on parole in 2007. 
He is not alone in seeing a conflict. Mr. Jennette is one of several voices calling for the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, to step aside from the investigation and ask Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to appoint a special prosecutor.
A former Brooklyn federal prosecutor, Kenneth Thompson, who is running against Mr. Hynes in the Democratic primary, wrote a letter to the governor on Wednesday asking him to use his authority under the state's executive law to appoint the attorney general or a special prosecutor to review Mr. Scarcella's cases and other questionable convictions.
The controversy has ignited a broader debate about whether New York State needs a permanent body to examine wrongful convictions so that prosecutors are not put in the position of having to examine their own work. Mr. Hynes, a six-term district attorney, was in office when many of the questionable convictions occurred. Others occurred during the tenure of his predecessor, Elizabeth Holtzman.
Experts in postconviction law say a series of recent high-profile exonerations revealed prosecutorial misconduct and raised questions about whether the time has come for an outsider to review innocence claims.
''When a Delta plane crashes, Delta doesn't do the review -- the National Transportation Safety Board does,'' said Peter Neufeld, co-director of the Innocence Project, an organization that uses DNA evidence to fight wrongful convictions. ''It is essential to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest.''
The controversy in Brooklyn began in March with the release of David Ranta, who was an unemployed drug addict when he was arrested in the 1990 murder of a Hasidic rabbi. After 23 years in prison, the Brooklyn district attorney's office conceded that Mr. Scarcella had told a witness whom to pick in a lineup, had ignored another suspect and had let witnesses out of jail to smoke crack and visit prostitutes.
An examination by The New York Times of other cases, all during Ms. Holtzman's tenure, showed that Mr. Scarcella presented the same crack-addicted prostitute as an eyewitness in several homicide cases, including Mr. Jennette's. Some inmates denied giving Mr. Scarcella a confession and were convinced that they were set up by a rogue detective so eager to clamp down on rampant drug-fueled crime that he did not care whether he got the wrong guy.
Mr. Scarcella denies any wrongdoing.
''There needs to be independent oversight of all prosecutors,'' said Steve Banks, attorney in chief at the Legal Aid Society, which said it handled several cases of Mr. Scarcella's that were overturned. ''Public confidence needs to be restored, regardless of who is at fault.''
Mr. Banks said the legal defense organization planned to seek court relief for its clients and had asked the district attorney for the names of those affected.
''We're conducting our own review,'' he said.
Mr. Hynes's office said an outside review was unnecessary and stressed that he had the support of the president of the Kings County Criminal Bar Association.
''The D.A.'s position is that there is no basis to appoint a special prosecutor,'' said the office spokesman, Jerry Schmetterer. ''He's very serious and committed to remedy any injustice that has been done.''
Mr. Schmetterer noted that Mr. Hynes himself was a special prosecutor. Mr. Hynes took office in 1990, shortly after he was appointed to take over the criminal prosecution of a group of white teenagers who beat a black man and chased him to his death on the Belt Parkway in Howard Beach, Queens.
The decision to appoint a prosecutor would fall on Mr. Cuomo, whose father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, selected Mr. Hynes for the Howard Beach case. As attorney general, the younger Mr. Cuomo was appointed to take over the wrongful conviction investigation of Marty Tankleff, who was convicted of killing his parents, Seymour and Arlene Tankleff. Mr. Tankleff was released after 17 years in prison.
The governor's office said it would review Mr. Thompson's request.
Although members of the defense bar laud Mr. Hynes for creating the Conviction Integrity Unit, which investigated Mr. Ranta's case, they question his sudden interest in wrongful convictions when his office spent two decades fighting appeals for men like Mr. Ranta.
''We were screaming about Scarcella and his one-witness cases for 20 years,'' said Mr. Ranta's trial lawyer, Michael Baum. ''Maybe Charles Hynes should step down from this review. That would show that he really cares'' about wrongful convictions.
Bruce Green, a legal ethics expert at Fordham University School of Law, said Mr. Hynes was not wrong to insist on doing the job for which he was elected, but said the issue underscored the need for greater reform. ''Can a D.A. clean up his own mess?'' Mr. Green said. ''That's the bigger question.''

HEADLINE: Taiwan Recalls Its Envoy In Manila Over a Killing

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Floyd Whaley contributed reporting from Manila.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Taiwan announced the withdrawal of its representative in Manila on Wednesday and said it had stopped accepting applications for Filipino workers, a retaliatory step for the killing of a Taiwanese fisherman by the Philippine Coast Guard last week.
The office of President Ma Ying-jeou of Taiwan said the country regarded an informal apology offered earlier by the Philippines as inadequate. 
The diplomatic squabble is the latest sign of high tensions over competing claims in and around the South China Sea among Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan.
The Philippines said the Taiwanese fishing vessel had entered waters in its exclusive economic zone on Thursday and that it had tried to ram a Philippine Coast Guard ship. The Taiwanese fisherman, Hung Shih-cheng, 65, died from a bullet wound in the neck, and his boat was hit with dozens of rounds, Taiwanese officials said.
Taiwan has said that the shooting occurred at a location that is within exclusive economic zones claimed by both countries.
Mr. Ma's office said Wednesday that Taiwan's Navy and Coast Guard would stage an exercise as a show of strength in disputed waters near where the episode occurred. But Taiwanese officials seemed to be resisting some calls for military action.
The Central Daily News in Taiwan urged the government to take tough action against the Philippines, saying that ''suffering in silence'' for fear of antagonizing the United States, an ally of the Philippines, would only mean further international marginalization of the island.
In an effort to defuse the diplomatic standoff, a spokesman for President Benigno S. Aquino III of the Philippines said later Wednesday that a presidential representative would convey ''deep regret and apology'' to the family of the dead fisherman and to the people of Taiwan.
The spokesman, Edwin Lacierda, said in a statement that Amadeo R. Perez, chairman of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office, which operates as the Philippines' de facto embassy in Taipei, would personally deliver the message. Taiwan and the Philippines do not maintain official diplomatic relations.
Mr. Lacierda's statement also said that the Philippines' National Bureau of Investigation had begun an inquiry into the shooting, and that it would be ''thorough, exhaustive, impartial and expeditious.'' In a further note of apology, the statement said, ''We understand the grief and hurt of the family and of the people of Taiwan over this unfortunate loss and we empathize with them.''
Mr. Lacierda also asked that the Taiwan government not bar Filipino workers from Taiwan. ''We appeal to Taiwan not to involve our Filipino compatriots there,'' he said.
In 2011, the latest year for which data is available, 41,896 Filipinos went to Taiwan to work, according to the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration. Taiwan is the seventh most popular destination for Filipino workers overseas; the Philippines sends more than a million workers each year to countries around the world, and the money they send home is a mainstay of the country's economy.
China, which has frosty relations with the Philippines over territorial disputes in the South China Sea, has come down on the side of Taiwan, which it regards as a breakaway province. At a briefing Wednesday in Beijing, a spokesman for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office repeated China's demand that the Philippines investigate.
''We have already emphasized many times that we request the Philippines investigate thoroughly, punish those responsible and give the fishermen a satisfactory response,'' said the spokesman, Yang Yi.
The Philippines is challenging China's territorial claims in the South China Sea through an arbitration case filed with the tribunal of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

HEADLINE: For New York Mayor, D'Amato Puts His Money on a Democrat

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER; Al Baker and David W. Chen contributed reporting.

 BODY:
He was the rough-and-ready boss of the New York State Republican Party for a quarter-century, the senator from the suburbs who helped make ''liberal'' a dirty word in American politics.
Yet Alfonse M. D'Amato, it turns out, is the biggest financial backer for one Democrat in the New York City mayoral race, raising money enthusiastically for William C. Thompson Jr., whose best-known boosters, including David N. Dinkins and Betsy Gotbaum, lean decidedly to the left.
As the man long known as Senator Pothole might put it: What gives?
The unlikely alliance has given Mr. Thompson, an even-tempered former city comptroller, a sorely needed jolt of high-powered fund-raising as he seeks to project energy and momentum in the wide-open race for the Democratic nomination. 
It also underscores the diversity of supporters in the political establishment that he has tried to demonstrate with endorsements from Merryl H. Tisch, chancellor of the State Board of Regents, and Richard Ravitch, a former lieutenant governor and Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman.
Mr. D'Amato and his partner Melvin H. Miller, a onetime speaker of the State Assembly, bundled some $65,000 in donations to Mr. Thompson through March 11. And Mr. D'Amato's close associates, former aides and major clients have pitched in, too. All told, his network has accounted for as much as $125,000 in gifts to the Thompson campaign.
Mr. D'Amato's support does not come without complications. At 75, he is provocative and prickly, traits that have not dissipated with age. Appearing on NY1 on Tuesday night, he feigned tears while mocking the disclosure by Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker and another Democratic candidate for mayor, that she had struggled with bulimia and alcoholism. ''Oh, give me a break,'' he said. ''Now we have to soften her image. It's a bunch of bunk.''
(On Wednesday, Mr. Thompson said that Ms. Quinn's disclosure was ''touching'' and ''took courage.'' Asked if Mr. D'Amato should apologize, he said: ''Oh, please. Everyone has their own opinion. That's my opinion.'')
This is the first time Mr. D'Amato has been a major fund-raiser in a New York mayoral race, and already, he is in the top tier of check bundlers, a class headed by Sally Susman, a top executive at Pfizer who has taken in $128,000 for Ms. Quinn.
Mr. Thompson's fund-raising has generally lagged behind that of Ms. Quinn and another Democrat in the mayoral race, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, each of whom have already raised the maximum allowed for the primary under the city's voluntary public matching fund program. But Mr. Thompson's pace has picked up in recent months, and he has raised more than his rivals as he seeks to catch up.
Mr. D'Amato, who left the Senate in 1999 after losing a bid for a fourth term, is now the head of a thriving lobbying firm, Park Strategies, with clients in utilities, real estate, technology and a host of other industries that do business in and around New York. The firm generated about $3.7 million in fees at the state level last year, but only around one-tenth of that from city clients.
He said he mainly gave to Republicans. But Democrats currently hold all statewide elective offices in New York, and Mr. D'Amato has been a conspicuous donor to New York Democrats in recent years, raising money for Eliot Spitzer, David A. Paterson and Andrew M. Cuomo in their runs for governor, and standing by proudly as Mr. Paterson named Kirsten E. Gillibrand to the Senate in 2009.
Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Thompson are not close friends; their alliance appears largely pragmatic.
Mr. D'Amato called Mr. Thompson a decent, steady hand who understands education, economics, budgets and Wall Street, and said he found Mr. Thompson to be the least offensive Democrat, particularly from the perspective of his clients.
''Some of them are antigrowth, antidevelopment, just plain wrong,'' Mr. D'Amato said of the other mayoral contenders. He said that Mr. Thompson, by contrast, was someone ''who doesn't frighten business.''
''They don't have fear of Bill Thompson, that he's going to do some radical proposal that's going to hurt their business,'' Mr. D'Amato said. ''He's not as give-away-everything-there-is.''
Mr. D'Amato also said he believed that Mr. Thompson was the likely winner in the race for mayor, based on his support in Brooklyn, where the candidate has deep roots, and among black and Hispanic voters.
In an interview, Mr. Thompson said he was gratified by Mr. D'Amato's assistance. ''I'm proud to have his support,'' he said.
There was a time -- 1998, to be specific, during his losing race against Charles E. Schumer -- when Mr. D'Amato tossed around the phrase ''Brooklyn Democrat'' as though it was a slur. But Mr. Thompson said what most Democratic elected officials remembered about Mr. D'Amato was what he did in office, not what he said in the heat of partisan battle.
''People looking back realize how he delivered for the state of New York, and how hard he worked,'' Mr. Thompson said.
Mr. D'Amato has several clients with business before city government, including Redflex Traffic Systems, which makes red-light cameras; Delshah Capital, which buys poorly run apartment buildings and seeks city tax abatements to fix them up; and CGI Technologies, a major computer consultant.
Mr. Thompson said he would treat Mr. D'Amato ''like everybody else.'' And Mr. D'Amato denied that special treatment was on his mind.
''I would hope that if we had to get a hearing, we could get a hearing,'' he said. ''That's all you can ask for. You cannot ask to make a pig fly.''
Mr. D'Amato had harsh words for many of the other candidates. Among Republicans, he spoke fondly of John A. Catsimatidis, the grocery and oil magnate. But he said Joseph J. Lhota, the former transit authority chairman and deputy mayor -- under Rudolph W. Giuliani, a longtime foe of Mr. D'Amato's -- had no business entering the race.
''He's a nice man, but he should've stood where he was,'' Mr. D'Amato said, pointing to Mr. Lhota's comparison of the Port Authority police to ''mall cops,'' for which Mr. Lhota quickly apologized. ''Oh my God, he really shot himself,'' Mr. D'Amato said.
He said Mr. de Blasio, for whom others at Park Strategies have raised $40,000, was likable, except on the issues. ''I told him to move to the center,'' he said. ''Instead he's moved more to the left.''
But Mr. D'Amato seemed especially animated by animus toward Ms. Quinn. He cited newspaper reports of some of her more hard-nosed actions as Council speaker -- cutting money for the pet projects of council members who defied her, using Council funds to employ a public relations machine that benefits her politically -- as signs that she was ''a political boss in the worst sense.''
Even after being reminded that he, too, had been known as a domineering leader, Mr. D'Amato described Ms. Quinn's conduct as wrong.
''That kind of operation is old-style bossism, cronyism, of the worst kind,'' he said.
Mr. D'Amato also attacked Ms. Quinn over her support for the extension of term limits in 2008. But her campaign asserted that he had, on ''multiple occasions,'' lobbied her office in support of overturning term limits.
''Al D'Amato accusing someone of bossism is like the Kardashians calling someone gaudy,'' said Mike Morey, a spokesman for Ms. Quinn. ''Knowing what we know about antichoice, anti-gun-control, anti-Medicare Al D'Amato, voters should decide whether he's supporting Bill Thompson because he agrees with him on the issues or because he thinks it will help his lobbying business.''

HEADLINE: Pension Predators

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew Cuomo has done retirees and military veterans a great service by ordering New York's top banking regulator to investigate ''pension advance'' firms that persuade customers to sign over all or part of their monthly pensions in exchange for immediate cash payments. The payments, advertised as advances, are, in fact, cleverly disguised loans that can carry ruinously high interest rates and eventually strip older citizens of their meager assets. 
By insisting that they are making advances, not loans, these firms elude state supervision, including usury laws, licensing regulations and the federal Truth in Lending Act, which requires lenders to disclose borrowing costs. These and other subterfuges have enabled the companies to ambush pensioners with ''advance'' loans that carry interest charges ranging, according to a review by The Times, from 27 percent to 106 percent.
This is clearly illegal in New York, where a 1976 law makes it a felony for lenders to charge in excess of 25 percent interest. In addition to cash-strapped older residents and public employees like teachers, firefighters and police officers, the companies have been aggressively courting military veterans despite a federal law barring veterans from turning over pension payments to third parties. Next up for fleecing are disabled people who may have received structured disability settlements. In some cases, borrowers are required to pay for life insurance policies that list the lender as the sole beneficiary.
In addition to this investigation, the Cuomo administration has come out strongly against a bill pending in the Legislature that would lift the longstanding usury cap, allowing short-term lenders who issue ruinously priced loans to operate in the open. This should shed light on, and shame, legislators who have been lapping up contributions from the industry in return for supporting a bill that would be dangerous for their constituents.
The investigation into the pension advance companies now rests with the state's Department of Financial Services. The department moved quickly last week, sending subpoenas to 10 companies that asked, among other things, for information about their profits and marketing strategies. Depending on what it finds, the state could bring a lawsuit, issue an enforcement action or create new regulations. Given what we know so far about these seedy enterprises, all three could be required.

9 P.M. (NBC) THE OFFICE The series comes to an end as, months after the documentary is broadcast, Dunder Mifflin employees past and present reunite for a wedding and a final round of interviews in which hatchets are buried and mysteries are solved. Mindy Kaling, B. J. Novak, Rachael Harris, Dakota Johnson, Joan Cusack and Ed Begley Jr. guest star. A retrospective, featuring interviews with writers, producers and actors; clips of favorite moments; and a behind-the-scenes look at the finale, leads in at 8. Above, a scene from the show. 
11:45 A.M. (HBO2) FIELD OF DREAMS (1989) Kevin Costner, below, plays Ray Kinsella, a farmer who builds a baseball diamond in his cornfield, where some ghostly men in old-time uniforms show up to play. One is Shoeless Joe Jackson, the greatest player on the Chicago White Sox team that threw the 1919 World Series. ''The short route that has led to this point in 'Field of Dreams' goes to the heart of a work so smartly written, so beautifully filmed, so perfectly acted, that it does the almost impossible trick of turning sentimentality into true emotion,'' Caryn James wrote in The New York Times. Ray Liotta makes Shoeless Joe ''ethereal and real at once,'' she said, ''a relic of an earlier age much more than a ghost from the past.''
3:30 P.M. (MoreMax) THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT (2010) The children (Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson, below) conceived by a lesbian couple (Annette Bening, in an Oscar-nominated role, and Julianne Moore) with the help of an anonymous sperm donor find their father (Mark Ruffalo). This take on the American family from Lisa Cholodenko regards gay marriage as an established social fact and ''is so canny in its insights and so agile in its negotiation of complex emotions that it deserves to stand on its own,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times.
6 P.M. (TCM) GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER (1967) Katharine Hepburn, in the role that won her the second of four Oscars, and Spencer Tracy, who was nominated posthumously, portray an aging couple who find their liberal principles rattled when their daughter (Katharine Houghton) announces her engagement to a black doctor (Sidney Poitier). William Rose also received an Oscar for best screenplay in this film directed by Stanley Kramer, which earned a total of 10 nominations.

But he's bored. Then along comes Nikki (Kerry Washington), and with her, trouble. Mr. Rock directed this film and wrote the script, which he adapted with Louis C. K. from Eric Rohmer's ''Chloe in the Afternoon.'' ''In attempting to synthesize the later French New Wave of the late 1960s and early '70s with the upscale African-American romantic comedies that flourished in Hollywood in the late 1990s, Mr. Rock has not only done his best work as a director and screenwriter but has also made an unusually insightful and funny mainstream American movie about the predicaments of modern marriage,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The Times.

HEADLINE: Big Banks Get Break in Rules Limiting Risks

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
9:33 p.m. | Updated
Under pressure from Wall Street lobbyists, federal regulators have agreed to soften a rule intended to rein in the banking industry's domination of a risky market.
The changes to the rule, which will be announced on Thursday, could effectively empower a few big banks to continue controlling the derivatives market, a main culprit in the financial crisis.
The $700 trillion market for derivatives -- contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset like a bond or an interest rate -- allow companies to either speculate in the markets or protect against risk.
It is a lucrative business that, until now, has operated in the shadows of Wall Street rather than in the light of public exchanges. Just five banks hold more than 90 percent of all derivatives contracts. 
Yet allowing such a large and important market to operate as a private club came under fire in 2008. Derivatives contracts pushed the insurance giant American International Group to the brink of collapse before it was rescued by the government.
In the aftermath of the crisis, regulators initially planned to force asset managers like Vanguard and Pimco to contact at least five banks when seeking a price for a derivatives contract, a requirement intended to bolster competition among the banks. Now, according to officials briefed on the matter, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has agreed to lower the standard to two banks.
About 15 months from now, the officials said, the standard will automatically rise to three banks. And under the trading commission's new rule, wide swaths of derivatives trading must shift from privately negotiated deals to regulated trading platforms that resemble exchanges.
But critics worry that the banks gained enough flexibility under the plan that it hews too closely to the ''precrisis status.''
''The rule is really on the edge of returning to the old, opaque way of doing business,'' said Marcus Stanley, the policy director of Americans for Financial Reform, a group that supports new rules for Wall Street.
Making such decisions on regulatory standards is a product of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which mandated that federal agencies write hundreds of new rules. Most of that effort is now complete at the trading commission. But across several agencies, nearly two-thirds of the rules are unfinished, including some major measures like the Volcker Rule, which seeks to prevent banks from trading with their own money.
The deal over derivatives was forged from wrangling at the five-person commission, which was sharply divided. Gary Gensler, the agency's Democratic chairman, championed the stricter proposal. But he met opposition from the Republican members on the commission, as well as Mark Wetjen, a Democratic commissioner who has sided with Wall Street on other rules.
Mr. Wetjen argued that five banks was an arbitrary requirement, according to the officials briefed on the matter. In advocating the two-bank plan, he also noted that the agency would not prevent companies from seeking additional price quotes. Other regulators have proposed weaker standards.
Mr. Gensler, eager to rein in derivatives trading but lacking an elusive third vote, accepted the deal. By his reckoning, the compromise was better than no rule at all.
In an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Gensler said that, even with the compromise, the rule will still push private derivatives trading onto regulated trading platforms, much like stock trading. He also argued that the agency plans to adopt two other rules on Thursday that will subject large swaths of trades to regulatory scrutiny.
''No longer will this be a closed, dark market,'' Mr. Gensler said. ''I think what we're planning to do tomorrow fulfills the Congressional mandate and the president's commitment.''
Yet the deal comes at an awkward time for the agency. Mr. Gensler, who was embraced by consumer advocates but scorned by some on Wall Street, is expected to leave the agency later this year now that his term has technically ended.
In preliminary talks about filling the spot, the White House is expected to consider Mr. Wetjen, a former aide to the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid. The administration, according to people briefed on the matter, is also looking at an outsider as a potential successor: Amanda Renteria, a former Goldman Sachs employee and Senate aide.
The prospect of someone other than Mr. Gensler completing the rules provided some momentum for the compromise, officials say. The officials also noted that Mr. Gensler had set a June 30 deadline for completing the plan.
The White House declined to comment. Mr. Gensler, who has not said whether he will seek a second term at the agency, declined to discuss his plans on Wednesday.
While the regulator defended the derivatives rule, consumer advocates say the agency gave up too much ground. To some, the compromise illustrated the financial industry's continued influence in Washington.
''The banks have all these ways to reverse the rules behind the scenes,'' Mr. Stanley said.
The compromise also alarmed Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the agency who has called for greater competition in the derivatives market. Still, Mr. Chilton signaled a willingness to vote for the rule.
''At the end of the day, we need a rule and that may mean some have to hold their noses,'' he said.
The push for competition follows concerns that a handful of select banks -- JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs -- control the market for derivatives contracts.
That grip, regulators and advocacy groups say, empowers those banks to overcharge some asset managers and companies that buy derivatives. It also raises concerns about the safety of the banks, some of which nearly toppled in 2008.
''It's important to remember that the Wall Street oligopoly brought us the financial crisis,'' said Dennis Kelleher, a former Senate aide that now runs Better Markets, an advocacy group critical of Wall Street.
With that history in mind, Congress inserted into Dodd-Frank a provision that forces derivatives trading onto regulated trading platforms. The platforms, known as swap execution facilities, were expected to open a window into the secretive world of derivatives trading. But Congress left it to Mr. Gensler's agency to explain how they would actually work.
There was a time when Mr. Gensler envisioned the strictest rule possible. In 2010, he pushed a plan that could, in essence, make all bids for derivatives contracts public. Facing complaints, the agency instead proposed a plan that would require at least five banks to quote a price for derivatives passing through a swap execution facility.
But even that plan prompted a full-court press from Wall Street lobbyists. Banks and other groups that opposed the plan held more than 80 meetings with agency officials over the last three years, an analysis of meeting records shows. Goldman Sachs attended 19 meetings; the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Wall Street's main lobbying group, was there for 11.
The banks also benefited from some unlikely allies, including large asset managers that buy derivatives contracts. While money managers may seem like natural supporters of Mr. Gensler's plan -- and some in fact are -- the industry's largest players already receive significant discounts from select banks, providing them an incentive to oppose Mr. Gensler's plan.
The companies cautioned that, because Mr. Gensler's plan would involve a broader universe of banks, it could cause leaks of private trading positions. The plan, the companies said, would not necessarily benefit the asset managers.
''If someone told me I needed to shop five different places for a pair of jeans, I don't see how that would help me,'' said Gabriel D. Rosenberg, a lawyer at Davis Polk, which represents Sifma and the banks.
The banks and asset managers also warned that many derivatives contracts are traded too infrequently to even generate attention from five banks.
Some regulators dispute that point. They point to the industry's own data, which shows that 85 percent of derivatives trading in a recent 10-day span occurred in four products that are arguably quite liquid. (Each traded more than 500 times.)
As such, according to officials briefed on the matter, Mr. Chilton proposed a plan to require quotes to be submitted to at least five banks for the most liquid contracts. Under his plan, contracts that were less liquid could still be subject to at least two.
Mr. Wetjen, who saw the effort as too complicated, continued to favor the two-bank plan. While the requirement jumps to three banks in about 15 months, the agency might also have to produce a study that could undermine that broader standard.
In an interview, Mr. Wetjen explained that he was seeking to grant more flexibility to the markets. ''If flexibility means it's more beneficial to the banks, so be it,'' he said. ''But it also means it's more flexible to all market participants and the marketplace as a whole.''
Some consumer advocates have raised broader concerns about Mr. Wetjen, who once advocated a wider than expected exemption to part of a derivatives rule. They also complained that Mr. Wetjen has split with Mr. Gensler on aspects of a plan to apply Dodd-Frank to banks trading overseas. He has, however, voted with Mr. Gensler on every rule, unlike the other commissioners.
Mr. Wetjen also noted that his actions often upset the banks. On only a few issues, he happened to agree with them.
''I'm not driven by who wages the argument,'' he said. ''It's about what policy makes sense.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Japan's Economy Growing at 3.5% Annualized Rate

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's economy grew at a robust annualized pace of 3.5 percent in the first quarter, preliminary data showed, the first sign that the bold monetary and economic policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe were starting to bear fruit. 
Japanese growth came to 0.9 percent for the January-to-March period compared with a year ago, driven by higher household consumption and exports, government data showed. That beat market expectations of 0.7 percent for the quarter, or 2.8 percent for the annualized pace.
Exports grew 3.8 percent, pushed higher by strong shipments of cars and other manufactured goods to the United States on the back of a weaker yen, offsetting a slump in exports to China and Europe.
Personal consumption, which makes up the largest part of Japan's gross domestic product, grew 0.9 percent, as consumer sentiment brightened amid signs of an economic recovery.
The solid pace, which came after two quarters of contraction and a quarter of just 0.2 percent growth, appeared to point to the beginnings of a long-awaited turnaround in the world's third-largest economy, after the United States and China. ''It is a sign that the Abe administration's economic policies are starting to show results,'' the economics minister, Akira Amari, said.
The latest numbers have come as early validation for Mr. Abe, who took office in December, and has used what has been called a three-arrowed bid to lift Japan out of its long deflationary slump. He has focused on an aggressive monetary policy that has flooded the economy with cheap money, major fiscal spending and reforms to make the economy more competitive.
Under Mr. Abe, the central bank has sought to double its monetary base and to generate inflation of 2 percent by 2014. This first arrow has been accompanied by a devaluation of the yen by some 20 percent in the last six months, which has been a boon for exporters. Exporters from Toyota to Sony have reported a rebound in profit in the first quarter of 2013, thanks in good part to the policy.
In recent days, however, concerns have grown over rising interest rates in the government bonds market, which could threaten Japan's monetary policy. Japan is vulnerable to rising borrowing because of its high public debt burden, which is twice the size of its economy.
Still, investors have piled into Japan's stock market, emboldened by expectations of rosy corporate profits and an economic recovery. The Nikkei stock index has risen by an astonishing 46 percent since Mr. Abe took office.
Japan is also getting a boost from the second arrow, more fiscal spending. Mr. Abe pushed through an emergency stimulus package of 10 trillion yen in February, and has followed up with a 92.6 trillion yen initial budget for 2013, which Japan's Parliament approved late Wednesday.
Economists say that for the economy to keep growing, the third arrow will be crucial: mainly structural reforms that aim to make the economy more competitive, for example by making Japan's labor market more flexible and lowering barriers to trade.
''For the rally to continue and be fundamentally driven, Abe must convince the market that his 'third arrow' will benefit Japan's underlying economy,'' the UBS economists Daiju Aoki and Toru Ibayashi said.

HEADLINE: Faster Broadband Speeds: The View From the F.C.C.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Yanking Broadband From Slow Lane,'' by Eduardo Porter (Economic Scene, May 8): 
It's vital that we keep pushing for faster broadband speeds. Google Fiber is an important positive development and has been followed by a growing number of other high-speed broadband deployments, including expansions by AT&T, CenturyLink, and other companies and municipalities.
Smart policies at all levels of government are needed to drive capital investment by new entrants and expansion by existing players. Over the past four years, the Federal Communications Commission has adopted significant policies to do so, including rules to lower broadband deployment costs.
We've also modernized universal service programs from telephone to broadband, creating the Connect America Fund to invest $45 billion in our broadband infrastructure; eliminated outdated regulations that were discouraging network upgrades; and adopted open Internet rules and other policies to spur competition.
We've seen significant progress in the United States over this period, including moving from 22nd to 8th globally in broadband speeds and from laggard to leader in mobile broadband. But in this fast-moving sector, challenges remain. The F.C.C. is exploring additional policies to lower deployment costs and has opposed state efforts to stop municipal broadband projects.
Particularly in today's global economy, it's essential that the F.C.C. -- revitalized and focused on broadband -- continue to implement policies to unleash private investment and promote competition.

HEADLINE: Denmark's Welfare State

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Danes Rethink a Welfare State Ample to a Fault'' (front page, April 21) paints a picture of Denmark that we take issue with: a picture of a country forced into reforming an unsustainable economic model that fosters a lazy population and inhibits innovation and growth. 
That is not the case. Danish government works consistently to reform our welfare state, most recently with the agreement on a long-term, ambitious growth plan aiming to create a substantial number of new jobs by 2020. This plan is part of securing our model for the future.
Throughout the global financial crisis, Denmark has maintained its A.A.A. rating, and many international investors consider the Danish krone to be a safe haven. Average employment rates in Denmark remain higher than in the United States and other countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
Denmark consistently ranks among the most competitive economies in the world, most recently in the Global Competitiveness Report for 2013.
Add to this that Denmark is widely recognized as a world leader in the transition to green growth, that it is one of the most equal societies in the world, and that the Danish population is widely known as ''happiest in the world,'' as measured by indicators of living conditions like health, education and housing.
So when The New York Times asks whether Denmark can manage to sustain and reform its welfare state, my answer is yes. A strong economy, a high level of solidarity and a green transition are mutually supportive, not the opposite.
PIA OLSEN DYHR Minister for Trade and Investment Copenhagen, May 13, 2013

HEADLINE: The Myth of a Perfect Orderly Liquidation Authority for Big Banks

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Yet another report on too-big-to-fail institutions fails to address the right issues, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
On Tuesday, with some fanfare, the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington rolled out a report, "Too Big to Fail: The Path to a Solution." Focused on how to "resolve" big financial companies - a technical term for the details of handling the failure of such institutions - the report is elegantly written and nicely laid out. You can either read the very short version, the short version or the long version of the same material. Unfortunately, in all three the authors fail to persuade that the problem of too-big-to-fail is fixed or can be brought under control if only we follow their recommendations. 
Their argument has three elements. First, big financial companies can be resolved either in bankruptcy or, more likely, through using the orderly liquidation authority, or O.L.A., created by the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. Second, the key to making O.L.A. workable is sufficient "loss-absorbing" long-term debt and equity at the holding-company level. Third, the implication is that most or all of the big banks already have sufficient "loss-absorbing" debt and equity at the holding company level to make this work. 
As a result, the authors contend, we (or perhaps financial-sector executives) are in luck - no significant structural changes, like simplification or reductions in scale, are needed at megabanks. 
All three parts of this argument are unconvincing - and the bottom-line policy implication, "do little, be happy," is downright dangerous.

The first point about the workings of bankruptcy and O.L.A. may sound good on paper but is simply not plausible in the real world. We are talking about huge, complex and opaque companies - typically including hundreds of thousands of employees across more than 100 different countries, with 2,000-plus legal entities. Even well-informed investors cannot figure out where the risks really lie - and the recent London Whale experience at JPMorgan Chase raises questions about whether officials or even company managements have much more of a clue.
The exercise of having large bank holding companies draw up "living wills" to show how their failures could be handled under normal bankruptcy procedures (part of the Title I requirements under Dodd-Frank) is widely regarded as having yielded little or nothing of value. There will be a do-over later this year, but I have yet to find a well-informed person - in either the private sector or government - who is optimistic about the outcome.
In addition, the United States authorities have so far failed to designate a single nonbank as systemically important - and thus subject to additional prudential requirements (a technical term, meaning closer scrutiny and supervision), including preparation of a living will. The authors show no awareness of the painful lessons from A.I.G., Lehman Brothers and the run on money funds in September 2008. None of those entities were banks (a specific legal and regulatory term), but this report seems oblivious to the implications.
If the market questions, and it does, whether the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation could handle the failure of a single big bank holding company (already subject to close supervision, in principle), what are the chances of persuading anyone that a significant nonbank financial institution could be resolved in an orderly fashion?
To be fair, the authors of the Bipartisan Policy Center report would like to modify the bankruptcy code - adding a new Chapter 14 (an idea that originated with the Hoover Institution). But why should the financial sector, or anyone else, get special treatment? If we are going to use bankruptcy when companies fail - and this would be my strong preference, if I thought it could be done without destroying the world economy - surely there should be one set of rules for everyone. 
Once you establish special treatment and break with precedents, the entire legal process becomes murky, unpredictable and likely to spread more fear than confidence in the outcomes.
Of course, megabanks and other systemically important financial companies cannot go through bankruptcy today without generating the risk of a broader economic collapse - again, one lesson from the fall of 2008. An obvious response would be to induce these companies to change the structure, scale and nature of their activities in order that their failure could be handled by bankruptcy. This is precisely the intent of Title I in Dodd-Frank.
The authors of this report, however, prefer instead to rely on the orderly liquidation authority, including the proposed "single point of entry" for bank-holding companies. In the current version of this plan, the F.D.I.C. would take over a failing institution and force recapitalization at the holding-company level through wiping out equity holders and converting long-term subordinated debt owed by the holding company into equity, while allowing operating subsidiaries to continue in business and to pay their liabilities in full.
I fully support the F.D.I.C. in its attempt to build a workable O.L.A., and there are presumably situations in which this set of tools could help. (I'm a member of the F.D.I.C.'s Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee, but the views here are mine alone.)
But I have not heard any of the relevant responsible officials express the kind of frothy optimism for O.L.A. that bubbles through in this report.
The authors do cite a recent speech by Mary Miller, under secretary for domestic finance at the Treasury Department, in which she says that too-big-to-fail is substantially fixed by the O.L.A. and other measures. But, as John Parsons and I pointed out at the time, her speech is deeply flawed at many levels and absolutely does not represent the public views of the F.D.I.C. or the Federal Reserve.
Regarding whether she provides a realistic assessment of O.L.A., Ms. Miller's language actually confuses liquidation - the closing of a company and the winding down of its activities - with resolution (see Page 6 of her speech). I pointed out this problem two weeks ago to the Treasury Department; unfortunately, it has made no discernible attempt to tighten the wording or issue any kind of clarification.
The second point in the Bipartisan Policy Center report's argument completely misses the key systemic issues, including the basic mechanics of how global crises spread.
The authors do mention the issues of global resolution - handling a financial failure across borders - but only to dismiss the thorny realities as trivial. As for the report's recommendations, regarding global resolution these amount to exhorting the F.D.I.C. to get foreign countries to cooperate (good luck) and to threatening to bring Congress back in to legislate cross-border cooperation (a legislative and diplomatic impossibility).
The authors are top experts (legal and financial), so surely they have been following the news from Europe, including a series of botched bank rescues, the debacle in Cyprus and now a row at the highest political levels about whether to protect uninsured depositors more or less than bondholders. Not surprisingly, the split is between countries where such depositors have more sway (e.g., France and Spain) and those where bondholders have a stronger voice (e.g., Britain and Denmark). Who will get what kind of support - or be forced to swallow a bail-in (i.e., take losses) in a potential crisis?
It is impossible to say with any accuracy. 
Writing in The Financial Times on Monday, Wolfgang Schäuble, Germany's finance minister, made it clear that we are a long way from having an integrated bank resolution regime in Europe. In a crisis, it's every finance minister and central banker for himself.
This matters a great deal because, as the Federal Reserve governor Jeremy Stein pointed out in a recent speech, the costs of financial stress are felt not just when there is an outright failure but also when financial institutions suffer losses and come under pressure. In terms of macroeconomic impact, "near collapse" can be almost as damaging as actual failure, particularly amid great uncertainty about who will bear what kind of loss.
And this leads to perhaps the greatest deficiency in this report: a complete failure to discuss the importance of who holds the quasi-mythical "loss-absorbing debt" at the holding company level. If such debt is held by highly leveraged institutions, with or without obvious systemic importance themselves, then a sharp fall in the value of this debt (leading up to the forced conversion into equity) can help spread a crisis far and wide. 
The same problem exists for money-market funds, which remain highly susceptible to runs. Would it be stabilizing or destabilizing if a large amount of this debt were held across borders?
And who will be allowed to insure this debt, through credit default swaps or in some other complicated way using derivatives? If Goldman Sachs insures any kind of bail-in liabilities of JPMorgan Chase (or another megabank), that should make us very worried.
Third, all roads lead to equity capital, in a way that the authors of this report fail to appreciate fully.
If the big banks really had sufficient equity to absorb likely losses, we would be discussing equity levels close to those proposed in legislation by Senators Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana. (I wrote in more detail last month on Bloomberg View about Brown-Vitter and its impact so far.)
But the Bipartisan Policy Center report takes the view that such levels of equity funding (relative to total assets) are a bad idea. The wording here seems close to that in a recent document issued by Davis Polk & Wardwell, a law firm (not surprising, as one of the authors of the center's report is a senior person at that firm). Both Davis Polk and this report are completely wrong on equity - a point that I made in this blog recently (including the misinterpretation of the pivotal new book by Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig).
At least implicitly, the report is putting great weight on long-term subordinated debt at the holding company level. How much is there?
Moody's, the rating agency, issued a report on this question in March ("Reassessing Systemic Support in U.S. Bank Ratings - an Update and F.A.Q."). There is more than one way to do the relevant calculations, but Moody's entirely plausible methodology suggests that total capital subject to a bail-in (equity plus the right kind of debt at the holding company level) is 4 or 5 percent of total assets for some of our biggest banking conglomerates (see Exhibit 3 in that report).
I'm comparing bail-in capital with total assets, not risk-weighted assets - as the risk weights are wrong in every crisis. However, I would caution that Moody's does not adjust these debt numbers according to whether they are held by bail-in creditors - i.e., entities on which the F.D.I.C. would actually be willing to impose losses.
Next, we should expect megabanks and their representatives to whine that reasonable levels of bail-in capital (e.g., 20 to 30 percent of total assets) - and a conservative definition of bail-in creditors - will crater the real economy. We hear this assertion every time financial reforms are discussed. For example, the financial consulting firm Oliver Wyman (which is also involved in the Bipartisan Policy Center report) made this point on the Volcker Rule). 
The Bipartisan Policy Center report depicts a pair of mythical beasts - the perfect orderly liquidation authority and its partner, the bail-in creditor. More broadly, this appears to be part of a concerted effort by megabanks and their allies to convince you, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, that the existence of these beasts will hold all other evils at bay.
Such mythical beasts do not exist in the real world.

HEADLINE: House Agriculture Committee Approves Farm Bill

BYLINE: RON NIXON


HIGHLIGHT: The House voted to approve a $940 billion farm bill. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - After a late-night session Wednesday, the House Agriculture Committee voted to approve a $940 billion farm bill, a day after the Senate passed its version, setting the stage for Congress to finally begin work on a new five-year bill.
The vote was 36 to 10, with mostly Democrats voting against the bill after nine hours of debate. 
Efforts to pass a farm bill last year failed when House leaders refused to bring their version of the bill to the floor for a vote. The Senate did pass its version. The most recent farm bill, which passed in 2008, was extended until Sept. 30.
The committee's chairman, Representative Frank D. Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma, praised the efforts of the committee in passing the bill, but warned that there was still a lot of work ahead as the measure headed to the full House. "I'm pleased the committee was able to work together, find some common ground, and advance a five-year farm bill today," Mr. Lucas said.
The House bill cuts projected spending in farm and nutrition programs by nearly $40 billion over the next 10 years. Just over half, $20.5 million, would come from cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. The Senate voted to cut spending by $23 billion, with $4.1 billion of the cuts coming from the food stamp program.
The House bill, like the Senate's version, would eliminate direct payments to farmers, which are made annually whether they grow crops or not. Currently, farmers who grow corn, wheat, soybeans, cotton and other crops receive about $5 billion in direct payments. Billions of dollars saved by eliminating direct payments would be directed into other subsidy programs, including crop insurance and new subsidies for peanut, cotton and rice farmers.
The House, like the Senate, basically left the sugar program alone, keeping price supports and restrictions on imports intact. The bill adds money to support fruit and vegetable growers. It also restores insurance programs for livestock producers, which expired in 2001, leaving thousands of operations without disaster coverage last year during the worst drought in 50 years.
The House farm bill passed the committee with strong bipartisan support but exposed a division among committee members over the size of cuts to the food stamp program, which has long been a target of conservatives.
Hoping to get more Republicans to support the bill, Mr. Lucas and Collin C. Peterson, Democrat of Minnesota and ranking member on the committee, increased the amount of the cuts by $4 billion from $16 billion in last year's bill.
Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, and a number of other Democrats on the committee offered an amendment that would have restored proposed cuts to the food stamp program. That amendment was defeated 27 to 17. The vote was largely along party lines, although Mr. Peterson, along with two other Democrats, voted against the amendment.
Cuts to the food stamp program was hotly debated, with members quoting Bible verses to support keeping the food stamp programs at current levels or cutting it.
Representative Juan C. Vargas, Democrat of California, who opposes cuts to the food stamp program, began the thread by quoting a biblical passage from the 25th chapter of the Book of Matthew.
"I'm a Christian, and this chapter talks about how you treat the least among us," said Mr. Vargas, adding that he would not support a bill that made such deep cuts to the antihunger program.
But K. Michael Conaway, a Texas Republican, countered that argument. "I take umbrage to that," he said. "I take Matthew 25 to mean me as an individual, not the U.S. government."
Representative Stephen Fincher, Republican of Tennessee, then quoted a Bible verse from the 26th chapter of Matthew, saying the "poor will always be with us" in his defense of cuts to the food stamps program. Mr. Fincher said obligations to take care of the poor should be left to churches, not the government.
"Christians, Jews Muslims, whatever - we are failing our sisters and brothers," Mr. McGovern shot back.
A report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan Washington research group, said the cuts in the food stamp program would eliminate two million people from the program, most of them children and older people. The report said the cuts would come in addition to a reduction that food stamp recipients would experience starting Nov. 1., when benefits that were increased under the 2008 economic stimulus expire.
"Placing the SNAP cuts in this farm bill on top of the benefit cuts that will take effect in November is likely to put substantial numbers of poor families at risk of food insecurity," the report said.
Senate leaders announced Wednesday that they would begin work on their $955 billion farm bill next Monday. House leaders have not set a timetable.

HEADLINE: How Important Is Driving to You?

BYLINE: MICHAEL GONCHAR


HIGHLIGHT: Do you see yourself as someone who will drive a car every day as you get older &#8212; to go to work, go shopping and get around town? Or, do you imagine yourself walking, bicycling and using public transportation? 

 BODY:
 Driving was once considered the ticket to freedom for teenagers eager to be more independent. But has driving lost some of its luster recently? 
How important is driving to you?
 

In "Young Americans Lead Trend to Less Driving," John Schwartz writes that Americans are driving less.
Dan Mauney keeps misplacing his car.
Mr. Mauney, 42, lives in an apartment tower in this city's Uptown neighborhood, a pedestrian-friendly quarter with new office buildings, sparkling museums and ambitious restaurants. He so seldom needs to drive that when he does go to retrieve his car in his building's garage, he said, "I always forget where I parked it."
Charlotte and other American cities have not abandoned their cars or their sprawling growth. But people like Mr. Mauney are part of the reason that American driving patterns have downshifted - perhaps for years to come.
For six decades, Americans have tended to drive more every year. But in the middle of the last decade, the number of miles driven - both over all and per capita - began to drop, notes a report to be published on Tuesday by U.S. Pirg, a nonprofit advocacy organization.
People tend to drive less during recessions, since fewer people are working (and commuting), and most are looking for ways to save money. But Phineas Baxandall, an author of the report and senior analyst for U.S. Pirg, said the changes preceded the recent recession and appeared to be part of a structural shift that is largely rooted in changing demographics, especially the rise of so-called millennials - today's teenagers and 20-somethings. "Millennials aren't driving cars," he said.
 Students: Tell us ...

        
How important is driving to you?
        
Do you drive a car now? If you're not old enough yet, do you want to drive? Have you gotten your driver's license yet?
        
Do you see yourself as someone who will drive a car every day as you get older - to go to work, go shopping and get around town? Or, do you imagine yourself walking, bicycling and using public transportation?
        
Do you see driving as "a birthright and the open road a symbol of freedom," as previous generations have? Or, do you see cars and driving as something else? Explain.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times, plus a look at what&#8217;s happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 

        
The acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service resigned on Wednesday as the Justice Department continued its nascent investigation of accusations that the I.R.S. targeted conservative groups for additional scrutiny. Jonathan Weisman reports that the Senate Finance Committee will look into the matter on Thursday, a day before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hears testimony from Lois Lerner, who heads the agency's division on tax-exempt organizations.
 

        
One hundred pages of e-mails released by the White House on Wednesday show intense fighting between officials at the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency over how much information to reveal after last September's terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, Mark Landler, Eric Schmitt and Michael D. Shear report.

        
The chasm between the reality and the actuality of President Obama's second term, dogged by recent controversies, has raised questions about whether the president can rise above scandal and wrest the powers of his office to achieve his latter-term goals, Peter Baker writes.

        
The series of embarrassing revelations about the sexual violence in the military may force Congress to address the issue, but lawmakers on the Senate Armed Services Committee are split on how or whether to change how the military handles the cases, Jennifer Steinhauer writes. As President Obama meets with Pentagon officials on Thursday, Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, is expected to introduce legislation that would give military prosecutors rather than commanders the power to decide which sexual assault cases to try.
 Happening in Washington: 

        
Economic reports expected Thursday include April housing starts, last month's consumer price index and weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed at 10 a.m. by weekly mortgage rates.

        
During a visit to Washington on Thursday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey will meet with President Obama at 9:50 a.m. and the two will give a joint press conference at noon. At 1:30 p.m., Mr. Erdogan is the honoree at a lunch held by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Secretary of State John Kerry. Mr. Erdogan and Mr. Biden will speak at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce at 5:15 p.m., before Mr. Erdogan rejoins Mr. Obama for a working dinner at 6:30 p.m.

        
Separate Senate committees are expected to vote on President Obama's nominees to run the Department of Labor (9:15 a.m.) and the Environmental Protection Agency (noon).

        
At a 10 a.m. oversight hearing focused on the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency's chairwoman, Mary Jo White, will testify before the House Committee on Financial Services.

        
Also at 10 a.m., an Appropriations subcommittee in the Senate will hold a hearing on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's budget request for 2014 with testimony from the agency's director, Robert S. Mueller III.

        
When the House gathers at noon, lawmakers are expected to pass (again) a bill to repeal President Obama's health care law that, like its predecessors, is unlikely to go anywhere in the Senate.

HEADLINE: JPMorgan Shareholders in the Dark

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The shareholders that sponsored a proposal at JPMorgan Chase have stopped receiving updates on the vote. | Changes to a rule on derivatives could allow a few big banks to continue controlling the market. | Third Point has sold its stake in Morgan Stanley. | Tesla&#8217;s plan to raise cash is fueling a debate about the company. 

 BODY:
In the middle of a closely watched vote on whether to split the roles of chairman and chief executive at JPMorgan Chase, the firm providing tabulations of the results has stopped giving voting snapshots to the shareholders that sponsored the proposal, Susanne Craig and Jessica Silver-Greenberg report in DealBook. The firm says the change followed a request from Wall Street's main lobbying group.
"The pension fund shareholders that are promoting a split at the top of the bank are crying foul. Knowing the current tally is critical for both sides in shaping their campaigns, they say - cutting off access to them gives JPMorgan, which is getting frequent updates, an upper hand," DealBook writes. Michael Garland, assistant comptroller who heads corporate governance for New York City's comptroller, John Liu, said: "It's like playing a game where only the home team gets to know the score."
Lyell Dampeer, a senior executive at Broadridge, the firm providing the voting information, said he received a call last week from an employee of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Wall Street's main lobbying group, requesting that Broadridge cut off access to organizations that are sponsoring proposals. The association represents JPMorgan and other financial firms. 
The debate around the shareholder vote has drawn an unusual degree of attention to Jamie Dimon, the bank's leader. "In an unfortunate way, but that's the way life is, it is all coming down to this vote around the guy who has been at the forefront of being a successful banker, running a bank that's still making money and somebody who speaks his mind," William Daley, who was JPMorgan's Midwest chairman until 2011, told Bloomberg Businessweek. Others found the pressure on Mr. Dimon unwarranted. "They're jealous," James E. Cayne, former chief of Bear Stearns, said of Mr. Dimon's critics.
BIG BANKS GET A BREAK IN DERIVATIVES RULES | "Under pressure from Wall Street lobbyists, federal regulators have agreed to soften a rule intended to rein in the banking industry's domination of a risky market," DealBook's Ben Protess reports. "The changes to the rule, which will be announced on Thursday, could effectively empower a few big banks to continue controlling the derivatives market, a main culprit in the financial crisis."
After derivatives played a starring role in the financial crisis, regulators initially planned to require asset managers to contact at least five banks when seeking a price for a derivatives contract. "Now, according to officials briefed on the matter, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has agreed to lower the standard to two banks," Mr. Protess reports. "About 15 months from now, the officials said, the standard will automatically rise to three banks. And under the trading commission's new rule, wide swaths of derivatives trading must shift from privately negotiated deals to regulated trading platforms that resemble exchanges."
But critics fear the plan now hews too closely to the way things were before the crisis. "The rule is really on the edge of returning to the old, opaque way of doing business," said Marcus Stanley, the policy director of Americans for Financial Reform, a group that supports new regulations for Wall Street.
THIRD POINT LEAVES MORGAN STANLEY; JANA BUYS INTO GROUPON | Daniel S. Loeb has ended his engagement with Morgan Stanley. Mr. Loeb's hedge fund, Third Point, disclosed in a filing on Wednesday that it had sold its 7.8 million shares in the firm during the first quarter, not long after accumulating the stake. An activist investor, Mr. Loeb had taken aim at the compensation of Morgan Stanley's board members. Third Pointk, which this week called for a breakup of Sony, likely made money on its Morgan Stanley investment.
At the same time, Jana Partners, the hedge fund run by Barry Rosenstein, disclosed big new stakes in the online commerce company Groupon and the game maker Zynga on Wednesday. The firm reported owning 21.9 million shares in Groupon, giving it a 3.3 percent stake, and 25.5 million shares in Zynga, for a 4.3 percent stake, making Jana one of the top six shareholders for both companies.
ON THE AGENDA | The Hess Corporation, which is engaged in a proxy contest with Elliott Management, holds its annual meeting. The Consumer Price Index for April is out at 8:30 a.m. Wal-Mart reports earnings before the market opens. J.C. Penney announces results Thursday evening. The House Financial Services Committee holds a hearing at 10 a.m. on the Securities and Exchange Commission's budget request. Bart Chilton of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is on CNBC at 7:30 a.m.
TESLA'S BID FOR CASH FUELS DEBATE | Tesla Motors, the maker of electric cars led by Elon Musk, announced plans on Wednesday to raise approximately $830 million by selling new shares and debtlike securities. Mr. Musk personally plans to buy $100 million of shares in the offering, the company said. "The plans could raise questions about the company's ability to generate cash flows from its operations," DealBook's Peter Eavis writes. While the sentiment surrounding the company has recently been positive, "the financing announced on Wednesday could prove a pivotal development in the intense debate over Tesla's future," Mr. Eavis says. "The company's shares have risen by 150 percent this year as more investors have started to express belief that the company will make electric vehicles that people will flock to buy because they perform as well as gasoline cars. Other investors, however, remain unconvinced."

HEADLINE: With Security, Trade Center Faces New Isolation

BYLINE: DAVID W. DUNLAP


HIGHLIGHT: Planners and residents of Lower Manhattan imagined a new World Trade Center that would be integrated in the neighborhood, but now they fear that security measures will keep it isolated as ever. 

 BODY:
The wreckage had not been cleared from ground zero when planners and neighbors began imagining how the devastation of Sept. 11 could be redeemed, in some way, by a new World Trade Center, one that would be fully joined to the rest of Lower Manhattan rather than standing apart in chilling isolation.
It was a chance, they believed, to correct a painful planning error of the 1960s, when a lively, jumbled gridiron of riverfront streets, anchored by a clamorous appliance district called Radio Row, was bulldozed into oblivion to create a barren, windswept plaza whose only evident purpose was to serve as a pedestal for the twin towers.
With the blank slate offered by a catastrophic attack, planners, soon joined by the mayor himself, saw a chance to re-establish a great crossroads: Fulton and Greenwich Streets, tying the second World Trade Center into New York - north, south, east and west. 
Now, however, they see that vision slipping away, as security concerns trump urban planning.
The Police Department has proposed encircling the site with a fortified palisade of guard booths, vehicle barricades and sidewalk barriers. And neighbors and planners worry that the trade center will once again feel cut off from its surroundings, a place where security credentials prevail, traffic is unwelcome and every step is scrutinized, as at the New York Stock Exchange or 1 Police Plaza security zones.
The police plan calls for nine guard booths, each about 6 by 12 feet in area and 11 feet tall. Eight street intersections would be restricted by a double barricade system known as a sally port, from 30 to 160 feet long. The trade center site would also be bounded by bollards, the barrier posts that have cropped up around many important structures since 2001.
This appears to depart from the expansive vision for Lower Manhattan offered by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in December 2002. "We can examine innovative ways to manage streets and traffic downtown, reinforcing the feeling that this is one place," he said at the time. "Getting around easily means community, and that's what we're trying to create."
Brendan J. Sexton, former president of the Municipal Art Society and former director of the city's Office of Operations, said this month that the Police Department's security plan "appears to bend every effort to undo this connectivity, the fluidity and connectedness the neighborhood hoped it was getting back."
And Alexander Garvin, who was the vice president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation for planning, design and development from 2002 to 2003, said the planned security measures made "a complete mockery of the public participation process of 2002-2003, the design competition, and the mayor's speech of December 2002."
But the Police Department argued that the measures allow for plenty of public access. "The campus security plan will not isolate the World Trade Center from the Lower Manhattan community," said Richard C. Daddario, the deputy police commissioner for counterterrorism. In fact, he said, it would make the site a more desirable for pedestrians and bicyclists, who will be able to pass freely. That, in turn, might knit it more seamlessly into the fabric of downtown.
The security measures are described in a draft environmental impact statement that is open for public comment until Wednesday.
A key goal of the early planning of the trade center redevelopment was to recreate parts of two important thoroughfares, the east-west Fulton Street and the north-south Greenwich Street, that had been eliminated by the trade center superblock.
"Greenwich Street is not only symbolically important," Amanda M. Burden, the chairwoman of the city's Planning Commission, said in April 2002, when the first reclaimed segment was established. "It's about beginning to interconnect the totally disconnected elements of Lower Manhattan." And Mr. Bloomberg said eight months later that "re-establishing Fulton Street through the World Trade Center site would make it a thoroughfare that stretches from river to river."
Those streets have been recreated and will once again crisscross as they did 50 years ago. But under the police plan, they would be closed to through traffic at the trade center.
Vesey and Liberty Streets would also be closed to through traffic at the north and south ends of the site, as would one lane of Church Street, the eastern boundary. Only vehicles with business at the trade center would be permitted. They would undergo credential checks and inspection. Vehicles and drivers enrolled in a trusted-access program could go through faster screening.
Installation of the security measures would occur as construction progresses on the site, which may extend until 2019. The Police Department expects to share the estimated $40 million cost with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site.
Mr. Sexton recalled that what had come through most clearly in the planning process was the community's desire to restore Fulton and Greenwich Streets. "We can, with one change in municipal behavior, defeat all that design and engineering and urban planning, and vacate all that civic good will and good work," he said in a May 1 letter to Mr. Daddario.
A year ago, leaders of Community Board 1 in Lower Manhattan told police officials of their worries. "We are very concerned that the implementation of this plan will adversely affect our growing residential and business community," Michael Levine, the director of planning and land use for the board, said at the time. "We see ourselves surrounded by a 'fortresslike' environment with the creation of a security perimeter around the W.T.C. site."
This week, Mr. Levine said, "We knew our statements were falling on deaf ears."
Julie Menin, the former chairwoman of the community board, who is now running for Manhattan borough president, said the community "cannot be in complete lockdown."
Restrictions in zones that the police have established around the Stock Exchange and Police Headquarters have strangled some small businesses, she said.
Mr. Daddario disagreed with such assessments.
"Pedestrians and bicyclists will be able to enter the site and travel along its streets and sidewalks just as they can everywhere else in the city," he said in an e-mail. "Vehicles and tour buses having business at the site will have access after screening to guard against the threat of a car bomb. The booths at entry and exit points are approximately the size of existing newsstands you see about the city."
In fact, the booths may be designed to complement the newsstands, and bus shelters installed by Cemusa under a franchise from the city, thereby making them less conspicuous.
"The argument that these measures will disconnect the site from the rest of Lower Manhattan ignores the fact that people largely experience the city on foot and on bikes," Mr. Daddario said. "The measure of connectiveness should not be the volume of vehicle traffic passing through the site."
There is a school of thought that pedestrian-only zones can seem lifeless, but some planners believe that the traffic restrictions will have a positive effect on the public's experience.
"It makes the entire World Trade Center more of a pedestrian precinct than it had been in the past," said Jeff Zupan, a senior fellow of the Regional Plan Association.
Mr. Zupan did not say that guard booths, sally ports and bollard lines were ideal. But he added: "If you accept the fact that vehicles have to be checked, that's unavoidable. I'm not quite sure how to overcome that. It might be the byproduct of the fact that the World Trade Center was a place where 3,000 people died."

HEADLINE: Seeking to Engage Citizens, Athens Turns to New York for Advice

BYLINE: ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS


HIGHLIGHT: The mayor of Athens, Giorgos Kaminis, came to City Hall looking for guidance on how to give young people a sense of civic engagement while Greece&#8217;s government-debt woes continue. 

 BODY:
Could Michael R. Bloomberg save Athens?
That thought was in the air as Athens's mayor, Giorgos Kaminis, spent an hour at City Hall on Wednesday with Mayor Bloomberg's head of volunteer services, Diahann Billings-Burford. 
Traditionally, volunteerism in Greece has been carried out by rich women on behalf of the disadvantaged. During the "crisis," the Greek shorthand for the social and political turmoil caused by the nation's continuing government-debt woes, the mayor has begun searching for a new model that would engage a wider swath of citizens, particularly the young. The idea is to give young, creative people a sense of purpose and civic engagement in a country where the youth unemployment rate has soared above 60 percent and homelessness and hunger are on the rise. 
Mr. Kaminis is looking to Mr. Bloomberg, known for his philanthropic prowess, and to Ms. Billings-Burford, who has recruited thousands of New Yorkers to do everything from leading fitness classes in poor neighborhoods to preparing tax returns for guidance. 
 "We do not have at all a similar tradition of volunteerism in Greece," Amalia Zepou, the newly appointed adviser on civil society networking for Athens, told Ms. Billings-Burford, whose title is chief service officer, on Wednesday, as they sat around a table at City Hall, with this reporter allowed to sit in.
"Not that people do not do things for nothing," Ms. Zepou said. But, she continued, "With the crisis, so many new groups have popped up. Sometimes it's people with no legal profile." Some are neighborhood groups that communicate through Facebook and social media. Often, she said, they are just three or four friends trying to do something positive.
To which Ms. Billings-Burford responded, "They are the ones you want," because, "they don't come with the problems but with the solutions."
Mr. Kaminis, who ran as an independent supported by the then-ruling socialist party on his election in 2010, only hinted at the kinds of problems he wanted to tackle through volunteerism. "We want to address a problem mainly in the center of the city, of graffiti," he said.
"Tagging," Ms. Zepou clarified. 
What they did not mention was that the graffiti that has spread like a virus across Athens in recent years is not just vandalism or personal expression, it is often a political cri de coeur - decrying the government, comparing joblessness to terrorism, and the like.
Ms. Billings-Burford said that in New York, graffiti removal was not a volunteer operation. "You can call 311, and the graffiti removal crew will come," she told them. "They're not volunteer; they're paid." Conflict between volunteer and paid jobs is always a risk, she said.
But she suggested New York's "Love Your Block" program, which operates on the "broken windows" theory that a neglected block invites vandalism, but one that looks like people care does not.
Before adjourning for a private meeting with Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Kaminis wondered if Ms. Billings-Burford would like to go to Athens to help them out.
She would, she said, but only after her current boss's term ended, and not a day sooner. "He knows the days," she said.

HEADLINE: Not Heaven; Iowa: Lucas Mann Talks About 'Class A'

BYLINE: JOHN WILLIAMS


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Mann&#8217;s first book chronicles the season he spent with the Clinton LumberKings, a minor league baseball team. 

 BODY:
In his first book, "Class A: Baseball in the Middle of Everywhere," Lucas Mann chronicles the year he spent following the LumberKings, a minor league team in Clinton, Iowa, affiliated with the Seattle Mariners. In a recent e-mail interview, Mr. Mann discussed the team's fan base, the strange incentives of minor league existence and more. Below are edited excerpts from the conversation:
 Q. 
You write about Clinton, "I came here because it best fit the stereotype I was looking for." What was it you were looking for? 
 A. 
Wow, first question and I'm second-guessing my phrasing. I guess by stereotype I mean that perfect grainy image of old-timey baseball - a town nestled in cornfields next to a river, a quaint-looking stadium, fans that know each other's first names. Baseball is so steeped in nostalgia, and I loved that sensibility as a kid, even if I didn't understand it.
 Q. 
Clinton has been hit hard by economic decline, and the history of its organized labor movement mirrors that of the country as a whole. Were those features you required from whatever place you were going to write about, or were they coincidental?
 A. 
I wish I could say that I had the foresight to plan that. Really, the themes and structure grew much more out of winging it than anything else. Writing about the factory happened because of its omnipotence, the way it physically and metaphorically dwarfs the town, and feels a part of everything. Writing about Clinton's huge decades-old labor strike happened after fans kept mentioning it; it was part of the stories I was hearing, so it became part of the one I told. 
 Q. 
You got very close to a group of devoted fans, and you were only 24 at the time. Do you think your youth helped in gaining the trust of fans and players?
 A. 
A lot of the book is about reconciling my own outsider status, the balance between becoming part of a community while still being unable to avoid the fact that I was received with a certain deserved wariness. I do think that a combination of my age and my total lack of credentials gave me a unique entry point. It probably won't shock you to hear that saying, "I'm getting my M.F.A. at the University of Iowa," doesn't buy a lot of cachet in a baseball clubhouse.
 Q. 
The minor league is a place where successful players inevitably leave teams behind, often just when the teams need them most. Did you find that the sense of individuals fighting to get to the next level subverted the traditional incentives of winning and improving as a team?
 A. 
It creates an entirely unique sensibility in the clubhouse and in the stands. Everybody knows the stakes - fans want to see players win in their local uniforms, while players only find true validation when they're allowed to leave. But then it becomes about people trying to make meaning out of each season in whatever way they can. Fans balance rooting for the team with rooting for the careers of the players they've come to care about. Players try to recreate that heartening high school or college feeling of winning through teamwork, while also striving to stay extra-noticeable as individuals. I've never seen such a charged, multi-faceted sports world.
 Q. 
At Iowa you studied under John D'Agata, who has famously argued for the malleability of facts in essayistic nonfiction. I'm wondering how you feel about that issue in general and in your own work.
 A. 
John D'Agata is a friend and a mentor, and a writer that I greatly admire. I love that he is asking difficult questions, forcing conversation about the limits of truth in nonfiction. He's certainly not the first or only writer to point out that the moment we craft a narrative out of something, we've moved beyond the strict factuality of what happened. I'm not out to play around with facts in "Class A" - that's not my project. I tried to stay true to the events in people's lives, while acknowledging that this is my experience of them - and I don't agree with all of the points in [Mr. D'Agata's book] "The Lifespan of a Fact." But I do think that open discussion about the differences in people's realities, the fleeting nature of accepted truths, the shifting imperfection of fact, makes for better, more artful, more honest nonfiction. 
 Q. 
You still live in Iowa City, which is about 90 miles from Clinton. Do you get to LumberKings games these days?
 A. 
I do. Less frequently now, but in each season since 2010 I've always made it to at least a handful of games. Also, the Baseball Family, the group of fans that I got close to, meets once a month at a local restaurant in the off-season and I try to make those gatherings when I can. They're a remarkably welcoming group of people and I like seeing them. 
 Q. 
The LumberKings fail to attract much of a crowd. Near the end of the book, the Mariners extend the team's existence for three years. Is the team's status still secure? Do you see it lasting much longer?
 A. 
I do think the team will last. It's very well run, and one aspect of the LumberKings that fascinated me while researching is that they are community owned, a rarity. Shareholders are almost entirely local residents, and shares are often passed down through generations. Nobody makes much of a profit, so that's not the motivation. From what I've been told, shareholders have turned down a lot of pretty lucrative buyout offers over the years from groups that wanted to move the team to a bigger city, so the town is actively holding onto its place in the minors. 
I know it's hard for the players when they go to away games in bigger cities like Dayton and see sellout crowds of seven or eight thousand. To my mind, though, it's a testament to the loyalty of Clinton fans and the success of the team that they can regularly get an attendance of 1,000 in a town of 26,000. That's a huge percentage.
 Q. 
Do you have another project lined up, and will it be immersive nonfiction in this vein?
 A. 
I have a couple of projects going at the moment. The first I've been working on forever and was researching long before I started "Class A." It's about my older half-brother, who died of a heroin overdose when I was a teenager. References to him and his legacy pop up at times in "Class A," but this other book focuses specifically on trying to find meaning in his life and death. It's my take on a more conventional memoir - I interview a lot of people who knew him in a lot of different ways, and try to reconstruct and make sense of the life and death of an addict.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Rate Falls to Lowest Level in Over Four Years

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: A surge in hiring offset continued weakness on Wall Street, according to a report from the State Labor Department. 

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate plunged in April to 8.4 percent, its lowest level in more than four years, as widespread hiring easily offset continued weakness on Wall Street, the State Labor Department reported on Thursday. 
The city's unemployment rate was down half a percentage point from 8.9 percent in March and a full point from April 2012. The last time the city's rate was as low was in March 2009. 
Private-sector employment in the city rose in the month by about 35,100, or more than three times as many jobs as have been added, on average, in April over the past decade, the Labor Department said. The city has added 275,200 jobs since the low point of the recession in November 2009, a gain of 7.5 percent.
The biggest gains have come in professional and business services and in the health and education fields. The biggest losses in the past year were in finance and government jobs.
The surge in hiring reversed a recent decline in the city's job market in comparison to the rest of the nation. Over the past year, the number of private sector jobs in the city has grown by 2.5 percent, while the national job count has risen by 2 percent.
Statewide, the unemployment rate is 7.8 percent, down from 8.2 percent in March. The national unemployment rate in April was 7.5 percent.

HEADLINE: A New Spanish Language Consumer Finance Site

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: The Consumer Protection Finance Bureau has created a Spanish language Web site. 

 BODY:
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has created a Spanish language Web site, joining a growing list of online resources for Spanish-speaking consumers. 
Latinos were especially hard hit by the financial crisis and are often the targets of financial scams, according to the bureau. So they may benefit from access to clear information about financial services. They are also more likely not to use a regular bank and to use alternative financial products like money transfers and payday loans.
About 37 million people speak primarily Spanish at home, the bureau said, citing United States Census data, and nearly half do not speak English well.
The site, CFPB en Español, is optimized for mobile use. Roughly two-thirds of Latinos who are online tend to go online using a mobile device, the bureau's director, Richard Cordray, said in prepared remarks about the new site.
The site allows users to submit consumer complaints and offers answers to 250 common consumer questions on topics like paying for college, owning a home and sending money to another country.
Other consumer-oriented finance sites have also added Spanish-language versions of their Web sites. The creator of the FICO score, for instance, the credit score used by most banks and lenders to gauge a consumer's creditworthiness, last year created a Spanish version of its "myFico" Web site for consumers.
Do you find the bureau's Spanish-language Web site useful?

HEADLINE: Wheelies: The Return of Honda Edition

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Honda returns to Formula One, Fiat ponders a move to Detroit and Kanye&#8217;s Lamborghini gets into a Kardashian scrape. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Honda will re-enter the world of Formula One racing for the first time since 2008, the company announced Thursday. In an echo of the Honda's storied partnership with McLaren from 1988-92, the Japanese automaker said it would supply engines for McLaren's racecars beginning in 2015. Formula One is slated to introduce turbocharged 1.6-liter V-6 engines into the series next year; Honda's version of the engine is in the works. (The Telegraph) 
 Can you imagine a world where Fiat has its headquarters in New York instead of Turin? Fiat is mulling over the possibility as it plans a full merger with Chrysler, according to Automotive News. The move would be a big shift, both symbolically and politically, for the Italian company, which has been headquartered in Turin since its founding in 1899. Italian lawmakers, who are grappling with a financial crisis and facing nearly 12 percent unemployment, would undoubtedly oppose such a move. But Fiat must first buy the remaining 41.5 percent of Chrysler still owned by the United Auto Workers retiree health care fund. The price for such a buyout is currently being disputed in court.

 Crossovers are all the rage these days, and Volvo is set to release a new one of its own. There has been no official word as to whether it will resemble a V40 Cross Country, an XC60 or neither, but Volvo has been showing teaser commercials (such as the one above) to boost anticipation for the model, set to be revealed Friday afternoon. None of the spots shows a car; instead, each features a member of the band Swedish House Mafia in a contemplative coastal setting. (Autoblog)
 According to TMZ, Kanye West's Lamborghini Aventador had a run-in with the gates at Kim Kardashian's mansion this week. The celebrity news blog reported that Mr. West had ordered the Lamborghini delivered to Ms. Kardashian's home in Los Angeles after having the car serviced. The gates closed on the Lamborghini as it entered the driveway; the car has since been returned to a repair shop. (TMZ)

HEADLINE: Regulators Overhaul Derivatives Market, but With a Caveat

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The C.F.T.C. pushed the risky trading into the light of trading platforms, but effectively empowered a handful of select banks to continue controlling the derivative market. 

 BODY:
Federal regulators approved new rules on Thursday to shine a light on Wall Street trading, but they also softened a crucial aspect of the plan in the face of lobbying pressure from the nation's biggest banks.
In a long-awaited vote to tackle an essential cause of the 2008 financial crisis, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission voted to adopt an overhaul of the derivatives market, pushing the risky trading from the shadows of Wall Street into the light of trading platforms. For decades, such trading has eluded regulators and the public.
"This is a paradigm shift for the American markets," Gary Gensler, the chairman of the commission, said at the meeting. "When light shines on a market, the economy and public benefit." 
Yet, in the fine print, the agency also effectively empowered a handful of select banks to continue controlling the $700 trillion derivatives market.
Just five banks hold more than 90 percent of all derivatives contracts, which allow companies to either speculate in the markets or protect against risk. This tight grip came under fire amid concerns that those banks overcharge some companies for derivatives and pose a systemic risk to the economy. Derivatives, for example, pushed the insurer American International Group to the brink of collapse before it was rescued by the government.
In the wake of the crisis, the commission initially planned to require hedge funds, asset managers and other corporations to contact at least five banks when seeking a price for a derivatives contract. The proposed requirement was intended to bolster competition among the banks. 
Under pressure from the banks - and some firms that buy derivatives - the agency agreed to lower the requirement to two banks. In about 15 months, the standard will automatically rise to three banks, but the agency agreed to produce a study that could undermine that broader standard.
The move was the product of a compromise among the agency's five commissioners, who voted 4 to 1 in favor of the plan. Mr. Gensler, a Democrat, pushed for the higher standard. So did Bart Chilton, a fellow Democrat and frequent critic of financial risk-taking. But their plan met opposition from the Republican commissioners, and from Mark P. Wetjen, a Democrat who has sided with Wall Street on other rules.
Mr. Wetjen argued that five price quotes was an arbitrary number. He pushed for the two-bank plan, arguably the minimum required under Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, the law that mandated an overhaul of derivatives.
Even that compromise failed to please Wall Street. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the industry's main lobbying group, said in a statement that the rules "impair market liquidity at the expense of all market participants." 
But consumer advocates, and even some regulators, have questioned whether the agency ceded too much ground. In the futures market, regulators note, a request for a price quote must be broadcast to the entire market.
"I've never been a more reluctant and reticent regulator than today on these rules," Mr. Chilton said at the meeting. "I just wish we had reached a different compromise."
Mr. Chilton joined Mr. Gensler in supporting the measure. Mr. Wetjen, who said that the more flexible plan "is not code for status quo as some might suggest," also voted for the plan. 
Jill E. Sommers, a Republican commissioner, cast the lone vote against the proposal. 
In some ways, the compromise overshadowed the broader magnitude of the agency's effort.
Under the adopted plan, many types of derivatives that have traded exclusively in private must now shift to a regulated trading platform. The platforms, known as swap execution facilities, will open a rare window into the secretive world of derivatives trading and serve as a check on risky activity.
In another rule, adopted in a 3-to-2 vote on Thursday, the agency required that large swaths of derivatives trades enter a swap execution facility. The rule captured more derivatives than the financial industry had hoped.
"No longer will this be a closed door market," Mr. Gensler said.
Mr. Chilton was not satisfied. Before casting his vote for the plan, he said, "I'm still holding my nose and biting my tongue."

HEADLINE: Can Obama Save Turkey From a Syrian Quagmire?

BYLINE: By SONER CAGAPTAY and JAMES F. JEFFREY. 
Soner Cagaptay, the author of the forthcoming book ''The Rise of Turkey: The 21st Century's First Muslim Power,'' is director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, where James F. Jeffrey, a former United States ambassador to Turkey and Iraq, is a distinguished visiting fellow.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- WHEN Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, met President Obama at the White House on Thursday, the most pressing topic was the war in Syria. Turkey has not faced a threat on this scale since Stalin demanded territory from the Turks in 1945.
In 2011, the Turkish government severed all diplomatic ties with the government of Bashar al-Assad and began to support the Syrian opposition groups seeking to oust him. But, thus far, this policy has failed, and it has exposed Turkey to growing risks, most recently two deadly bomb attacks in the Turkish border town of Reyhanli that were most likely planted by pro-Assad forces in retaliation for Turkish support of the Syrian rebels. 
Turkey's blessing over the past decade has been its reputation as a stable country in an otherwise unstable region. In November 2012, the global ratings agency Fitch rated Turkish bonds investment-grade for the first time since 1994. The country's improved international reputation has alleviated a chronic economic problem: lack of capital. A steady infusion of foreign investment for over a decade has ushered in phenomenal growth, at some points exceeding 8 percent annually, and propelled Turkey into the Group of 20 industrialized nations.
Turkey has become a majority middle-class society for the first time in its history, helping Mr. Erdogan's Justice and Development Party win three successive elections since 2002.
But the war in Syria threatens these gains, and Mr. Erdogan's political future. Turkey will not be immune to the fallout from a Somalia-style failed state next door -- or from a rump Assad regime seeking revenge against Turkey for supporting the rebels. Turkey grows because it attracts international investment; and Turkey attracts investment because it is deemed stable. A spillover of the mess in Syria risks ending the country's economic miracle.
Turkey has a community of over 500,000 Arab Alawites, whose ethnic kin in Syria have, with few exceptions, supported the Assad regime against the Sunni-led rebels. This sectarian conflict threatens to seep across the border into Turkey, pitting Syrian rebel fighters and Sunni Turks against pro-Assad Alawites, especially in the country's southernmost province, Hatay, where the Alawite community is concentrated. There is also a risk of chemical weapons' being deployed and spreading toxic agents over Turkish territory; and the proximity of Qaeda fighters in Syria poses a serious threat to Turkey's vaunted stability.
The Syrian war has also awakened Turkey's once dormant Marxist militant groups. These groups vehemently oppose any government policies they see as serving American imperialist interests and have already launched a number of attacks, including one at the United States Embassy in Ankara on Feb. 2. Turkish media reports that these Marxist groups, in cooperation with elements of Mr. Assad's regime, may have been behind the May 11 attack that killed 51 people in Reyhanli.
This is bad news for Mr. Erdogan's bid to remake the Turkish political system with a strong French-style presidency. Mr. Erdogan has aligned all the domestic political stars to be elected president in 2014. He has even made peace with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or the P.K.K., a move that would have been an unthinkable taboo just a few years ago. By entering a peace process with the P.K.K.'s reviled leader, the imprisoned Abdullah Ocalan, Mr. Erdogan has effectively ensured the country's domestic stability in the run-up to 2014 and secured himself at least some Kurdish support. Yet an economic downturn brought on by the war in Syria could upset his plans.
Mr. Erdogan is aware that unless he secures greater American assistance against the Assad regime, Turkey could become the big loser in Syria, and Mr. Erdogan the big loser at the ballot box if he can't cobble together an absolute majority in 2014. This is also bad news for the United States, which sees Turkey as one of the few stable, strong pillars of Western values in the region.
Turkey's government believes that unless the balance of power in Syria is tilted in favor of the rebels now, the Syrian conflict will turn into an interminable sectarian civil war that pulls Hatay Province, and with it the rest of Turkey, into turmoil.
Only Washington can change the equation. Following the May 16 summit meeting between Mr. Obama and Mr. Erdogan, two options seem to be on the table.
The infusion of American power, by arming the rebels or enforcing a no-fly zone, would change the military and regional dynamic and help unite the often squabbling ''Friends of Syria'' behind American leadership. Only direct American military engagement will rally the disparate parties that want to act against Mr. Assad into unified action.
The wars in Kuwait and Bosnia are cases in point in proving the value of American leadership. It would tilt the balance of power in favor of the rebels and provide diplomatic cover for Turkey as it faces the wrath of Iran and Russia. By presenting Moscow with a counter-incentive, threatening to act alone if Moscow does not use its influence to bring an end to the conflict, the United States could demonstrate that it is serious about engagement. This would also lighten the pressure on Turkey, which is hesitant to take further steps in Syria without at least tacit Russian consent. Russia is Turkey's historic nemesis and the only country in the region with an economy and military larger than Turkey's. The Turks fear the Russians and will not confront them alone.
If convincing the Russians proves impossible, Washington should consider creating a buffer zone in northern Syria along the Turkish border to protect rebel-captured areas. A buffer zone, protected by American airpower and an international coalition, would endow the rebels with a staging ground from which to launch operations against Mr. Assad and it would also help Turkey push the conflict back into Syria by transferring rebels and their headquarters into the buffer zones on Syrian territory rather than offering sanctuary to militants on Turkish soil. (There would most likely be regional support for such a policy, including from Jordan, which would also benefit from a buffer zone inside southern Syria.)
More decisive American engagement would simultaneously end doubts about the United States' commitment to Syria and save Turkey from being pulled further into a conflict that threatens to squander its progress toward resolving the Kurdish conflict and undermine its impressive economic achievements.

Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Artist and Visionary: William Matthew Prior Revealed' (through May 26) William Matthew Prior (1806-73), the subject of this fascinating exhibition, painted portraits in the ''American primitive'' mode. His paintings of solemn, pie-faced tots, stiffly posed yet animated by some inner mystery, are especially compelling. But he had the chops to paint like a well-trained academician too. He was also an abolitionist who, at some risk to his reputation, painted portraits of black people; they are among his best works. He was also into spiritualism, and he was a savvy entrepreneur. He was, altogether, a most remarkable character. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
&#x2605; Asia Society: 'The Artful Recluse: Painting, Poetry, and Politics in 17th-Century China' (through June 2) With the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644, China's intellectual elite, many of them artists who worked in the imperial government, were thrown into a tailspin. Confucian ethics demanded filial devotion to the old regime. But how were they to demonstrate it? One way was to remove themselves from active life and signal their resistance through art. How they did so is the subject of this compellingly fine-grained painting show. Some artists sacrificed their lives for principles; others used recluse status as a career move. The emotional weight, psychological depth, and intellectual complexity of the work of this time is what comes through here. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Fine Lines: American Drawings From the Brooklyn Museum' (through May 26) Although marred by the tone-deaf exhibition design usual to this museum, the first large display of American drawings from its collection spans over 150 years with more than 100 sheets and six sketchbooks. Well-known artists like Winslow Homer, Ralph Blakelock and Louise Nevelson are well represented, but less familiar figures like Joseph Frank Currier, Louis Bouché and Chaim Gross contribute equally to its excellence. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
Brooklyn Museum: 'LaToya Ruby Frazier: A Haunted Capital' (through Aug. 11) This preternaturally mature body of work by a 31-year-old photographer connects bedrooms and streetscapes, the suffering of loved ones and the afflictions of a ''distressed municipality'' (the state's official term for Ms. Frazier's hometown, Braddock, Pa.). Simultaneously introspective and extroverted, it's composed of arresting black-and-white photographs that sometimes look like studio portraits or social documentaries but aren't fully at home in either category. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'John Singer Sargent Watercolors' (through July 28) Sargent fans and watercolor hobbyists will be in heaven with this exhibition's more than 90 watercolors from the first decade of the 20th century, all from the collections of the Brooklyn Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and all representing picturesque scenes in Europe. Sargent pioneered the kind of loosely gestural yet clearly representational watercolor painting that today's popular culture adores. He has his detractors, though, who may profit from re-examining their prejudices in light of this beautiful show. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Gravity and Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui' (through Aug. 4) Born in Ghana and long a resident of Nigeria where he maintains a productive studio, El Anatsui has for the past decade been creating spectacularly large, fabric-like sculpture from countless numbers of liquor-bottle caps linked together with twists of copper. The work weaves together ideas about colonialism, politics and economics, and is absolutely gorgeous. The Brooklyn show, which originated at the Akron Art Museum in Ohio, also includes a number of the artist's earlier and now-overlooked carved wood pieces, which are well worth studying. 200 Eastern Parkway, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'The Hugo Boss Prize 2012: Danh Vo' (through May 27) Known mostly for attenuated, elliptical works, this year's Hugo Boss recipient opts for density and robustness with a display of some 4,000 items that once belonged to the artist Martin Wong (1946-99). Installed wonder-cabinet style in a shelf-lined gallery, the items range from art to artifact to trinkets; leap across cultures; and trickle from high to low, where racial stereotypes and kitsch frequently take over. It gives us an artist who has decided to function as a curator and an archaeologist and to keep the honor of his prize in motion. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Japan Society: 'Edo Pop: The Graphic Impact of Japanese Prints' (through June 9) Contemporary provocateurs could learn a thing or two from the venerable artists in ''Edo Pop,'' who mixed high and low culture in arch and urbane ways. In this show's 100 or so ukiyo-e, or color woodblock prints (drawn from the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts), valiant samurai turn out to be Kabuki actors in costume; refined landscapes depict well-trodden tourist sites; and images of classical beauties accompanied by poems are more often than not portraits of courtesans. These spirited images bring to life Edo Japan's ''floating world,'' a sort of Renaissance of popular entertainment. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Jewish Museum: 'As it were ... So to speak: A Museum Collection in Dialogue With Barbara Bloom' (through Aug. 4) Ms. Bloom, invited to organize a show from elements of the museum's collection, has turned to the Talmud for inspiration. Weaving together real and fictional narratives, historical and literary sources, she creates new and often ambiguous contexts for ceremonial and decorative objects like Torah pointers, Kiddush cups and spice containers. Somehow she manages to quote Nietzsche, Freud, Leonard Cohen, Joan Didion, the Bible and various Wikipedia entries, all without losing her own probing, skeptical voice. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through Sept. 2) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors.

&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'James Nares: Street' (through May 27) Far from pedestrian, this show revolves around a ravishing, 61-minute video projection by the artist James Nares. Called ''Street,'' it consists of long, slow-motion pans of people going about their business on the sidewalks and streets of New York City. To go with it, Mr. Nares combed through the museum's permanent collection and came up with a fascinating array of thematically related photographs, prints, paintings and drawings having largely to do with human and vehicular traffic.

Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Photography and the American Civil War' (through Sept. 2) As intellectually fascinating as it is emotionally wrenching, this exhibition is sure to be remembered as one of the great museum photography shows ever. Its more than 200 photographs include expansive images of battlefields and war-ruined towns; wallet-size portraits of soldiers; preciously framed daguerreotypes; political campaign buttons; a doctor's documents of horrifically wounded soldiers; portraits of loved ones in lockets; and a series depicting the hanging of five co-conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by the photographer Alexander Gardner. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Punk: Chaos to Couture' (through Aug. 14) This entertaining exhibition proves that high fashion rarely looks quite as frivolous and cluelessly 1 percent-ish as when it upgrades aspects of the obstreperous punk sartorial mode, adding gold-plated safety pins, careful rips and holes, and a feigned DIY look that can involve materials like garbage bags or cellophane. Cleverness abounds. A few designers absorb and transform punk attributes, but most garments simplistically scream punk. Not for nothing do they call the show's organizing department the Costume Institute. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Velázquez's Portrait of Duke Francesco I d'Este: A Masterpiece from the Galleria Estense, Modena' (through July 14) This single-painting exhibition highlights a portrait made at a delicate diplomatic moment during the Thirty Years' War; the painting is on loan to the Met in part because the museum that normally houses it, the Galleria Estense in Modena, is repairing damage from a 2012 earthquake in the region. It's a chance to see another commanding Velázquez at this already well-stocked museum, and to appreciate that this artist's politically savvy portraits are more than just tools of statesmanship. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'At War With the Obvious: Photographs by William Eggleston' (through July 28) In 36 transcendentally beautiful photographs shot in the Mississippi Delta region in the 1970s and early '80s, this pioneer of color photography captured those kinds of sacred moments when something you ordinarily would pass by without a thought -- a children's swing set overgrown by weeds, an abandoned gas station, a basket of fake flowers hanging on someone's front door -- suddenly takes your breath away. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Cambodian Rattan: The Sculptures of Sopheap Pich' (through July 7) Born in Cambodia in 1971, Soheap Pich first came to international attention in 2009 with a series of openwork, basketlike rattan sculptures that looked as light as air, but carried serious ideas in images of half-built cities, viscera, flowers and bombs. His impressive Met show is embedded in the permanent Asian collection. It starts outside the Chinese painting galleries, continues in mezzanine space usually devoted to South Asian material, and concludes in the galleries of Southeast Asian art with a gorgeous suspended Buddha. (An exhibition of new work is on view through June 14 at Tyler Rollins Fine Art, 529 West 20th Street, in Chelsea.) (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Impressionism, Fashion and Modernity' (through May 27) The title may suggest a double-dose of pandering, but the show itself is a stunning combination of great paintings, ravishing gowns, historical clarity and pitch-perfect contextualizing. Demonstrating how the Impressionists and more conservative painters alike used the latest fashions to define their sitters as real people, it builds fascinating webs of new information and viewpoints around some of the best-known, most beloved paintings of all time, quite a few of which don't often travel to this country. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Subliming Vessel: The Drawings of Matthew Barney' (through Sept. 2) With its Gospels and reliquaries, the Morgan Library is at the right place for the first survey of graphic work by the most medievalizing of American contemporary artists. Encased in thick, pale, plastic frames, Mr. Barney's drawings of the past two decades have the look of precious pages from sacred books displayed on iPads. His images, with their emphasis on redemption through fleshly mortification, suggest sources in heroic epics and penitential religion, filtered through Sade and extreme sports. A display of collagelike storyboards for his films confirms the occult glamour of the personal cosmology he has developed, which feels as artificial and addictive as a video game. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Claes Oldenburg: The Street and the Store' and 'Claes Oldenburg: Mouse Museum, Ray Gun Wing' (through Aug. 5) Pop Art is based on two things: ordinariness and eating. It's about daily consumption; the democratic appetite, ravenous for meat, sweets, life on the street, and getting more of everything, cheap. No artist cooked up a tastier version of the primal Pop recipe than Claes Oldenburg did in New York in the late 1950s and early '60s. The art he made in that brief, fecund time is the focus of a two-meals-for-the-price-of-one MoMA feast. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Bill Brandt: Shadow and Light' (through Aug. 12) With nearly 160 works ranging from photographs of London in the 1930s and during World War II to nearly abstract Surrealist nudes from the 1950s and '60s, this impeccable survey makes a strong if slightly over-edited argument for Brandt as one of the founders of modern photography. It sticks to vintage prints and brings a wonderful lucidity to a persistent balance of art and humanity that is, as it is frequently described: strange, mysterious and irresistible. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through Aug. 5) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera.

New Museum: 'Adhocracy' (through July 7) The term ''adhocracy'' was coined by the futurologist Alvin Toffler, who predicted that innovative, ad hoc forms of organization would replace more bureaucratically entrenched structures in business and government. This crowded design exhibition presents a variety of self-empowering things that people can make and do for themselves like build their own furniture and bicycles; make new appliances from functional parts of old, broken ones; raise money for bigger projects by means of Kickstarter; and, more problematically, make their own functional handguns using 3-D printers. 231 Bowery, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; New Museum: 'NYC 1993: Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star' (through May 26) History is written by the winners, which in contemporary art usually means the market. It's often also written by people who weren't on the scene and have to take the winners' word for what happened and what mattered. Such is the case with this retrospective show that too often favors the currently best-selling survivors of a fraught era over many now less well-known on-the-ground players. There's good art here, but the spirit of a furiously skeptical utopian moment -- very high, very low -- rarely breaks through the institutional nostalgia. And the chance to probe some market myths -- exactly how political was that 1993 ''political'' Whitney Biennial? -- is lost. Like all surveys of the immediate past, ''NYC 1993'' will get everyone kvetching, and it's a must-see, if only to find ways to bring the story into the present differently. Nari Ward's 1993 installation ''Amazing Grace'' in the New Museum's next-door space is for the ages. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum: 'Jay DeFeo: A Retrospective' (through June 2) The American artist DeFeo, who died in 1989 at 60, is famous for a single work, a gargantuan painting -- nearly 12 feet tall -- called ''The Rose,'' which she labored on exhaustingly for eight years, even after it had been extracted out of her San Francisco studio with a forklift. In the absence of other evidence, many people tend to see the piece as the sum of her accomplishment, but to this view the Whitney's tenderly shaped and visually absorbing survey says: No. There's more, and different. ''The Rose'' may have been the pivotal point of her career -- DeFeo herself said as much -- but streams of inventive, if less spectacular, work flowed toward it and from it.

'The Pop Object: The Still Life Tradition in Pop Art' (through next Friday) Pop's debt to traditional still life is nothing new, but it is explicated here with some less than usual suspects like Marjorie Strider, Jann Haworth and Robert Arneson, and a handful of unfamiliar, rarely exhibited or outstanding works. These include Marisol Escobar's carved, painted and drawn portrait of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein's dour yet chic 1961 ''Black Flowers,'' a tour de force that merges painting, drawing and commercial printing and justifies the whole show.

'Salvaging the Past: Georges Hoentschel and French Decorative Arts from The Metropolitan Museum of Art' (through Aug. 11) This sometimes arcane but highly effective assemblage of rare furnishings, artifacts and a smattering of art and printed matter resurrects a once-renowned French interior designer whose collections -- and displays -- of 18th-century French decorative material and Medieval art were purchased en bloc by J.P.Morgan and given to the Met. They formed the nuclei of the museum's holdings in these areas, helped shape its departmental structure and influenced the arrangement of its galleries in numerous ways.

&#x2605; Richard Serra: 'Early Work' (through June 15) This terrific exhibition looks back on five formative years in the career of the world's most admired sculptor. One room contains objects made of lead, rubber, wood and stone produced by basic procedures like cutting, folding and tearing. A second gallery features works made by propping up four-by-four-foot lead panels and a single slab of hot-rolled steel, eight feet tall and 24 feet long, that juts from a corner into the room with grand implacability.

Sara VanDerBeek (through June 8) With two glamorous installations of photographs and minimalist sculptures, Ms. VanDerBeek contributes to the Postmodern endgame tradition of art reflecting on itself. In the biggest gallery four white columns reflected in mirror glass covering large, abstract, vaguely cosmic photographs call to mind the pillar of salt that Lot's wife turned into when, contrary to divine command, looked back to the corrupt city of Sodom.

Giosetta Fioroni: 'L'Argento' (through June 2) This first American survey of Giosetta Fioroni reveals that we still have much to learn about postwar Italian art, despite recent gallery exhibitions of Lucio Fontana, Piero Manzoni, Giorgio Griffa, Gianni Colombo and Luigi Ghirri and museum shows of Michelangelo Pistoletto and Alighiero Boetti. In the silvery, evanescent paintings, drawings and films of Ms. Fioroni, who was born in Rome in 1932, we see how American Pop's celebrities and commodities took on new meanings in a post-fascist society.

Jane Alexander: 'Surveys (From the Cape of Good Hope)' (through July 29) The Cathedral of St. John the Divine is an occupied zone this spring, with a transient population of unearthly beings camped out in its chapels and aisles. Neither angels nor devils, though suggesting both, the figures in the sculptural tableaus and related photographs were all created by the South African artist Jane Alexander. And while haunted by her country's history of apartheid, the work has no single meaning, no sum-upable content. Instead, painstakingly calibrated ambiguity leaves this strange and wonderful show open to political speculation and spiritual interpretation.

&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info.

'Albrecht Dürer: Master Drawings, Watercolors, and Prints from the Albertina' (through June 9) Albrecht Dürer had it all: the eye of a Raphael, the brains of a Leonardo, the looks of a cleaned-up Kurt Cobain. Traditionally, the category of great artist implies great painter, and Dürer was that, though there's reason to think that he was at his most inventive, involved and expansive in his works on paper. Evidence for that argument is in this startlingly generous loan exhibition of more than 100 works on paper that includes some of his best known images. National Gallery of Art, on the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
Montclair Art Museum: 'The New Spirit: American Art in the Armory Show, 1913' (through June 16) The Armory Show opened 100 years ago in Manhattan, introducing to Americans the shocking works of van Gogh, Cézanne, Picasso, Matisse and Duchamp and other European avant-gardists along with less adventurous efforts by hundreds of home-grown artists. This much more modest, centennial show presents a selection of works by artists who were included, most of them Americans. Paintings by Edward Hopper, Marsden Hartley and John Sloan stand out, but a small, vibrant pastoral scene by Matisse shows how far behind the avant-garde curve the Americans lagged. 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 746-5555, montclairartmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Montclair Art Museum: 'Oscar Bluemner's America: Picturing Paterson, New Jersey' (through June 16) This lovely, small show presents works dating from 1910 to 1917 when the American Modernist Bluemner was catching up on European avant-garde developments. He combined realism and Cubism in paintings of farm buildings in rural landscapes and the industrial architecture of Paterson, his hometown. Favoring glowing reds and blues and opaque blacks, he painted images that seem illuminated from within like modern stained-glass windows. 3 South Mountain Avenue, Montclair, N.J., (973) 746-5555, montclairartmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Great and Mighty Things: Outsider Art From the Jill and Sheldon Bonovitz Collection' (through June 9) One good turn generates another: the gift of a beloved, finely calibrated collection of American outsider art to a major encyclopedic museum is celebrated with an equally excellent exhibition of same. It displays around 200 paintings, sculptures, drawings and assemblages, made mostly from the 1930s to the '80s by 27 outsiders, both renowned and less prominent. All are seen here at or close to their best, pressing against the increasingly unjustifiable division between outsider and inside. 2600 Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Philadelphia, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org.

&#x2605; Smithsonian American Art Museum: 'Nam June Paik: Global Visionary' (through Aug. 11) Including a large and fascinating trove of material from the Nam June Paik archive, acquired by the Smithsonian from the artist's estate in 2009, this survey of the avant-garde musician, multimedia wizard and video art pioneer (1932-2006) looks startlingly current despite the preponderance of analog televisions and other obsolete hardware. It makes clear that contemporary artists like Christian Marclay, Jon Kessler, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin and Haroon Mirza owe a great deal to Mr. Paik's tweaked TV sets and frenetic, technically innovative videos.

Last Chance
&#x2605; Benny Andrews: 'There Must Be a Heaven' (closes on Saturday) Working in combinations of allegory and genre, Benny Andrews (1930-2006) took the politics of African-American life as his subject, in figurative paintings that were often also sculptural reliefs, with three dimensional elements built up from collagelike layers of recycled cloth. Stylistically, the work had virtually nothing to do with mainstream styles of the day; in content it was always of its time. The 36 pictures at Michael Rosenfeld Gallery span his career, which is due for reappraisal. 100 11th Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 247-0082, michaelrosenfeldart.com. (Cotter)
The Frick Collection: 'Piero della Francesca in America' (closes on Sunday) Reuniting six panels from an altarpiece by Piero, this ravishing show approximates an intimate quattrocento chapel in the Frick's grand Oval Room. At the center of the installation is a seventh painting, the Clark Art Institute's ''Virgin and Child Enthroned With Four Angels,'' which comes from a different altarpiece in the painter's hometown, Sansepolcro, and exemplifies Piero's uncanny orchestration of figures, architecture and religious symbolism. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
Mary Grigoriadis: 'Strokescapes: 1970s-1980s' (closes on Saturday) This splendid little exhibition showcases early warning signs of the Pattern and Decoration movement of the early 1970s, which signaled that American painting could be other than abstract and minimal. Their bright symmetrical designs draw on a host of multicultural sources while exploring still-current concerns with the materials and methods of paintings. They are seen here with later, more free-form and spatially active paintings from the 1980s, forming a group that packs a visual punch.

&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'No Country: Contemporary Art for South and Southeast Asia' (closes on Wednesday) American museums are increasingly collecting contemporary art from outside the Western Hemisphere, and the Guggenheim, supported by the financial corporation UBS, is leading the pack. This inaugural show in the acquisitions campaign highlights work from South and Southeast Asia. Certain artists -- like Amar Kanwar, from India, and Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook, from Thailand -- have international reputations. Others, like the sculptor Tang Da Wu, from Singapore, and the painter Aung Myint, from Myanmar, both born in the 1940s, are less familiar. Nearly all the work of the roughly two dozen artists refers in partisan, political and personal ways to specific histories. The inclusion of those histories in our art museums is long, long overdue. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter)
Peter Piller: 'Umschläge' (closes on Saturday) This metaphorically charged installation of photographic works could be titled ''Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.'' Colored diptychs copied from an East German military magazine picture an attractive woman on one side and some kind of impressive military weaponry like tanks, cannons and rockets on the other. Grainy black-and-white photographs of ocean waves and devastated World War I battlefields expand the mythic implications. Andrew Kreps, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-8849, andrewkreps.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; 'Poetics and Politics' (closes on Friday) The final installment of the Walther Collection's three-part series of shows titled ''Distance and Desire: Encounters With the African Archive'' is a must-see survey of portraits, landscapes and ethnographic photographs shot in Africa from the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Much of what is both beautiful and ethically suspect about photography as a medium is embodied in a show organized by the art historian Tamar Garb and accompanied by an impressive book.

'Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Art and Design, 1848-1900' (closes on Sunday) A large and well-done survey of paintings, drawings, books, furnishings, textiles and even stained glass includes such classics as John Everett Millais's ''Ophelia'' and Henry Wallis's ''Chatterton.'' It also enables a clear assessment of England's ever-popular mid-19th-century art movement, whose legacy is fittingly full of contradictions. Using brazenly modern colors, the brotherhood nonetheless turned toward the past, fashioning a nostalgic, literary, costume-heavy, clichéd style that demeaned women. The best works here are the landscapes, which are unfortunately in short supply. National Gallery of Art, on the National Mall between Third and Seventh Streets NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Smith)
Kathy Ruttenberg: 'Nature of the Beast' (closes on Saturday) Combining human figures with the flora and fauna of the natural world, this artist's ambitious ceramic sculptures make her a force to contend with as a narrator and symbolist, a form maker and colorist. In her pieces woodland scenes unfold across skirts; flowers or trees sprout from heads; and sexual tensions are coated with a storybook innocence. Human companionship may be hard to sustain, but, like it or not, we are one with nature. Stux Gallery, 530 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-1600, stuxgallery.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; 'Shangaa: Art of Tanzania' (closes on Sunday) ''Shangaa'' is the Swahili word for ''awesome,'' and that's what this extraordinary exhibition is. A pair of seven-foot-tall Sukuma guardian figures staring down gravely at whoever approaches; a five-inch-long Chagga ceramic female form nestled, like an infant, in a banana-leaf cradle; a row of beaded Tabwa masks, this show offers a sensational array of images of a kind all but absent from our big museums, which have consistently neglected art from East Africa. Organized by the art historian Gary Van Wyk, the exhibition would do any of those larger institutions proud. It looks terrific in one of the city's most attractive small museums, set on the bucolic campus -- once a golf club -- of Queensborough Community College, a branch of the City University of New York.

HEADLINE: Race, War and the Birth of an Unlikely Romance

BYLINE: By ALEXIS CLARK

 BODY:
The nurse and the soldier may never have met -- and eventually married -- had it not been for the American government's mistreatment of black women during World War II.
Elinor Elizabeth Powell was an African-American military nurse. Frederick Albert was a German prisoner of war. Their paths crossed in Arizona in 1944. It was a time when the Army was resisting enlisting black nurses and the relatively small number allowed entry tended to be assigned to the least desirable duties.
''They decided they were going to use African-Americans but in very small numbers and in segregated locations,'' said Charissa Threat, a history professor at Northeastern University who teaches race and gender studies. 
Ms. Powell was born in 1921 in Milton, Mass., and in, 1944, after completing basic training at Fort Huachuca, Ariz., she was sent, as some other black nurses were, to tend to German prisoners of war in Florence, Ariz.
''I know the story of how they met,'' said Chris Albert, 59, the youngest son of Elinor and Frederick Albert. ''It was in the officers' mess hall, and my father was working in the kitchen. He kind of boldly made his way straight for my mother and said: 'You should know my name. I'm the man who's going to marry you.'''
Frederick Karl Albert was born in 1925 in Oppeln, Germany. ''He volunteered for the paratroops to impress his father, who served in WWI,'' Mr. Albert said. ''His father was an engineer and not really interested in his children. My dad ended up getting captured in Italy.''
He joined many other German prisoners who were detained in camps across the United States. With millions of American men away in combat or basic training, P.O.W.'s became a solution to the labor shortage. ''Under the Geneva Convention, enlisted criminals of war could work for the detaining power,'' said Matthias Reiss, a professor at the University of Exeter, in England, who has researched the history of German P.O.W.'s. ''So the idea was, bring them over to America and let them do the unskilled work.''
In the camp in Arizona, Frederick Albert worked in the kitchen, where he prepared special meals for Elinor. A romance between the two blossomed but not without consequences. ''My dad was severely beaten by a group of officers when they found out about my mom,'' Mr. Albert said, referring to American soldiers.
At Camp Florence, as well as other camps, the environment for black nurses could be particularly humiliating. The nurses were forced to eat in separate dining halls, apart from white officers on the base.
''My mother mentioned that she was in a bar or some place that had food or drink and they refused to serve her,'' said Stephen Albert, 66, Elinor and Frederick's oldest son.
The discrimination blacks encountered was not lost on the German P.O.W.'s.
''You'd be hard-pressed to find a German soldier who was held captive in America who didn't speak about African-Americans,'' Professor Reiss said. ''They were quite aware there was a major discrimination problem and that the Americans weren't really allowed to occupy the moral high ground on that matter.''
By war's end, about 500 black nurses had served in World War II. All German P.O.W.'s, including Frederick Albert, were eventually sent to Germany.
The American military officially ended segregation after WWII, but for the Alberts, the issue of race would resurface throughout their lives. Their unlikely romance resulted in Stephen's birth in December 1946. After Frederick was able to return to the United States, he and Elinor married on June 26, 1947, in Manhattan.
''I would say the first 10 years for my parents were a struggle to find some kind of economic security and a safe haven for an interracial family,'' said Chris Albert, who plays the trumpet with the Duke Ellington Orchestra.
''They moved to Boston and my father worked several jobs,'' he said. ''At some point, he decided it was best if they moved to Göttingen, Germany, where his parents lived. He could work for his father's cement manufacturing business.''
But Kristina Brandner, 70, a niece of Frederick Albert, said life in Germany was difficult. ''Göttingen is a small town,'' she said. ''My grandmother never had contact with black people so it was strange and uncomfortable for her with Elinor. Kids used to ask me how come there was a black woman living with us, and why is your cousin another color. Sometimes, I saw Elinor in the kitchen crying.''
In less than two years, Frederick, Elinor, Stephen and Chris, who was an infant, returned to the United States.
''We came back and moved to Morton, Pa. And then they went through the school issue,'' Mr. Albert said.
That issue was the rejection of Stephen's attempt to enroll at a local public school after being told that the school was not open to black children.
''My mother pitched a fit,'' Mr. Albert said, who still has a copy of the letter Elinor wrote to the school superintendent and a local branch of the N.A.A.C.P.
In 1959, Mr. and Ms. Albert settled in Village Creek, an interracial neighborhood in Norwalk, Conn., where Elinor became an avid gardener and Frederick became a vice president at Pepperidge Farm.
''We always had great music at home,'' said Mr. Albert, who resides in his childhood house in Norwalk. ''My dad had this affinity for New Orleans jazz. I think it was a much larger representation for him. That lack of warmth he felt growing up, he found it in jazz and when he saw my mother.''
Mr. Albert's father died in 2001, and his mother in 2005.
''I now ask myself how come I never questioned my dad about Hitler or what he thought about the Nazi movement,'' said Mr. Albert, who will perform along with his band mates at the Blue Note Jazz Club in the West Village this month.
''My mother didn't talk about it either,'' he said. ''They didn't bring up the past. But what I do know about my parents, their story is a remarkable one.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Full reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance. A searchable guide to these and other performances is at nytimes.com/events.
&#x2605; American Ballet Theater (Friday through July 6) After 13 years as a principal dancer, Irina Dvorovenko gives her final performance with the company on Saturday night, as Tatiana in ''Onegin'' (which will also be performed on Friday, Saturday afternoon and Monday). There are some notable firsts on the horizon, too, including the company premiere of Frederick Ashton's ''Month in the Country,'' which shares a short-lived bill (Tuesday through Thursday) with George Balanchine's dazzling ''Symphony in C'' and Mark Morris's brisk, buoyant ''Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes'' -- one of the most inviting programs this season. Friday, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Wednesday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, abt.org; $20 to $235. (Siobhan Burke) 
Battery Dance Company (Tuesday through Thursday) Based in Lower Manhattan for 37 years, this company has made an international footprint through its arts-in-education program, Dancing to Connect, which has toured to more than 20 countries since 2006. Its repertory, meanwhile, has remained less diverse, dedicated to the works of the founder and artistic director Jonathan Hollander. But perhaps that's changing: for the first time the troupe has commissioned an outside artist, the Polish choreographer Jacek Luminski. In ''Not All Those Who Wander Are Lost,'' Mr. Luminski reflects on the lost Jewish culture of Poland, creating a kind of companion piece to Mr. Hollander's 2005 ''Shell Games,'' also on the program. Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Wednesday and Thursday at 10:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m., 3LD Art & Technology Center, 80 Greenwich Street, at Rector Street, Lower Manhattan, (866) 811-4111, web.ovationtix.com/trs/cal/1401; $20, $15 for students and 65+; $275 for opening gala on Tuesday. (Burke)
Lori Belilove & the Isadora Duncan Dance Company (Friday and Saturday) As long as Ms. Belilove is around, we are in no danger of forgetting Isadora Duncan, the storied matriarch of American modern dance. Ms. Belilove doesn't just remount her works but carefully trains her dancers in the fluid nuances of the Duncan technique. For the troupe's latest project she resurrects some of Duncan's most politically fervent pieces, created from 1904 to 1924, celebrating the 136th anniversary of her birth. At 8 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (800) 838-3006, brownpapertickets.com; $25, $15 for students, $10 for children. (Burke)
&#x2605; Dance Under the Influence (Friday and Saturday) For the next installment of this choreographic sampler (and the final one this spring), the curator Valerie Gladstone brings a particularly appealing bunch into the close quarters of the basement theater at the Museum of Arts and Design. Making the most of the narrow stage will be Rashaun Mitchell, the former Merce Cunningham dancer who lately has been conjuring wonderfully strange worlds; Doug Elkins, known for his masterful mixing of forms (break dancing, ballet, Broadway musicals); the critically acclaimed Bharatanatyam soloist Ramya Ramnarayan; and Blakeley White-McGuire, a stellar performer with the Martha Graham Dance Company. At 7:30 p.m., 2 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, (800) 838-3006, madmuseum.org; $20, $12 for students. (Burke)
DanceAfrica (Sunday and next Friday through May 27) A Memorial Day weekend tradition, this vibrant festival, in its 36th year, gets a head start on Sunday with an opening celebration, featuring the a cappella group Sweet Honey in the Rock -- and, of course, plenty of dancing. Umkhathi Theater Works, from Zimbabwe, makes its New York debut, while the BAM/Restoration DanceAfrica Ensemble, a dynamic student company based closer to home (in Bedford-Stuyvesant), returns to the festival for the 17th time. Sunday at 3 p.m., next Friday at 7:30 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $50. (Burke)
Fridays at Noon: Pauline Koner, American Original (Friday) A celebrated dancer with José Limón in the 1940s and '50s, Ms. Koner would have been 100 years old if she were alive today. A program in her memory includes reconstructions of her own choreography and footage from ''The Farewell,'' her 1962 tribute to her mentor, Doris Humphrey. At noon, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, 92y.org; free or pay what you can; tickets required. (Burke)
Gallim Dance (Tuesday through May 26) The 31-year-old choreographer Andrea Miller has been churning out new work since she founded her company in 2007. Now she takes a moment to revisit one of her early pieces, the hourlong ''Blush,'' which she's updated since its premiere at Joyce SoHo in 2009. Whatever changes she's made, her prowling, contorted physical language will no doubt be there, reminding us how tough and resilient the human body can be. At 8 p.m., Fishman Space, Fisher Building, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 321 Ashland Place, near Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, bam.org/gallimdance, (718) 636-4100; $20 to $40. (Burke)
Hubbard Street Dance Chicago (Friday through May 26) With their protean ability to slip effortlessly between styles, these Chicago-based dancers bring two mixed bills to the Joyce Theater. Program A includes pieces by the always-in-demand Aszure Barton, the former company member Robyn Mineko Williams, the resident choreographer Alejandro Cerrudo and Israel's Sharon Eyal and Gai Behar, known for their work with Batsheva Dance Company. There's also a Batsheva connection on Program B, which features ''Three to Max'' by that troupe's eminent director, Ohad Naharin, and ''Casi-Casa'' by one of Europe's most celebrated choreographers, Mats Ek. Friday and Thursday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $69. (Burke)
Darrell Jones (Thursday through May 25) Brief excerpts from ''Hoo-Ha (for your eyes only)'' at Danspace Project last year made you wonder what else was lurking inside of this eerie, ecstatic dance. Mr. Jones (who has performed with Urban Bush Women, Bebe Miller Company, Min Tanaka and Ralph Lemon) returns to St. Mark's Church with the full work, an exploration of gender fluidity and a voluptuous deconstruction of voguing, performed by Damon Greene, Jsun Howard and himself. Ponytails, rose petals and nylon masks feature prominently. At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, danspaceproject.org; $18. (Burke)
&#x2605; Movement Research Spring Festival (Tuesday through May 25) ''Where is our space? Where is our home?'' ask the curators of this annual festival -- Vanessa Anspaugh, Hilary Clark, Mina Nishimura and Antonio Ramos. This year's lineup, under the title Alternate/Shelter, wrestles with questions about the economics of contemporary performance and where it resides. Don't let the seemingly dry subject deter you; revelry is always central to this week of workshops, installations and creative encounters, which pop up at various locations in Brooklyn and Lower Manhattan. At various times, (212) 598-0551, movementresearch.org; free to $25. (Burke)
New Voices in Live Performance (Thursday and next Friday) Good curators are as vital to the dance field as good choreographers, and this series nurtures both. As one of four curators selected to envision an evening of innovative performance, the dancer Lindsay Clark brings together one artist with a devoted following (Jack Ferver) and three others in the early part of their careers: Bessie Mcdonough-Thayer, Naomi Elena Ramirez and Jacob Slominski. At 7:30 p.m., Center for Performance Research, 361 Manhattan Avenue, near Jackson Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (800) 838-3006, brownpapertickets.com; $10. (Burke)
&#x2605; New York City Ballet (Friday through June 9) If you haven't had your fill of American composers and the ballets they've inspired, there are still a few more days of the American Music Festival, which concludes on Sunday. Friday is the night to see what's new to the repertory this season: the Contemporary Composers program includes Christopher Wheeldon's new pas de deux, ''A Place for Us'' (set to André Previn and Leonard Bernstein), and his ''Soirée Musicale'' (set to Samuel Barber), first created for the School of American Ballet in 1998. Beginning on Tuesday, the familiar sounds of Tschaikovsky and Stravinsky return on mixed bills that include ''Serenade,'' ''Firebird'' and ''Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux.'' Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Tuesday through Thursday at 7:30 p.m., David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 496-0600, nycballet.com; $29 to $155. (Burke)
New York Dance Parade (Saturday) The procession of salsa, tango, waltz, hula, house, techno and disco dancers -- among many, many others -- makes its annual march down Broadway, convening at 21st Street at 1 p.m. and snaking toward Tompkins Square Park. A four-hour party kicks off in the park at 3 p.m., with performances of just about every dance style practiced in the five boroughs -- from Mexican zapateado, Brazilian zouk and Egyptian belly dance to ballet, contemporary and hip-hop. Grandstand at St. Marks Place and Third Avenue, (267) 350-9213, danceparade.org; free. (Burke)
Purchase Dance Company (Wednesday through May 25) Students from SUNY Purchase, home to one of the country's most highly regarded dance conservatories, give New York City audiences (and, perhaps, their future employers) a chance to see what they've been working on. The program includes known repertory by Bill T. Jones (''Spent Days Out Yonder'') and George Balanchine (''Valse-Fantaisie''), as well as new works by Ori Flomin, Loni Landon and Claire Porter, choreographed specifically for the troupe. Each night one graduating senior will have a moment in the spotlight. At 7:30 p.m., New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, newyorklivearts.org; $15 in advance, $20 at the door, $10 for students and 65+. (Burke)
Katy Pyle and the Ballez Company (Friday and Saturday) A Lesbian Princess, a Dominant Sorceress and a Tranimal (part bird, part prince) are just a few of the characters viewers will encounter in ''The Firebird, A Ballez.'' In this reimagining of the 1910 Stravinsky-Fokine ballet, Ms. Pyle upends the story's traditional gender roles and subverts conventions of classical technique, while navigating the twists and turns of a very fanciful plot. It should be a compelling ride. At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, danspaceproject.org; sold out, but there will be a waiting list at the door. (Burke)
RG Dance Projects (Friday and Saturday) The initials, presumably, stand for Rubén Graciani, the director of this newly formed company and a professor at Skidmore College. In his latest work, ''We Fall Down, We Get Up,'' 24 singers from the Broadway Community Chorus function not just musically but also spatially, as a living component of Philip Treviño's set. Five dancers navigate the landscape of human and architectural boundaries. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 3 and 8 p.m., Martha Graham Studio Theater, Westbeth, 55 Bethune Street, 11th floor, artful.ly/store/events/1111; $20, $15 for students, 65+, and artists. (Burke)
&#x2605; Pam Tanowitz (Friday and Saturday) Any new piece by Ms. Tanowitz shouldn't be missed. It's hard to think of another contemporary choreographer with such a reverence for classical form and, at the same time, such dexterity in disassembling it. She works with some terrific dancers and composers, too. The premiere of ''The Spectators'' features Andrew Champlin, Maggie Cloud, Dylan Crossman, Pierre Guilbault, Sarah Haarmann and Melissa Toogood, with Annie Gosfield's music (and an original score by Dan Siegler) played live by the Flux Quartet. At 7:30 p.m., New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, newyorklivearts.org; $30, $24 for students and 65+. (Burke)
Aynsley Vandenbroucke (Friday and Saturday) You can't judge a performance by its promotional photo, but the one for Ms. Vandenbrouke's new ''35 ½'' gives us some intriguing hints about what she's been up to. An index of keywords, superimposed over the image of a rubber boot-wearing dancer, suggests that everything from ''radical formalism'' to ''Swan Lake'' to ''subtlest dance ever'' has been on her mind. It's worth the trip to Long Island City to see what she and her wonderful collaborators (who include the esteemed dancer-choreographer Vicky Shick) have been cooking up. At 8 p.m., the Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org; $15. (Burke)
Works & Process: Keigwin & Company (Sunday and Monday) If you can't make it to Colorado this summer for Larry Keigwin's premiere at the Vail International Dance Festival, not to worry. The witty choreographer offers a preview of his new piece, ''Canvas,'' along with other repertory spanning the 10 years since he founded his company, at the Guggenheim Museum's illuminating performance-and-discussion series. Mr. Keigwin and Damian Woetzel, the artistic director of Vail, will chat intermittently throughout the program. The news release promises ''special ballet guests.'' At 7:30 p.m., 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3587, worksandprocess.org; $35. (Burke)
Bill Young/Colleen Thomas & Co. (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Young and Ms. Thomas, a well-known husband-and-wife team, have a history of putting on shows that feel more like parties. It helps that they have their own SoHo loft space, which, for ''A Place in France,'' they will transform into ''a distorted and wondrous carnivalesque world'' -- or so the news release promises. Helping to construct that world will be Rebecca Makus's lighting design, Peter Richards's video, John McGrew's original live score and six adventurous dancers, including Ms. Thomas. At 8:30 p.m., Hundred Grand, 100 Grand Street, at Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 925-6573; $15. (Burke)

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Rise, And Housing Starts Fall

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
New data released Thursday on the United States economy showed some worrisome signs.
Jobless claims rose sharply last week, while housing starts tumbled in April and a gauge of underlying inflation pointed to weak demand. 
The data could feed fears over the impact of a government austerity drive that began in January and could also raise pressure on the Federal Reserve to continue to buy bonds to support the economy.
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits climbed last week at the fastest pace in six months, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits jumped by 32,000 to 360,000. That was the biggest jump since November and confounded analysts' expectations for a more modest increase.
''I think there's plenty of slack in the labor market,'' said Tanweer Akram, an economist with ING U.S. Investment Management in Atlanta.
Futures indexes for United States stocks turned lower after the data's publication, and so did yields on government debt. The dollar weakened against the euro and the yen.
A Labor Department analyst said no states had estimated their data, and there were no signs that furloughs for government employees had played a significant role in last week's increase in claims.
The economy has shown signs that growth slowed late in the first quarter and in April as Washington's push to trim the budget deficit weighed on consumers and businesses. The federal government raised taxes in January, and sweeping budget cuts were initiated in March.
Many analysts have noted that a reluctance by employers to lay off workers has made an outsize contribution to recent improvements in employment levels. Last month, employers added 165,000 new jobs while the unemployment rate dropped to a four-year low at 7.5 percent.
Housing has also been an economic bright spot, but a separate report showed groundbreaking for new homes fell more than expected in April. The Commerce Department said starts at building sites for homes fell 16.5 percent last month. Still, permits to build new homes increased, a reassuring indication that the housing sector could still contribute to the economic recovery.
In a third report, a sharp drop in gasoline costs led consumer prices to tumble in April by the most in over four years, while a gauge of underlying inflation was also weak.
The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index slipped 0.4 percent, the biggest decline since December 2008 when America was suffering some of the worst days of its financial crisis. Analysts had expected a more modest 0.2 percent decline in last month's prices.
In the 12 months through April, consumer prices rose 1.1 percent. That is well below the Fed's 2 percent inflation goal. Much of April's decline in prices was because of an 8.1 percent dive in gasoline costs, the biggest since December 2008.

HEADLINE: Scandal Machine

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
When politicians want to turn scandals into metaphors, actual details of wrongdoing or incompetence no longer matter. In fact, the details of the troubles swirling around the White House this week are bluntly contradicting Republicans who want to combine them into a seamless narrative of tyrannical government on the rampage. 
The Internal Revenue Service, according to an inspector general's report, was not reacting to political pressure or ideology when it singled out conservative groups for special scrutiny in evaluating requests for tax exemptions. It acted inappropriately because employees couldn't understand inadequate guidelines. The tragedy in Benghazi, Libya, never a scandal to begin with, has devolved into a turf-protection spat between government agencies, and the e-mail messages Republicans long demanded made clear that there was no White House cover-up.
The only example of true government overreach was the seizure of The Associated Press's telephone records, the latest episode in the Obama administration's Javert-like obsession with leakers in its midst.
Many of the Republicans who have added this action to their metaphor blender were also the ones clamoring the loudest for vigorous investigations of national security leaks. But reality simply isn't solid enough to hold back the vast Republican opportunism on display this week. Whatever cranky point Republicans had been making against President Obama for the last five years -- dishonesty, socialism, jackbooted tyranny -- they somehow found that these incidents were exactly the proof they had been seeking, no matter how inflated or distorted.
''This is runaway government at its worst,'' Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, said at a Tea Party news conference on Thursday about the I.R.S. scandal. ''Who knows who they'll target next.'' Representative Michele Bachmann knew. Standing next to Mr. McConnell, she said the I.R.S.'s next target would obviously be the religious beliefs of people seeking health insurance.
For Senator Mike Lee of Utah, these incidents proved that the federal budget has to be cut even more deeply. ''We need to return it to a simpler, more manageable government,'' he said, ''because that's the only way that we're ever going to prevent things like this from happening.''
There are no ''things like this,'' beyond a coincidence of bad timing. But they do have one thing in common: when bound together and loudly denounced on cable television and in hearings, they serve to obscure the real damage that Republicans continue to do to the economy and the workings of government.
While Washington was arguing about e-mail messages about Benghazi, it wasn't paying attention to the hundreds of thousands of defense furloughs announced this week because of the Republican-imposed sequester, which will become a significant drag on economic growth. It wasn't focusing on the huge drop in the deficit, which has yet to silence the party's demands for more austerity. And apparently it's considered old news that Republicans are blocking several of the president's cabinet nominees.
For those who are wondering whether this week's political windstorms will hinder Mr. Obama's second-term agenda, here's a bulletin: That agenda was long ago imperiled by the obstruction of Republicans. (See Guns. Jobs. Education. And, very possibly, Immigration.)

HEADLINE: E.U. Considers Emission Fines for Chinese and Indian Airlines

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Commission said Thursday that Air China and Air India were among 10 Chinese and Indian airlines facing the prospect of fines and exclusion from airports in the European Union for refusing to comply with rules aimed at regulating greenhouse emissions.
The carriers are accused of not providing emissions data, as required by the European rules, and not participating in a permit system that entitles airlines to emit greenhouse gases in European airspace.
The volume of carbon dioxide that the European Commission said the 10 carriers emitted through their jet engines in Europe last year was comparable to the emissions from burning about 130 rail cars of coal.
The commission said the eight Chinese carriers could face fines totaling &#x20ac;2.4 million, or $3 million, and the two Indian airlines face total fines of &#x20ac;30,000. 
So far the emissions rules apply only to flights within Europe, and European carriers and most non-European airlines have complied. Still hotly debated, though, is the planned expansion of the system next January to include international flights in and out of Europe.
Japan, Russia and the United States, as well as China and India, were among about two dozen countries that protested against that expansion early last year.
The resistance by the Chinese and Indian airlines to even the intra-Europe part of the program highlights the fierce opposition, particularly in emerging economies, to environmental rules imposed by Europe on companies and organizations in other parts of the world.
The dispute adds to a growing list of trade tensions between the European Union and China. Other cases include a recent recommendation by the European Commission to impose steep tariffs on Chinese producers of solar panels for allegedly flooding the bloc with goods at prices below the cost of producing them. The commission has also threatened to open an investigation into Chinese producers of telecommunications equipment for similar practices, and for benefiting from unfair government subsidies.
No airlines have been fined yet for violating the permit system, and the program does not present them with huge costs, at least initially. The system has added less than &#x20ac;1 to the cost of flights from, say, Paris to Rome.
The warning Thursday to the Chinese and Indian carriers derived from their failure to report their emissions to the national authorities and their missing of an April 30 deadline for handing over sufficient numbers of permits to the national authorities to cover their emissions last year. The European Commission, the Union's administrative arm, which made the announcement, oversees the system.
Connie Hedegaard, the Union's commissioner for climate action, said there was no excuse for the airlines to ignore Europe's system.
''It's not so that when we make our European laws, then we say they count for everybody except for Chinese and Indians -- and that is no different in the aviation sector,'' Ms. Hedegaard said. ''It shows how controversial and difficult it is to get to the adequately ambitious outcome we need in global aviation.''
Officials from the Chinese Mission to the European Union did not have any comment. The Indian authorities, and officials at Air India and Jet Airways, the other Indian airline accused of violating the Union's rules, could not be reached for comment.
The resistance by the Chinese and Indian carriers against going along with even the intra-European portion of the emissions regulations is only one of the snags in the Union's program, which is the world's most extensive effort to control greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. It relies on the use of permits for the right to emit at certain levels, essentially requiring producers of greenhouse gases to pay for the right to emit them.
The system was established eight years ago, initially to cover heavy industry in Europe, but it has lately been on the verge of collapse. That is in large part because the weak European economy has somewhat curtailed emissions- producing activity, weakening demand for the permits.
Another factor is that the national authorities gave too many permits away to sectors like the steel industry. Prices are currently at levels too low to force polluters to change to cleaner practices. Ms. Hedegaard issued a report on Thursday showing the surplus of permits on the market had reached a record high.
By expanding the program last year to include airlines, and the greenhouse gases emitted by jet engines, the European Union made its farthest-reaching move yet to protect the environment.
Other major airlines flying intra-European routes like Aerovías de México, American Airlines, Cathay Pacific of Hong Kong, Emirates of Dubai, Qantas of Australia and Singapore Airlines have complied by supplying emissions data and by handing over permits accounting for their emissions.
But airlines do not have to account for their intercontinental flights leaving from, or arriving at, E.U. airports until Jan. 1, 2014. Last November, after an international outcry, the Union decided to delay the planned debut of the expanded system by one year.
China, India, the United States and others say the European Union has no right to charge for emissions on routes that are mostly outside European airspace.
The European Union's program, called the Emissions Trading System, already covers about 11,000 factories and power plants across the Union. Major polluters need to show each year that they have acquired a sufficient number of permits -- many initially granted for free by the national authorities -- to compensate for their greenhouse gas emissions.
Each permit represents a ton of carbon dioxide.
So far, many airlines have received about 80 percent of their E.U. permits for free to help them adjust. But those handouts are based on past measurements of emissions, and airlines with rapid growth rates could face substantially higher costs in the future if they have to start buying more of their permits.
The price of permits lately has been about &#x20ac;3.65 per ton in the international trading market that has emerged. But that market has been affected by the depressed level of industrial production in Europe, leading to a lack of trading volume, and by the large number of permits still in circulation.
The warnings the European Union issued to the Chinese and Indian airlines were brought about by the carriers' not accounting for their intra-European emissions during 2012.
The Chinese and Indian carriers began snubbing the system last year, refusing to share information with the European authorities about their pollution. Last May, the European Commission warned that the airlines were guilty of ''systematic nonreporting'' of their emissions.
The fines the Union said Thursday that it might impose are based on provisions in the rules stipulating that violators pay &#x20ac;100 for each ton of carbon dioxide not covered by a permit.
Each of the Union's member states supervises a certain number of airlines. In the case of the Chinese and Indian carriers, the commission must rely mainly on Britain, France and Germany to issue further warnings and impose fines, if necessary. Repeated breaches by the airlines can lead to a ban from using airports in the European Union.
But the British, French and Germans probably have little appetite for a confrontation with China and India, which could cause the Asian countries to cancel orders for Airbus passenger planes -- among Europe's most important exports. France and Germany each hold 12 percent of Airbus's parent company, European Aeronautic Defense & Space. Airbus generates about 100,000 British jobs, according to the company.
In a letter to top Chinese aviation officials last November, after the Union pared back the system to cover Europe-only flights, Airbus's chief executive Fabrice Brégier wrote that the company had been ''very active'' in preventing application to international flights.
''I hope we at Airbus have been able to clearly demonstrate our strong support to Chinese aviation,'' he wrote.
Though many airlines have tried to reduce their carbon footprints through technical innovations like more efficient aircraft designs and biofuels blends, European officials say there are few technologies for substantially reducing emissions -- leaving market-based trading systems as the most cost-efficient option for prompting airlines to find solutions.
The Union's goal is to speed up the adoption of greener technologies at a time when air traffic represents about 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions and is growing much faster than gains in efficiency.
Ms. Hedegaard, the E.U. commissioner, said the cost for airlines should be manageable even when applied internationally -- adding about &#x20ac;3 on the price of a round-trip ticket between Brussels and Washington, or about &#x20ac;4 for a round trip between Brussels and Beijing.
Ms. Hedegaard also emphasized that Europe wanted to implement the plan because 15 years had gone by since the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency, was given the task under the Kyoto international climate treaty of coming up with a way to regulate greenhouse gases from aircraft.
The United States has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, unable to muster sufficient support in the Senate.
Nancy Young, the vice president for environmental affairs at Airlines for America, an industry group, said that full application of the E.U. trading system, beyond internal European flights, could cost the U.S. airlines about $3.1 billion through 2020. The group supports voluntary fuel efficiency targets for the sector, which she said ''doesn't need an exorbitant tax to incentivize the industry to go green.''

HEADLINE: Europe Seeks U.S. Help as Airline Emissions Dispute Intensifies

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- A dispute between Chinese and Indian airlines and Europe over greenhouse gas rules could be a precursor to broader international resistance to the European system at a global conference later this year in Montreal. 
Starting in late September, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, will supervise discussions in the Canadian city, during which the European system is expected to meet severe criticism from many other nations.
Without an agreement on a global system, the European Union may have to drop the airline component from one of its signature projects: its effort to lead the world in controlling the emission of greenhouse gases, which are linked to global warming.
To head off that humiliating prospect, senior European officials have already been courting support from the United States.
Such backing could be vital for Europe, which has offered to relax or even abolish portions of its emission program -- which aims to make airlines accountable for emissions on all flights landing or taking off from airports in the Union -- if a more environmentally effective alternative can be found among an even larger group of countries.
Last month, José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, told Secretary of State John Kerry in Brussels that creating an effective global system for airline emissions would represent a unique opportunity to break the stranglehold that emerging nations like China and India have long exercised over international climate negotiations. Those nations have refused to submit their industries to the same environmental strictures as those faced by companies in developed nations.
The standoff has bedeviled climate negotiations since the 1990s, when expectations that industrialized nations should bear the burden of emission cuts began colliding with the realization that some developing nations were rapidly becoming the world's biggest polluters.
The U.S. State Department did not respond to requests for comment on how Mr. Kerry viewed Mr. Barroso's request. But Europe probably will face an uphill battle in trying to win U.S. backing.
Last year, President Barack Obama signed the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme Prohibition Act, an American law forbidding U.S. airlines from participating in the E.U. system. This year, U.S. officials plan to press nations at the U.N.'s civil aviation meetings to consider a system that would operate only within a state's sovereign airspace, falling far short of European objectives.

HEADLINE: Looking for Capitalism's Tipping Point

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
SAN JOSE, California -- One of the most urgent questions in economics today is the connection between inequality and growth. That is because one of the big economic facts of our time is the surge in income disparity, particularly between those at the very top and everyone else. The other big fact is the recession set off by the financial crisis and the consequent imperative to jump-start economic growth. Figuring out the relationship between these two tent-pole issues is therefore a good way for economists to spend their time.
There are two main and contradictory ideas about how that relationship might work. One is that inequality is the price of robust economic growth. If the private sector is thriving, the most successful capitalists will be getting very rich. Creating a system that allows -- indeed, encourages -- the best and the brightest to pull away from everyone else is how you shift your economy into its highest gear. 
There is, however, another theory, and it has been winning adherents in the aftermath of the financial crisis. In this view, rising inequality is not a symptom of a fast growing economy or an incentive that will help create one. Instead, too much income inequality crushes economic growth.
There are different arguments for why that might happen. One is that high income inequality creates an unstable system that is vulnerable to costly booms and busts. Another is that when too much of the income goes to the very top and not enough goes to the middle, spending slumps -- how many yachts does a plutocrat need? -- putting a brake on growth.
David Howell, a professor of economics at The New School in New York, has written a draft paper for the Center for American Progress, a progressive research group, that investigates the first argument. Mr. Howell argues that the United States and Britain have acted over the past three decades on what he calls the laissez-faire theory, that the equation of rising inequality and increasing gross domestic product is correct.
As Mr. Howell puts it, ''the laissez-faire case for high inequality is grounded in the belief that growth in output and employment depends mainly on strong incentives to work and invest.''
Mr. Howell tested that view by comparing the United States and Britain to their peers. He asked whether ''compared to other rich countries, U.S. income inequality has paid off in relatively high growth.'' His answer: not particularly. He finds that ''there is no simple correlation between our measures of growth and income inequality.''
That may come as a surprise to many Americans, who are accustomed to hearing, as Mr. Howell explained, ''that the U.S. middle class is doing relatively well, at least compared to Europe, because of productivity growth and because we allow higher inequality.''
But the reality is that at least some of those allegedly sclerotic European economies, dragged down by their highly redistributive welfare states, have out-performed the United States.
''What we see is Sweden having really good productivity growth by all measures, despite much more modest increases in inequality and starting at a much lower level,'' he said.
''The U.S. is anywhere from an O.K. to middling performer in the Age of Inequality,'' Mr. Howell said, using his term for our era. But while his work suggests inequality is not needed to get growth, he does not show that inequality actually hurts growth either: ''I don't show a strong measurable inverse effect.''
Lars Osberg, an economist at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, takes on this second argument -- the case that inequality, at least beyond a certain point, can stifle growth.
He, too, adopts a comparative lens, looking at Canada, the United States and Mexico.
Mr. Osberg argues that a growing chasm between those at the very top and everyone else imperils the overall economy. His worry is financial instability.
''The added savings of the increasingly affluent must be loaned to balance total current expenditure,'' he writes, ''but increasing indebtedness implies financial fragility, periodic financial crises, greater volatility of aggregate income and, as governments respond to mass unemployment with counter-cyclical fiscal policies, a compounding instability of public finances.''
This is a variation of an argument by Raghuram Rajan, a politically center-right professor at the University of Chicago, who has suggested that rising income inequality was one of the drivers of the financial crisis. As income inequality increased, and the incomes of the middle class stagnated, the U.S. government responded by increasing the consumer credit available to the middle class.
In the short term, that was a win-win solution: consumption, and therefore the economy, grew, and the middle class was quiescent because stagnating incomes were masked by increasing consumer debt. But in the medium term, that Goldilocks scenario broke down -- the middle class consumption bubble, and the Wall Street bubble it helped finance, popped with devastating consequences.
Both Mr. Howell and Mr. Osberg are skeptical, at best, of the value of rising income inequality as a driver of economic growth. When you put that conclusion together with the arithmetic of democracy -- rising income inequality means a majority of voters are on the losing end of the deal -- a political backlash seems inevitable.
''Go back to the 1920s or the 1870s and economists were worried about the stability of the capitalist system,'' Mr. Osberg said. ''One of the things the 1930s experience teaches us is there are some catastrophic outcomes which can happen.''
The investing class and the academic world are focused on those dangers. ''Can capitalism survive?'' is one of the trendiest conference topics among red-blooded capitalists and left-leaning professors alike. So far, at the ballot box and on the street, this question has not been as salient. That does not mean it will not be in the future, and in ways we cannot predict.

HEADLINE: Japan Growth Supports Case for Abe Policies

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- In the first sign that the bold policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe are gaining traction in the real economy, Japan's gross domestic product grew at a robust annualized pace of 3.5 percent in the first quarter, kindling hopes that recovery would finally take hold for the long-suffering economic power.
Japanese growth came to 0.9 percent for the January-to-March period compared with a year ago, driven by higher household consumption and exports, government data showed Thursday. That beat market expectations of 0.7 percent for the quarter, or 2.8 percent for the annualized pace. 
Exports grew 3.8 percent, pushed higher by strong shipments of cars and other manufactured goods to the United States on the back of a weaker yen, offsetting a slump in exports to China and Europe.
Personal consumption, which makes up the largest part of Japan's G.D.P., grew 0.9 percent, as consumer sentiment brightened amid signs of an economic recovery. Capital expenditure fell 0.7 percent for the fifth consecutive quarter, though economists expect a rebound as the recovery takes hold. Public spending grew 0.8 percent.
The solid pace, which followed two quarters of contraction and a quarter of just 0.2 percent growth, appeared to point to the beginnings of a long-awaited turnaround in the Japanese economy, the world's third-largest, after those of the United States and China.
''It is a sign that the Abe administration's economic policies are starting to show results,'' said the economics minister, Akira Amari.
The latest numbers have come as early validation for Mr. Abe, who took office in December and has used what has been called a ''three-arrowed'' bid to lift Japan out of its long deflationary slump.
He has focused on an aggressive monetary policy that has flooded the economy with cheap money, major fiscal spending and changes to make the economy more competitive.
Under Mr. Abe, the central bank has sought to double its monetary base and to generate inflation of 2 percent by 2014.
This first arrow has been accompanied by a devaluation of the yen by about 20 percent in the past six months, which has been a boon for exporters. Exporters including Toyota and Sony have reported a rebound in profit in the first quarter of 2013, thanks in good part to the policy.
In recent days, however, concerns have grown about rising interest rates in the government bonds market, which could threaten Japan's monetary policy. Japan is vulnerable to rising borrowing because of its high public debt burden, which is twice the size of its economy. Bonds are also the main financial asset held by banks, pension funds and insurance companies, making a surge in debt yields perilous.
Still, investors have piled into Japan's stock market, emboldened by expectations of rosy corporate profits and an economic recovery. The Nikkei stock index has risen an astonishing 46 percent since Mr. Abe took office.
And though the improved fortunes of exporters and the surging stock market have yet to translate to higher wages, there are signs of brighter consumer sentiment and a recovery in spending, which will be critical to Japan's fight against deflation.
Japan is also getting help from the second arrow, more fiscal spending. Mr. Abe pushed through an emergency stimulus package of ¥10 trillion, or $97 billion, in February and has followed up with a ¥92.6 trillion initial budget for 2013, which Japan's Parliament approved late Wednesday. That heavy spending is expected to push up growth next quarter.
Economists at Nomura, the Japanese investment bank, said they now projected strong growth for three consecutive years, with an estimated 1.6 percent expansion for the whole of 2013 and even higher growth after that.
''Sentiment among companies and consumers has improved sharply of late as the yen has depreciated and the equity market has risen. We think this is likely to create a positive cycle in which improved sentiment underpins growth in private consumption and private capex,'' Nomura said in a research note after the figures were released, referring to capital expenditure, ''and this growth in turn supports further improvement in sentiment.''
Beating deflation remains, for now, an elusive goal.
The G.D.P. deflator, a measure of the average price of all of the goods and services produced in an economy, was negative 1.2 percent, year on year, though economists said they expected deflation to ease gradually as benefits from the weak yen were felt more widely throughout the economy.
And economists warn that for the economy to keep growing, the third arrow will be crucial: mainly structural changes that aim to make the economy more competitive, for example by making Japan's labor market more flexible and lowering barriers to trade.
But these changes will be far more politically difficult for Mr. Abe to push through.
''We expect Abe's first and second arrows to support domestic demand significantly in the next two years,'' the UBS economists Daiju Aoki and Toru Ibayashi said in a recent note.
''That said, the two policies can only stimulate short-term demand-side growth, not long-term fundamental growth,'' they added. ''For the rally to continue and be fundamentally driven, Abe must convince the market that his 'third arrow' will benefit Japan's underlying economy.''

HEADLINE: New Fracking Rules Proposed for U.S. Land

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Thursday issued a new set of proposed rules governing hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas on public lands, moving further to address industry concerns about the costs and reporting burdens of federal regulation. 
The new Interior Department proposal, which is subject to 30 days of public comment and further revision, disappointed environmental advocates, who had pushed for full disclosure of the chemicals used in the drilling process and tougher standards for groundwater protection and well integrity.
The new rule allows oil companies to keep some components of their drilling fluids secret and will allow them to run well integrity tests on one representative well rather than all wells in a field where the geology and well construction techniques are similar.
The proposed regulation, which revises one proposed a year ago, also allows drillers to comply with state regulations in places where federal officials deem them as tough or tougher than the applicable federal rules.
Environmental advocacy groups and industry officials were critical of the proposed rules.
''Comparing today's rule governing fracking on public lands with the one proposed a year earlier, it is clear what happened: the Bureau of Land Management caved to the wealthy and powerful oil and gas industry and left the public to fend for itself,'' said Jessica Ennis, legislative representative for Earthjustice.
Kathleen Sgamma, vice president of government affairs for Western Energy Alliance, an association of oil companies, said: ''While the current rule is better than the first impractical rule, D.O.I. still has not justified the rule from an economic or scientific point of view. It continues to second-guess states and tribes, and will hurt job creation and economic growth in Western communities.''
Production of domestic oil and natural gas has surged in recent years through the use of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, and horizontal drilling.
Among the concerns of property owners and environmentalists is that operators will be able to keep the composition of the drilling fluids secret. The rule requires that most fluids be logged on the industry-operated Web site FracFocus, although certain proprietary compounds can be kept confidential.
Interior officials said that they would consider using a different reporting scheme if one can be found.
The 171-page proposal is the first significant regulation issued under the new interior secretary, Sally Jewell. Ms. Jewell worked in the oil industry in the late 1970s and proudly said that she fracked a few wells in Oklahoma.
Ms. Jewell said in a conference call for reporters that the administration would continue to lease large tracts of public and Indian lands for oil and gas development and that it was critical that rules keep pace with technology.
Anticipating criticism from environmental advocates, she said: ''I know there are those who say fracking is dangerous and should be curtailed, full stop. That ignores the reality that it has been done for decades and has the potential for developing significant domestic resources and strengthening our economy and will be done for decades to come.''
The draft rule affects drilling operations on the 700 million acres of public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management, as well as 56 million acres of Indian lands. The Interior Department estimates that 90 percent of the 3,400 wells drilled each year on public land use hydraulic fracturing.
Ms. Jewell said the proposal ensures that best practices would govern drilling and protect human health and the environment.

HEADLINE: Obama Names New Acting I.R.S. Chief

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama appointed Daniel I. Werfel, the controller of the Office of Management and Budget, to be the acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, the White House announced Thursday. 
Mr. Werfel, who manages much of the day-to-day operations at the budget office, will replace Steven Miller, who was fired this week as the agency's interim director in the scandal over its targeting of conservative groups.
The White House said in a statement that Mr. Werfel would begin his new job on Wednesday.
''Danny has proven an effective leader who serves with professionalism, integrity and skill,'' Mr. Obama said in the statement. ''The American people deserve to have the utmost confidence and trust in their government, and as we work to get to the bottom of what happened and restore confidence in the I.R.S., Danny has the experience and management ability necessary to lead the agency at this important time.''
Another top official at the I.R.S. also announced his departure Thursday. Joseph H. Grant, the acting commissioner of the tax exempt and government entities division, said he would retire on June 3.
At the budget office, Mr. Werfel has been the administration's point man on one of the thorniest political problems in the last six months: the across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration.
As controller, Mr. Werfel is responsible for making sure that the departments and agencies of the federal government adhere to the sequestration law.
Now, the president is charging him with another difficult task: overseeing the I.R.S. in the middle of a scandal. Republicans -- and some Democrats -- have made clear that they intend to hold numerous hearings over the next several months, and it will be Mr. Werfel's job to comply with their demands even as he keeps the agency running.
Mr. Werfel, 42, is a longtime civil servant who has worked deep in bureaucracy, far from the political arena. Before managing the implementation of the sequester, for instance, Mr. Werfel helped to implement the complicated American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Mr. Obama's stimulus legislation. The selection of such a technocrat -- a well-liked one who also served in the George W. Bush administration, no less -- seemed designed to pre-emptively defuse partisan criticism.
Josh Bolten, who served as Mr. Bush's chief of staff and budget director, praised Mr. Werfel as a ''smart choice'' to help restore faith in the I.R.S. following the revelations that officials there targeted conservative groups.
''He was always, in my experience, very professional, careful, nonideological,'' Mr. Bolten said. ''He's not easily intimidated. He's low ego. He's just going to tell it straight like it is. It's not that he's bipartisan. He's nonpartisan.''
Officials said Mr. Werfel had agreed to serve in the position until the end of the year. The president then would have to name another acting commissioner or nominate someone to permanently lead the agency. That nomination would be subject to Senate confirmation.

HEADLINE: Rebuilding of Mali Faces Daunting Obstacles, Despite Outside Aid

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

 BODY:
DAKAR, Senegal -- The outpouring of support may be more a sign of nervousness than altruism.
At an international conference in Brussels this week, donors pledged $4.2 billion for Mali on a range of fronts, including roads, energy and business development, hoping to help rebuild a nation that alarmed governments around the world when much of it collapsed and fell to Islamist militants last year.
Beyond the money, the United Nations plans to deploy 12,600 peacekeepers this summer to make sure the militants do not return, while a host of outside powers, with France and the United States in the lead, are keeping a watchful eye on preparations for elections the Malians have promised for July. 
What is unclear is whether these efforts will be enough to remake the nation, about the size of Texas and California combined, after its civilian and military institutions have fallen, leaving a vacuum for the militants to exploit. Skeptics question whether money and oversight will suffice in a country with an army in tatters, accused of serious and so far unpunished human rights violations, and a political class that is mostly discredited.
The military junta that seized power last year, accelerating the country's collapse, hovers in the background, with its tight connections to leading candidates in the July elections and an influential ally, Defense Minister Yamoussa Camara, in the cabinet of the so-called transition government. Signs of the junta's influence persist: The editorial director of the country's leading newspaper, Le Républicain, was arrested in March by state security agents and jailed for 27 days for publishing a letter critical of the pay being given to the coup leader, Capt. Amadou Sanogo.
For now, the Islamist militants who held sway for more than nine months in the country's north have been largely chased out, defeated in a rapid French and Chadian military campaign in January and February. Hundreds of Islamists were killed; many have regrouped in lawless southern Libya, say regional officials, including Niger's foreign minister. But the separatist nomadic rebels whose 2012 uprising precipitated the takeover by Islamist extremists remain in control of the country's far north, refusing to budge from their stronghold in Kidal in spite of saber-rattling in the capital, Bamako.
Mali, which played little role in the defeat of the militants on its own turf, remains vulnerable, incapable of defending or reconstructing itself, Western officials say. The militants have fled the principal towns of northern Mali -- Gao and Timbuktu -- but some remain in the region's villages, as evidenced by attempted suicide bombings in recent days and brief armed incursions into urbanized areas, which were repulsed after gun battles with French and Malian forces.
Outside governments are eager to forestall a repeat of last year's chaos, and two large-scale multinational efforts now under way, led by France and shepherded by the United Nations and the European Union, would effectively make this impoverished West African nation a ward of the international community.
At the international donor's conference in Brussels on Wednesday, Mali received most of what it was seeking in a broad reconstruction plan. ''We need money,'' Mali's foreign minister, Tieman Coulibaly, bluntly declared.
The needs are immense. The Malians told donors that government ''resources'' decreased by 30 percent after the coup. Nearly half a million people have fled their homes in the north, tens of thousands are still in refugee camps, most schools and health centers in that region remain closed and well over a million people are considered at risk of going hungry.
''Everyone understands that the future of the subregion and beyond depends on Mali's stabilization and development,'' the French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, said at the Brussels conference.
Outside supporters are insisting that Mali replace the current coup-born government with a democratically elected one. ''A lot of this is in the hands of the Malians, to see that that political transition happens,'' said the interim head of the United Nations Mission in Mali, David Gressly. ''This is what the international community is looking for.''
The Malians themselves, in their 48-page reconstruction plan, note the ''fragility of the republic's institutions'' and the ''poor governance and corruption riddling every area of national life.'' Whether that recognition translates into a homegrown reform effort remains to be seen. The jockeying before the promised elections in late July resembles old-time Malian politics in the capital, with many in the discredited political class again playing prominent roles.
''It's almost a self-satirizing plan,'' said Prof. William Easterly, an economist at New York University, adding that he worried about an Afghanistan-like situation of ''pouring in money to a fictional government.''
''In the past few years there's been this delusion of fixing failed states,'' Professor Easterly continued. ''Instead of the common-sense view that it's extremely difficult to fix failed states with aid, it sort of goes to the reverse extreme: that it becomes one of the best possible opportunities to comprehensively transform the whole country.''
Still, there is little disagreement that one of the most pressing needs is the country's ineffectual military, which retreated in the face of last year's rebel advance. The Malian report speaks of the ''extreme weakness of the army,'' and the United Nations is effectively proposing to step in as a substitute with what will be its third-largest peacekeeping force. Meanwhile, European Union military trainers are at work in Mali trying to reform the army.
The core of the United Nations force is expected to be the 6,000 regional African troops already deployed, though a Pentagon official called them ''completely incapable'' in remarks to Congress in April. Soldiers from Senegal, Togo and Niger now operate in Gao and its environs. Troops from Burkina Faso are in Timbuktu. They will be backed by the 1,000 French troops who remain in the country, authorized to intervene when the peacekeepers are under ''imminent and serious threat.''

HEADLINE: Investors Take Profits, Leading Indexes Down

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Thursday, with the downturn accelerating late in the day after a Federal Reserve official said the central bank could begin easing up on its monetary stimulus this summer. 
The three major stock indexes earlier traded in a tight range, supported by a gain of more than 12 percent in Cisco Systems shares and as investors took in a batch of economic data that pointed to slower growth.
But the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished near its session low after the comments from John C. Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, who also said the Fed could end its bond purchases this year, assuming the labor market continued to grow stronger. Mr. Williams is not a voter on the Fed's policy-setting panel this year.
''When a Fed governor is out there and mentions this possibility, it does spook the market a little, because I don't think anybody quite knows how the stock market is going to react'' after the stimulus ends, said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in New York.
The Fed's purchases of $85 billion a month in bonds have been a significant driver of the rally in equities that has taken indexes to highs and pushed the S.& P. 500 up nearly 16 percent this year.
Analysts also said the comments could have been viewed as a reason to take a pause after such a strong run-up in stocks.
''It turned a boring day into a bit of profit-taking,'' Mr. Ghriskey said.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 42.47 points, or 0.28 percent, to 15,233.22 at the close. The S.& P. 500 fell 8.31 points, or 0.50 percent, to end at 1,650.47. The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 6.38 points, or 0.18 percent, to finish at 3,465.24.
Earlier, the Dow reached a new intraday high, at 15,302.49.
The Nasdaq fared better than the other two major indexes as Cisco shot up 12.6 percent, to $23.89, after it posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and said current-quarter revenue could increase.
Economic data set a lackluster tone in markets early in the day as factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region contracted, while housing starts plummeted 16.5 percent in April. New claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly jumped last week.
However, investors had speculated that soft underlying inflation also meant the Fed had room to continue its economic stimulus.
Wal-Mart Stores fell 1.7 percent, to $78.50, and dragged on the Dow after it posted a quarterly profit that missed expectations, with sales down 1.4 percent at United States stores open at least a year.
Tesla Motors shares gained 8.7 percent, to $92.25, after the carmaker said it aimed to raise $830 million through a stock-and-debt offering that would be used to repay its Energy Department loans with interest. The stock has surged more than 50 percent since the company reported earnings last week.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 18/32, to 98 27/32, dropping the yield to 1.88, from 1.94 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: 16 Accused of Smuggling Cigarettes Worth Millions

BYLINE: By JOSEPH GOLDSTEIN

 BODY:
One of the men had once lived in the same Brooklyn building as the personal secretary of a senior Hamas member, the authorities said. Another was something of a father figure to the terrorist who fatally shot at a van full of yeshiva students on the Brooklyn Bridge. And a third is said to have once received an investment from Omar Abdel Rahman, the so-called blind sheik, who is now serving a life sentence for a terrorism plot. 
Over the years, these three men each came under the scrutiny of the New York Police Department's Intelligence Division, which runs counterterrorism investigations. On Thursday, they were charged along with 13 other men -- not on terrorism-related charges, but as defendants in a more commonplace conspiracy: trafficking in untaxed cigarettes.
At a news conference, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly and Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said that what had begun as counterterrorism police work uncovered a smuggling ring that was generating tens of millions of dollars by buying cigarettes in Virginia, where the state tax is 30 cents a pack, and selling them across New York, where they are far more expensive as a result of taxes as high as $5.85 a pack.
One defendant was overheard on a wiretap telling another, ''This business is better than selling drugs,'' said Mr. Schneiderman, who estimated the smuggling ring's revenue to be at least $55 million. At its top, prosecutors say, was Basel Ramadan, a businessman in Ocean City, Md., who was arrested on Wednesday.
Beyond illuminating the economics of the black-market cigarette trade, the case also opened a window into the operations of the Intelligence Division, where investigators keep files on suspects for many, many years, slowly adding information from confidential informers and waiting to see whether a criminal case ever materializes. Several of the men arrested in the cigarette case first drew the division's notice in 2006 or earlier.
''This case started because we were being vigilant about terrorism,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''We discovered that individuals who were on our radar for links to known terrorists were engaged in a massive raid on the New York State treasury.''
At the news conference, he focused his remarks on the links of several of the men to known terrorists, although he stopped short of saying that they themselves had any involvement in terrorism. But Mr. Kelly said much of the suspected profit from the cigarette smuggling ring had not been recovered, and he raised the possibility that it might have ended up with terrorist organizations overseas.
Of the 16 defendants named in the indictment, 11 were arraigned on Thursday in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn on charges of enterprise corruption, money laundering and tax evasion. They pleaded not guilty, the authorities said.
Most of the men are from Brooklyn and Staten Island. Messages left for them or their lawyers were not immediately returned.

HEADLINE: ESPN to Gain Full Rights to U.S. Open in 2015

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
For decades, the United States Open tennis tournament was a mainstay of broadcast television, along with the Super Bowl, the World Series and the Masters. From Billie Jean King and Rod Laver to Roger Federer and the Williams sisters, viewers knew they could watch superstars, rising talents and upstarts play in the men's and women's finals and semifinals -- and more -- on CBS.
But that is about to end. The latest assault on the fraying broadcast sports model came Thursday when ESPN announced that it would take control of the tournament in 2015, ending CBS's role in it after what will be 46 years. 
ESPN already has the tournament's cable rights and will pay $825 million over 11 years to combine what it has carried since 2009 with what CBS has televised. It also promised that every match would be seen live on ESPN, ESPN2 or ESPN3, the broadband network.
''Look, this is just about ESPN,'' John Skipper, ESPN's president, said in a telephone interview. ''It's not about cable or broadcast. We feel that sports rights are the most valuable commodity in media. The difference between broadcast and cable is inconsequential.''
ESPN's acquisition of the United States Open advances a trend in which cable networks like ESPN and TBS scoop up increasingly important sports events. Nearly every college football bowl game is on an ESPN network. Chunks of the Major League Baseball and N.B.A. postseasons have been on cable for a while. And the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament that had been CBS's sole domain since 1991 is now shared with three Turner Sports networks. One of them, TBS, will carry the Final Four semifinals next year and the Final Four and championship game every other year from 2016 until 2024.
And the new college football playoff will be on ESPN. Only the Super Bowl and the World Series seem safe on broadcast television, but maybe for another decade or so.
Cable networks have increasingly used their revenue from subscribers and advertisers to lavish cash on leagues, college conferences and other rights holders. Broadcasters have reasoned that they sometimes cannot compete with cable networks, especially ESPN, for high-end sports rights, or that they do not need them as they once did, as CBS has concluded with the United States Open.
Its United States Open viewership tumbled to a 25-year low of 2 million in 2012 from as many as 3.4 million 10 years earlier. And rain has forced the postponement of the men's final from Sunday to Monday for five straight years.
With money to spend, ESPN and other cable channels like TNT and TBS have for years been encroaching on the turf of broadcast networks, which have long carried games on weekends and occasionally in prime time. Their strategy has been similar to the one deployed with great success by cable networks like USA, AMC and A&E, which developed original dramas, comedies and reality series that have forced broadcasters to reimagine their futures as viewers have left them in droves.
The acquisition of all rights to the United States Open follows a similar move by ESPN two years ago to end NBC's 43-year grip on Wimbledon with a 12-year deal worth nearly $500 million. When the United States Open deal starts in two years, the only tennis Grand Slam left on broadcast television will be the French Open on NBC, which has the rights through 2024.
CBS was looking at losing money on the United States Open if it had to raise its annual rights payment to the United States Tennis Association to about $32.5 million in a new deal, from $20 million.
''We could not come to an agreement with the U.S.T.A. that made economic sense for CBS,'' said Sean McManus, the chairman of CBS Sports.
ESPN's $75 million annual payment for the Open nearly quadruples what it has been paying. It will combine what it had been paying with what CBS has been paying and absorb a sizable increase. Still, it amounts to pocket change for ESPN, which in 2014 will start a long-term deal in which it will pay $1.9 billion a year to continue to carry ''Monday Night Football.''
U.S.T.A. officials sounded so enamored of ESPN's power to reach tennis fans that on a conference call with reporters Thursday they sounded ready to move on, immediately if possible, from CBS.
The U.S.T.A.'s executive director, Gordon Smith, said the deal ''puts the U.S. Open at the center of American sports culture as never before.''

Previews and Openings
'Botallack O'Clock' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on May 28) Roger Hilton may not have the name recognition of Mark Rothko and Stanley Spencer, two other 20th-century painters who became the subject of plays. But for what this abstract artist lacks in marquee value he makes up for in eccentricity: Hilton spent the last two years of his life confined to his bed -- and still managed to paint. Eddie Elks's black comedy about Hilton, which earned some attention at the 2011 Edinburgh Fringe Festival, makes its United States premiere as part of 59E59's Brits Off Broadway festival. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Eric Grode) 
'The Caucasian Chalk Circle' (in previews; opens on May 30) Once you've turned Wedekind into an alt-pop juggernaut, Brecht should be a snap, right? Duncan Sheik, whose ''Spring Awakening'' score earned him a Tony Award, has contributed a new score to this 1940s parable about goodness in a diabolical world. Christopher Lloyd heads a cast that includes the dependable supporting performers Mary Testa, Tom Riis Farrell and Elizabeth A. Davis. The director, Brian Kulick, did right by Brecht's play ''Galileo'' last year. Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Grode)
'Ensemble Studio Theater 2013 Marathon' (previews start on Saturday; opens on Tuesday) For 34 years, this one-act play festival has offered a wild array of works ranging in style and scope. This year's crop of 16 plays is once divided into three separate series, and one particularly wide gap involves the authors' ages. Murray Schisgal, 85, will pop up later in the series, but the 24-year-old Eric Dufault will present ''Something Fine'' in this batch. Also in the first group: ''Poison,'' a new play by the Pulitzer Prize-winning John Patrick Shanley, along with three other pieces. Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Grode)
'Far From Heaven' (in previews; opens on June 2) It's been a busy spring for Richard Greenberg, who has opened two new Broadway plays, ''Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' which has already closed, and ''The Assembled Parties.'' Here he has joined the ''Grey Gardens'' creative team for the musicalization of a movie -- the lush 2002 homage to Douglas Sirk's febrile melodramas, in which racial and sexual taboos topple in a seemingly idyllic Connecticut town in 1957. Kelli O'Hara and Steven Pasquale lead the whopping cast of 18 -- the largest Playwrights Horizons has ever fielded. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'Good Television' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on June 4) Playwrights aren't quite as hard on the television industry as they used to be. (After all, half of them are on the writing staffs of TV shows these days.) But reality television still comes in for a good grilling now and then, which is the case with this piece from the longtime actor Rod McLachlan. Here he looks at the machinations that take place on both sides of the camera as part of a reality program about addiction and rehab. Atlantic Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, atlantictheater.org. (Grode)
'The Master Builder' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) Grandiosity seems to come easy to John Turturro, who has played the Brechtian dictator Arturo Ui, Howard Cosell and ''the Jesus.'' (That's Jesus Quintana, in ''The Big Lebowski.'') He and the director Andrei Belgrader scored a hit at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2008 with a starry production of Beckett's ''Endgame''; the two men have returned to take on Ibsen's 1892 classic tale of obsession and ambition. Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Grode)
'Murder Ballad' (in previews; reopens on Wednesday) A small but savvy musical that panders in style to those of us who lap up febrile accounts of fatal attractions. Julia Jordan and Juliana Nash's contemporary tale of a razor-edged love triangle knows exactly what it wants to do, and does it most efficiently, with a four-member cast, directed by Trip Cullman. Staged last fall at Manhattan Theater Club's Studio at Stage II, the show returns with most of its original cast (John Ellison Conlee, Will Swenson and Rebecca Naomi Jones) and an addition: Caissie Levy, who is taking over for Karen Olivo. Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'A Picture of Autumn' (previews start on Thursday; opens on June 10) Even by Mint Theater standards, N.C. Hunter's 1951 play qualifies as a rarity: They are presenting its American premiere. Hunter's refined, tentative style became synonymous in some corners with everything the Angry Young Men of mid-20th-century British theater opposed, but perhaps it's time to revisit this piece here. It's about a family trying to hold on to their decrepit ancestral home, and it gave London audiences their first glimpse of a playwright who would soon become an important, but now-forgotten, dramatist in the 1950s and '60s. Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org. (Grode)
'Reasons to Be Happy' (in previews; opens on June 11) For anyone going through ''The Office'' withdrawal, the headline here will be Jenna Fischer (a k a Pam) in her Off Broadway debut. For everyone else, the news is that Neil LaBute has created a sequel -- the MCC Theater is calling it a companion piece -- to his understated (by LaButian standards) 2008 gem ''Reasons to Be Pretty.'' All four of its characters are back for more high-octane couplings and uncouplings, with Ms. Fischer joined by Josh Hamilton, Leslie Bibb and the LaBute regular Fred Weller. Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Grode)
'Somewhere Fun' (in previews; opens on June 4) Jenny Schwartz made plenty of friends in high theatrical places -- including Edward Albee -- with her linguistically and emotionally ambitious ''God's Ear'' in 2007. In her first play since then, Ms. Schwartz and her ''God's Ear'' director, Anne Kauffman, explore an impromptu reunion between two women who met 35 years ago. Ms. Schwartz's ear for the quirks and clichés of the English language remains intact, though her cast is a bit starrier this time around: Kathleen Chalfant and Kate Mulgrew are the two women. Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (Grode)
'Three Kinds of Exile' (in previews; opens on June 11) John Guare's new play has a dependably meaty subject -- the lives of three noted émigrés from Poland and Czechoslovakia, among them the writer Witold Gombrowicz -- and one unexpected co-star: Mr. Guare himself, who is making his Off Broadway acting debut 45 years after winning his first Obie Award for playwriting. Among his co-stars are the actors-turned-authors David Pittu and Martin Moran, so they'll have plenty to talk about. Linda Gross Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, atlantictheater.org. (Grode)
'The Tutors' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on June 5) Second Stage kicks off its two-play Uptown series of new works with this comedy by Erica Lipez about three young adults who, when they are not developing their social-networking start-up, tutor the offspring of New York's 1 percent. Thomas Kail, who looked at a very different tax bracket of New Yorkers when he directed ''In the Heights,'' is working with some of Off Broadway's more dependable young names, including Matt Dellapina, Keith Nobbs and Aubrey Dollar. McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Grode)
'The Weir' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Irish Repertory Theater's offerings tend toward the comforting, which makes this revival of Conor McPherson's 1997 bone-chiller of a play all the more intriguing. The presence of a young woman in a remote Irish pub one windy night shifts the usual whiskey-warmed blarney into something altogether more eerie and astonishing. Irish Rep's producing director, Ciaran O'Reilly, directs a group of company regulars. 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Grode)
Broadway
'Ann' Holland Taylor wrote and stars in this solo show about Ann Richards, the straight-shooting onetime governor of Texas. Ms. Taylor's engaging performance goes beyond impersonation, though the script is neither a dramatically shapely piece of writing nor a deeply probing character study (1:55). Vivian Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, lct.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may occasionally feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Anthony Warlow and Jane Lynch as Miss Hannigan (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Assembled Parties' Richard Greenberg's play about the decline of an affluent family is a throwback to a time when Charm -- with a capital C -- was a cardinal virtue in theater. It is also smart, sad and so impossibly well-spoken you may feel like giving up on conversation. Lynne Meadow directs a fine cast led by a singularly Charming Jessica Hecht (2:35). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Big Knife' Bobby Cannavale stars in the first (and last?) Broadway revival of Clifford Odets's 1949 drama about a movie star in a moral bind: to knuckle under to studio blackmail and sign his life and artistic aspirations away, or leave behind the corrupt system and risk reprisals. Doug Hughes's sluggish production doesn't make a case for the play's enduring merits; Odets handled similar themes with more urgency and cogency in ''Golden Boy,'' seen earlier this season in a superior revival (2:20). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'I'll Eat You Last: A Chat With Sue Mengers' Bette Midler gives the most lusciously entertaining performance of the Broadway season in John Logan's soufflé of a solo show in which she depicts the Hollywood agent Sue Mengers, dishing great piles of dirt as she awaits word from her great friend -- and ex-client -- Barbra Streisand (1:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Kinky Boots' Cyndi Lauper has created a love-and-heat-seeking score that performs like a pop star on Ecstasy. This Harvey Fierstein-scripted tale of lost souls in shoe business, in which a young factory owner (Stark Sands) teams up with a drag queen (Billy Porter), sometimes turns into a sermon. But it's hard to resist the audience-hugging charisma of the songs (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Lucky Guy' Nora Ephron's elegy and valentine to the rough-and-tumble of big-city newsrooms and scoop-hungry reporters, starring Tom Hanks as the columnist Michael McAlary, is written with a true fan's avidity. Directed with bells and whistles by George C. Wolfe, this is less a fully developed play than a boisterous swapping of fond anecdotes about the end of a life and the end of an era (2:00). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Macbeth' Alan Cumming portrays the Scottish general who would be king, and all the other significant roles, in this one-man race through Shakespeare's tragedy, set in a mental institution. Mr. Cumming's virtuosity and the gothic inventions of the directors, John Tiffany and Andrew Goldberg, impress, but while the actor effectively differentiates the roles, he never fully inhabits any of them (1:40). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Matilda the Musical' The most satisfying and subversive musical ever to come out of Britain. Directed by Matthew Warchus, with a book by Dennis Kelly and addictive songs by Tim Minchin, this adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel is an exhilarating tale of empowerment, told from the perspective of that most powerless group, little children. Bertie Carvel is priceless as their schoolmistress nemesis (2:35). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Motown: The Musical' A dramatically slapdash but musically vibrant joy ride through the glory days of the Detroit music label founded by Berry Gordy. Mr. Gordy's book is sketchy and obvious -- you want to plug your ears whenever the music stops. But the music is, of course, some of the greatest R&B ever recorded, and the performers mostly electric (2:40). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'The Nance' Playing a gay burlesque performer whose onstage specialty is mincing effeminacy, Nathan Lane combines shiny expertise and dark conviction to sometimes devastating effect, in this strained if heartfelt play by Douglas Carter Beane. Not even Mr. Lane, though, can reconcile all the disparities the script asks him to weave together. Jack O'Brien is the estimable director (2:25). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Pippin' Diane Paulus sends in the acrobats for her exhaustingly energetic revival of Stephen Schwartz and Roger O. Hirson's 1972 musical. As for the 99-pound story at the center of this muscle-bound spectacle -- the one about the starry-eyed son of Charlemagne (Matthew James Thomas) -- that's there too, if you look hard. With Patina Miller and a delightful Andrea Martin (2:35). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella' This ultimate and most enduring of makeover stories, via the team who gave us ''Oklahoma!,'' has been restyled by the director Mark Brokaw and the writer Douglas Carter Beane into a glittery patchwork of snark and sincerity, with a whole lot of fancy ball gowns. Laura Osnes and Santino Fontana are the appealing leading lovers (2:20). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Trip to Bountiful' Michael Wilson's slow-handed staging of Horton Foote's 1953 drama about an old woman's journey into the past is most notable for its remarkable star, Cicely Tyson, who seems thoroughly rejuvenated by her return to Broadway. The attractive supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr., Vanessa Williams, and in a lovely, low-key performance, Condola Rashad (2:10). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Portraying a woman mired in what appears to be a permanent midlife crisis, the marvelous comic actor Kristine Nielsen provides much of the laughing gas in Christopher Durang's uneven but intermittently delightful riff on Chekhovian themes. David Hyde Pierce and Sigourney Weaver also star in Nicholas Martin's production, smoothly transferred from a sellout run Off Broadway (2:30). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
'Bull' Mike Bartlett's efficient three-character, 55-minute exercise in human brutality, in which the workplace is transformed into a boxing ring, isn't as rich or complex as his ''Cockfight Play.'' But as directed by Clare Lizzimore, it may provide catharsis for theatergoers seeking to purge tensions by watching a metaphoric version of what happens during their regular office hours (:55). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Brantley)
'Bunty Berman Presents...' Though it sounds as if it should be a hoot, Ayub Khan Din's musical sendup of Indian movie-making is mostly only a whimper. Look hard and you can discern the reproachful outline of the brasher, more outrageously satisfying show it might have been. Scott Elliott directs a cast led by Mr. Din as a beleaguered Bombay producer. (2:30). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Call' Tanya Barfield's thoughtful, absorbing drama explores the tensions that arise when a white couple (the terrific Kerry Butler and Kelly AuCoin) decide to adopt an African baby. Their African-American friends, a lesbian couple well played by Eisa Davis and Crystal A. Dickinson, have different perspectives on their choice. Leigh Silverman directs (1:50). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'A Family for All Occasions' Bob Glaudini's dreary drama about a disorderly family whose patriarch, played by the fine Jeffrey DeMunn, finds an unlikely ally in his daughter's boyfriend (William Jackson Harper). Philip Seymour Hoffman's listless direction doesn't help (2:10). Bank Street Theater, 155 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 513-1080, labtheater.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)
&#x2605; '_______ Up Everything' The unprintable title of this winsome rock musical is trying way too hard to shock and awe. But then, so are all the show's characters, who are Brooklyn faux-hemians desperately trying to prove their anti-establishment bona fides. Poking fun at the pasty-white underbelly of Brooklyn's hipster crowd is like shooting free-range ducks in an artisanal barrel, but with catchy music and a talented cast, this show still does so exquisitely well (1:35). Elektra Theater, 669 Eighth Avenue, at 42nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, fueonstage.com. (Catherine Rampell)
&#x2605; 'Here Lies Love' An invigorating poperetta, conceived by David Byrne, that sets a new standard for audience participation. Or do I mean coercion? In this heady show about the heady life of Imelda Marcos, staged with infinite inventiveness by Alex Timbers, all the world's a dance floor, and all the men and women (including the audience) merely disco rats (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
'Love in the Time of Cholera' Directed by José Zayas and performed by an efficient four-actor crew, Caridad Svich's adaptation of the Gabriel García Márquez novel is pleasing but lightweight. A production cannot live on romance alone. In Spanish with subtitles (2:00). Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 889-2850, repertorio.org. (Claudia La Rocco)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30). Westside Theater/Upstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
'Nikolai and the Others' An estimable cast of 18, directed by the ensemble master David Cromer, works in harmonious disharmony in Richard Nelson's sprawling, occasionally soporific portrait of transplanted eminent Russians in leafy Connecticut in the late 1940s. The real-life models for the characters here include George Balanchine (a perfect Michael Cerveris) and Igor Stravinsky (John Glover) (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Old Hats' Bill Irwin and David Shiner, the peerless neo-vaudevillian jesters behind the long-running hit ''Fool Moon,'' have concocted a winning new compendium of nifty clown routines. The pixie-ish singer-songwriter Nellie McKay makes for a perfect musical foil in this ebullient, thoroughly charming variety show (1:50). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Old-Fashioned Prostitutes (A True Romance)' The great avant-garde auteur Richard Foreman returns to the stage with a gleeful brain-bender in which a man (Rocco Sisto) recalls his wilting salad days. Memory lane, for Mr. Foreman, turns out to be near Lewis Carroll's Wonderland, and his nostalgic frame of mind melts and warps like a Salvador Dalí clock. Great fun for organic head trippers (1:05). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Pinkolandia' Two young sisters from a family of Chilean exiles come of age in 1980s Wisconsin in this passionate and ambitious new play (2:10). Intar Theater, 500 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 695-6134, intartheatre.org. (Ken Jaworowski)
'A Public Reading of an Unproduced Screenplay About the Death of Walt Disney' Larry Pine gives a mesmerizing performance as the title character in Lucas Hnath's dark comic inversion of the Disney legend. The staccato, stylized writing can be wearying, but Sarah Benson's smooth direction and a terrific cast hold your attention fast (1:15). Soho Rep, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, sohorep.org. (Isherwood)
'These Halcyon Days' Deirdre Kinahan's two-hander about a man and a woman in a nursing home in Ireland boasts excellent performances by Anita Reeves and Stephen Brennan. At 70 minutes, the pace is brisk, and the play, which is occasionally sentimental, has the feel of a short story, with the emphasis on character: we get to know the hopes and disappointments of Sean and Patricia as their lives approach the end (1:10). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, irishartscenter.org. (Saltz)
'Who's Your Daddy?' It is impossible not to love the story told in Johnny O'Callaghan's solo show about his adoption of a 3-year-old Ugandan boy. Mr. O'Callaghan's onstage persona may dip into arrogance at times, but the production works up considerable suspense and occasional outrage, even though the outcome is a foregone conclusion (1:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Gates)
'Women of Will' Mixing casually delivered scholarly exposition with intensely rendered performance, this impassioned exploration of Shakespeare's heroines by Tina Packer traces their evolution through their language. When Ms. Packer and her co-star, Nigel Gore, get down to the business of acting, it's not just poetry in motion, it's thought made flesh. Eric Tucker directs (2:30). Gym at Judson, Judson Memorial Church, 55 Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, judson.org/The-Gym. (Brantley)

'The Hotel Colors' It's not quite the Hotel California, but there is a sense of lives adrift in Eliza Bent's debut play. A strong cast and Anna Brenner's direction lend heft to an engaging but uneven script (1:30). Bushwick Starr, 207 Starr Street, between Irving and Wyckoff Avenues, Brooklyn, (800) 836-3006, thebushwickstarr.org. (La Rocco)
&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00). Duplex Cabaret Theater, 61 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, pattiissues.brownpapertickets.com. (David Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Shadows' Hoi Polloi returns with its inventive 2011 stage adaptation of John Cassavetes's classic 1959 indie film. Directed by Alec Duffy, the troupe transcends the source material's narrative limitations with verve and audacity (1:20). Jack, 505 ½ Waverly Avenue, at Fulton Street, Brooklyn, jackny.org. (Webster)
&#x2605; 'Then She Fell' Inspired by Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books, this transporting immersive theater work occupies a dreamscape where the judgments and classifications of the waking mind are suspended. A guided tour of Wonderland, created by Third Rail Projects, leads its participants through a series of rooms and an interactive evening of dance, poetry, food and drink (2:00). Return engagement starts on Saturday. The Kingsland Ward at St. John's, 195 Maujer Street, near Humboldt Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 374-5196, thenshefell.com. (Brantley)
'Totally Tubular Time Machine' This show is less a play or musical than a big, campy, drinking party, with a little bit of singing thrown in. Held at an '80s-theme dance club in Midtown, it features celebrity impersonators who wander through the crowd handing out party favors (lollipops from Katy Perry, trucker hats from Justin Bieber) and taking turns at karaoke. The impersonations come with varying degrees of similitude and singing talent (2:00). Saturdays only. Culture Club, 20 West 39th Street, (212) 921-1999, totallytubularnyc.com. (Rampell)

'Core Values' (closes on Saturday) Reed Birney turns in a typically expert performance as the perky owner of a small travel agency trying to instill enthusiasm in his workers during a weekend retreat.

&#x2605; 'The Drawer Boy' (closes on Sunday) The Oberon Theater Ensemble does a fine job with this lovely play by Michael Healey about two farmers, one with a brain injury, and the writer who comes to observe them for the purposes of writing a play about farming. The humor is left wry and dry, and when it comes time to reveal the story of how the two men arrived at their present state, heartstrings are tugged expertly (2:00). Soho Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (866) 811-4111, sohoplayhouse.com. (Neil Genzlinger)

&#x2605; 'The Girl I Left Behind Me' (closes on Sunday) The gifted singer Jessica Walker and the playwright Neil Bartlett pay loving tribute to a bygone novelty of the late-19th- and early-20th-century stage: the cross-dressing female performers who enchanted audiences with their rich voices, comic or sentimental love songs, and faint odor of exoticism (1:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Isherwood)
'The Good Boy' (closes on Sunday) Michael Bonnabel's solo show about growing up with deaf parents has moments of real feeling but often feels as if it were written as an essay and memorized.

'I'm a Stranger Here Myself' (closes on Sunday) The cabaret singer Mark Nadler does an effective job of transforming what last year was a cabaret show into a theatrical production, annotating a journey through music that was created during the Weimar Republic or by composers like Kurt Weill after they escaped Naziism. The show starts out feeling like a pleasant history lesson but ends as a profoundly personal journey (1:45). Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820, yorktheatre.org. (Genzlinger)
'The Last Five Years' (closes on Saturday) Jason Robert Brown has mounted a stylish production of his two-character musical about the waxing and waning of young love. Adam Kantor and Betsy Wolfe play aspiring artists whose paths diverge. Their story is told in songs that are skillfully written but, like his characters, are on the generic side (1:25). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)
'Mariquitas' (closes on Sunday) Eduardo Machado returns to Cuba in this portrait of gay male hustlers. The source material is great, the pacing and length (more than two and a half hours) not so much (2:20). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 254-1109, theaterforthenewcity.net. (La Rocco)
'The Memory Show' (closes on Saturday) In reflecting the tensions of caring for someone -- and being someone -- with Alzheimer's disease, this brave, imbalanced musical dares to be ugly. Zach Redler's score is flecked with harshness and dissonance while Sara Cooper's book and lyrics present a mother and a daughter (Catherine Cox and Leslie Kritzer, both excellent) who are far from embraceable (1:25). The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010, new42.org. (Brantley)
'The Notebook of Trigorin' (closes on Saturday) This lackluster production from the Attic Theater Company doesn't make much of a case for Tennessee Williams's generally faithful but often overstated ''free adaptation'' of Chekhov's ''Seagull'' (2:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theflea.org. (Isherwood)
'Orphans' (closes on Sunday) In Lyle Kessler's 1983 play about motherless thugs, knives, guns, rope and fists are deployed to violent ends. Yet Daniel Sullivan's limp revival somehow plays like a sentimental sitcom, perhaps a low-rent ''Modern Family.'' Alec Baldwin, in slippery mode, plays the avuncular gangster, held hostage by two brothers: Ben Foster and the remarkably hyperkinetic Tom Sturridge (1:45). Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'queerSpawn' (closes on Sunday) Mallery Avidon's compassionate, bleakly funny play finds a high school freshman (the excellent David Rosenblatt) enduring daily humiliations -- and worse -- at the hands of gay-hating bullies. Unfortunately even imaginary friends like Dan Savage (David Greenspan) can't really help him much. Jesse Geiger directs this dark comic strip with a light touch (1:10). Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101, here.org. (Isherwood)

HEADLINE: Urging Government Action on Water, Roads and Power

BYLINE: By AMAN BATHEJA and KATE GALBRAITH.

 BODY:
Touting Texas' low taxes and light regulations, Gov. Rick Perry has relished trying to poach jobs from other states. In February, he described building a business in California as ''next to impossible.'' Last month, he warned Illinois entrepreneurs to ''get out while there's still time.''
Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago had a ready retort. ''We don't have to measure our showers like they do in Texas,'' he said.
Mr. Emanuel's jab was well aimed. Texas' drought and water-supply problems have captured headlines and inspired frank, worried comments from Texas officials. But with the state's rapid population growth projected to continue in future decades, other infrastructure problems also loom, including clogged roads and a strained power grid. 
''If we don't address these issues, the message is -- don't go to Texas,'' Bill Hammond, the president of the Texas Association of Business, said of financing for water and roads. (The Texas Association of Business is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)
The challenge is prominently on display in the waning days of the state legislative session. Lawmakers have access to a multibillion-dollar budget surplus but are struggling to find ways to finance roads and water projects that can draw support from Republican majorities wary of the proposals' large price tags.
''Everybody right now is saying no new fees and no new taxes,'' said Ed Emmett, the Harris County judge, who is looking for state financing for roads that would support busy and expanding gulf coast ports. ''And you have to spend money to build roads.''
Texas' population growth has propelled infrastructure strains into the spotlight. The statistics breed superlatives. From 2011 to 2012, Midland, an oil boomtown, ranked as the nation's fastest-growing metropolitan area, according to the United States Census Bureau. Of metropolitan areas with at least one million people, Austin was the fastest growing; Houston, Dallas and San Antonio also made the top 10.
''The state's population has more than doubled since 1970,'' said Michael Cline, the associate director of the Hobby Center for the Study of Texas at Rice University. ''It will probably more than double in the next 40 years.'' (Rice University is a corporate sponsor of The Tribune.)
Mr. Perry has a record of backing large infrastructure projects. Last decade, he supported a multibillion-dollar project to string transmission lines across Texas to harvest power from wind farms, and he also pushed, unsuccessfully, for a huge network of toll road, rail and utility corridors. Recently he has highlighted infrastructure challenges anew, warning that ignoring them will end the ''Texas miracle,'' shorthand for the state's recent economic success.
''It's also important to remember that a big part of convincing employers to come to Texas is convincing them we'll have adequate electricity, water and transportation infrastructure to fit their needs,'' Mr. Perry said last month in a speech to the Texas Lyceum conference on infrastructure. ''Now is the time to make sure we do.''
Of Texas' infrastructure challenges, water is considered the most pressing. Nearly three years of drought have taken a toll on reservoirs and aquifers. Two key reservoirs that supply Austin have fallen so low -- they are currently 39 percent full -- that most rice farmers downriver have been barred from using water from them this year and were last year as well. Eight small communities could run out of water within 45 days, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, and more than 20 others could be out by the end of the year.
''Water is going to be the great scarce natural resource in Texas in the 21st century,'' said Stephen L. Klineberg, co-director of the Kinder Institute for Urban Research at Rice.
Mr. Perry and other top officials have made water financing a priority during the legislative session, which ends in 10 days. After a protracted debate during this session on where the money should come from, budget leaders appeared poised to come to a deal on taking $2 billion from the state's bulging Rainy Day Fund, fed largely by oil and gas tax revenues, to endow a special fund for water projects. Voters may need to approve the fund.
Road financing, another of Mr. Perry's stated priorities this session, faces a trickier future. The Texas Department of Transportation has relied heavily on borrowed money and tolls in recent years to develop new roads. Its officials have warned lawmakers that they need $4 billion extra annually just to maintain the current level of congestion.
Efforts to find at least some of that financing have met significant resistance this session, particularly from Tea Party-friendly Republicans uninterested in raising vehicle registration fees or allowing the state to take on more debt. Talk of increasing financing for public transportation, which planning experts consider crucial for absorbing urban growth, has also met stiff resistance.
The department has enough financing on hand to continue projects through 2015, creating a perception that its situation could be handled in the legislative session scheduled for that year. Senator Robert Nichols, Republican of Jacksonville and chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, said that sentiment ignored how transportation projects develop.
''TxDOT needs to plan six years out, eight years out,'' Mr. Nichols said. ''You cannot do that if you don't know what revenue is going to be.''
The size of the challenge was evident at last month's Texas Lyceum conference, as speaker after speaker tried to convey how the state's runaway population growth and road network were on a collision course.
''We are looking at somewhere around 150 people moving to Austin every single day,'' said Linda Watson, president of Capital Metro, that city's public transportation provider. ''That's putting 70 cars on the road every day.''
A third infrastructure issue, the state's laboring power grid, has been a less visible concern for lawmakers. Texas has its own power grid, and keeping up with the summer air-conditioning load of a growing number of customers poses a perpetual challenge. Relatively low power prices have diminished the incentives for power companies to build new plants.
It is a problem that regulators are trying to solve, in part, by raising the maximum price that electricity-generating companies can get for their power. But in recent reports compiled at the behest of Congress, the nonprofit North American Electric Reliability Corporation has singled out the Texas grid as having particularly serious challenges in meeting future demand.
In economically prosperous parts of the state, infrastructure concerns are only growing more pressing. An oil drilling boom in West and South Texas has brought heavy truck traffic, leading to torn-up roads and a sharp rise in vehicle collisions, while also increasing strains on water and power supplies. Gulf coast ports are eager to accommodate rising trade, according to Mr. Emmett of Harris County, but need government money to assist with road and rail.
Without improvements to the infrastructure supporting the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, ''our economy will stagnate,'' said Mr. Emmett, who also heads the Transportation Department's freight advisory committee. ''You have to invest in infrastructure now in order to have an infrastructure in place for 20 and 30 years from now.''

HEADLINE: Regulators Tighten Rules On Trading of Derivatives

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Federal regulators approved new rules on Thursday to shine a light on Wall Street trading, but they also softened a crucial aspect of the plan in the face of lobbying pressure from the nation's biggest banks.
At a meeting in Washington, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission voted to adopt an overhaul of the derivatives market, pushing the risky activity from the shadows of Wall Street into the light of trading platforms. For decades, such trading has eluded regulators and the public.
''This is a paradigm shift for the American markets,'' the agency's chairman, Gary Gensler, said at the meeting. ''When light shines on a market, the economy and public benefit.'' 
Yet in the fine print, the agency also effectively empowered a handful of select banks to continue controlling the derivatives market, a main culprit in the financial crisis of 2008.
Just five banks hold more than 90 percent of all derivatives contracts, which allow companies to either speculate in the markets or protect against risk. This tight grip came under fire amid concerns that the banks overcharge some companies for derivatives and pose a systemic risk to the economy. Derivatives, for example, pushed the insurance giant American International Group to the brink of collapse before it was rescued by the government.
In the wake of the crisis, the trading commission initially planned to force hedge funds, asset managers and other corporations to contact at least five banks when seeking a price for a derivatives contract. The proposed requirement was intended to bolster competition among the banks.
But under pressure from the banks -- as well as some of the companies that buy derivatives -- the agency agreed to lower the requirement to two banks. About 15 months from now, the standard will rise to three banks, but the agency agreed to produce a study that could undermine that broader standard.
The loosening of the plan was the product of a compromise struck among the agency's five commissioners, who voted 4 to 1 in favor of it. Gary Gensler, the agency's Democratic chairman, pushed for the higher standard. So did Bart Chilton, a fellow Democrat and frequent critic of Wall Street risk-taking. But their plan met opposition from the agency's Republican commissioners, as well as Mark Wetjen, a Democratic commissioner who has sided with Wall Street on other rules.
Mr. Wetjen argued that five price quotes was an arbitrary number. He pushed for the two-bank plan, arguably the minimum required under Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, the law that mandated an overhaul of the derivatives market.
Even that compromise failed to please Wall Street. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Wall Street's main lobbying group, issued a statement saying the rules ''impair market liquidity at the expense of all market participants, ultimately harming the everyday investors that the rule aims to protect.''
But consumer advocates, and even some agency officials, questioned whether the agency ceded too much ground. In the futures market, regulators note, a request for a price quote must be broadcast to the entire market.
''I've never been a more sort of reluctant and reticent regulator than today on these rules,'' Mr. Chilton said at the meeting. ''I just wish we had reached a different compromise.''
Mr. Chilton still supported the rule, arguing that some plan was better than none. Mr. Gensler also voted in favor of the rule, calling it ''an appropriate balancing.'' Mr. Wetjen, who said that the more flexible plan ''is not code for status quo as some might suggest,'' also supported the rule.
Jill Sommers, a Republican commissioner, cast the lone vote against the plan. While Scott O'Malia, a Republican commissioner, argued that the agency should first conduct a study of derivatives data before ratcheting up the requirement from two banks to three, he still supported the plan.
In some ways, the compromise overshadowed the broader magnitude of the agency's effort.
Under the plan adopted on Thursday, many types of derivatives that have traded exclusively in private must now shift to a regulated trading platform for the first time. The platforms, known as swap execution facilities, will open a rare window into the secretive world of derivatives trading and serve as a check on risky activity, much like a stock exchange.
In another rule, adopted in a 3-to-2 vote on Thursday, the agency also required that large swaths of derivatives trades enter a swap execution facility. The so-called block trade rule, which spelled out what sort of trades were large enough that they would be exempt from the trading platforms, captured more derivatives than the financial industry had hoped.
A third rule further reinforced the trading mandate. In essence, it will require nearly every derivatives transaction that goes through a clearinghouse to also be traded on a swap execution facility.
''I want to underscore the significance of these three rules taken together,'' Mr. Gensler said. ''With these three rules today, no longer will this be a closed door market.''
Mr. Chilton was unsatisfied. Before casting his vote in favor of the plan, he said: ''I'm still holding my nose and biting my tongue.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Sales Go Cold, and Its Shares Feel the Chill

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Despite several quarters of controversy over bribery allegations in Mexico, Wal-Mart Stores' profitable earnings and strong sales in recent quarters made it a Wall Street darling, and its stock price hit a record high on Wednesday.
On Thursday, though, the company's financial picture worsened as it reported quarterly results that missed analysts' expectations, citing factors like a cold spring season and late tax refunds, and the stock price began to decline. Shares fell $1.36 to close at $78.50.
''We didn't have the first-quarter performance we wanted,'' Michael T. Duke, the chief executive, said in a statement. 
Net income rose 1.1 percent, to $3.8 billion, up 1.1 percent from the period a year earlier, while revenue rose 1 percent, to $114.2 billion; analysts expected revenue of $116.3 billion.
United States same-store sales dropped for the first time since the summer of 2011, declining by 1.4 percent, versus Wal-Mart's projection of around flat. Visits to stores also fell, by 1.8 percent in the quarter.
While consumers remained under pressure, nothing drastic had changed in their economic state in the quarter, said Charles M. Holley Jr., Wal-Mart's chief financial officer, in a call with reporters. Instead, the lower-than-expected sales in the United States were because of colder weather than last year, the payroll tax increase, tax refunds that came in later than usual and little inflation in food prices.
Internationally, the company's sales grew 2.9 percent, to $33 billion, and Wal-Mart said it increased market share in several countries despite the weak sales. Mr. Duke said that the company was ''disappointed in our expense control in International''; Mr. Holley explained that Walmart International lacks many of the tools the domestic business does in terms of forecasting when employees need to be in stores or when customer traffic will spike.
On a per-share basis, earnings for the fiscal first quarter, which ended April 30, were up 4.6 percent to $1.14 a share, a penny below analysts' expectations. The company forecast lower second-quarter profit than the $1.29 a share analysts were expecting, giving a range of $1.22 to $1.27. Its shares closed down 1.7 percent.
Expenses for the quarter shot up by 44.4 percent, or $200 million, mostly because of a larger-than-expected bill for the bribery allegations in Mexico Last year, The New York Times reported that Wal-Mart de Mexico officials had paid bribes to smooth expansion in the country, and executives at the company's Bentonville, Ark., headquarters had known of the bribes and declined to take action. After learning of The Times's investigation, Wal-Mart began an inquiry into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and also began a compliance review.
The company spent $73 million on expenses associated with those reviews, while it had expected to spend only $40 million to $45 million. Excluding that cost, Wal-Mart said its corporate expenses would have increased by just 14.6 percent. Mr. Holley said that Wal-Mart expects to spend $65 million to $70 million on those expenses in the second quarter.
More recently, labor and consumer groups have been pressuring Wal-Mart to take steps to ensure factory safety in Bangladesh, where it produces many of its goods and where a building collapse last month killed more than 1,000 workers.
This week, Wal-Mart announced it would not join a broad factory safety plan supported by H&M and other large retailers, but would pursue its own plan, including conducting inspections of the 279 Bangladeshi factories it uses.
It seems the working conditions in Bangladesh are not at the forefront for Walmart's shoppers. Mr. Holley said Thursday that ''we really haven't had much feedback from that.''

HEADLINE: Aiming for the Top, Again

BYLINE: By RANDALL SMITH

 BODY:
On Wall Street, the wheel of fortune can spin around and around, from enormous cash bonuses and luxurious perks one year to the unemployment line the next.
Then there is Fred Eckert, a onetime Goldman Sachs partner who soared as a star in ''vulture'' investing in ailing companies. But in the turmoil of the financial crisis, his business and wealth came crashing down. By 2011, he was bankrupt, divorced and, for two months, in a coma.
Today, he is in better shape, earning $1 million a year from a consulting job, although that expires next year. But most of his income is dedicated to paying leftover debts -- he says he is running at ''break-even at best'' after expenses.
It is a far cry from the luxury he enjoyed just a few years ago: an 11-bedroom mansion over 28 acres in the horse country of Bernardsville, N.J., 18 vintage automobiles and a 1,500-bottle wine collection. 
Now Mr. Eckert, 65, is planning to return to the arena. He says he has shed 25 pounds from his peak of 220 and has given up drinking. His cashmere overcoat may be rumpled, but his confidence is high.
Mr. Eckert is trying to start a new money management business by raising up to $100 million. The new company's name -- Phoenix Star Capital.
While even longtime friends say a comeback will be difficult, Mr. Eckert perseveres. He went to the SALT (for SkyBridge Alternatives) hedge fund conference in Las Vegas last week to try to drum up interest in his new venture.
''I'm going to make it back,'' he said in a recent interview. And this time, he vows, he will avoid ''the excesses, both in business and personally.''
His excesses were once the talk of Wall Street. For a lunch in 1993, he ordered a $6 Reuben sandwich -- made with corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and dressing -- with a $120 bottle of Corton-Charlemagne Burgundy.
''The waitress said it was the greatest disparity she had ever seen between the price of the entree and the price of the beverage,'' a former business partner, Thomas Inglesby, recalled in a legal deposition.
Mr. Eckert and his wife at the time were driven in Maybachs and Bentleys and vacationed on the French Riviera. From 2002 to 2008, the couple spent an average of $10.8 million a year, according to divorce papers filed by the wife in 2011.
Decked out in Brioni suits, Mr. Eckert was a raconteur with a quick wit and ''a personality that filled up the room,'' one colleague recalled. He dominated most conversations, and his fearlessness made associates believe they ''could slay any dragon.''
His rise came with a private equity fund he founded in 1994 at Sanford Weill's Travelers Group. The fund, Greenwich Street Capital, was spun off in 1999 and became the GSC Group. Through its distressed-debt investing, GSC participated in a 2002 takeover of the theater chain Regal Cinemas and a 2004 merger involving the printing giant R. R. Donnelley, with Mr. Eckert serving on the Regal and Donnelly boards.
At the top in 2007, GSC managed $28 billion and Mr. Eckert's 25 percent stake was worth as much as $250 million on paper. That year, he left his second wife and three sons to move into a $65,000-a-month suite in the Towers at the Waldorf-Astoria in Manhattan with a flight attendant from GSC's Gulfstream IV corporate jet.
But GSC had borrowed $250 million by February 2007, primarily to finance growth but also to make cash payouts to its top executives. Its timing could not have been worse, as the subprime crisis was beginning to freeze the credit markets.
GSC might have avoided bankruptcy by trimming its sails and working harmoniously with creditors, some former fund officials say. But Mr. Eckert, a veteran of many tough debt renegotiations, clashed with the firm's lenders when they rejected his proposed debt restructuring and would not approve 2008 bonus payments. He refused the banks' demand that he resign.
The firm filed for bankruptcy in 2010, as did Mr. Eckert in 2011. The Eckerts sold their home for just $7.9 million in 2010 to pay off debts but still owed $3.25 million to JPMorgan Chase and $2 million in federal and state taxes.
Early in 2011, he tripped in a parking lot after lunch at a Morristown, N.J., steakhouse, hitting his head. He was in a coma for two months. Mr. Eckert says he believes that the fall may have been caused by the interaction of a new prescription medication mix and alcohol.
Looking back, Mr. Eckert said he had been ''too optimistic'' about GSC's growth prospects and should not have taken on so much debt.
''I wanted to be as big as we could be. I wanted to be a major financial engineering company,'' he said. ''It just killed me to see the looks on the faces of the people I had hired when we closed the place. I was the pied piper.''
He attributed the firm's demise to ''the perfect storm'' that swept over markets and swamped many companies, not to big spending and his lavish lifestyle.
Mr. Eckert was the oldest of four children of a chemist who worked at the battery maker Globe-Union. Born Alfred Carl Eckert III, he grew up in a modest home in Wauwatosa, Wis.
Starting as a Goldman banker at $16,000 a year in 1973, Mr. Eckert specialized in corporate finance. He founded the firm's leveraged buyout business, which structured deals like the buyout of the department store chain R. H. Macy in 1986. He became a partner in 1984.
Some of his deals forged lifelong bonds with clients. John Bryan, one of five executives who led a 1984 buyout of the Georgia Gulf chemicals company, recalled that Goldman won the deal partly by offering management a 25 percent stake. But he said Mr. Eckert was able to combine financial analysis with ''the people part of things.''
Mr. Bryan attributed the banker's conspicuous consumption at least partly to ''a marketing strategy. He was establishing his 'street cred' in the heavy hitting deal making community.''
The Goldman executive lived large. He bought a Ferrari sports car for himself and a Rolls-Royce for his first wife.
He became an expert on the junk bonds used to finance buyouts. When that market tumbled in 1989, he started a fund at Goldman to invest in such bonds at a discount and seek control of the issuers. But vulture investments offended the firm's clients, and Goldman closed the fund.
Mr. Eckert left Goldman in 1991 to start his own fund with a colleague. He also split with his first wife and married a Goldman colleague, spending $15 million to buy and improve a 1904 Greek Revival mansion built for a member of the Ballantine brewing family
Mr. Eckert left that firm to form Greenwich Street Capital in 1994.
In his peak earning years, Mr. Eckert made $19 million in 2004 and $13 million in 2006, according to a court filing by his second wife. He often flew via private jet to Green Bay Packers games. ''When I land,'' he told colleagues, ''the only plane bigger than mine belongs to the owner of the visiting team.''
Aided by strong returns in some corporate debt funds, such as a loan fund run by Mr. Inglesby, his former business partner, GSC expanded into subprime mortgage debt. Mr. Eckert began taking steps for the firm to go public. Bankers said GSC could be worth $1 billion.
But in 2007, the subprime debt market began to collapse. When GSC was not able to comply with the terms of its bank debt in 2008, GSC's partners and outside investors like Jefferies & Company at first put up money to keep the firm afloat. It was not enough; GSC filed for bankruptcy in mid-2010.
Another alternative money manager, Black Diamond Capital Management, gained control of the firm by buying up its bank debt. During the bankruptcy, Mr. Eckert negotiated a three-year consulting pact with Black Diamond worth $3 million -- prompting other creditors to obtain his ouster as the trustee overseeing the sale.
Despite GSC's failure, Mr. Eckert was accused in divorce and bankruptcy court filings in fall 2011 of ''profligate spending'' on hotels and private jets and ''paying escorts for sexual favors'' while falling short on $44,000 a month required for family support. ''The vast majority of our assets have been wiped out,'' the former Ms. Eckert said.
Mr. Eckert disputes some of the accusations, noting they were part of an acrimonious divorce. He says the unpaid support was repaid.
His personal bankruptcy settled claims of about $25 million for $3.6 million; his second ex-wife and his children will receive $2.4 million over three years.
Recently, Mr. Eckert sent a letter to former GSC colleagues: ''I put my heart and soul into GSC, I tried my best and when the time came, I 'went down with the ship.' The demise of GSC was very much a cause of my personal bankruptcy filing and physical illness, and it coincided with a collapse in my personal life from which I am still recovering.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Europeans Rate Their Neighbors

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: How European Union nations stack up in trustworthiness, arrogance and compassion, according to fellow members &#8212; views probably reflecting both longstanding stereotypes and the recent debt crisis. 

 BODY:
Pew Research Center released a report this week about decaying sentiment in the European Union, based on its polls showing disintegrating support for the mission of the union. Of all the tidbits in the report, though, this table is probably the most interesting: 
It's kind of like the superlatives page in your high school yearbook: respondents in each country were asked "In what European Union country, if any, are people the most/least trustworthy/arrogant/compassionate?" The responses are of course influenced by longstanding cultural stereotypes, but probably also driven by recent frustrations in the European debt crisis.
Check out the first column: Everyone thinks Germans are the most trustworthy, except the Greeks (who name themselves for this superlative). And residents of every country consider themselves the most compassionate. Almost everybody thinks the Germans are least compassionate, except France and Germany. The data in the chart above refer to which country got a plurality of the votes for each question, but in the case of the "least compassionate" question, the Germans got a clear majority from Greek survey respondents (57 percent of whom named Germany as least compassionate).
And Germans would need a lot of compassion to understand the economic pain visited upon its neighbors. After all, the Germans report that they themselves are still doing relatively well:
Pew conducted the polls in eight European countries in March, by telephone or in person, with 700 to 1,100 adults surveyed in each country. Each poll has a margin of sampling error of either three or four percentage points.

HEADLINE: Andrew Mason's Life After Groupon

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Andrew Mason, the co-founder of Groupon, will be a part-time partner at Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley start-up incubator. He also plans to start a company. 

 BODY:
Andrew Mason is back.
In an online post on Thursday, Mr. Mason, the quirky co-founder of Groupon, announced his plans and gave an update on what he had been doing since being fired as Groupon's chief executive at the end of February. 
Mr. Mason revealed that he would become a part-time partner at Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley start-up incubator. That means he will spend one day a week over the next several months advising young companies. Later this summer, Mr. Mason, who has been based in Chicago, plans to move to San Francisco with his wife, he said.
Once there, he plans to start a company.
"If there's a silver lining to leaving Groupon, it's the opportunity to start something new," Mr. Mason said in the post. "I've accumulated a backlog of ideas over the last several years, my favorite of which I'll be turning into a new company this fall."
A onetime darling of the technology world, Groupon quickly fell from grace after going public in late 2011. The online commerce company reported quarter after quarter of disappointing results, and its stock price sank. It was not surprising to many observers when Mr. Mason was finally pushed out by the board.
(Still, the hedge fund Jana Partners apparently sees a promising future in Groupon; it accumulated a 3.3 percent stake in the company in the first quarter.)
In the months since leaving Groupon, Mr. Mason has been engaging in some "cliched pursuits of the unemployed," he said. Those include traveling, losing weight and reading.
And then there's the new album.
"One thing that surprised me" about managing Groupon employees, Mr. Mason said, "was that many would arrive at orientation with minimal understanding of basic business wisdom."
"I came to realize that there was a real need to present business wisdom in a format that is more accessible to the younger generation."
He continues:
It was with this in mind that I spent a week in LA earlier this month recording Hardly Workin', a seven song album of motivational business music targeted at people newly entering the workforce. These songs will help young people understand some of the ideas that I've found to be a key part of becoming a productive and effective employee. I'm really happy with the results and look forward to sharing them as soon as I figure out how to load music onto iTunes, hopefully in the next few weeks.
This is not a joke, according to TechCrunch, which says it has confirmed with Mr. Mason that the album "is for real."

HEADLINE: Why Indian Elites Like to Call Themselves 'Middle Class'

BYLINE: SAMBUDDHA MITRA MUSTAFI


HIGHLIGHT: Policies for the so-called middle class end up benefiting the rich at the expense of the poor, the author argues. 

 BODY:
If you are an Indian reading this, you are very likely among the top 10 percent in the country, since you have Internet access. It is also very likely that you, just like me, consider yourself middle class, though we are not anywhere close to the middle of this country in income or standard of living. We may well have trended the hashtag #IamSoMiddleClass last month, but being in the top decile of a 1.2 billion population, perhaps it's time to ask #WhyICallMyselfMiddleClass?
"The elite in many parts of the world do not like to be called the elite," said Dipankar Gupta, a sociologist. "In the U.K., they called themselves the nobility; in current American discourse, the elite are called the job creators. In India, the elite call themselves middle class." 
Like the rich in the United States who use the "job creator" tag to lobby for tax breaks, India's elite has devised the middle-class narrative to capture more public resources like fuel, food and education subsidies, often at the cost of the country's poor millions. Using their proximity to the center of power and media amplification, the rich, masquerading as the middle class, have a disproportionate influence in policy formulation and the Indian government's allocation of funds.
The diesel subsidies - which cost India an estimated $18 billion, according to Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission - illustrate the elite's capture of subsidies and its consequences. Much of the subsidies benefit big industries and the so-called middle class, who use the fuel to run their cars and power generators.
Farmers consume 12 to 18 percent of these subsidies - and those who do are the rich farmers who can afford tractors or pumps - but the majority of the small farmers hardly use any diesel.
Because diesel is much cheaper than gasoline, diesel cars have raced to capture 40 percent of the auto market, from merely 4 percent in 2000. The fast-growing S.U.V. segment runs almost entirely on diesel, as do the massive generators that insulate posh city hotels, offices and residences from power blackouts.
A government panel report last year called diesel subsidies a "major contributor to India's fiscal deterioration" that jacked up the national deficits and prompted international threats of a ratings downgrade. The report recommended phasing out diesel and cooking gas subsidies, which the government is now attempting at the risk of a middle-class backlash and media outrage.
The subsidies for the well-off don't stop there. Many rich Indians still pay small amounts like $400 a year for education in the country's top colleges - a legacy of deep government subsidies for higher education. In a country where millions still do not have access to basic primary education, the higher education subsidies have led to further widening of the gap between the rich and poor, critics say.
The elite capture of India's subsidies take a toll on the country's poorest, who genuinely need the discount for subsistence. The current public debate over the Food Security Bill highlights this problem.
Around 20 percent of India's population is malnourished, and 43 percent of children under 5 are underweight. These numbers have changed little despite the impressive economic growth of the last two decades, with neighbors Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Nepal doing better than India in the 2012 Global Hunger Index.
The ambitious Food Security Bill, approved by the country's cabinet but held up in a paralyzed Parliament, aims to provide nearly 70 percent of Indian households with five kilograms (11 pounds) of heavily subsidized wheat, rice and coarse grains every month. But critics say this is a wasteful expenditure, an irresponsible dole from a socialist government with an eye on parliamentary elections next year.
These critics conveniently overlook much larger doles from the government that benefit the rich: for example, this year's budget waived about $12 billion in customs duties on the import of gold, silver and jewelry. The additional costs in the food bill to feed India's hungry would amount to much less: $4.5 billion a year.
The economist Amartya Sen, in advocating the Food Security Bill, wrote: "The political support for tolerating - and defending - the present profligacy in catering to the relatively better off contrasts sharply with the fiscal alarm bells that are sounded whenever proposals for helping the poor, the hungry, the chronically unemployed come up."
India is going through its own version of the American Gilded Age, wrote Jayant Sinha, managing director of Omidyar Network India Advisors, and Ashutosh Varshney, a professor of political science at Brown University, in 2011. The Gilded Age (1865-1900) was marked by fast economic growth, business corruption and cronyism, a shift from agriculture to industry, rapid urbanization and the surge of a new middle class.
This was followed by the Progressive Era, a time of cleansing the system, ousting the corrupt and channeling private wealth into social causes. Presidents like Theodore Roosevelt (a Republican) and Woodrow Wilson (a Democrat), received wide support from middle-class professionals to weed out the corruption of the Gilded Age, to bring about major reforms in education and economic policies that gave more Americans a level playing field to prosper.
"Will India's political parties fight corruption as a nonpartisan matter?" asked Mr. Sinha and Mr. Varshney. "Will the rising middle class throw out the corrupt? Will the wealthy systematically embrace philanthropy?"
The short answer: it's too early to know. With only 25 percent of Indians in the middle class and hundreds of millions impatient to break into the zone, both the barons and the masses have incentives to glide on the gilded turf for a few more years.
But in the Delhi street protests, in the philanthropy of software tycoons like Azim Premji and Narayana Murthy who are working to educate disadvantaged Indians, in the example of business school students who are giving up corporate jobs to work in India's villages, there are faint green shoots of a progressive, compassionate society, a middle class whose values are evolving past the bling of its Gilded Age.

HEADLINE: The Problem With the Fed's Easy Money Policies

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: Are we moving from the bust to the bubble &#8212; and missing the recovery for average people? 

 BODY:
My most recent column incited a robust and welcome discussion. But few of my many critics, includingPaul Krugman on his blog andmany commenterson DealBook, seem to have engaged with my main point. 
My piece was not celebrating hedge fund managers. It was not predicting inflation and imminently rising rates or a debt crisis. Nor was the main point to rehash who got the financial crisis right or not.
Lastly, the main point was not to dwell on the Federal Reserve's credibility problem, though I think that's important.
What was my main point? We are four years into the One Percent's recovery. Now, we are in Round 3 of quantitative easing, the formal term for the Fed injecting hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy by purchasing longer-term assets like Treasury bonds and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac paper. What's that giving us? Overvalued stocks. Private equity firms racing to buy up Arizona real estate. Junk bond yields at record lows. Ratings shopping on structured financial products.
These are dangerous signs of prebubble activity. 
But, much more important, quantitative easing is not giving us a self-sustaining recovery and job creation. As I put it in the column, hedge fund managers "can read markets, and they can see that the Fed isn't engineering the hiring, inflation and recovery it would like." There's been a breakdown in the connection between wages and productivity. Labor participation is desperately low.
So are we moving from the bust to the bubble and missing the recovery for average people? 
And if so, why?
Many people argue that we need more fiscal stimulus. That's persuasive, but it's clearly not happening with today's Washington.
In response to my column, people have said: What else should the Fed do? Things would be far worse if the Fed weren't buying $85 billion in bonds a month. Look at Europe, whose monetary policy has been almost as big a disaster as its fiscal policy.
But how long do we have to wait? How much more wealthy do the One Percent get to become through speculation - how much house flipping do private equity firms get to do - before we see some sustained improvement in the rest of the economy?
And could it be that with a heavily indebted populace and a dysfunctional banking system still unable to lend effectively, that this round of quantitative easing is having a counterproductive effect? As evidence that the banking system transmission mechanism isn't working well, small businesses are having a hard time borrowing, according to a recent New York Fed poll.
One solution is that the Fed needs to have a heavy regulatory hand to limit speculative activities. Perhaps regulators should raise margin requirements for stocks. Put the ratings agencies on notice that they are watching out for any loosening of criteria. Make these efforts public and keep talking about them.
And then, maybe quantitative easing needs to be refocused away from long-term Treasuries and housing. Maybe the Fed could figure out a way to buy student debt or municipal bonds to support infrastructure.
If quantitative easing is necessary, it should support investment, not speculation.

HEADLINE: 10 Questions for the Tax Men of Congress

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: John Harwood sat down with the chairmen of the House and Senate tax-writing committees, Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, and Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, who suddenly find themselves at the center of action in Washington. 

 BODY:
The chairmen of the House and Senate tax-writing committees, Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, and Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, suddenly find themselves at the center of action in Washington. They have joined forces to push for an overhaul of the nation's tax code, which could pave the way to a budget deal between President Obama and Congress. And they have jumped to investigate the controversy surrounding the I.R.S.'s targeting of conservative groups that has dominated front pages for the last week.
Mr. Camp and Mr. Baucus sat down with John Harwood of The New York Times and CNBC on Thursday, one day before the House Ways and Means Committee held a hearing on the I.R.S.'s actions. What follows is a condensed, edited transcript of their conversation. 
 Q. 
 What do you want to hear from Steven Miller [the outgoing acting I.R.S. commissioner] now that he's been fired? Do you have confidence in the inspector general's report?
 MR. CAMP: Well, he's still the acting commissioner until June. So he's still the guy. Why did they target people for their political beliefs? And how pervasive was it? The I.G. report is not complete enough. It doesn't really describe why this occurred. Look, the American people need to have faith that the government is working on their behalf, not targeting them. We need to get answers before he goes.
 Q. 
 Do you have any reason to think that what happened at the I.R.S. was directed or caused to happen by anyone at the White House?
 MR. BAUCUS: We're just going to have to find out. Ask all the questions, get the facts, and let the facts determine our conclusions of where this goes to - not on behalf of the president, on behalf of one political party or the other. Our job is behalf of the American people. 
 MR. CAMP: I just don't know. We're going to follow this where it goes. It's important that we get the information, which we've been trying to get for more than two years. We've had repeated hearings in the Ways and Means Committee. And they've not been forthcoming. Not had the kind of candor that you'd expect from government officials. So we're going to try to get those answers tomorrow.
 Q. 
 The reason the I.R.S. issue strikes such a chord is there's so much distrust of government. Don't you think that many millions of Americans are going to look at tax reform, and look at all the lobbyists swarming around the Capitol and say, "That's going to be rigged for those lobbyists," including 28 of your former aides?
 MR. BAUCUS: The I.R.S. scandal is an opportunity to look into statutes which tend to create the scandal. They're very confusing. It's my goal, and I know it's Chairman Camp's goal, to be totally transparent, open in this process so that there is more trust all the way around. We want to go around lobbyists, around the special interest groups here in Washington D.C. and go directly to the American people. [Lobbyists] will do whatever they do. They're not influencing me. What's influencing me is how to make the code much more efficient, how to make it more simple, help individuals, help small business. That's what's driving me on this. That's my north star. 
 Q. 
 Let's talk a little bit about your bottom lines. To be worth it to you as a Ways and Means chairman, and to your party, do both top rates have to come down somewhat - corporate and individual?
 MR. CAMP: What we want to do is lower rates, and do that through closing special interest Washington loopholes. On the business side, we need more growth. Our economy isn't as healthy as it needs to be. And obviously a lot of businesses file as individuals. But the American people need a tax code that works for them, not a tax code that targets them. There's a real sense that, if you could only get the high-priced accountant or a lobbyist, you'd have that special provision, or you'd get a better deal. So part of this is simplifying the code, making it more transparent, not having the government pick winners and losers. 
Both [rates] need to come down. But we do that by closing loopholes. It's what we call revenue neutral - we're not trying to raise money in this bill. 
 Q. 
 He just said "revenue neutral." Isn't the bottom line for Democrats, for your Democratic president, that tax reform is only worth doing if it raises more money?
 MR. BAUCUS: The bottom line is getting reform. It is simplifying the code dramatically. But it is true that many would like revenue raised. We will not get tax reform unless there's a compromise on that question. I'm not sure what it is yet. I tell all my colleagues, "Keep an open mind on that." 
 Q. 
 Do you envision an endpoint that, as Chairman Camp articulated, would lower the top individual rate below 39.6 percent?
 MR. BAUCUS: There's much more agreement on lowering the corporate rate. On the individual side, I think we should work in that direction as well. It's more complicated. We will do our very best to try to figure out how to lower rates. But we have to also maintain the current distribution in the code so higher income people are paying the same proportionate amount of taxes.
 Q. 
 On loopholes and deductions, everybody knows the big moving parts: state and local taxes, home mortgage interest, charitable deductions. Would you call it tax reform if you don't touch all of those things?
 MR. CAMP: We're going to look at everything - start with a blank sheet of paper and decide what goes in, not take the current code and see what comes out. 
 MR. BAUCUS: Everything's on the table, because once something's off the table, then other groups will rationalize it, their provisions also should be off the table.
 Q. 
 To what degree do you look at what Senator Packwood and Representative Rostenkowski did, in passing tax reform more than 20 years ago, as your model?
 MR. CAMP: There are some things to be learned from that because they actually got it done. But I think probably what you learn most from that is, it had starts and stops. There were times when it looked like things weren't going to happen. But they stayed committed to trying to improve the lives of the American people through a simpler, fairer, flatter tax code.
 MR. BAUCUS: Back then, the president [Ronald Reagan] wanted reform -- the Congress didn't. This is reversed. Both chairmen want reform. The president's not opposed, but he's not as excited. And it's good that he's not as excited right now. This is an opportunity for us to break down some of the partisanship that's in this town, some of the political rhetoric. My approach is based on the facts. What effect on rates if we eliminate this deduction, that one? It's numbers and facts. 
 Q. 
 I talked to Packwood about this, and he said given how Washington's evolved, Camp and Baucus don't have the power because people in their parties beyond them are the ones ultimately who are going to say yes or no, we can do this or not.
 MR. CAMP: There are changes. The nation's evolved. It's not just leadership - all members are more empowered than they were 30 years ago. We're reaching out - that's why I created 11 bipartisan working groups. This is going to be a very different process.
 MR. BAUCUS: I'm talking to every single member of the Senate. It's not just members on the committee, but off the committee, so that they feel empowered as well. And when individual senators are more empowered, that's going to help us in the committee and help me guide reform.
 Q. 
 You are leaving the Senate. You are losing the gavel because of your term limits as chairman. Tell me your timetable practically speaking for when this is going to happen. By the end of 2013?
 MR. CAMP: I'm going to try to get something out of the committee this year.
 MR. BAUCUS: We probably will. And that's not bad. Back in 1986, that was an election year. And I think it's very possible to pass tax reform again in an election year in 2014.

HEADLINE: A Populated Park and Conservation in the Anthropocene

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A populated park as a model for Earth in the Anthropocene. 

 BODY:
Earlier this week, I spoke at the 20th meeting of the Adirondack Research Consortium.* This coalition of scientists and institutions has focused on providing data and analysis that can help sustain the ecological and economic integrity of New York's 6-million-acre, 120-year-old Adirondack Park. 
In my talk, I described the park as a positive example of what the biologist Erle C. Ellis calls "anthromes" - "ecological patterns created by sustained direct human interactions with ecosystems." 
Environmental management in such places can succeed when there's sustained scientific monitoring and engagement of diverse constituencies, I said, creating "zones of compromise, adaptability, and complexity."
Consider that the Adirondack region has seen people as variegated as snowmobilers and wildlife defenders - not always easily - continue working to find common ground. Welcome to the ecology of the Anthropocene - this era of Earth history that is increasingly of our own making.

During a break, Tomeka Weatherspoon of Mountain Lake PBS recorded an interview in which I provided an update on why I blog and discussed the importance of the Adirondacks as a test case in how human-developed landscapes can sustain rich biological webs. As I explained: 
It's a park but it's also a community - a bunch of communities. That's a fairly unusual thing, but it's representative of what we're going to see more and more in the world... There are certainly special places that need to be protected, with entry fees and that kind of thing. But when you look at other parts of the world, where resources and land use is more constrained, the idea of these hybrid landscapes, where you have people living potentially in harmony with natural systems, with pockets of beautiful biodiverse forest or wetlands, but amid a human-managed landscape, that's kind of where we're headed.... The Adirondacks is really a great template or model for how that can be done."
I encourage you to watch the chat and weigh in.

HEADLINE: 3 Foreign Companies Invest in U.S. Project to Export Liquid Gas

BYLINE: STANLEY REED


HIGHLIGHT: In a sign the United States shale gas boom is making global waves, two Japanese conglomerates and a big French energy player signed agreements on Friday to invest up to $7 billion in a liquefied natural gas project in Louisiana. 

 BODY:
LONDON - In a sign the United States shale gas boom is making global waves, two Japanese conglomerates and a big French energy player signed agreements on Friday to invest up to $7 billion in a liquefied natural gas project in Louisiana.
The companies - Mitsui and Mitsubishi of Japan, and GDF Suez of France - plan to each take a 16.6 percent stake in the gas-export plant being developed at Hackberry, La. The complex is being built by Sempra Energy, a San Diego-based company with annual revenue of about $10 billion. The companies agreed last year to help develop the project. 
 GDF Suez predicts that the plant will begin operations in 2017. The companies' final decision to make their investment will depend on the project's receiving necessary permits, GDF Suez said.
International companies, responding to a ravenous global appetite for natural gas, particularly in Japan and Europe, want access to shale gas from the United States, which has emerged as an important new source over the last few years. But because it is only in the last few years that the United States has shifted from being a gas importer to being self-sufficient in the fuel, the government has not yet agreed to allow exports except in a few cases and to the 20 countries with which it has free trade agreements, including Panama and Costa Rica.
Export approval, under consideration for several projects by the Energy Department, will be necessary before the potential of shale gas can be fully realized. On Friday, the department approved a Texas project called Freeport L.N.G. It has also signed off on a facility being built by Cheniere Energy at Sabine Pass in Louisiana that is expected to start exporting in 2015.
But international companies are investing all the same, betting that United States shale gas will eventually be able to go onto the global market.
In a statement, Sempra Energy estimated that the foreign partners would be putting up $6 billion to $7 billion in return for just less than half the equity in the project, which is forecast to yield 12 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas annually for 20 years. In return, they will receive all of the gas. Sempra will retain a stake of just more than 50 percent.
''These agreements represent a major step forward in the development of our L.N.G. export project,'' Sempra's president, Mark A. Snell, said in a statement. 
For international players, the attractions of United States shale gas are both the large potential volumes and the relatively low cost of extracting it.
Other foreign companies that have lined up American supplies include the Korean company Kogas; Sumitomo of Japan; and BG, the British-based company that is a big player in the liquefied natural gas business.
Natural gas prices in the United States are now about $4 per million British thermal units, the industry's standard measure. European-traded prices are in the $10 per million B.T.U.'s range, with Asian prices about $15 per million per B.T.U.'s. Long-term contract prices are often higher, and liquefication adds to the cost over plain gas.
Japan's liquefied natural gas imports have surged after the shutdown of nuclear power in the wake of the Fuksushima disaster and were up by 11 percent last year. Japanese imports account for roughly one-third of the world's total liquid gas market, according to a recent study by Bernstein research.
Japanese utility executives have said they want to reduce the prices they are paying by tying them to United States supplies.
''It is a win-win situation,'' said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer in New York. Such deals will help stabilize global fuel prices over the long term and benefit the United States economy, he said.
A big worry in the industry is whether United States' exports could contribute to lower prices around the world, eroding profits. ''It will give buyers a choice, something they have never had before,'' said Jonathan Stern, chairman of the gas program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.
But industry executives think that surging demand, especially from Asia, will easily absorb the exports that the United States government might eventually permit. 
United States gas ''won't have a material effect on long-term pricing,'' Martin Houston, BG's chief operating officer, said in a recent presentation on the company's Web site.
 Matt Wald contributed reporting from Washington.

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | $29.78 Million for Town-House-Size Living

BYLINE: MICHELLE HIGGINS


HIGHLIGHT: An 8,500-square-foot triplex, with seven bedrooms and eight baths, was created by combining two condominium units and was the most expensive residential sale of the week. 

 BODY:
An expansive penthouse at 320 West 12th Street, a former nursing home converted to luxury condominiums, sold for $29,783,812.50 and was the most expensive residential sale of the week, according to city records. 
The seven-bedroom, eight-bath apartment was created by combining No. 9, a four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath duplex originally listed for $19.5 million, with No. 7, a $10.5 million 3,200-square-foot unit below it, for a total of 8,500 square feet over three floors. It also has 1,200 square feet of outdoor space.

The buyer, represented by Giampiero Rispo of Domus Realty and Brett Miles of Town Residential, used a limited-liability company, Abingdon Property NYC.
"I think, what the buyer saw in it was this rare opportunity to aggregate serious square footage," said Tim Crowley, the managing director of Flank Development, which handled the conversion of the building, now known as the Abingdon.
The buyer was looking to relocate "a big family" downtown and had an open budget, Mr. Rispo said, but finding a suitably large apartment with outdoor space was not easy. "We checked everywhere," he said, "and in any price range it was impossible." He added that the search also involved a visit to the rock star Jon Bon Jovi's SoHo condo, listed for $42 million.
The Abingdon, formerly known as 607 Hudson, was bought for $33.3 million in January 2011. Although there are plenty of large town houses on prime blocks on the Upper East Side, Mr. Crowley noted, homes with 8,500 square feet in the West Village are "unheard-of." Theoretically, he said, you might be able to cobble two West Village town houses together to get similar square footage, but finding a prewar boutique condo in the West Village with that amount of space "is probably as close as you will see to a once-in-a-lifetime real estate opportunity in this city."
Town-house-size living was what Flank Development had planned when it converted the seven-story building into just 10 units, all larger than 3,200 square feet. The 1905 structure was once a home for working women; it was later a 200-bed nursing home. In its current iteration, it houses a gym and a sauna, and offers the services of doormen and porters.
The nearly $29.8 million sale price makes it the second-costliest deal in the West Village in recent years, according to Cityrealty.com. The 2010 sale of a 6,300-square-foot penthouse at 400 West 12th Street, the Superior Ink building, for $31.5 million, or roughly $5,000 a square foot, remains the most expensive.
 Big Ticket includes closed listings from the previous week, ending Wednesday.

HEADLINE: New Audit Allegations Show Flawed Statistical Thinking

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Some conservatives are alleging that the I.R.S. targeted not just conservative groups, but also individual conservative taxpayers. But a handful of anecdotal data points are not worth very much in a country of 300 million people. 

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service is under fire for inappropriately targeting conservative groups that sought tax-exempt status. As I wrote earlier this week, the revelation has the potential to motivate conservative turnout in the 2014 elections, perhaps costing Democrats as they seek to gain seats in the House and retain control of the Senate.
Some conservatives, however, are alleging that there is another component to the scandal. They accuse the I.R.S. of targeting not just conservative groups that sought 501(c)(4) status, but also individual taxpayers who oppose President Obama or have supported conservative causes. "The second part of the scandal is the auditing of political activists who have opposed the administration," the Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan wrote on Thursday, describing the I.R.S.'s actions as the "worst Washington scandal since Watergate." 
What evidence does Ms. Noonan present for this second allegation? She reports on four cases of conservatives who she says were targeted for audits, and infers that there were undoubtedly many more:
The Journal's Kim Strassel reported an Idaho businessman named Frank VanderSloot, who'd donated more than a million dollars to groups supporting Mitt Romney. He found himself last June, for the first time in 30 years, the target of I.R.S. auditors. His wife and his business were also soon audited. Hal Scherz, a Georgia physician, also came to the government's attention. He told ABC News: "It is odd that nothing changed on my tax return and I was never audited until I publicly criticized Obamacare." Franklin Graham, son of Billy, told Politico he believes his father was targeted. A conservative Catholic academic who has written for these pages faced questions about her meager freelance writing income. Many of these stories will come out, but not as many as there are.
Ms. Noonan is surely correct that many conservative taxpayers were audited. In fact, based on some simple math that I'll present in a moment, it's likely that hundreds of thousands of Mitt Romney voters were selected for an audit in 2012.
However, it's also likely that hundreds of thousands of Mr. Obama's supporters were audited. Although the percentage of taxpayers who are audited is relatively low - about 1 percent - the number of taxpayers in the United States is so large that this still yields well more than a million audits every year, across the political spectrum.
The I.R.S. publishes data each year on the number of taxpayers it audits. In 2012, it conducted just shy of 1.5 million audits out of 144 million individual income tax returns.
The probability of being audited is highest for high-income taxpayers - about 12 percent of individuals who made more than $1 million were audited in 2012 - although taxpayers who report little to no income are audited at higher rates than those with average incomes. In fact, about one-third of audits pertained to people who claimed the Earned Income Tax Credit, a benefit for low-income taxpayers.
In the table below, I've estimated the number of taxpayers in each income group who were audited in 2012, as derived from statistics in the I.R.S.'s 2012 Data Book. It is also possible to estimate how many Mitt Romney and Barack Obama voters would have been audited last year. The calculation assumes that an individual's chance of being audited was related to their income, but not to their political views.
I estimate the number of voters in each income bracket from the 2012 Current Population Survey. I then estimate the share of the vote in each income bracket that went to Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama based on last year's national exit poll. (Note that the income brackets used in the exit poll and the Current Population Survey do not exactly match the income brackets listed in the I.R.S.'s audit data, so I use the closest available approximations.)
This results in an estimate that about 380,000 of Mr. Romney's voters were audited last year, as were about 480,000 of Mr. Obama's voters.
To be clear, this calculation assumes that individuals' risk of being audited is independent of their political views. In fact, there is no way to know exactly how many supporters of each candidate were chosen for an audit - nor could there be, since individual-level voting records and audit records are private.
The point is, however, that even with no political targeting at all, hundreds of thousands of conservative voters would have been chosen for audits in the I.R.S.'s normal course of business. Among these hundreds of thousands of voters, thousands would undoubtedly have gone beyond merely voting to become political activists.
The fact that Ms. Noonan has identified four conservatives from that group of thousands provides no evidence at all toward her hypothesis. Nor would it tell us very much if dozens or even hundreds of conservative activists disclosed that they had been audited. This is exactly what you would expect in a country where there are 1.5 million audits every year.
None of this ought to take away from the major part of the I.R.S. scandal - the targeting of conservative groups that applied for 501(c)(4) status, which the I.R.S. has admitted to and for which the . And evidence could yet emerge that there was targeting of politically active individual taxpayers.
But the principle is important: a handful of anecdotal data points are not worth very much in a country of more than 300 million people. Ms. Noonan, and many other commentators, made a similar mistake last year in their analysis of the presidential election, when they cited evidence like the number of Mitt Romney yard signs in certain neighborhoods as an indication that he was likely to win, while dismissing polls that collectively surveyed hundreds of thousands of voters in swing states and largely showed Mr. Obama ahead.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths ALEXANDER, MARY

 BODY:
ALEXANDER--Mary, of New York, Palm Beach, Mansfield, New Jersey and Bucharest, Romania died peacefully at home in her 85th year, May 16th 2013, fighting to her last breaths, so bravely and surely, after an illness that took all of her away except her essence that remained to say goodbye to this good life she loved so much and lived so well. Mother of Raluca Allison of New York; grandmother to Raleigh Allison and Percy Allison; most loving wife to Nicholas Alexander, deceased and terribly missed these past seven years. She will be missed by so many whom she helped when help was needed; by so many whose course of life she changed; and above all by her closest family who inherited and were inspired by her energy, her ambition, her spirit of adventure, her love of culture, her unquenchable desire to improve, her vast curiosity, her presence as the force of life she was. 
Born and educated in Romania, she went on to get a PhD in economics, attain a senior position in the Central Bank where she oversaw major industries; winning the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest recognition for professional service; and yet accomplished all this without political affiliation under a communist system she viscerally opposed, and, despite marriage to a man, the 50-year love of her life, who was a scion of one of the country's leading pre-communist families. Here was a woman who had the courage and vision to flee this oppressive system in her forties, leaving everything behind family, friends, job, prestige, home, belongings, money for freedom and dignity and prosperity in the United States, the adopted country she and her husband so loved and gave so much to, and, most of all, for the opportunity to give their one and only daughter, Raluca, a life worth living. And Mary did all this with no supports except her own drives and family. She did all this with false starts. She did all this having to learn in mid-life a new language and new ways. And she succeeded establishing a successful business in the great American entrepreneurial tradition; building homes and new family roots; sending her daughter to Yale and Columbia and on to a successful family and business life of her own; involving herself politically as she felt she must and attending two Presidential inaugurals as an emblem of her American commitment; following her longstanding interest in poetry, opera, and the life of the mind; and all the while enjoying all the little, daily things of life. The life force she was devastated as she was by the loss of her dearest Nick in 2006 and by the onset of a long Alzheimer's journey never once was lost, so much so, that to her very last breaths she knew her family and her family knew her and she fought with the final grains of her body's strength to say goodbye. She will be remembered and honored. She will inspire those who knew her. Most of all her spirit is a presence in the lives of her family and descendants who are happy at her peace even as they grieve at their loss. A funeral service will take place at St. James' Church at 11:00am., May 20th followed by a private burial service at the Princeton Cemetery. Donations to St. James' Church in lieu of flowers.

HEADLINE: Newark Mayor Discloses $1.3 Million in Speaking Fees

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
NEWARK -- Mayor Cory A. Booker has turned his office into a platform for national celebrity, and he has been richly compensated for it, taking in more than $1.3 million in speaking fees over the last four and a half years.
In disclosure forms filed this week in preparation for his campaign for a United States Senate seat, Mr. Booker, 44, reported being paid $1,327,190 for 96 speeches since 2008. 
In documents released to the news media on Friday, he said he had paid $476,156 in taxes on the money he earned from speaking fees and donated $619,253 to charity, leaving him with about $232,000.
The amounts are somewhat higher than what Mr. Booker had disclosed previously.
In March, he told The New York Times that he had earned just over $1 million in the seven years since he took office, and kept ''very little, if any'' of the money. His disclosure forms do not indicate how much he took in during his first two years.
The mayor was elected in 2006 as a reformer, replacing Sharpe James, a machine politician who had ruled Newark for 30 years and later served 18 months in prison for fraud.
Mr. Booker was a rising political star when he took office, with a documentary celebrating his promise. But since then, he has faced criticism that his frequent travel and television appearances serve his growing national profile more than the 280,000 residents of this beleaguered city. He now has more than 1.3 million followers on Twitter.
The number of speeches he gave peaked at 24 in 2011, up from 6 in 2008. Mr. Booker has defended his travel by saying that it allows him to build Newark's profile, attracting philanthropy and development.
On Friday, his spokesman reiterated the benefits the speaking engagements have brought to Newark.
''They have helped the mayor connect to philanthropists and developers and attracted talented people to the city,'' the spokesman, Kevin Griffis, said in a statement. ''Further, his talks have helped to increase and improve the city's profile, and allowed the mayor to make significant contributions to Newark nonprofits and organizations hit especially hard during this difficult economic time.''
The Senate disclosure forms indicate that Mr. Booker holds $222,000 to $731,000 in assets, mostly stocks. The figures are reported using ranges, and his advisers said the actual figure was at the low end of that range.
He earned $174,496 in salary for his job as mayor of Newark. In addition, he owns a home in Newark assessed at just over $406,000.
The speeches, according to the disclosure forms, were mostly to colleges and universities or nonprofit groups, but some were to corporations. The sponsors included Google, United Way, the Association of Perioperative Registered Nurses in New Orleans, Baldwin Wallace University in Ohio, Brown University and the Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce.
His biggest fee in the last year, $31,500, was for a speech to the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles. His smallest, $10,500, was for a speech at the Stern School of Business at New York University.
His donations went mostly to Newark organizations, including several churches and private or charter schools, as well as a local Pop Warner football team.
Mr. Booker's plans have been the subject of much political speculation in New Jersey politics over the last year. Many Democrats had seen him as the best-known and most well-funded challenger to the popular Republican governor, Chris Christie, who is up for re-election in November.
The mayor announced in December that he would not challenge Mr. Christie, but would instead run next year for the Senate seat being vacated by Frank R. Lautenberg, where the chances of a Democrat winning are stronger. Still, other Democrats, including two of the state's Congressional representatives, Frank Pallone Jr. and Rush D. Holt, are also interested in that seat.

HEADLINE: Budget Office Says Obama Plan Would Cut Deficit by $1 Trillion

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's budget proposal, if enacted into law, would cut more than $1.1 trillion from the government's projected deficits over the next 10 years, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said on Friday. It would bring deficits down to near 2 percent of economic output, a level many economists consider safe in the long term. And it would hold them there for years to come.
But the proposal, which was released just last month, has already been mostly forgotten in Washington. Senate Democrats and House Republicans have not agreed to come to the table to split the difference between their budgets, either. After two years of knock-down, drag-out fights over taxes and spending, the budget has been put on the back burner, at least for now. 
In part that is because the gap between spending and revenue has started to shrink substantially, in response to earlier tax increases, spending cuts and a strengthening economy. Earlier this week, the budget office sharply cut its estimate of the current fiscal-year deficit by more than $200 billion, on higher-than-anticipated tax receipts and big payments to the Treasury from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage financiers. Were Congress to do nothing and the economy avoid running into a ditch, the deficit would fall to just over 2 percent of economic output in 2015.
It is also because the series of automatic cuts, ceilings and self-imposed crises have for the most part ended. The so-called fiscal cliff was avoided when at the beginning of the year Congress managed to pass a more-moderate package of tax increases and cuts. The $85 billion in cuts to domestic and military programs known as sequestration has already hit, with lawmakers doing little to change them.
That has left nothing on the horizon to force Congress's hand until it needs to raise the debt ceiling, a statutory borrowing limit. But because of strong tax receipts and the sequestration spending cuts, it might not need to tackle that issue until October or even later.
Separately, lawmakers and the White House have focused their attention on other priorities, particularly gun laws, immigration reform and a series of scandals. This week, for instance, it was a fracas over the revelation that Internal Revenue Service employees targeted conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status.
But some members of Congress, along with President Obama, are still vowing to tackle the country's long-term deficits even though there is no imminent threat. Without Congressional action, the deficit, as measured as a proportion of economic output, could start rising again in the latter half of the decade, the Congressional Budget Office warned again this week. If health care spending starts rising again sharply and debt payments soar as interest rates rise, many experts fear that those costs will eventually crowd out financing for the government's other priorities.
''It is encouraging to see that the president's proposals would indeed begin to reduce the debt, and to lower levels than originally thought,'' said Maya MacGuineas of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a budget watchdog, in a statement responding to the new budget office estimate. ''Regardless, additional reforms will be needed over the long-term, especially to slow the growth of health care programs and shore up Social Security,'' she said.
On some issues, Republicans and Democrats are closer than their heated rhetoric might let on. For instance, Mr. Obama included in his budget proposal cuts to Social Security and Medicare that are anathema for many Democrats, showing a willingness to spread the political pain as part of a larger budget deal in a bid to encourage Republicans to bargain. One major change would alter the calculation used to ensure that Social Security payments kept up with the pace of inflation, providing less money to seniors over time.
His proposal also includes almost $1 trillion in tax increases, by further limiting the deductions and exclusions high-income families can claim, increasing taxes on tobacco and introducing the so-called Buffett Rule, a new minimum tax on income over $1 million. Republicans have refused to consider changes to increase revenue, arguing that money raised from closing loopholes should be used to bring down overall tax rates.
Mr. Obama's proposal would widen deficits slightly in the fiscal years 2013 through 2015, the budget office said, but trim them later on. Starting in 2014, his tax increases would lift revenue gradually from about $27 billion to $155 billion a year. Spending would increase by as much as $142 billion a year until 2018, when it would decline beneath the levels indicated by current law.
The two parties are principally at odds over priorities like infrastructure, science, agriculture and education, and on Medicaid, the health care program for the poor and disabled.
In 2023, the House Republicans plan would put the level of Social Security and Medicare spending very close to where the White House would -- about 8.7 or 8.8 percent of economic output, according to an analysis by Douglas W. Elmendorf, the director of the budget office. Mr. Obama is calling for modestly smaller military spending, at 2.4 percent of economic output, compared with the House Republicans' 2.7 percent.
The White House would spend 7.7 percent on everything else, including housing programs, unemployment insurance, Medicaid, health insurance subsidies and education. The House would spend just 5.2 percent.
The Congressional Budget Office does not analyze Congressional budget resolutions. The House and Senate budget committees put forward revenue and spending estimates of their own plans based on Congressional Budget Office data, but both plans lack a lot of detail.
When it released its plan, the Obama White House claimed that it saved $1.8 trillion over 10 years. The divergence between its estimate and the budget office's stems from the fact that the White House assumed the $85 billion in automatic budget cuts would be repealed or replaced with a new policy. The budget office did not.
Other than that, the independent office's assessment of how the budget proposal would affect spending and revenue differs only marginally from the White House's own.

HEADLINE: A Troubling Survey on Global Corruption

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
CORRUPTION is a growth business.
Bribery scandals have dominated headlines in several countries in recent months, among them India and Nigeria. International enforcement of antibribery laws has been increasing in the United States and major European countries. 
A new survey of corporate officials and employees in 36 countries -- in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, as well as India -- indicates that there is plenty of corruption that needs investigating.
Over all, 20 percent of the respondents said they knew of incidents at their own companies within the previous year that could be construed as cooking the books -- moves to either understate expenses or overstate revenue. Among senior managers and directors, the figure was 42 percent.
The survey was conducted late last year by Ipsos, a market research firm, on behalf of Ernst & Young, a major accounting firm.
Ernst did not break down responses to the cooking-the-books question by country, but indicated that managers from emerging markets were more likely to say that had happened than were managers from more developed economies.
The firm did provide country-by-country results for some questions, as can be seen in the accompanying charts. Asked if companies in their countries ''often report their financial performance as better than it is,'' more than half the respondents in nine countries -- Nigeria, Slovenia, Russia, Spain, Croatia, India, Serbia, Kenya and Austria -- said that they did.
At the other end of the scale, fewer than a quarter of respondents in eight countries -- Finland, Norway, Switzerland, France, Romania, Sweden, Hungary and the Netherlands -- said that happened.
The survey was commissioned by Ernst's fraud investigation and dispute services group, which does not perform standard corporate audits but instead is hired by companies to look for signs of corruption or fraud in their own operations. It did not include either China or the United States.
David Stulb, the global leader of that group, said it was growing in part because many companies were worried about enforcement of the American Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars the bribing of foreign officials, and of similar laws in other developed countries. Those surveyed included employees and officials of overseas subsidiaries of multinational companies. The respondents were promised anonymity, Ernst said.
The survey revealed what Ernst called a ''corruption perception gap'' in many countries, where respondents said bribery and corrupt practices were far more common in other parts of their country than they were in their own industry. At the extreme, 94 percent of respondents in Kenya thought corruption was widespread in the country, but only 34 percent thought it was a problem in their own industry.
The responses indicated that corruption and bribery are rare in the Scandinavian countries, but common in some Southern and Eastern European countries, as well as in India, the Middle East and Africa.

Most thought corruption was more common in other industries than it was in their own. (Source: Ernst & Young)

HEADLINE: Immigrant Workers Give New Direction To Los Angeles Unions

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- As the head of the hotel workers' union here in the 1990s, Maria Elena Durazo negotiated a contract with provisions rarely seen by labor unions: The jobs of workers who were deported or lost authorization to work in the United States would be held open for two years, with the same pay.
It was remarkable protection for the immigrant workers who made up the bulk of the union's membership -- and it implicitly acknowledged that many of those immigrants were working without legal papers.
In the years since, Ms. Durazo, 60, has become one of the most prominent labor leaders advocating an overhaul of the country's immigration policies. As the executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, she presides over what is widely perceived as the most successful group of unions in the country. While union membership is declining nationally, it is growing in California, and much of that growth can be attributed to Latino immigrants. 
And many believe immigrants offer the best potential for growth in a movement that is often viewed as foundering.
''You look around at who has the most difficult jobs, at who is doing the work we rely on every day, and it is immigrants,'' Ms. Durazo said in an interview here. ''If we look at what we can do for them, what we can do together, we see that there can be very important rewards that will improve their lives. We cannot fix the prosperity of the rest of the country without improving the prosperity of immigrants.''
It is impossible to know just how many of the roughly 800,000 union members in Los Angeles are in the country illegally, often using fake Social Security numbers or other forged papers. But the county has an estimated 900,000 illegal immigrants, more than any other in the country, and according to the Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration at the University of Southern California they make up about 9 percent of the state's work force.
The power of the heavily immigrant unions can be seen in huge protests in Los Angeles, as well as in the extensive voter outreach operations across the city. And while Ms. Durazo remains focused on the immigration debate in Congress, she is simultaneously marshaling her troops to help elect a new mayor here and prevent the sale of The Los Angeles Times to the conservative billionaires Charles G. Koch and David H. Koch.
In the mayoral race, the unions have backed Wendy Greuel, the city controller, against Eric M. Garcetti, a city councilman, and have spent millions helping her. This week, the union mailed fliers suggesting that if Ms. Greuel was elected, the minimum wage would be raised to $15. Ms. Greuel has said she would support raising wages at the city's largest hotels to $15, but has not backed a citywide increase.
Ms. Durazo has often enraged local business leaders, but successful campaigns to require a living wage in some of the city's hotels and to unionize carwash workers have earned her respect and devotion among many immigrants, who often line up to see her as she travels around the country.
''As the immigrant population starts to spread to other cities, you are going to see more and more attempts to recreate the kind of victories the unions have had here,'' said Peter Dreier, a professor at Occidental College who has studied unions at the local and national levels. He pointed to the successful campaigns by janitors in Texas and Florida as recent examples. ''We see clearly that immigrants are willing to play a significant role in politics and that they are used to being part of a movement.''
''Los Angeles became the model and now Maria Elena is spreading the gospel,'' Dr. Dreier said.
But critics of immigration reform take a far less charitable view, saying that the unions have failed to save jobs for American-born workers.
''They are simply searching for ways to make themselves relevant again,'' said Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group opposed to the immigration bill being discussed in the Senate. ''Particularly in the large service industries, they are coming along to protect the people working in these jobs illegally.''
Ms. Durazo grew up as one of 11 children of Mexican immigrant farmworkers who traveled all over Central California to find jobs picking crops. She went to college and began work with unions and later got a law degree.
In 1989, she took over as the head of the local chapter of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union after local leaders fought against providing Spanish translations of information for their members. At the time, some viewed her victory as a coup, while others saw it as an inevitable change because of the shifting demographics.
Much of labor's success in Los Angeles is attributed to Ms. Durazo's husband, Miguel Contreras, who as the head of the county labor federation built a coalition of elected officials, clergy and civil rights advocates. In 2006, a year after his death, Ms. Durazo was elected to his post of executive secretary-treasurer, overseeing 350 unions, including government workers, teachers, janitors and security guards.
Mr. Contreras, with help from Ms. Durazo and other labor leaders, had successfully begun recruiting new candidates for political office, including several Latinos who had long supported immigrant rights and labor unions, said Madeline Janis, the national policy director of Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, which she helped found with the support of Ms. Durazo in the 1990s.
''Unlike almost any other place, the leadership here realized that immigrants could get out and knock on doors and convince people to vote, even if they themselves were not eligible to do so,'' Ms. Janis said. ''That really transformed California politics and was a precursor to what is happening nationally today.''
Many say Ms. Durazo helped make immigration a priority for unions nationally by framing the issue as an extension of the civil rights struggle. In 2003, she entered the national stage with the ''Immigrant Workers Freedom Ride,'' stopping across the country to draw attention to the plight of illegal immigrants.
''There is now a collective understanding that what is happening to immigrant workers -- the kinds of abuse and theft they experience every day -- is just wrong,'' said Angelica Salas, the executive director of the Coalition for Human Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. Ms. Salas said that workers' immigration status frequently thwarts the unions' efforts to organize new employees or improve conditions. ''We hear all the time that people fear speaking out because they will be fired or deported.''
Eliseo Medina, the international secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union, said unions' attitudes toward illegal immigrants had changed over the decades in part because more Latinos like him and Ms. Durazo have climbed through the ranks.
''Most of us are only one or two steps removed from a friend or a relative who is undocumented,'' Mr. Medina said. ''We all understand that this is a much more of an entire community issue. When people started equating illegal with Latinos, it forced us to come together.''
While many say that immigration status often stops workers from unionizing, Mr. Medina said the efforts to organize low-wage workers here showed that many immigrants were ''fearless.''
''Immigration and labor has become so integrated, because in order to organize workers you are going to have to deal with immigrant rights,'' said Victor Narro of the Labor Center at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''Immigrants are really the source of optimism for the labor movement.''

HEADLINE: Indicators Offer Signs Of Growth For Future

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A measure of the economy's future health rose solidly in April, buoyed by a sharp rise in applications to build homes and a better job market. 
The Conference Board said on Friday that its index of leading indicators increased 0.6 percent last month to a reading of 95. The index declined 0.2 percent in March.
The index is intended to signal economic conditions three to six months out.
Kenneth Goldstein, an economist at the Conference Board, said the index was 3.5 percent higher at an annual rate than it was six months ago, suggesting expansion for the economy.
Mr. Goldstein said steady job gains and a recovering housing market were driving the economy and helping offset deep federal spending cuts that threaten growth.
The index is composed of 10 forward-pointing indicators. Strength in April came from the surge in building permits, a drop in applications for unemployment benefits and a rising stock market.
Holding the index back in April were weaker consumer confidence and a decline in the average hours worked at American factories.
A separate report on Friday showed that consumer confidence rose to almost a six-year high in early May. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 83.7, from 76.4 in April.
Economists attributed the gain to high stock prices, cheaper gas and solid employment gains.
''Changes in confidence don't always filter through into changes in spending, but the omens are good,'' said Amna Asaf, an economist at Capital Economics.
The job market has also improved over the last six months. The economy has added an average of 208,000 jobs a month since November, compared with only 138,000 a month in the previous six months.
Unemployment has fallen to a four-year low of 7.5 percent.
A rebound in housing, along with a limited supply of homes for sale, has lifted the construction industry.
Construction cooled in April, as builders broke ground on fewer homes after topping the one million mark in March for the first time since 2008. But most of the decline was in apartment construction, which tends to vary sharply from month to month.
The most encouraging sign for the industry last month was that applications for new construction reached a five-year peak. That suggests that the housing revival will be sustained.

HEADLINE: European Auto Sales Rise In April, With an Asterisk

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
European auto sales broke an 18-month losing streak in April, industry data showed on Friday. But don't pop open the Champagne just yet: the increase was mostly a trick of the calendar.
New car registrations in the 27-nation European Union rose 1.7 percent in April from a year earlier, the first increase since September 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported from Brussels.
But the association pegged that improvement mainly to the fact that April had two more business days this year than last. 
Cara McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the automakers' association, said that was because the Easter holiday fell in March this year instead of in April as in 2012. Even with the extra days, she said, the year-over-year comparison was underwhelming, as car sales in April 2012 in the European Union were the worst on record for that month.
''We cannot talk about the market picking up at this stage,'' she said.
The overall trend in car sales remains a dismal one: April sales, at just over one million units, were still the third-lowest total recorded for that month since the association started compiling the data in 1990.
Many European households remain reluctant to spend on big-ticket items in a grinding recession and a precarious labor market. Unemployment in the 17-nation euro zone stands at 12.1 percent. Many Europeans view cars as a lifestyle option rather than a necessity.
More ominous for the car industry, a major generational shift appears to be under way, with younger Europeans, like their American counterparts, far less interested in car ownership than their parents and grandparents were.
One-third of the way through this year, Friday's report showed, new-car sales were down 7.1 percent from the first four months of 2012. Last year was particularly bad, as annual sales fell to just over 12 million, the fewest since 1995.
For all of that, though, investors on Friday seemed to embrace the headline number as a sign that the auto market might be reaching its nadir.
Shares of PSA Peugeot Citroën rose 10.2 percent in Paris, while Renault closed 3.6 percent higher. In Frankfurt, Volkswagen gained 3.7 percent, and Daimler rose 3.9 percent.
Michael Tyndall, an auto analyst at Barclays Capital in London, said that while it was understandable that people were grasping for good news, the weakness in Europe was not over.
He predicted, though, that the market would hit bottom before the end of the year and that it would manage growth of just over 1 percent in 2014.
Replacement demand, he noted, might remain insufficient to bolster the market for some time, given that the age of cars on European roads is relatively young -- about 8.5 years, on average, compared with 11 years in the United States.
The latest data showed that Germany's auto market, the largest in Europe, grew 3.8 percent in April, while Spain's expanded 10.8 percent. The market in Britain, Europe's second-largest, grew 14.8 percent. But the third-largest market, France, continued its slump, shrinking 5.3 percent, while Italy's declined 10.8 percent.
The four-month trend showed that among major markets, only Britain grew, with car sales up 8.9 percent. New-car sales in Germany were down 8.5 percent in that period.
Sascha Gommel, an auto analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said he believed that the market was ''bottoming out at the moment.''
Even so, a return to precrisis sales ''is a very long way down the road,'' he said. ''We wouldn't be surprised if the market never gets back to those levels.''

HEADLINE: As Obama Pushes Overhaul of Food Aid, Panels in Congress Favor Smaller Changes

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In response to the Obama administration's plans to overhaul the nation's international food aid program, which provides food to disaster-stricken regions, Congress this week began laying the groundwork for its own changes.
Farm bills passed this week by the House and Senate Agriculture Committees do not go as far as the Obama administration's proposal, which would move the $1.4 billion program from the budget of the Agriculture Department to the foreign affairs budget in an effort to speed delivery and cut costs. The bills reauthorized the food aid program and left it largely intact, in the agriculture budget. 
Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan and the chairwoman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said she had had conversations with the Obama administration about changes to the food aid program.
''We chose to keep it in the Agriculture Department, but give it more flexibility,'' she said in a conference call with reporters on Thursday. ''I think it's a big step forward, and it had bipartisan support.''
Tamara Hinton, a spokeswoman for the House Agriculture Committee, said there was also widespread support among members of the committee for keeping food aid in the farm bill.
She said the bill passed the committee with overwhelming support, 36 to 10, without any amendments to move the food aid program out of the farm bill.
The Obama administration is also proposing that the government buy some food in developing countries instead of just shipping food produced by American farmers, a process that typically takes months. More than half of the food would still have to be purchased and shipped from the United States.
The Senate bill would extend a pilot program that lets the Agency for International Development use some money to buy food locally.
Also under the bill, antihunger groups that receive food to sell to finance their development programs would have to reach a 70 percent rate of return on the sales or send a report to Congress explaining the shortfall. A 2011 Government Accountability Office study found that groups typically lost money on the transactions. The House bill also addresses the issue, known as ''monetization,'' saying the practice should be used in countries where it makes sense.
Critics of the practice of providing American-grown grains to international charities say it hurts local farmers by increasing competition. The administration's proposal would end the practice.
Several antihunger charities, which have long supported major changes to the food aid program, said they were disappointed by the Senate and House farm bills, but not surprised by them.
''We would have liked to have seen more movement on this in the farm bill; I really wouldn't call what they did reform,'' said Blake Selzer, a senior policy advocate with CARE, a group that in 2007 stopped taking food from the government to sell.
Supporters of the current food aid program, like shippers, agriculture trade groups and some antihunger charities, said they were pleased that the Agriculture Committees kept it in the farm bill.
''Our position is that we need to keep the food in food aid,'' said Dale Moore, the executive director of public policy for the American Farm Bureau Federation, which represents American farmers. ''What we are wondering is why they need to make this radical change for a program that works well.''
The House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday introduced its own bill to overhaul the food aid program. Sponsored by the committee's chairman, Ed Royce, Republican of California, and Representative Karen Bass, Democrat of California, the legislation would make changes to the food aid program that generally follow those laid out by the Obama administration.
Mr. Royce, who has been a critic of President Obama's overall budget proposals, said the overhaul was common sense.
''The system through which the United States provides food aid to those facing starvation is needlessly inefficient and ineffective,'' Mr. Royce said. ''Especially given the current fiscal environment, it is critical that we enable the U.S. to reach two million more people while reducing mandatory spending by $500 million over 10 years.''
Danny Murphy, a farmer in Canton, Miss., who is president of the American Soybean Association, said the change would be a disaster for American agriculture and the economy. He said countries receiving cash instead of food aid could use the money to buy from American competitors like Canada or Brazil.
''And we can't vouch for the safety of the food,'' Mr. Murphy said.
Officials at the aid agency said that food bought from local markets was safe and that safeguards were in place to prevent food from being purchased from competitors.
The House Foreign Relations Committee bill was endorsed by several antihunger charities, including Oxfam America, CARE, the American Jewish World Service and Bread for the World.
''These reforms -- if enacted -- mean the U.S. would be able to deliver lifesaving food assistance more quickly, more efficiently and to millions of more hungry people every year with the same taxpayer resources,'' the groups said in a statement.
The House and Senate Appropriations Committees are also expected to take up food aid overhauls, but no timetable has been given.
Dan Glickman, an agriculture secretary in the Clinton administration, who now works on global development issues, said changes to the food aid program faced an uphill battle in Congress this year. But he said he expected that the changes would eventually happen.
''People are really beginning to talk about our food aid program and if it still serves the purpose it once did,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Hidden Costs of Buying on the Cheap

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- The Children's Place, a clothing-store chain, has acknowledged sourcing from the Bangladeshi factory complex that collapsed last month and killed more than 1,100 people. But far from the rubble, on a slow day at a store in the Flatlands section of Brooklyn, the faraway deaths had yet to inspire a new awareness about the people who stitch the $4 ''Royal Cutie'' T-shirts, $9 floral onesies and $10 blue plaid shorts.
''They don't really let us know where the clothes are made,'' a Children's Place saleswoman said, handling wares whose labels disclose only countries -- Vietnam, China, Bangladesh. ''I guess that's not really our business. We just sell them.'' 
Mysterious origins are a hidden cost of cheap things. To spend a day in the diverse stores of New York -- from the working-class area of Flatlands to the gentrifying Brooklyn neighborhood of Park Slope to the moneyed Upper East Side -- is to encounter yet another line dividing the prosperous from the poor.
To have money today is often to acquire the right to know which person knitted your sweater or which farm bred the pigs in your chorizo. To be without money is to buy from a placeless netherworld and be told to take it or leave it, no questions asked.
It's a strange reversal. For most of history, the poor would have eaten the local pigs and known the origin of their socks, and the rich had better access to a global marketplace. But changing elite tastes and the relentless efficiency of supply chains have slowly inverted tastes: In many categories, the poor now buy from the exotic unknown, and the rich insist on what can be traced, from the pig next door to the locally sewn sock.
At the Payless Shoesource down the street from The Children's Place, origins are hidden -- under the tongues of shoes, or inside where the ankles lurk. ''They all say 'Made in China,''' a saleswoman says, when asked about the shoes' manufacture. ''That I know. But they don't tell us anything else.''
Now get on the No. 5 train and get off 17 stops later at 59th Street, on Manhattan's Upper East Side.
Walk into The Art of Shaving on Madison Avenue, whose Fusion Engraved Nickel Plated Shaving Set costs $600. If, when the clerk offers help, you decline and say you're browsing, she might insist nonetheless. She offers an origin story about the husband and wife who sold their car for $12,000 and started this store -- with this as their first location of dozens. Rich products, like rich people, have histories; poor products only have pasts.
At the Barneys department store nearby, walk up to the woman at the Delvaux counter, selling pricey leather accessories. She will volunteer that her brand is eight years older than Hermès; that the goods are made in a factory in Brussels; that this one is lizard skin, and that one ostrich. In an alcove around the corner are the products of the Maison Goyard, a maker of bags and trunks. Like many products for the wealthy, Goyard announces its origins -- Paris -- on the logo of the product rather than hidden away. On some, Goyard includes an address: 233 rue Saint-Honoré.
Over in Park Slope, at the fancy Bklyn Larder provisions shop, it is much the same. Because it caters to the moneyed classes now migrating to Brooklyn, everything must be from somewhere. It's not hidden in labels, but right out front: New Hampshire cider, Ithaca milk yogurt, cheese-and-pecan crackers in which the cheese is from Bravo Farms in California and the pecans are from New Mexico.
Four blocks away, the Key Food supermarket, catering more to the neighborhood's less-affluent old guard than its newcomers, is less forthcoming with detail. The food is mostly from nowhere.
It often seems to be from somewhere. The label may say ''Bolthouse Farms,'' without mentioning that it's not a farm so much as a vast business owned by the Campbell Soup Co. When places are cited, they are often no more specific than ''Product of U.S.A.'' The sweet mixed pickles, less than half the price per unit of similar ones at Larder, offer no more history than to say that they are distributed by Key Food.
When the buck stops at Key Food, it tends to stop no further back than the distributor.
Back at The Children's Place, Marsha Toombs was browsing the racks. She is 30 and pregnant with her third child. Her daughter was cruising the clothes, full of requests: ''Mommy, can I have a purse? Ooh, Mommy, can I have these shorts?''
Ms. Toombs was disturbed by events in Bangladesh. ''Me personally, I don't agree with the outsourcing,'' she said. She blamed it for a dearth of jobs in America, and for giving low-income foreigners a devil's bargain -- either don't eat, or labor in danger.
Why, then, was she buying these clothes? She struggled. ''That's where it gets really tricky, because if the economy is bad and things are tight financially, you've got to bargain,'' she said. ''I guess -- man -- that's where the dilemma comes into play.''
How much extra would she pay -- say, for the $15 jeans in her cart -- to have them made closer to home, in better conditions?
''See, I'm a bargain queen,'' she said, hesitating. She settled on $5 extra and no more. And she wasn't convinced about the jeans, either: ''I'm going to go to Target and see if I can get something cheaper.''

HEADLINE: Trying Unlikely Comeback, Ex-Iran President Strikes Chord With Public

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- There was a time when Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani seemed to have it all. A founder of the Islamic Revolution, he headed a family empire that owned the second biggest Iranian airline, Mahan, had a near monopoly on the lucrative pistachio trade and controlled the country's largest private university, Azad.
But then things started to go wrong. Iranians, angered by his wealth, back-room dealings and supposed involvement in the killing of dissidents, nicknamed him ''Akbar Shah,'' after the old Persian rulers who sat on velvet cushions in lush courtyards. Political rivals, jealous of his grip on the economy, seized on his support for reformists and labeled him an ''aristocrat,'' a ''capitalist'' and a supporter of ''American Islam'' 
His political stock fell so low that in 2002 he could not even muster the votes to win a seat in Parliament. He suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the 2005 presidential election, and two of his children ended up in jail. His speech in favor of greater freedom during the 2009 protests alienated him from Iran's conservative clerics and military commanders.
Now, from the fringes of Iran's closed circle of power, Mr. Rafsanjani, 79, is attempting a comeback, entering his name last Saturday for the June 14 presidential elections. Though once widely reviled, his reputation as an economic pragmatist and modernizer -- by Iranian standards, anyway -- seems to be hitting a responsive chord with the public.
''He is the only one that can fix this mess,'' said Farshad Ghorbanpour, a journalist who spent several months in jail for his ties to the opposition. ''This man is an icon of our revolution. He owns the shop, so to speak. He will fix the economy.''
Tired of Iran's stumbling economy and galloping inflation rate, most Iranians yearn for policies that stimulate business while lowering the prices of staples, real estate and foreign exchange. While generally fed up with politics, many in Tehran say that Mr. Rafsanjani, whose policies as president formed the basis for Iran's modern day middle class, is the man for the job.
''He is a master of economy, and at the moment my business is doing really bad,'' said Hasan Sarhangi, 35, a trader from the poorer southern part of Tehran. ''We have no one with his qualities. He can make us rich again.''
If approved as a candidate -- and that is by no means assured -- Mr. Rafsanjani is likely to find himself walking a tightrope, trying to address his natural constituency of dissatisfied urban Iranians who want more freedoms and realistic economic policies while not further alienating the country's leaders, many of whom say he should be tried for corruption and links to the opposition.
A close associate of the Islamic republic's founder, Ayatollah Khomeini, and president from 1989 to 1997, Mr. Rafsanjani was once the nation's kingmaker, said to have brought the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to power after Ayatollah Khomeini's death. It is only that pedigree, most analysts agree, as well as Ayatollah Khamenei's continuing support, that has allowed him to survive his fall and even hope to fight his way back into power.
And even then, the road back is bound to be treacherous. Iran's intelligence minister, Heydar Moslehi, an appointee of Ayatollah Khamenei's, recently warned Mr. Rafsanjani not to become a candidate. The only reasons Mr. Rafsanjani was not under house arrest for his speech in 2009, the minister said, were ''certain considerations by the system,'' meaning his relationship with the supreme leader.
''Do not make the mistake to think the role you have played is forgotten by the revolution,'' said Mr. Moslehi, referring to the 2009 protests.
Another hurdle is whether the Guardian Council, an evaluating body whose 12 members are appointed by Ayatollah Khamenei, as well as the head of the judiciary, and confirmed by Parliament, will even allow Mr. Rafsanjani to participate in the elections.
On Tuesday, 100 members of Parliament sent a letter to the Guardian Council, asking its jurists and clerics to reject Mr. Rafsanjani's candidacy, calling him a ''seditionist'' for ''supporting'' the 2009 protests.
In fighting that effort, Mr. Rafsanjani can count on his relationship with Ayatollah Khamenei, his ''friend for 50 years,'' as Mr. Rafsanjani likes to say. The supreme leader, who preserves his power by playing various factions against one another, has refused to cut the lifeline that protects Mr. Rafsanjani from his foes. In turn, Mr. Rafsanjani has been careful never to criticize the supreme leader.
Nevertheless, despite their longtime ties, the two men have fundamentally different ideas regarding the state the country is in.
For years now, Mr. Rafsanjani has been arguing that Iran faces the threat of ''Islamic fascism'' and is in a ''dangerous crisis,'' while the supreme leader insists that Iran is a ''beacon of freedom'' and is making ''astonishing leaps of progress.''
The effect is to severely limit what Mr. Rafsanjani can say in any campaign, analysts say. Not only does his relationship with Ayatollah Khamenei limit him from bluntly addressing the issues facing the country, Ayatollah Khamenei's supporters are eager to label any potential criticism as an insult of the supreme leader, which is illegal under Iranian law.
But Mr. Rafsanjani is plainly dependent on the support of his old friend. In an interview with the reformist Shargh newspaper on Sunday, his daughter Fatemeh described how her father had waited next to the phone all day on registration day for Ayatollah Khamenei to call and give his blessing for his candidacy. He had earlier said he would not run without it.
The phone did not ring, and Mr. Rafsanjani had given up hope and had ordered his staff to write a letter explaining why he had not joined the race.
There are different versions of what exactly happened, but around half an hour before the closing of the registration period, Fatemeh said that her father suddenly rushed out of his office and said, ''In the name of God, let us go!'' barely making it in time for registration.
''We don't know if Mr. Khamenei clearly gave his blessing,'' said one Iranian journalist close to Mr. Rafsanjani's camp, who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the situation. ''But I guess we will find out soon.''

HEADLINE: Republicans Broaden Scope of I.R.S. Inquiry, Hoping to Entangle White House

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN and JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans, not resting with the Internal Revenue Service scandal, are moving to broaden the matter to an array of tax malfeasances and ''intimidation tactics'' they hope will ensnare the White House.
Republican charges range from clearly questionable actions to seemingly specious allegations, and they grow by the day. On Friday, lawmakers sought to tie the I.R.S. matter to the carrying out of President Obama's health care law, which will rely heavily on the agency. Whether they succeed holds significant ramifications for Mr. Obama, who will soon know if he is dealing with a late spring thunderstorm that may soon blow over or a consuming squall that will leave lasting damage.
Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, the usually mild-mannered chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, set the tone Friday at Congress's first hearing on the targeting of conservative groups by the I.R.S., laying out details, from the alleged threatening of donors to conservative nonprofit groups to the leaking of confidential I.R.S. documents.
In that context, he said, the screening of Tea Party groups for special scrutiny was not the scandal itself but ''just the latest example of a culture of cover-ups -- and political intimidation -- in this administration.'' 
''It seems like the truth is hidden from the American people just long enough to make it through an election,'' Mr. Camp said.
Taken aback, the ranking Democrat on the committee, Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, modified his prepared remarks to warn, ''If this hearing becomes essentially a bootstrap to continue the campaign of 2012 and to prepare for 2014, we will be making a very, very serious mistake.''
Republicans raised a long list of issues. Mr. Camp contended, for instance, that a White House official's divulging of a private company's tax status constituted ''a clear intimidation tactic.'' The 2010 incident involved an offhand comment by the White House economist Austan Goolsbee that Koch Industries had not paid corporate income taxes because it pays taxes through the personal income tax code. As it turned out, that was not true, but the assertion was made in a discussion of tax reform ideas, not politics.
The Republicans also criticized the publication of donors to the National Organization for Marriage, a group opposed to same-sex marriage. That donors list surfaced mysteriously in March 2012 from a whistle-blower whose identity is still unknown. The whistle-blower apparently obtained it by simply requesting it from the I.R.S.
Linkage to the health care law came through Sarah Hall Ingram, a longtime I.R.S. official who has headed the agency's program to carry out the Affordable Care Act since December 2010. Before that, she led the I.R.S.'s tax-exempt and government-entities division, which contained the political targeting effort.
''This is an audit, and it's helpful,'' Representative Tim Griffin, Republican of Arkansas, said of the investigation of I.R.S. targeting by the Treasury inspector general for tax administration, ''but it's the tip of the iceberg.''
But the inspector general made clear that effort did not reach the attention of high-level I.R.S. officials until 2011 at the earliest.
The inspector general gave Republicans some fodder Friday when he divulged that he informed the Treasury's general counsel he was auditing the I.R.S.'s screening of politically active groups seeking tax exemptions on June 4, 2012. He told Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin ''shortly after,'' he said. That meant Obama administration officials were aware of the matter during the presidential campaign year.
The disclosure last summer came as part of a routine briefing of the investigations that the inspector general would be conducting in the coming year, and he did not tell the officials of his conclusions that the targeting had been improper, he said.
Treasury officials stressed they did not know the results until March 2013, when the inspector presented a draft.
''Treasury strongly supports the independent oversight of its three inspectors general, and it does not interfere in ongoing I.G. audits,'' the department said in a statement Friday evening.
Still, Inspector General J. Russell George's testimony fueled efforts by Congressional Republicans to ensnare Mr. Obama in the scandals suddenly swirling over the White House. Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who joined the national ticket as the vice-presidential nominee last year, said of the revelation, ''That raises a big question.''
Republicans hit hard on the divulging of confidential tax information, hinting of intimidation not only by the I.R.S. but also by the White House.
In March 2012, the Human Rights Campaign and The Huffington Post made public confidential tax documents from the National Organization for Marriage. The Human Rights Campaign said it obtained the documents from a ''whistle-blower'' who mailed them to the gay rights group's Washington headquarters.
In a similar incident, ProPublica, an investigative journalism Web site, asked the I.R.S.'s Cincinnati office for the applications of 67 nonprofits, both liberal and conservative. When the I.R.S. responded, it inadvertently included applications for nine conservative groups that had not yet been granted tax-exempt status, a violation of confidentiality law.
When ProPublica realized what it had -- including the application from Crossroads GPS, the conservative group founded by Karl Rove and other Republican strategists -- it alerted the I.R.S., which warned the journalists that ''publishing unauthorized returns or return information was a felony'' punishable by up to five years in prison. ProPublica ProPublica redacted certain details and published the documents anyway.
Representative Peter Roskam, Republican of Illinois, hit on a different explanation. ''On the one hand, you're arguing today that the I.R.S. is not corrupt, but the subtext of that is you're saying, 'Look, we're just incompetent,' '' Mr. Roskam said. ''It is a perilous pathway to go down.''
One release that turned out to be advertent was last Friday's disclosure of the agency's conservative targeting. Steven Miller, the ousted acting commissioner of the I.R.S., confessed that the agency's apology was prompted by a question planted by the agency at an American Bar Association meeting. At that meeting, Lois Lerner, the head of the I.R.S.'s division overseeing tax-exempt organizations, was asked about an inquiry into the targeting issue, eliciting an apology that quickly leaked out of the closed-door session. The I.R.S. then scrambled to issue a formal release on the issue.
Mr. Miller divulged that the exchange was not an impromptu apology but a planned exchange between Ms. Lerner and Celia Roady, a tax lawyer at the Washington office of the Morgan Lewis law firm. That revelation only underscored the ham-handed way the scandal has burst into view.
Under fire, Mr. Miller called the agency's targeting of conservative groups ''obnoxious,'' but he told the House Ways and Means Committee it was not motivated by partisanship. And in testy exchanges, he said he had not misled Congress, even though he did not divulge the targeting efforts of a Cincinnati unit examining 70,000 applications for tax exemption.
He called the group's centralization of applications from groups with names that included the words ''Tea Party'' or ''patriots'' simply ''foolish mistakes'' that ''were made by people trying to be more efficient in their workload selection.''

HEADLINE: Gains for a 4th Week in a Row, and Milestones, Too

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks continued their climb into uncharted territory on Friday, racking up the fourth week in a row of gains as encouraging economic data prompted investors to buy shares of growth companies.
The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished at highs, driven by gains in energy and industrial shares. The indexes have pushed to a series of high levels as part of the rally that has lifted equities more than 16 percent for the year so far.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 121.18 points, or 0.80 percent, to close at a milestone 15,354.40. The S.& P. 500-stock index rose 17 points, or 1.03 percent, to end at a record 1,667.42. 
The Nasdaq composite index climbed 33.73 points, or 0.97 percent, to finish at 3,498.97 -- its highest close since October 2000.
In a sign of how far the market has come, the S.& P. 500 is about 1,000 points above the low it hit in March 2009 in the wake of the credit crisis and recession.
''It's hard to hold this market down,'' said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Conn.
Data released on Friday showed Americans felt better about their economic and financial prospects in early May, with consumer sentiment at its highest in nearly six years, while a gauge of future economic activity rose in April to a near five-year high.
''If you believe the economy is going to gradually get better and that global growth will improve, the parts of the market that have not benefited so far, like cyclicals, will probably be the next group to outperform,'' Mr. Sheldon said. Cyclical industries are those that do well when times are good, like an airline that benefits from more people flying on vacation.
The S.& P. energy sector index gained 0.8 percent, with Exxon Mobil up 1.2 percent at $91.76.
Boeing shares led the S.& P. 500's industrial sector index higher with a 2.4 percent advance to $98.92, its highest since October 2007. The S.& P. industrial index rose 1.4 percent.
The rate of growth in the economy has been expected to slow in the second quarter as tighter fiscal policy started to take effect. But recent improvements, including in the labor market and retail sales, suggest the recovery remains resilient.
''We are still recovering,'' said Doreen Mogavero, chief of Mogavero, Lee & Company in New York, who also noted that the comeback was slow. She added that markets in the United States, for all their troubles, were ''still the best place to be at this moment.''
Earlier in Friday's session, the Dow touched a high at 15,357.40. For the week, the Dow advanced 1.7 percent, while the S.& P. 500 climbed 2.1 percent and the Nasdaq rose 1.9 percent.
J. P. Morgan raised its year-end target for the S.& P. 500 to 1,715 from 1,580, implying a gain of just under 3.5 percent for the index for the rest of the year.
''We realize investors are apprehensive about making fresh money purchases, but we see the risk/reward as particularly attractive in technology, health care and financials,'' said the client note from Thomas Lee, J. P. Morgan's United States equity strategist.
J. C. Penney shares lost 4.2 percent to $18.01 after the retailer reported another steep quarterly loss on weak sales and heavy clearance deals, and the chief executive, Myron Ullman, cautioned that he needed time to fix the company's problems.
Tableau Software, a maker of data analysis software, surged in its first day of trading as investors bet the rising interest in Big Data would drive its growth. Tableau surged 64 percent to $50.75.
The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 22/32 to 98 5/32, increasing the yield to 1.95, from 1.88 on Thursday.

HEADLINE: 4 College Essays That Stand Out. Topic: Money.

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER. 
Twitter: @ronlieber

 BODY:
''I wonder if Princeton should be poorer.''
If you're a high school senior trying to seduce the admissions officer reading your application essay, this may not strike you as the ideal opening line. But Shanti Kumar, a senior at the Bronx High School of Science, went ahead anyway when the university prompted her to react in writing to the idea of ''Princeton in the nation's service and in the service of all nations.''
Back in January, when I asked high school seniors to send in college application essays about money, class, working and the economy, I wasn't sure what, if anything, would come in over the transom.
But 66 students submitted essays, and with the help of Harry Bauld, the author of ''On Writing the College Application Essay,'' we've selected four to publish in full online and in part in this column. That allowed us to be slightly more selective than Princeton itself was last year. 
What these four writers have in common is an appetite for risk. Not only did they talk openly about issues that are emotionally complex and often outright taboo, but they took brave and counterintuitive positions on class, national identity and the application process itself. For anyone looking to inspire their own children or grandchildren who are seeking to go to college in the fall of 2014, these four essays would be a good place to start.
Perhaps the most daring essay of all came from Julian Cranberg, a 17-year-old from Brookline, Mass. One of the first rules of the college admissions process is that you don't write about the college admissions process.
But Mr. Cranberg thumbed his nose at that convention, taking on the tremendous cost of the piles of mail schools send to potential students, and the waste that results from the effort. He figured that he received at least $200 worth of pitches in the past year or so.
''Why, in an era of record-high student loan debt and unemployment, are colleges not reallocating these ludicrous funds to aid their own students instead of extending their arms far and wide to students they have never met?'' he asked in the essay.
Antioch College seemed to think that was a perfectly reasonable question and accepted him, though he will attend Oberlin College instead, to which he did not submit the essay.
''It's a bold move to critique the very institution he was applying to,'' said Mr. Bauld, who also teaches English at Horace Mann School in New York City. ''But here's somebody who knows he can make it work with intelligence and humor.''
Indeed, Mr. Cranberg's essay includes asides about applicants' gullibility and the college that sent him a DHL ''priority'' envelope, noting inside that he was a priority to the college. ''The humor here is not in the jokes,'' Mr. Bauld added. ''It originates in a critical habit of mind, and the kind of mind that is in this essay is going to play out extremely well in any class that he's in.''
Admissions professionals often warn people not to think that they can write their way into the freshman class. ''The essay is one document that, even in the best of circumstances, is written by an individual telling one story,'' said Shawn Abbott, the assistant vice president for undergraduate admissions at New York University. ''I don't believe that any one writing sample should trump what they did over four years.''
Still, he acknowledged that his staff had been taken with the story told by Lyle Li, a 19-year-old Brooklyn resident who applied this year. He wrote about his family's restaurant and his mother, an immigrant from China who once wanted to be a doctor and now works behind a cash register.
''When I visit my friends, I see the names of elite institutions adorning the living room walls,'' wrote Mr. Li, a senior at Regis High School in Manhattan. ''I am conscious that these framed diplomas are testaments to the hard work and accomplishments of my friends' parents and siblings. Nevertheless, the sight of them was an irritating reminder of the disparity between our households. I was not the upper-middle-class kid on Park Avenue. Truth be told, I am just some kid from Brooklyn. Instead of diplomas and accolades, my parents' room emits a smell from the restaurant uniforms they wear seven days a week, all year round.''
Mr. Abbott said that N.Y.U. received plenty of essays about the immigrant experience. So Mr. Li risked writing one of many stories about long odds and hard work in an unfamiliar, unforgiving place.
But he did not fall into that trap and will be attending N.Y.U. this fall. ''His essay brought his family's circumstance and background into Technicolor,'' Mr. Abbott said. ''He paints a very vivid picture of what life is really like in his home. I think he's proud of his accomplishments and work ethic, but there's also a humility each day when he takes off his preppy blue blazer in front of his mom.''
The essay by Ana Castro, an 18-year-old senior at the Doane Stuart School in Rensselaer, N.Y., is about not quite arriving, in spite of having been born in the United States. And her essay for Hamilton College, which she will attend in the fall, centers on her desire to serve in the Peace Corps. It opens with a joke about her hating clowns and leeches and tells a sad story of a visit to the Dominican Republic, where her father refused to let her play with the destitute boy next door. ''My heart broke, not because I was now stuck eating plantains by myself in the stinging sun, but because that boy experienced a level of poor I never knew.''
Then she makes a startling statement that stopped both me and Mr. Bauld as we were reading it for the first time. ''I have never seen the United States as my country,'' Ms. Castro wrote. ''I have never felt total patriotism to any country. I do not instantly think of staying here to help 'my home,' because I do not consider the United States my home. The Earth is 'my home.' ''
To Monica Inzer, Hamilton's dean of admission and financial aid, bold declarations like this one are a strong sign of authenticity if nothing else. ''Lots of essays have been doctored or written by other people,'' she said. ''You know that a parent didn't write this. I don't know how I know, but I do.''
Mr. Bauld knows how he knows. ''There's always an attempt in some of these college admissions factories to smooth out a student's edges,'' he said. ''But what I loved about this piece is that there is no attempt to smooth out anything.''
As for Ms. Kumar, the 18-year-old Princeton applicant, her essay wasn't so much smooth as it was slick, gliding effortlessly from her breakfast table to the manicured campus of Princeton to the ''occidental bubble'' of her school classroom. There's a detour onto the city bus and then a quick trip to India before coming back to the ''towering turrets'' of New Jersey again.
Nevertheless, Princeton rejected her, and when I approached the university to find out if it had anything to do with her essay, it cited its policy of not commenting on any applicants or admissions decisions. I told its spokesman, Martin Mbugua, that other schools had commented on their own applicants once the students gave them permission, but he was unmoved.
Ms. Kumar suggested that her grades might not have been quite high enough, but Mr. Bauld contended that Princeton should have been swayed by her words.
''One of the things that makes this essay is her tone,'' he said. ''It could have been, 'Princeton should be poorer,' but she opens it as an inquiry. What she does is that she listens very carefully to what you have assigned her to do, and as a response to that, she says, 'Well, let me ask you this!' ''
Next week, Ms. Kumar will take the stage as Marty in the Bronx Science production of ''Grease,'' and she'll collect her diploma on June 21. In the fall, she'll attend Cornell, for which she wrote no essays about the university's level of affluence.
To Mr. Bauld, that's Princeton's loss. ''She is that person who is always going to give an interesting answer, even to the most boring question,'' he said. ''That's my confidence in reading it, and I'd want that person in my class as a teacher.''

HEADLINE: Energy Exports Are Good!

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
What first caught my eye was the op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal. Published in late February, it was written by Andrew N. Liveris, the chairman and chief executive of the Dow Chemical Company. Liveris, an Australian, has become quite the Washington player in recent years. Among other things, he heads President Obama's efforts to revive manufacturing.
The op-ed was about one of my favorite subjects: the abundance of natural gas reserves discovered in the United States since the ''fracking'' revolution began. This newly found gas, Liveris wrote, offered ''a historic opportunity to strengthen the economy, increase national competitiveness and create jobs.'' I couldn't have said it better myself. 
Within a few paragraphs, however, the Liveris article took on a Pravda-like quality: a political insider sending a coded message to other insiders. He wrote, for instance, that the new jobs the natural gas boom was expected to create would depend on an ''affordable'' and ''plentiful'' supply. Given that that's exactly what we currently have, what was the real subtext?
Then it became clear: Liveris's plan for ensuring cheap domestic gas was -- are you ready for this? -- limiting exports. An export market driven by, you know, supply and demand was described as ''unchecked.'' What was left unsaid was that if natural gas could not be exported, the resulting oversupply would depress prices -- and boost Dow's profits.
Finally, Liveris acknowledged that Dow owned 15 percent of a proposed facility in Texas, which was causing ''advocates of unchecked exports'' to ''attack'' the company for being in a position to profit from exports while publicly opposing them. But, he insisted, Dow would not make a profit. Hmmm.
I bring all this up because on Friday, the Department of Energy, after a two-year hiatus, granted a permit to a facility called Freeport LNG, which will allow it to export liquefied natural gas to countries with which we do not have free-trade agreements.
Originally built to import natural gas, the plant will cost as much as $11 billion to retrofit and take years to complete. It will export only a tiny fraction of the natural gas that is consumed by Americans. And wouldn't you know it? This is the facility in which a Dow Chemical limited partnership holds a 15 percent stake.
Exporting natural gas has enormous benefits for the United States. Exports create jobs that are every bit as good as manufacturing jobs. They help our trade deficit. They tie us closer to important allies like Japan, which desperately need the gas. According to Michael Levi, the author of an authoritative new book, ''The Power Surge: Energy, Opportunity, and the Battle for America's Future,'' the prospect that America could export natural gas has even helped our European allies gain leverage with its primary supplier of fossil fuels, Russia.
''Most studies suggest that the main impact of exports will be to increase U.S. production rather than take away other uses,'' Levi says. Thus, it will not likely have a major effect on the price of gas. Levi told me that one legitimate fear is that the additional drilling could increase the potential environmental risks posed by fracking. But the answer is to ensure that wells are drilled in an environmentally safe manner. That is true whether we export gas or not.
And what does Dow Chemical say now that ''its'' facility has been approved? I spent much of Friday afternoon peppering the company with questions, most of them revolving around Dow's seeming hypocrisy in opposing ''unfettered'' exports while owning a big chunk of a facility that would someday be shipping natural gas to Japan.
Finally, more or less in exasperation, a Dow spokesman put Liveris on the phone. The Dow chairman pointed out that when the company originally invested in Freeport LNG, the facility was meant to import gas rather than export it. He said that the company won't make money because its stake will be so diluted once capital is raised for the retrofitting. He insisted that he is a believer in market forces, but that the natural gas market is so different from other commodities that it must be treated differently.
He also said, though, that the company was not opposed to natural gas exports -- just so long as it was limited.
Earlier, a Dow spokesman had sent out a press release claiming that the permit approval by the Department of Energy was actually a victory for Dow's position. To put it in words that the press representative would never use, so long as the Department of Energy permitting process is so absurdly slow -- thus creating a government bottleneck that restrains ''unfettered'' exports -- Dow and Liveris have gotten exactly what they've been seeking: limited exports and plenty of cheap domestic gas to help fuel their profits.
There is a technical term for this. It's called ''having your cake and eating it, too.''

HEADLINE: City's Largest Union Says It Will Endorse de Blasio

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
New York City's largest union, Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union, has decided to throw its considerable political weight and grass-roots muscle behind Public Advocate Bill de Blasio in the contest for mayor.
The endorsement, which was approved on Friday and will be formally announced at a City Hall news conference on Monday, represents labor's most significant move yet in what is shaping up as a wide-open Democratic primary.
Union leaders said bluntly that their decision, which came a month earlier than anticipated, was aimed at nudging other wavering unions into Mr. de Blasio's column. The union's 150-member executive council backed Mr. de Blasio in a unanimous vote -- something that has not happened, in any citywide primary, in at least 20 years. 
The union represents 200,000 health care workers, most of whom are African-American. In an interview, George Gresham, the union's president, and Kevin Finnegan, its political director, said Mr. de Blasio was an easy choice because of his emphasis on working-class New Yorkers and his ''potential to be a big unifier.''
They cited, in particular, his concerns about the Police Department's stop-and-frisk practice, which critics say discriminates against blacks and Hispanics, and his advocacy for legislation to require that many businesses offer paid time off to sick employees.
Even though candidates prize endorsements from labor unions, their value is hard to determine. In the past, many unions have sided with losing candidates, and in mayoral campaigns especially, union members may vote in accordance with their own political instincts, rather than hewing to the recommendations of their union. But this year, with all of the Democratic candidates vowing to participate in a public financing system with relatively low spending limits, labor's support could be crucial.
The leaders of 1199 vowed to work harder than they have for any other local candidate in many years to help Mr. de Blasio win, and said they were considering participating in a ''super PAC'' to spend money on the race. ''We wanted to send a strong signal: De Blasio was so far ahead of everyone else it was really a race to the bottom,'' Mr. Gresham said.
Mr. Finnegan added, ''We plan on a massive effort.''
News of the endorsement caps a strong week for Mr. de Blasio. He reported raising the maximum amount of money allowed for the primary under the city's voluntary public matching funds program. He also picked up the endorsements of yet another celebrity (Russell Simmons) and progressive group (New York Communities for Change).
By some measures, the 1199 endorsement is not a major surprise, because of Mr. de Blasio's deep ties to the union, which go back 25 years. But the union's sheer size and political operation could intensify the pressure on the three other major unions whose endorsements are coveted: those representing building employees (Local 32BJ of the S.E.I.U.), hotel workers (Hotel Trades Council) and teachers (United Federation of Teachers).
In an interview, Mr. de Blasio said he was buoyed by the support.
''This is one of the progressive consciences of New York City, and we really share a set of core values on social justice and economic fairness,'' he said. ''I don't think anyone on any side would doubt that this is a game-changer, a watershed moment, because they are so good and so large. They would not support someone this early and unanimously unless they thought I could win.''

HEADLINE: 3 Foreign Companies Invest in U.S. Project to Export Liquid Gas

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED

 BODY:
In a sign that the United States shale gas boom is making global waves, two Japanese conglomerates and a big French energy player signed agreements on Friday to invest up to $7 billion in a liquefied natural gas project in Louisiana.
The companies -- Mitsui and Mitsubishi of Japan, and GDF Suez of France -- each plan to take a 16.6 percent stake in the gas export plant being developed at Hackberry, La. The complex is being built by Sempra Energy, a company based in San Diego with annual revenue of about $10 billion. The companies agreed last year to help develop the project. 
GDF Suez predicts that the plant will begin operations in 2017. The companies' final decision to make their investment will depend on the project's receiving necessary permits, GDF Suez said.
International companies, responding to a ravenous global appetite for natural gas, particularly in Japan and Europe, want access to shale gas from the United States, which has emerged as an important new source over the last few years. But because the United States has only recently shifted from being a gas importer to being self-sufficient in the fuel, the government has not yet agreed to allow exports except in a few cases and to the 20 countries with which it has free trade agreements, including Panama and Costa Rica.
Export approval, under consideration for several projects by the Energy Department, will be necessary before the potential of shale gas can be fully realized. On Friday, the department approved a Texas project called Freeport L.N.G. It has also signed off on a facility being built by Cheniere Energy at Sabine Pass in Louisiana that is expected to start exporting in 2015.
But international companies are investing all the same, betting that United States shale gas will eventually be able to go onto the global market.
In a statement, Sempra Energy estimated that the foreign partners would be putting up $6 billion to $7 billion in return for just under half the equity in the project, which is forecast to yield 12 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas annually for 20 years. In return, they will receive all the gas. Sempra will retain a stake of just over 50 percent.
''These agreements represent a major step forward in the development of our L.N.G. export project,'' Sempra's president, Mark A. Snell, said in a statement.
For international players, the attractions of United States shale gas are the large potential volumes and the relatively low cost of extracting it.
Other foreign companies that have lined up American supplies include the Korean company Kogas, Sumitomo of Japan and BG Group, the British-based company that is a big player in the liquefied natural gas business.
Natural gas prices in the United States are now about $4 per million British thermal units, the industry's standard measure. European-traded prices are in the $10 per million B.T.U.'s range, with Asian prices about $15 per million per B.T.U.'s. Long-term contract prices are often higher, and liquefication adds to the cost over plain gas.
Japan's liquefied natural gas imports have surged after the shutdown of nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima disaster and were up by 11 percent last year. Japanese imports account for about one-third of the world's total liquid gas market, according to a recent study by Bernstein research.
Japanese utility executives have said they want to reduce the prices they are paying by tying them to United States supplies.
''It is a win-win situation,'' said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer in New York. Such deals will help stabilize global fuel prices over the long term and benefit the United States economy, he said.
A big worry in the industry is whether United States' exports could contribute to lower prices around the world, eroding profits. ''It will give buyers a choice, something they have never had before,'' said Jonathan Stern, chairman of the gas program at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.
But industry executives think that surging demand, especially from Asia, will easily absorb the exports that the United States government might eventually permit.
United States gas ''won't have a material effect on long-term pricing,'' Martin Houston, BG's chief operating officer, said in a recent presentation on the company's Web site.
Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting from Washington.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Women Know More About Finances Than They Get Credit For

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND

 BODY:
ON occasion, when my female friends and I are sitting around talking, the issue of money will come up. And generally, most will readily admit that they don't know anywhere near as much about their family finances as they should.
I find that interesting, but not surprising. After all, so many studies and news media reports reinforce the idea that women lag men in understanding how to handle their money.
But recently, some experts in personal finance are challenging the common wisdom, saying that the differences in how men and women deal with finances have been overstated. Further, they say, it does no service to women to portray them as naïve and in need of special help.
''A lot of the industry is flat-out condescending to women,'' said Helaine Olen, a financial journalist and the author of the book ''Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry.'' 
The real problem, Ms. Olen said, is that women often earn less money than men yet live longer. They also tend more frequently than men to drop in and out of the labor force to stay at home with children.
''I'm afraid this niching of women is a way to get around the systemic problems'' that need to be addressed through public policy, she said. Ms. Olen also said that some of the advice for women, like to cut back on shopping, is unhelpful at best and sexist at worst.
A 2011 Gallup poll showed that men spend $11 more a day than women, Ms. Olen wrote in her book.
Annamaria Lusardi, a professor of economics and accountancy at George Washington University and the academic director of the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center, said the idea ''that women spend more is a myth.''
But she said there is a clear gender difference when it comes to financial literacy, not just in this country but around the world.
Professor Lusardi was the co-author of a study of eight countries -- the United States, Japan, New Zealand, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy and Russia -- that found that the overall level of financial literacy was low. According to the study, Americans had a harder time with simple calculations, but no country stood out as being particularly knowledgeable.
The study, ''Financial Literacy Around the World: An Overview,'' was published in 2011 in The Journal of Pension Economics and Finance.
Professor Lusardi said women in all the countries studied were less likely than men to correctly answer questions about financial literacy, particularly those that used technical terms. The more sophisticated the question and the more financial jargon that was used, the less likely women were to answer the questions correctly, she said.
But she said the take-away shouldn't be that women were more ignorant.
Here's one example: ''Buying a single company's stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund.'' The answer options are true, false, do not know or refuse to answer. (The answer is false.)
In the United States, men answered correctly 57.1 percent of the time, compared with 46.8 percent of women. In Germany, both sexes picked the right answer more often than those in the United States did, but the difference between the sexes was similar, with 67.6 percent men and 56.8 percent of women scoring correctly.
But, and this is interesting, ''When we took away the 'do not know' option, women were no less likely to choose the wrong answer,'' Professor Lusardi said. ''So if forced to pick an answer, women seem to know as much as men.''
When women and men were asked to self-assess their financial knowledge, men tended to give themselves high scores -- even when that is not warranted by their actual knowledge -- while women tended to give themselves lower scores.
''Women are aware of their lack of knowledge,'' Professor Lusardi said, while ''men are less willing to admit what they don't know.''
Manisha Thakor, a financial adviser who runs MoneyZen Wealth Management and specializes in helping women, agreed that everyone struggled with financial information.
Investing has become more complex, she said, ''and formal education in the traditional academic setting hasn't kept up. Both genders are confused, but my experience as a professional is that women may be more willing to ask for information.''
Ms. Thakor compared it to the cliché that women were more inclined to ask for directions than men.
Men also experience financial stereotyping, she said, because society puts a lot of pressure on men to understand, or at least to pretend to understand, the ins and out of finances.
''I will say that the default lingo of the financial services industry is male-speak,'' Ms. Thakor said, referring to terms like ''play the market'' or ''dominating the field.''
''It sounds like a battle,'' she said. And such analogies tend to make women feel excluded.
Ms. Olen said that sports terms can be difficult for some women, particularly those of an older generation who may not have grown up playing team sports. But that doesn't mean women should be advised by only women or be talked to differently than men, she said.
''A good adviser, male or female, should be able to do this,'' Ms. Olen said. ''All talk should be understood by both genders.''
As she writes in her book, ''There is a fine line between making the industry more friendly to women and overtly condescending to them, and frankly, it is a line few have managed to tread successfully.''
Tahira K. Hira, a professor of personal finance and consumer economics at Iowa State University, said her research had shown that men and women had different learning styles. Men find it easier to learn from technology, she said, while women prefer to learn from a person. Catering to those differences, she said, can be helpful.
''Most of us agree that women are conditioned differently than men about money,'' Professor Hira said. ''Even in this day and age, we have different expectations for our daughters than our sons.''
What about the often-cited idea that women are more averse to risk than men?
''In my view, we don't have convincing evidence that women invest in less risky assets then men,'' Professor Lusardi said.
In fact, Julie Nelson, the chairwoman of the economics department at the University of Massachusetts Boston, reviewed 24 papers that reported women were less likely to take financial or gambling risks. She found that the papers consistently exaggerated relatively small statistical differences.
''The stereotype that men take more risks than women is very strong,'' she said, but it doesn't hold up under scrutiny. She said the risk-taking behavior of men and women was more alike than different, for the most part.
Besides, as Professor Nelson and others point out, greater risk-taking doesn't always promise a better return.
Because of the gender gap in income and life expectancy, women may need different financial projections. But, she said, ''I find it disempowering to say women have special needs when it comes to understanding finances.''

HEADLINE: Ex-Spanish Banker Is Released on Bail After a Night in Jail

BYLINE: By RAPHAEL MINDER

 BODY:
Miguel Blesa, the former executive chairman of Caja Madrid, has become the first prominent Spanish banker to go behind bars since the start of the financial crisis. He is accused of leaving the company saddled with huge losses because of an ill-advised takeover of a bank based in Miami in 2008.
Caja Madrid was one of several banks that eventually merged to form Bankia, which became the biggest mortgage lender in Spain. 
But the problems at Caja Madrid were part of the cascading issues that eventually undermined Bankia, which the government seized last year. Bankia's collapse set off a crisis that resulted in Spain's banking system requiring a 40 billion euro, or $51.3 billion, European bailout.
Mr. Blesa, 65, spent Thursday night in a Madrid jail but walked out on Friday after posting bail of 2.5 million euros.
The Madrid judge in charge of the case, Elpidio José Silva, had ordered that Mr. Blesa be jailed and have his passport taken because there was a risk he might flee the country.
Mr. Blesa has denied wrongdoing and has not been formally charged with any crime. Bail was set at 2.5 million euros because it is an amount equivalent to the severance payment Mr. Blesa received when he voluntarily left Caja Madrid in 2010.
He is accused by the group Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands -- a far-right association that has been pursuing several corruption cases -- of buying City National Bank, based in Miami, in 2008 at an inflated price without following due diligence by checking into that bank's underlying liabilities. Judge Silva is also investigating whether the purchase involved falsifying documents.
The case highlights how Spain's banking troubles stretched beyond its borders, as cajas, regional savings banks that are tightly controlled by area politicians, tried to emulate the overseas expansion of their commercial peers during the country's economic boom.
Over all, about 100 Spanish bankers have been named in continuing court cases that have mostly focused on loans said to be fraudulent, conflicts of interest and excessive compensation packages granted by collapsed cajas. But Mr. Blesa is the first among them to have spent any time in jail.
Mr. Blesa, a former official in Spain's Economics Ministry, became chairman of Caja Madrid in 1996. That was shortly after José María Aznar, a former classmate of Mr. Blesa, was elected prime minister. In April 2008, Caja Madrid announced that it would buy 83 percent of City National Bank for $927 million, following the lead of other Spanish commercial banks that had already expanded into the United States. Two years later it bought the remainder for $190 million.
That purchase price was roughly equivalent to the book value of the bank, but Caja Madrid ended up having to absorb losses of about 500 million euros generated by City National's Miami unit. The deal threw Caja Madrid into ''a perfect storm,'' according to the court filing, at a time when it was also facing rising domestic problems linked to the bursting of Spain's housing bubble.
Mr. Blesa was replaced as head of Caja Madrid in 2010 by Rodrigo Rato, a former managing director of the International Monetary Fund who was finance minister in the Aznar government.
Under Mr. Rato, Caja Madrid was at the center of the formation of Bankia, a seven-way merger of cajas that issued public stock in 2011. The combination was designed to consolidate the caja sector by allowing stronger entities to absorb the losses of weaker and smaller ones threatened with collapse.
Instead, Bankia sank under the collective weight of bad property loans and required 18 billion euros of the European rescue money to keep it afloat. The bank, which was nationalized a year ago, posted a loss for 2012 of 19.2 billion euros, a record for the Spanish banking industry. It has recently been trying to sell some assets, including City National.
Bankia is now the target of several lawsuits. Last year, Mr. Rato appeared in court after being named along with 32 other former Bankia executives and board members in a criminal inquiry. They are suspected of offering potentially misleading accounts at the time of Bankia's 2011 listing, which involved tens of thousands of the bank's retail clients buying into the stock offering. The former Bankia executives and board members deny wrongdoing and have not been charged so far.
Mr. Blesa will face separate accusations, also from Manos Limpias, relating to his time at Caja Madrid. The questions concern a credit line of 26.6 million euros granted in 2008 to Marsans, a travel company that subsequently went bankrupt. Marsans was owned by one of Spain's most prominent entrepreneurs, Gerardo Díaz Ferrán, who also sat on the board of Caja Madrid.

HEADLINE: Cooper Union's Investments

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There is a pivotal piece of information not mentioned in ''How Errors in Investing Cost a College Its Legacy,'' by James B. Stewart (Common Sense column, May 11), about Cooper Union. The column suggests that if we had sold our Chrysler Building holdings in 2006, we might have received as much as $1.8 billion (the amount Tishman Speyer Properties received for 666 Fifth Avenue). 
True, this less iconic building hardly compares to the landmark Chrysler Building, but it is a flawed comparison.
We ''own'' the Chrysler Building subject to a long-term ground lease, which offers no control of the building and its potential income. Retaining our Chrysler holdings provides an outstanding revenue stream that the market can't begin to match: revenue of $28 million a year, rising to as much as $55 million in 2018.
While our returns for all endowment assets consistently beat industry standards, our conservative strategy also guarded against a financial market meltdown, which would have eroded our ability to draw down money needed to pay our bills.
The column does say that ''Cooper Union did a good job managing its endowment through the recent financial crisis.'' We can agree on that.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times and a look at the weekly addresses. 

 BODY:
 Today's Times 

        
Struggling to find his footing after one of the most turbulent weeks in office, President Obama's aides have ordered the White House staff to spend no more than 10 percent of their time on controversies, Mark Landler and Michael D. Shear report. Democratic strategists are now working on a plan to intensify the administration's focus on revamping immigration laws, reaching a budget deal and implementing the new health care legislation.
 

        
Though cornered by a number of controversies that have put him under a white-hot spotlight, Jay Carney, a former reporter turned White House press secretary, says "it has been a good week," Jennifer Steinhauer writes.

        
Republican lawmakers are looking to broaden the recent Internal Revenue Service controversy into an array of tax malfeasance and "intimidation tactics" that range from the clearly questionable to the seemingly specious, Jonathan Weisman and Jeremy W. Peters report.
 Weekly Addresses 

        
President Obama reflected on visits with everyday people across the country in this week's address, saying they "make me optimistic about where we're headed as a nation." That's why, he said, he likes to get out of the "Washington echo chamber," because politics aren't always focused on the same things that Main Street Americans are. Though admitting that unemployment is still higher than he would like and that corporate profits have continued to skyrocket, he maintained that his primary focus is on the priorities of the people outside the Beltway. "Especially after all we've been through the past several years," he said. "And that should encourage us to work even harder on the issues that matter to you."

        
Representative Andy Harris of Maryland delivered this week's Republican address, hoping to intertwine the Internal Revenue Service controversy with the implementation of the health care law. "Now just think about the fact that it's the I.R.S. that will be responsible for enforcing many of these regulations. If we've learned anything this week, it's that the I.R.S. needs less power, not more," he said. "As a matter of fact, it turns out that the I.R.S. official who oversaw the operation that's under scrutiny for targeting conservatives is now in charge of the I.R.S.'s Obamacare office. You can't make this stuff up."

HEADLINE: The 1 Percent Are Only Half the Problem

BYLINE: TIMOTHY NOAH


HIGHLIGHT: Two types of inequality demand our attention. Liberals and conservatives have to open their ears. 

 BODY:
Most recent discussion about economic inequality in the United States has focused on the top 1 percent of the nation's income distribution, a group whose incomes average $1 million (with a bottom threshold of about $367,000). "We are the 99 percent," declared the Occupy protesters, unexpectedly popularizing research findings by two economists, Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, that had previously drawn attention mainly from academics. But the gap between the 1 percent and the 99 percent is only half the story.
Granted, it's an important half. Since 1979, the one-percenters have doubled their share of the nation's collective income from about 10 percent to about 20 percent. And between 2009, when the Great Recession ended, and 2011, the one-percenters saw their average income rise by 11 percent even as the 99-percenters saw theirs fall slightly. Some recovery!
This dismal litany invites the conclusion that if we would just put a tight enough choke chain on the 1 percent, then we'd solve the problem of income inequality. But alas, that isn't true, because it wouldn't address the other half of the story: the rise of the educated class. 
Since 1979 the income gap between people with college or graduate degrees and people whose education ended in high school has grown. Broadly speaking, this is a gap between working-class families in the middle 20 percent (with incomes roughly between $39,000 and $62,000) and affluent-to-rich families (say, the top 10 percent, with incomes exceeding $111,000). This skills-based gap is the inequality most Americans see in their everyday lives.
Conservatives don't typically like to talk about income inequality. It stirs up uncomfortable questions about economic fairness. (That's why as a candidate Mitt Romney told a TV interviewer that inequality was best discussed in "quiet rooms.") On those rare occasions when conservatives do bring it up, it's the skills-based gap that usually draws their attention, because it offers an opportunity to criticize our government-run system of public education and especially teachers' unions.
Liberals resist talking about the skills-based gap because they don't want to tell the working classes that they're losing ground because they didn't study hard enough. Liberals prefer to focus on the 1 percent-based gap. Conceiving of inequality as something caused by the very richest people has obvious political appeal, especially since (by definition) nearly all of us belong to the 99 percent. There's also a pleasing simplicity to the causes of the growing gap between the 1 and the 99. There are only two, and both are familiar liberal targets: the rise of a deregulated financial sector and the erosion of accountability in compensating top executives outside finance. (The cohort most reflective of these trends is actually the top 0.1 percent, who make $1.6 million or more, but let's not quibble.)
Both halves of the inequality story should command our attention, because both represent a dramatic reversal of economic trends that prevailed in the United States for most of the 20th century. From the 1930s through the 1970s the 1 percent saw its share of national income decline, while the "college premium" either fell or followed no clear up-or-down pattern over time.
At least some of the tools to restore these more egalitarian trends shouldn't be divisive ideologically. Liberals and conservatives both recognize the benefits of preschool education, which President Obama has proposed making universally available. I've never met an affluent 4-year-old who wasn't enrolled in preschool, but nationwide about one-third of kids that age aren't.
Another reform both conservatives and liberals have supported - though at different times - is withholding federal aid from colleges and universities that can't control tuition increases. Mr. Obama proposed it in his last two State of the Union addresses; House Speaker John A. Boehner was a sponsor of a bill to do the same in 2003.
THERE is also more bipartisan support than you might suppose for restricting some of the Wall Street excesses that enrich the 1 percent. The impetus to do so isn't inequality so much as fear that an out-of-control banking sector will once again create economic crisis and compel Congress to bail out the big banks. Congressional Republicans have been blocking proper implementation of the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, but a growing chorus of conservative voices, including the columnist George F. Will, the former Utah governor Jon M. Huntsman Jr. and Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, favor breaking up the big banks. Senators David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, and Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, have sponsored a bill to require the largest banks to hold more capital reserves, or become smaller.
One reason the left plays down the growing skills-based gap is that it accepts at face value the conservative claim that educational failure is its root cause. But the decline of labor unions is just as important. At one time union membership was highly effective at reducing or eliminating the wage gap between college and high school graduates. That's much less true today. Only about 7 percent of the private-sector labor force is covered by union contracts, about the same proportion as before the New Deal. Six decades ago it was nearly 40 percent.
The decline of labor unions is what connects the skills-based gap to the 1 percent-based gap. Although conservatives often insist that the 1 percent's richesse doesn't come out of the pockets of the 99 percent, that assertion ignores the fact that labor's share of gross domestic product is shrinking while capital's share is growing. Since 1979, except for a brief period during the tech boom of the late 1990s, labor's share of corporate income has fallen. Pension funds have blurred somewhat the venerable distinction between capital and labor. But that's easy to exaggerate, since only about one-sixth of all households own stocks whose value exceeds $7,000. According to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, the G.D.P. shift from labor to capital explains fully one-third of the 1 percent's run-up in its share of national income. It couldn't have happened if private-sector unionism had remained strong.
Reviving labor unions is, sadly, anathema to the right; even many mainstream liberals resist the idea. But if economic growth depends on rewarding effort, we should all worry that the middle classes aren't getting pay increases commensurate with the wealth they create for their bosses. Bosses aren't going to fix this problem. That's the job of unions, and finding ways to rebuild them is liberalism's most challenging task. A bipartisan effort to revive the labor movement is hardly likely, but halting inequality's growth will depend, at the very least, on liberals and conservatives better understanding each other's definition of where the problem lies.

HEADLINE: Bernanke Says Better Days Lie Ahead

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: In an address to graduates at Bard College at Simon&#8217;s Rock, the Fed chairman says nothing about his day job, but he sketches a world in which competition to produce innovations yields ever-greater rewards. 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke is, of course, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, but he always seems most comfortable as an educator, a role he slips into for a commencement address on Saturday at Bard College at Simon's Rock.
If you're looking for news about monetary policy, read no further. Mr. Bernanke's speech mentions not a word about his day job. (In 2009, he opened a commencement address by saying, "The business reporters should go get coffee or something, because I am not going to say anything about the markets or monetary policy." This time, we had to read the whole thing to make sure that no hint of news was buried inside.) 
No doubt the graduating class will be much relieved to have avoided a modern version of Paul Volcker's commencement address at American University in 1984, dug up by Catherine Hollander of National Journal. One can only imagine the faces in that audience as Mr. Volcker announced, "I'd like to take advantage of your captive presence today, before you scatter into the real world, to reflect a bit on that uniqueness, on the justification for our special role and degree of independence within the government, and on the special responsibilities that independence implies."
What Mr. Bernanke's speech delivers, instead, is a brief and engaging sketch of the debate about the state of innovation. 
Economic growth depends on innovation, and some see evidence we're having less of it - or at least that the areas of ongoing innovation, like information technology, are making less difference in our lives. The economist Robert Gordon wrote last year that we're no longer inventing anything as useful as indoor flushable toilets. The economist Tyler Cowen offered a fluid account of the same basic argument in a brief, important book with a long title: "The Great Stagnation: How America Ate All the Low-Hanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick and Will (Eventually) Feel Better."
Mr. Bernanke, describing this argument, compares the present moment with life in 1963, when he was 9 years old. "Though my memory may be selective, it doesn't seem to me that the differences in daily life between then and now are all that large," he says in the prepared text of the speech. "Heating, air conditioning, cooking, and sanitation in my childhood were not all that different from today. We had a dishwasher, a washing machine and a dryer. My family owned a comfortable car with air-conditioning and a radio, and the experience of commercial flight was much like today but without the long security lines. For entertainment, we did not have the Internet or video games, as I mentioned, but we had plenty of books, radio, musical recordings, and a color TV (although, I must acknowledge, the colors were garish and there were many fewer channels to choose from)."
But the real concern is about the future: What if life continues to resemble 1963? What if the Internet doesn't change the world?
And on this count, Mr. Bernanke breaks with the bleak traditions of his dismal profession to declare himself a fundamental optimist.
He notes that pessimism also ran rampant in the 1930s; it is human nature to assume (and to predict) that current trends will persist. "It is common to hear people say that the epoch of enormous economic progress which characterized the 19th century is over; that the rapid improvement in the standard of life is now going to slow down," John Maynard Keynes wrote at the time. Mr. Bernanke adds, "Sound familiar?"
Moreover, he says it is probably too soon to judge the impact of recent innovations.
And he sketches a world in which more people in more countries are pursuing innovations in competition for ever-greater rewards: "In short, both humanity's capacity to innovate and the incentives to innovate are greater today than at any other time in history."
So cheer up, graduates! It's a difficult time to be young but, as this blog notes frequently, you've just taken the single most important step to improve your own prospects: You earned a college degree. Now do the rest of us a favor and innovate.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths ALEXANDER, MARY

 BODY:
ALEXANDER--Mary, of New York, Palm Beach, Mansfield, New Jersey and Bucharest, Romania died peacefully at home in her 85th year, May 16th 2013, fighting to her last breaths, so bravely and surely, after an illness that took all of her away except her essence that remained to say goodbye to this good life she loved so much and lived so well. Mother of Raluca Allison of New York; grandmother to Raleigh Allison and Percy Allison; most loving wife to Nicholas Alexander, deceased and terribly missed these past seven years. She will be missed by so many whom she helped when help was needed; by so many whose course of life she changed; and above all by her closest family who inherited and were inspired by her energy, her ambition, her spirit of adventure, her love of culture, her unquenchable desire to improve, her vast curiosity, her presence as the force of life she was. 
Born and educated in Romania, she went on to get a PhD in economics, attain a senior position in the Central Bank where she oversaw major industries; winning the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest recognition for professional service; and yet accomplished all this without political affiliation under a communist system she viscerally opposed, and, despite marriage to a man, the 50-year love of her life, who was a scion of one of the country's leading pre-communist families. Here was a woman who had the courage and vision to flee this oppressive system in her forties, leaving everything behind family, friends, job, prestige, home, belongings, money for freedom and dignity and prosperity in the United States, the adopted country she and her husband so loved and gave so much to, and, most of all, for the opportunity to give their one and only daughter, Raluca, a life worth living. And Mary did all this with no supports except her own drives and family. She did all this with false starts. She did all this having to learn in mid-life a new language and new ways. And she succeeded establishing a successful business in the great American entrepreneurial tradition; building homes and new family roots; sending her daughter to Yale and Columbia and on to a successful family and business life of her own; involving herself politically as she felt she must and attending two Presidential inaugurals as an emblem of her American commitment; following her longstanding interest in poetry, opera, and the life of the mind; and all the while enjoying all the little, daily things of life. The life force she was devastated as she was by the loss of her dearest Nick in 2006 and by the onset of a long Alzheimer's journey never once was lost, so much so, that to her very last breaths she knew her family and her family knew her and she fought with the final grains of her body's strength to say goodbye. She will be remembered and honored. She will inspire those who knew her. Most of all her spirit is a presence in the lives of her family and descendants who are happy at her peace even as they grieve at their loss. A funeral service will take place at St. James' Church at 11:00am., May 20th followed by a private burial service at the Princeton Cemetery. Donations to St. James' Church in lieu of flowers.

HEADLINE: A Deduction Unevenly Used

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
A new report from the Pew Charitable Trusts reinforces what many economists have been saying for some time: the mortgage interest deduction primarily benefits high-income homeowners.
The report charts the geographic distribution of those using the deduction across and within the 50 states. The states with the largest percentages of tax filers claiming the deduction are clustered along the East and West Coasts, in more affluent areas with relatively high property values. 
The illustration isn't completely predictable, however, particularly when it comes to the varied usage within states. And those nuances could help inform the current debate in Washington over whether to shrink or even eliminate the interest deduction, which, at $72 billion in 2011, is the third largest in terms of foregone tax revenue.
A minority of tax filers benefit from the deduction, primarily because it is restricted to those who itemize deductions on their federal income tax returns. According to the Tax Policy Center of the Urban and Brookings institutes, only about 30 percent of taxpayers itemize, rather than take the standard deduction.
The Pew report found that Maryland taxpayers take greatest advantage of the mortgage deduction, with 37 percent having claimed it in 2010. Connecticut comes in a close second, at 34 percent. North Dakota and West Virginia taxpayers derive the least benefit, with claim rates of 15 percent.
One surprising finding is the presence of Colorado and Utah among the top six states for claim rates, especially compared with New York, which ranks 35th.
That seeming anomaly reflects the higher level of construction activity in Western states, said Michael Lea, the director of the Corky McMillin Center for Real Estate at San Diego State University. ''People have been moving there and buying newer houses,'' he said, ''and those have been larger houses, in part because they get the benefit of the tax deduction.''
Shrinking the focus on claims to the metropolitan level, the New York area shows a claim rate just shy of 20 percent, considerably below the national average. Anne Stauffer, a project director at Pew, says the low average can be explained partly, but not completely, by the area's high rental rate.
Ms. Stauffer outlined two ways in which altering the mortgage interest deduction could affect states. If their tax codes are directly linked to the mortgage interest deduction, any change in the deduction could affect state revenues. Also, economic activity within states could shift along with a revision that increases or decreases income taxes.
The real estate and building industries have opposed changes to the deduction, cautioning that it could set back the housing market recovery. In the estimation of Mr. Lea, the degree to which lowering the deduction would depress real estate prices in high-use areas would probably depend on how the change was administered.
''If it was phased in,'' he said, ''we would probably see some decline in house prices in the short run, but over time I think that the forces of supply and demand in those areas would dominate.''
Mr. Lea's preference would be a much lower cap on the deduction than the current $1 million in mortgage debt.
''I would actually advocate going one step further and replacing it with a first-time home-buyer tax credit,'' he added. ''If your real intent is to stimulate homeownership, that's a much better way.''

Not that Subaru is doing badly. Sales in the United States have increased in each of the last four years, setting records. But the Forester -- last reworked in 2008 -- has not been part of that growth, with sales shrinking some 10 percent in 2011 and stalling at that level last year.
The Forester has, in part, been a casualty of the brawl in the compact sport utility market in recent years, with automakers landing blow and counterblow by improving fuel economy while adding luxury, performance and safety features previously unseen in this class. Chasing market leaders like the Honda CR-V and Ford Escape, the major automakers are updating or introducing new models very quickly, said Tom Libby, senior forecasting analyst at Polk, the automotive data firm.
Now Subaru joins that melee with a Forester that offers more room, new features and better fuel economy, all based on the underpinnings of the redesigned Impreza introduced in 2011. Subaru's two-pronged market strategy continues: there's the standard Forester 2.5i and then the 2.0XT, a sportier turbocharged model. 
Prices start at $22,820 for a 2.5i with a 6-speed manual transmission; a continuously variable automatic is $1,000 extra. The least expensive sport model is the 2.0XT Premium, priced at $28,820.
But picking the fancier 2.0XT Touring version and adding a package of high-tech features that includes lane-departure warning, adaptive cruise control, high-intensity-discharge low-beam headlights and precollision braking can push the price past $36,000. That figure suggests high hubris, given that Foresters have never been considered prestige models, but a richly optioned Escape can also reach that level.
I tested both a 2.5i Premium, which had a sticker price of $26,320, and a 2.0XT Touring ($36,220).
The 2014 Forester is 1.4 inches longer and gets a new look -- lauded by company officials -- that drew little attention in two weeks of driving around northern New Hampshire, a prime habitat of Subaru enthusiasts. But settle inside and the all-around visibility is good; a huge panoramic sunroof, standard on many models, furthers the sense of openness.
Core Subaru values like practicality have not been forsaken. The basic controls for heating, cooling and ventilation rely on an increasingly forgotten and simple pleasure: large, easy-to-use knobs. However, an optional touch screen for functions like the stereo is frustrating, with tiny boxes best suited to dainty little fingers.
An important change is the addition of 3.7 inches more legroom in the rear, which Subaru justifiably felt was needed to attract families with children. That increase means the Forester now has more rear legroom than major competitors like the CR-V, Escape and Toyota RAV4. Behind the second row there's a competitive 34.4 cubic feet of space (31.5 when equipped with a sunroof).
There are also important mechanical upgrades. The quaint 4-speed automatic that hobbled the previous generation's acceleration and fuel economy is gone. It has been replaced with an utterly agreeable C.V.T. that offers a strong and instant response to the accelerator. Fuel economy is greatly improved, by up to 5 m.p.g on the highway and 3 m.p.g. in town.
A 6-speed manual transmission is standard on the two least expensive 2.5i trim levels, replacing a 5-speed manual. All other models get the C.V.T.
The entry-level engine is a 170-horsepower 2.5-liter flat 4-cylinder introduced in the 2012 Forester and then added to the 2013 Outback and Legacy models. With the automatic, it is rated at 24 m.p.g. city and 32 m.p.g. highway. Pick the 6-speed manual and the fuel economy drops to 22 city and 29 highway.
The other engine choice is the turbocharged direct-injection 4 rated at 250 horsepower at 5,600 r.p.m. Available only on the 2.0XT, it is making its North American debut. Mileage with the turbo engine is rated at 23/28, one mile per gallon less in the city and four on the highway than the 2.5-liter engine.
That 250 horsepower is up from the 224 produced by last year's 2.5-liter turbo. However, that gain is offset somewhat by extra pounds. The 2.0XT's curb weight of 3,622 pounds reflects an increase of about 172 pounds, in part a result of bigger wheels and brakes.
Subaru says the base 2.5-liter Forester will go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 9.3 seconds with the C.V.T. The turbocharged 2.0XT is 3.1 seconds quicker.
During two weeks of driving in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, what the 2.5i and 2.0XT proved to have in common was driving satisfaction, albeit in different amounts.
The electric power steering, new for 2014, is predictable and properly weighted, and for an all-wheel-drive vehicle the Forester is pleasingly quick to dig into a turn.
During brisk driving, lifting off the gas also allows a weight transfer to the front tires that nudges the Forester a little more deeply into the turn. That's when the rapid response of the variable transmission comes into play. A slight push on the gas pedal and there's an instant application of power, shifting weight to the rear and scooting the Forester out of the turn.
It is not surprising that the 250-horsepower 2.0XT provides the kind of acceleration that allows passing maneuvers on a two-lane mountain road that the driver of a 2.5-liter model would never dare. Subaru says the 2.0XT takes about 6.2 seconds to reach 60 m.p.h. A pair of switches also lets the XT driver select two sportier modes that speed up the powertrain response.
But the 2.0XT gets more than extra power. The suspension is firmer, the brakes are larger and there's a brace to stiffen the rear suspension. It also gets 18-inch wheels instead of the 17-inch rims of the regular Forester.
In theory this should provide better handling, and the XT's responses do seem sharper, although the steering felt lighter.
But there's a cost-benefit matter. The standard Forester already has more than enough cornering power for all but the most ruthless enthusiasts. In addition, the XT's ride on a rough surface is stiffer than the standard Forester's, which already can be somewhat harsh. The XT would be, I suggest, a more successful package if the suspension settings were recalibrated a bit toward to the comfort end of the scale.
Like its predecessor, the Forester has 8.7 inches of ground clearance, improving its chances in deep snow or on a rough, muddy road. There's also a new feature called X Mode designed for particularly challenging, slippery surfaces. Select it and the computer makes changes aimed at limiting wheelspin.
The 2014 Forester was also the only small utility wagon to get top rating in a new small overlap front crash test conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. In addition, the Forester earned a Top Safety Pick+ label for its good performance in a battery of tests.
Last year Subaru sold about 76,000 Foresters, while Honda, the leader in this market segment, sold 282,000 CR-Vs. Subaru may never match the sales volume of much larger automakers like Toyota (part owner of Fuji Heavy Industries, Subaru's parent) or Ford and Honda. But Subaru hopes to increase sales of the Forester to about 100,000, and with this more serious contender that ought to be within reach.

HEADLINE: The Giant of Shareholders, Quietly Stirring

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
AT 11 a.m. on a Wednesday earlier this month, Michelle Edkins and her team began wheeling extra chairs into a cramped conference room in a San Francisco office tower, preparing for the corporate-governance equivalent of speed dating.
Once settled, Yumi Narita started describing the disappointing qualities of a big entertainment company she'd been checking out. ''I'm inclined not to trust this compensation committee,'' she told the group. ''Year-over-year, they pay their C.E.O. more, and the metrics are often questionable.''
There were sympathetic nods around the room. Ms. Narita is one of about 20 analysts on the corporate governance team at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. BlackRock's size is mind-boggling. With almost $4 trillion under management, it is, according to a recent University of Michigan study, the single largest shareholder in one of every five United States companies. It manages money from pension funds and endowments as well as retail investors, controls large stakes in companies like JPMorgan Chase, Wal-Mart and Chevron and owns 5 percent or more of roughly 40 percent of all publicly traded companies in the country. 
These investments give BlackRock tremendous influence, particularly now, during proxy season. At this time of year, public companies hold annual meetings, and shareholders vote on executive pay and elect corporate directors. Inside BlackRock, the small group of analysts led by Ms. Edkins meets every morning for about an hour, hashing out how BlackRock will vote its clients' shares in hundreds of contests, zeroing in on directors they feel have been around too long, or ones who they think are overpaying executives.
These analysts have a language of their own, casually throwing around terms like ''overboarding,'' for when directors serve on multiple boards, possibly spreading themselves too thin; ''engagement,'' when a problem reaches a critical stage and merits a visit from a BlackRock analyst; and ''refreshment,'' when engagement doesn't work and a director needs a heave-ho.
BlackRock is no activist investor. In fact, it's far from it. It has never sponsored a shareholder proposal, and it rarely broadcasts its actions. Ms. Edkins says the firm generally votes against a director or a company proposal only when a behind-the-scenes ''engagement'' has failed.
A number of public pension funds and activist shareholders argue that BlackRock could use its influence to greater effect and say it sides with management far too often. It received a failing grade from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in a 2012 survey; BlackRock voted with the federation just twice in 32 shareholder votes on issues that the union sees as important to the trustees of union pension funds.
''We believe shareholders have the power and the obligation to use every tool at their disposal to encourage greater accountability,'' said Brandon Rees, acting director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Office of Investment. ''It's disappointing that such a large company like BlackRock votes for so few shareholder resolutions.''
There is agreement, however, that the firm has become more active in recent years, as other shareholders, too, have been expressing themselves more forcefully. It's easy to be cynical about the value of voting on what are ultimately nonbinding resolutions that companies can ignore. But investors can now wield more power than in the past, partly because of recent laws that require companies to hold a vote on issues like executive pay. On Tuesday, in fact, shareholders of JPMorgan Chase will meet in Tampa, Fla., where the company is expected to announce the results of a the vote on an unusually tense confrontation over a motion to split the roles of chairman and C.E.O., both now held by Jamie Dimon.
BlackRock's influence over the governance of corporations has increased as the company itself has expanded. It gained prominence during the financial crisis when Laurence D. Fink -- a BlackRock co-founder and its current chief executive -- became the government's go-to guy to analyze and manage hard-to-value assets. BlackRock expanded this expertise into a separate business, advising troubled governments around the world, like Greece and Ireland. In 2009, the firm bought Barclays Global Investors in a $13.5 billion cash-and-shares deal that transformed BlackRock overnight into the world's largest asset manager. BlackRock controls both actively managed shares, and millions more that sit in exchange-traded funds.
''BlackRock is the silent giant,'' said Gerald Davis, a professor of management and organizations at the University of Michigan. He said the firm had almost no name recognition, despite managing more money than household names like Vanguard and Fidelity. ''No one really knows about BlackRock but they are incredibly powerful.''
MS. EDKINS, an understated 43-year-old from New Zealand, leads BlackRock's corporate governance effort. She got her first taste of annual reports and the corporate documents that would become her future at the University of Otago as an economics teaching assistant, where she analyzed annual reports to see which companies were disclosing their environmental impact. The experience of parsing often-dry sentences didn't immediately turn Ms. Edkins into a corporate-governance geek. Instead, she landed a job at New Zealand's central bank and later at the British High Commission in Wellington.
In 1997, she moved to England without a job and answered an ad in The Financial Times for a ''corporate government executive'' at Hermes Pensions Management. ''I had to look up what corporate governance was,'' she said, laughing.
Eight years later, Ms. Edkins moved to Governance for Owners, a small shareholder advisory firm in London. In an odd twist, Governance for Owners was recently charged with voting BlackRock's shares in the proxy contest over splitting the role of chairman and chief executive at JPMorgan Chase. United States law requires BlackRock, thanks to its ties to a bank holding company, to turn over its votes to an independent third party when ownership exceeds a certain threshold. This provision is aimed at preventing any one company from having inordinate influence over the banking industry.
Ms. Edkins ended up at BlackRock in 2009, and later moved to San Francisco to lead its governance group. The way things worked in the United States, she said, came as a bit of a shock. Countries like Britain, she said, have a longer history of shareholders engaged in governance. ''There is an agreed standard that has typically been developed by some commission,'' she said. ''Here, there is no uniform code.''
She said shareholders typically had more rights in Europe, which encourages companies to talk to shareholder groups. ''In Europe it is about engagement,'' she said. ''Here it was, and still often is, about voting.'' This, she said, leads to a more confrontational governance system in the United States.
She raised this issue at a June 2011 meeting of top BlackRock managers, including Mr. Fink. ''Companies wait until the 11th hour to come to us or they assume we are going to follow I.S.S.,'' Ms. Edkins says she told the group, referring to Institutional Shareholder Services, the shareholder advisory firm that recommends how shareholders should vote. ''It's frustrating.''
Mr. Fink was receptive to Ms. Edkins's appeal. After the meeting, he wrote a letter to virtually every United States company in which BlackRock owns a stake. ''Companies that focus only on gaining the support of proxy advisory firms risk forgoing valuable and necessary engagements directly with shareholders,'' he wrote. ''We reach our voting decisions independently of proxy advisory firms on the basis of guidelines that reflect our perspective as a fiduciary investor with responsibilities to protect the economic interests of our clients.''
The letter counted as very big news in the decorous world of corporate governance, and seemed to suggest that shareholder advisory firms, as non-shareholders, had too much influence on voting. The letter was also seen as a public declaration that companies should call BlackRock if they have a problem, and not assume that it would follow advisory firm guidance.
Just days after Mr. Fink's letter was released, Martin Lipton and David Karp, Wall Street lawyers at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, wrote to their clients that ''it is a helpful sign that a major institutional investor is willing to take a direct and pragmatic role in governance issues rather than outsourcing this responsibility to a proxy advisory firm or agitating for short-term results.''
MS. EDKINS oversees 20 or so people covering thousands of companies around the world, and BlackRock says they make their own decisions -- regardless of the views of the firm's portfolio managers or even Mr. Fink. During the 2012 proxy season, BlackRock voted shares on 129,814 proposals at 14,872 shareholder meetings worldwide. Almost 3,800 of those meetings were in the United States.
BlackRock analysts don't comb through every shareholder proposal. Rather, Ms. Edkins says, the firm uses the advisory services I.S.S. and Glass, Lewis & Company to help summarize proxy statements. Once those services have identified an issue, BlackRock assigns an analyst to it.
J. Boyd Douglas, the president of CPSI, a health care provider in Mobile, Ala., said he was surprised when BlackRock withheld its vote for one of his company's independent directors, W. Austin Mulherin, in 2012. Mr. Mulherin is a local lawyer and his firm, according to regulatory filings, annually receives ''less than $120,0000'' in legal fees from CPSI. This relationship called into question his independence (and earned the disapproval of I.S.S.).
After the annual meeting, CPSI arranged for Mr. Mulherin step down in 2014. ''There was a delay because it's hard to find good directors here; we are not Chicago,'' Mr. Douglas said. ''We needed some time.'' (Mr. Mulherin did not return a call seeking comment.)
This wasn't enough for I.S.S., and Mr. Douglas said that this year I.S.S. took a run at Mr. Douglas himself, as well as another director. Mr. Douglas immediately called BlackRock, its second-largest shareholder, asking for its support.
''We are trying and we are making changes and we don't think it was in best interest of shareholders for Austin to come off the board immediately,'' Mr. Douglas said he told a member of BlackRock's governance team. He said the BlackRock staff member listened ''respectfully'' but didn't say much. BlackRock declined to comment about CPSI, but Mr. Douglas said he and the other director that I.S.S. targeted this year were re-elected with BlackRock's support. (The voting history of money managers like BlackRock becomes a matter of public record at the end of August.)
BlackRock has disagreed with the recommendation of the proxy advisory firms in a number of instances. For example, I.S.S. and Glass, Lewis generally support companies splitting the role of chairman and chief executive in order to create stronger, independent boards, which counterbalance management. BlackRock has rarely voted to split the role, believing that if a company has a strong lead director, there is likely no need to sever the roles.
BlackRock holds firm to certain principles when it comes to boards it sees as in need of ''refreshment'' -- directors who have been around too long or serve on too many boards. In 2012, it voted against three directors of Coca-Cola -- Ronald W. Allen, Barry Diller and Jacob Wallenberg -- because each serves on more than four boards, the tipping point that suggests to BlackRock that a director is ''overboarding.''
Mark Preisinger, director of corporate governance at Coca-Cola, said his company was happy with its board but knew BlackRock's policy, so that it was no surprise when the firm voted against these directors. Despite its ''no'' votes, he said BlackRock was engaged with Coke on numerous topics.
BlackRock has also voted against or withheld votes from compensation committee members at companies when it thinks that they pay executives too much. Still, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said that in 2012, the firm voted against board nominees at just 6 percent of United States companies. In contrast, the federation voted against 42 percent of all board nominees. And BlackRock almost always sides with management in ''say on pay'' measures.
WHILE BlackRock is more likely than not to side with management, it has been known to vote with more vocal shareholders.
In 2010, it voted against the management of the Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, which recommended supporting a takeover by Hertz for a $51 a share. Robert Zivnuska, who runs BlackRock's governance effort for the Americas, said a BlackRock team concluded that company was better off as a stand-alone concern. Other shareholders agreed and rejected the Hertz offer. Two years later, Dollar Thrifty was sold to Hertz for $87.50 a share, almost 60 percent higher than the 2010 offer.
''Since Ms. Edkins took over, we have seen a real change and willingness to dialogue with other investors and we hope she continues on this path,'' said Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of the CtW Investment Group, which represents union pension funds.
Back in the conference room in San Francisco in May, Zachary Oleksiuk, another analyst, gave his report to the group via video conference from Princeton, N.J.. He was in charge of keeping track of Occidental Petroleum, an oil and gas exploration company based in Los Angeles, some of whose directors had served for many years and were richly rewarded. BlackRock, with a $4.6 billion stake in Occidental, is its largest shareholder.
''As you all know, Occidental has been a perennial company of concern to us,'' Mr. Oleksiuk said. Just a few weeks before, he met with two key Occidental directors to voice BlackRock's dissatisfaction. ''I sent our message to them in person,'' he told the group. The message was that BlackRock planned to vote against the company's longest-serving directors and its entire compensation committee. BlackRock was certainly not the only investor objecting to the board, and a week after Mr. Oleksiuk's meeting with Occidental, the oil company issued a statement clarifying its succession planning, hoping to quell some of the concern. It wasn't enough.
This month, Ray Irani, the chairman and former C.E.O., stepped down from his post after failing to receive the support of a majority of investors. Whether it was BlackRock's ''engagement'' or the vote, or both, one thing was clear: shareholders made a difference.

HEADLINE: Why We Take the F.D.R. to La Guardia

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Alfred Stieglitz titled his stark 1910 photograph of the percolating Lower Manhattan skyline ''City of Ambition.'' Fittingly, Mason B. Williams borrows the name for a book about two transformative figures whose political and civic genius helped New York deliver on that promise.
In ''City of Ambition: FDR, La Guardia and the Making of Modern New York'' (Norton, $29.95), Dr. Williams, a historian and first-time author, explores what drove those visionaries, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Fiorello H. La Guardia, to overhaul the city and revive it from the Great Depression. Separately, their stories are familiar. Dr. Williams's contribution is to remind readers of the unusual personal and political bond forged by a big-city mayor and a president, and to show its value. 
It is no coincidence, he writes, that many New Yorkers take the F.D.R. Drive on the way to La Guardia Airport. The public works wrought by the New Deal -- and by the symbiotic collaboration between Roosevelt, the patrician Democrat, and La Guardia, the street-smart Republican -- overcame the petty local politics, vested interests and individual agendas that stood in the way of massive urban development, much of it overseen by La Guardia's construction coordinator, Robert Moses.
''New York in depression and war was a city of decidedly public ambitions,'' Dr. Williams writes: a city of libraries, parks, local health clinics, free adult education, model housing, and ''bridges and tunnels and airports intended to integrate the five boroughs and to link the city to the metropolitan region and the wider world.''
La Guardia survived barely two years beyond Roosevelt. Disillusioned by the shift from the New Deal toward cold war politics, Dr. Williams writes, he would ''spend the last months of his life engaged in a contest to preserve what he regarded as Roosevelt's proper legacy; he would die believing it had been all but lost.''
Henry A. Wallace, the former vice president, lamented in his eulogy: ''First Roosevelt, now La Guardia -- the fighters are taken from us when we need them most, but the fight continues.''â--
John B. Manbeck, a professor emeritus at Kingsborough Community College and a former Brooklyn borough historian, collects his columns from the revived Brooklyn Eagle in a second enlightening and engaging anthology, ''Chronicles of Historic Brooklyn'' (The History Press, $19.99).
In an earlier collection, he explored Brooklyn's origins. ''With this volume, I have tried to fill in the blanks,'' he writes, in essays on subjects ranging from Ebbets Field to Coney Island and the lost personalities of a borough that has been altered both by nature and by development. Brooklyn, he concludes, ''is all grown up now.''â--
So enticing are the guilty pleasures in ''New York Sweets: A Sugarhound's Guide to the Best Bakeries, Ice Cream Parlors, Candy Shops and Other Emporia of Delicious Delights'' (Rizzoli, $29.95) that it seems possible to put on a few pounds just by sampling Susan Pear Meisel's lavish photographs and piquant text.
This milk-and-honey vision of New York by Ms. Meisel, a photographer and caterer, is presented geographically and embellished with recipes from many of the local artisans and shops profiled. The mass-produced black-and-white cookie is not included, but Ms. Meisel places more innovative New York confections on a well-earned pedestal with the bagel and pizza by the slice.

HEADLINE: Show Us Your Woe

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
IN the service of what I'm about to write, an admission I'm loath to make: I watch ''The Voice.''
It gets worse. I watch ''American Idol,'' too.
Not whole seasons. Not even whole episodes. If I may brag a little, no one can fast-forward like I can, compressing two recorded hours of ''The Voice'' into 34 minutes and the ''Idol'' finale on Thursday night into about 19, including the pauses to top off my Chablis and brush the cracker crumbs from my comforter.
But I've experienced enough of these shows to know that they're not merely singing competitions. They're misery competitions. Bad-luck bake-offs. I'll see you your high school expulsion, and I'll raise you my stint in rehab.
I've experienced enough of them, in other words, to feel the onset of hardship fatigue, and changing the channel to CNN or MSNBC doesn't bring relief. Candidates for elective office tell us not just how high they've climbed but how high they've climbed against all odds, as if that's the only way accomplishment really means anything; as if survival itself confers great merit on the survivor; as if the bleak shall inherit the earth. 
There's a vivid streak of this in history, from Abe Lincoln's log home to Bill Clinton's turbulent one. But it seems more florid now. The economy's stubborn funk has ratcheted up our suspicion of perks and privileges and our support for underdogs, to a point where we're less taken with what people have achieved than with what they've endured.
In politics and in prime time, the contestants with the most traction are frequently the contestants with the gravest trials: afflictions, addictions, lost loves, lost dogs. I'm kidding about the canines, but only slightly. If there aren't any epic setbacks in your biography, your political consultants or your ''Voice'' producers will find and amplify whatever garden-variety sorrows do exist. They're like divining rods for tears, Yo-Yo Ma's of the heartstrings.
That's surely why a sort of weariness and skepticism was the response among a few New Yorkers I know to last week's revelations by Christine Quinn, the mayoral candidate, that she'd struggled with bulimia and alcoholism. They've grown so inured to the process of public figures rummaging through the past for hard knocks that they greet it in a jaded fashion, wondering how to tell the real aches from the exaggerated ones.
Fetishized misfortune -- hardship porn -- has numbed them. That's the biggest problem with it. It equates and mashes everything into one sentimental mush, cheapening uncommon suffering by showcasing it alongside the rest. It bends all life stories into identical arcs, no matter how different those stories are.
Think back to the Republican convention in Tampa, where so many speakers peddled similar tales of heroic forebears and humble origins that genuinely inspirational narratives were lost in the clutter. One moment, Tim Pawlenty was talking about the early death of his mother, when he was just 16; another moment, Rand Paul was reaching back generations to tell the audience: ''My great-grandfather, like many, came to this country in search of the American dream. No sooner had he stepped off the boat than his father died.''
Ann Romney remembered the basement apartment and tuna casseroles that she and Mitt once shared in a voice not unlike Condoleezza Rice's when she flashed back to her Birmingham girlhood in the Jim Crow era. Everyone's come a long way! Marco Rubio had by then already revised his family's saga, because he'd been getting it wrong, claiming that his parents had fled Castro's Cuba when they'd initially left years before he seized power. When you enter the hardship sweepstakes, you tend to overreach.
And anyone who can get in the game does. Democratic and Republican strategists alike crow about what ''a great story'' a candidate has, meaning that it includes great challenges, which are seen as the handiest routes to rendering the candidate ''relatable.'' Heidi Heitkamp, the Democratic senator from North Dakota, was toughened by breast cancer, Elizabeth Warren by waiting tables at 13 and Paul Ryan by waking up one morning when he was still in high school and finding his father dead in bed. Those aren't just anecdotes that flit by. They're foundational ordeals, mentioned incessantly.
And that suggests another problem with hardship porn: its insinuation that surmounting obstacles equals acquiring real character, which is ostensibly impossible without tough times. Romney was punished by this thinking; that's why Ann took the oratorical tack she did.
But I know strong, empathetic people who haven't weathered anything much more distressing than a hangnail, and I know jerks who are graduates of garish travails. Hardship isn't necessarily the crucible in which virtue is formed. Sometimes it's just hardship, sad and unenviable, and the man or woman on the far side of it is exactly who he or she was before: kindly or cruel, brave or timid.
I care less about Heitkamp's grit in the face of disease than about her cowardice in the face of gun-control legislation, which she voted against. I care less about how quickly Ryan was forced to grow up than about how unyielding he can be on certain social and fiscal issues, and what I want to know from Quinn is how she'll improve the city's schools and give its kids a real chance.
I can marvel at Olympic athletes' dominance without the hardscrabble back stories, presented in three minutes of gauzy footage, scored to bathetic music, that speak not just to the sacrifices they made but to the despair that almost swallowed them. In a ''Voice'' or ''Idol'' contestant, I prefer perfect pitch to perfect heartbreak.
These shows, like other elimination competitions, are clapping, stomping tributes to obstacles surmounted and pain sloughed off -- ''Dancing Queen for a Day'' -- and they have an astonishing knack for attracting talent under true duress. Last season's ''Idol'' winner, Phillip Phillips, performed through kidney stones; this season's runner-up, Kree Harrison, has already lost both her parents.
Over on ''The Voice,'' there's nary a sick relative unmentioned or rotten break unplumbed, and contestants are forever stifling sobs. The show, trying to one-up the best of ''Idol,'' insists on it.
Until about two weeks ago, I was mystified by how Judith Hill, the seeming front-runner on ''The Voice'' this season, had survived the screening process, given her good fortune. She's already sung professionally with Michael Jackson and her helicopter parents are always near, beaming and applauding.
Then she shared a secret: she was rehabilitating a ''scary'' node on her vocal cords. Hardship!
When she hit her high notes that night, it wasn't just a feat of artistry. It was a triumph over adversity.

HEADLINE: Sony's Unwanted Genre: Suspense

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES and MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
NOWHERE is the opulence of Old Hollywood more palpable than on the Sony Pictures lot in Culver City. Arching just inside the front gate is an eight-story rainbow. This grand $1.6 million sculpture, a condition of a lot expansion, rose last year and became a symbolic link between past glories -- ''The Wizard of Oz'' was filmed here -- and current ones. Years of cutbacks have taken the shine off many studios, which now look like glorified factories. But Sony has preserved its lot as a perfect little movieland town: executive suites overflow with orchids, and cafes border a new park where employees sip lattes and stretch on the grass.
The mood extends beyond the walls of the 44 1/2-acre lot. Each year, Sony rents out the entire Ritz-Carlton Cancún Resort for an international press junket. Day after day, the studio flies in stars and hosts parties.
''What I love about Sony,'' said Matthew Tolmach, a former executive at the studio and now a producer based on its lot, ''is that they still love movies, and they are incredibly aggressive about making all kinds of them.'' He added: ''It's why I want to live there.'' 
While competitors like Paramount, Disney and even Warner Brothers have gone through ferocious consolidation -- all focusing more narrowly on blockbuster-style fantasies and superhero movies -- Sony has been slower to give up the industry's broad prerogatives. Its ambitions still stretch from R-rated romps to ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' to tiny foreign films to African-American comedies to Oscar-caliber dramas. That requires making a home not just for Mr. Tolmach but also for an extensive family of filmmakers and stars.
Sometimes it pays. Last year, Sony Pictures Entertainment generated about $4.4 billion in global ticket sales, the highest in its history, powered by nine No. 1 hits including ''Skyfall,'' ''Men in Black 3'' and ''The Vow.'' It had an Oscar contender, ''Zero Dark Thirty,'' started a new franchise, ''Hotel Transylvania,'' and revived an old one, ''21 Jump Street.'' It ended the year in first place in market share.
But in true Hollywood style, the Sony picture is not quite what it seems.
The truth is that Sony finds itself at a troubled crossroads. Its go-to stars -- Adam Sandler and Will Smith -- are now a generation older than the prime film-going audience. And its steep production and infrastructure costs burden Sony with one of Hollywood's worst profit margins. Sony's entertainment unit had an operating margin of 6.5 percent in its last fiscal year; the figures at Warner Brothers, Disney, Paramount and 20th Century Fox were all higher.
It is extremely hard to compare studios, analysts warn. Some make only movies, while others, like Sony, also make television shows. Financing arrangements and accounting vary. Sony does not divulge how much of its profit comes from movies and how much comes from its fast-growing television business.
In its last fiscal year, the studio reported operating income of $509 million, up 40 percent from a year before. That result looks fantastic until you consider that roughly 65 percent of the total, analysts estimate, came from a relatively small television arm that includes shows like ''Wheel of Fortune'' and ''Breaking Bad'' as well as overseas cable channels. Analysts complain that the giant movie side is holding back profitability.
The movie unit has also lost the man long seen as its protector inside Sony, the far-flung Japanese electronics behemoth. That man is Howard Stringer, who was Sony's chief executive for seven years. Last year, he turned over the Sony helm to Kazuo Hirai. Mr. Stringer will retire as chairman next month.
But the truly startling plot twist came on Tuesday. Daniel S. Loeb, the activist hedge fund manager known for successfully engineering a shake-up at Yahoo, told Mr. Hirai in a letter that his Third Point investment fund had become Sony's largest shareholder, with a 6.5 percent stake. With that announcement, Mr. Loeb proposed breathtaking changes at the company, including a spin-off of up to 20 percent of its studio and other entertainment holdings.
Overnight, Michael M. Lynton, the C.E.O. of both Sony Pictures and Sony Entertainment, and Amy Pascal, co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures, found themselves under a kind of weight rarely felt in Hollywood since the 1980s, when corporate raiders and high-yield bond peddlers like Saul Steinberg, the Bass brothers and Michael Milken delved into studios, looking for hidden value.
''The entertainment businesses are important contributors to Sony's growth and are not for sale,'' Sony asserted in response to Mr. Loeb. ''We look forward to continuing constructive dialogue with our shareholders as we pursue our strategy.''
A spokeswoman for Mr. Lynton and Ms. Pascal said they had no comment. Several days before the disclosure of Mr. Loeb's letter -- in response to questions about the studio's performance and its movie release lineup -- Steve Elzer, a Sony spokesman, wrote in an e-mail, ''We have been strong and steady not just for a year, but for longer than a decade.'' He added, ''We couldn't be more confident in our slate this summer and through the year.''
The scrutiny from Mr. Loeb comes as Sony, with movie brands that include Columbia, Screen Gems and TriStar, prepares to pull off a death-defying summer. Starting May 31, the studio, which hasn't released a major movie since December, will roll out seven significant films in a span of 14 weeks, more than any rival.
An ensemble comedy like ''Grown Ups 2,'' starring Chris Rock, Kevin James, David Spade and Mr. Sandler, is a relatively safe box-office bet. An inexpensive comedy, ''This Is the End,'' about celebrities facing an apocalypse while partying at James Franco's house, is generating substantial advance buzz. And a concert film about the boy band One Direction that cost almost nothing to make is expected to be popular with teenage girls and to deliver fat profits.
But there are ominous clouds as well. ''After Earth,'' a dark science-fiction tale starring Jaden Smith and his father, Will, is attracting solid attention from moviegoers ahead of its May 31 arrival, according to prerelease tracking surveys. But people who have seen it tend to grimace when asked if it's any good. The movie was directed by M. Night Shyamalan, whose box-office history is bumpy at best.
''Elysium,'' a science-fiction drama starring Matt Damon and Jodie Foster and directed by Neill Blomkamp, comes at the end of a crowded summer. (Sony contends that this will actually work in its favor, as happened with Mr. Blomkamp's ''District 9'' in 2009.) And ''The Smurfs 2,'' while expected to be big overseas, is one of no less than six computer-animated movies in North American theaters between June and August, up from three last year.
Mr. Lynton acknowledged at a conference this month that the competition would be brutal. Though most Hollywood studios have radically cut their release schedules, an unusually large number of major films are crammed into the coming three months: 22, up from 15 in the same period last year. ''It's a scary summer,'' he said, ''because it's like walking through the Himalayas when I see the gigantic movies coming in.'' And for Sony, the competition is coming at just the wrong time.
SONY faces the same challenges as every studio. Costs keep rising as DVD sales weaken. Word-of-mouth on Twitter and Facebook makes attracting an audience on movie opening weekends harder; if ticket buyers rip apart a movie online on a Friday, fewer people show up on Saturday.
But after Mr. Loeb's letter went public, Sony shares soared 10 percent, and analysts cheered. ''Bravo Loeb,'' said Harold L. Vogel, an analyst and the author of the book ''Entertainment Industry Economics,'' adding, ''It might be the best thing to happen to Sony in at least 20 years.''
Mr. Loeb's suggestion was viewed as a long-overdue call to unlink two disparate businesses -- electronics and entertainment -- and to cut studio spending. ''There is an inherent logic to what Loeb is saying,'' said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Nomura, a Tokyo-based financial services company. ''All of us have been pressuring the companies we cover to put less capital into the film business.''
Sony, while still rooted in Old Hollywood, has nonetheless started to change. In the fall, Mr. Lynton and Ms. Pascal started broad cost cuts, trimming spending on development (scripts, literary materials), laying off home-entertainment employees, winnowing spending on marketing and downsizing the studio's mail room. ''We combed through every single division, right down to where things are stored,'' said one Sony executive who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid conflict with the studio's public stance.
Studio executives say the summer movies reflect smarter spending. ''After Earth'' cost about $135 million to make, while ''Elysium,'' jointly produced and financed with Media Rights Capital, cost about $115 million. The budget for the thriller ''White House Down'' was roughly $150 million. Those expenditures may sound astronomical to the uninitiated, but summer movies now routinely cost $200 million or more. (Examples this year include ''The Lone Ranger'' from Disney and ''Man of Steel'' from Warner Bros.)''They understand that business has changed, it's harder to make a profit, and they are being incredibly responsible,'' Mr. Tolmach said.
But there is also an air of defiance at Sony, where executives contend that their moviemaking strategy is perfectly attuned to the marketplace. As rivals have narrowed their offerings -- betting on a handful of big-risk, big-reward (or big-loss) titles -- Sony is the last studio to consistently deliver hits across genres, from family movies to indies, from minority comedies to global blockbusters. ''We may not look like the rest of Hollywood,'' said another Sony executive who spoke on condition of anonymity, ''but that doesn't mean this isn't a painstakingly thought-through strategy and a profitable one.''
Put another way, he seems to be saying: We won the box-office battle last year, and we did it mostly with doubles and triples. Do you have any idea how hard that is?
SONY'S $4.4 billion in ticket sales last year was impressive, but shareholders care about profit margins.
The movie studio's bottom line didn't look better for several reasons. For one thing, about 75 percent of the ''Skyfall'' revenue went to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer after James Bond rights holders took their cut. Revenue from some DVD titles -- ''Zero Dark Thirty,'' for instance -- will come in the next fiscal year. But more important, ''Men in Black 3'' cost an arm and a leg, and when you're making this many movies some are bound to miss: Sony's hits were offset by the major flops ''Total Recall'' and Mr. Sandler's ''That's My Boy.''
Until now, the studio has not been under much outside pressure to change. As C.E.O. of the parent, Mr. Stringer had bigger problems -- a deeply troubled electronics business, the Japan earthquake and tsunami -- and largely left the studio alone; its overall margins were poor compared with some competitors, but it was at least making money. His successor, Mr. Hirai, has taken a more serious approach to the studio, but Sony executives say he still speaks to Mr. Lynton only about once every three weeks for an hour.
Mr. Loeb, however, presents a bigger threat. In his critique of the entertainment unit's profitability, he stopped short of demanding new leaders, but just barely. ''We believe the underperformance would be remedied by a more disciplined management approach,'' his letter said.
He specifically complained that the entertainment unit at Sony have been far less profitable than those of big rivals. He said a better-focused entertainment operation, in which studio managers' pay could be linked to their newly public shares, might quickly increase its cash flow by up to 50 percent.
Precise comparisons among studios are difficult; operations vary, and large media companies typically provide very limited breakdowns of their units' profitability. But a report in March by Mr. Nathanson of Nomura noted that profit margins at Hollywood's biggest movie operations had stabilized in recent years at roughly 11 percent -- matching the most recent peak in 2007 -- as companies cut costs and the number of film releases and focused on movies that play to a growing global market.
The Nomura report did not include specific estimates for Sony's film division, but Mr. Nathanson highlighted some surprising differences among the studios. Sony Pictures, by his count, released 35 films in 2012 -- or 46 percent more than either Warner or Universal, which jointly ranked second with 24 when all of their specialty film units were included. While Disney has cut its picture count 54 percent since 2006, and both Fox and Warner Brothers reduced output more than 40 percent, Sony has cut its schedule only 21 percent. It has now passed Warner Brothers as Hollywood's most prolific studio.
At Viacom, which owns Paramount, the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 offered a reminder that movie studios often bolster profitability by doing less, and spending less -- and allowing income from older films to accrue.Viacom's film revenue fell 19 percent last year, as it cut back on its release schedule and reined in spending. But the film profit margin jumped to about 6.7 percent in 2012 -- even though Paramount ranked seventh at the domestic box office -- from 5.8 percent in 2011, when it was No. 1 in ticket sales. ''The mantra of most every studio has been shrink to profit, shrink to profit,'' Mr. Nathanson said.
ON Sony's Culver City lot, perhaps the most unnerving element of Mr. Loeb's critique is that it threatens to disrupt the remarkable stability of Sony's management. For decades, that team has cultivated internal ties and has often promoted from within.
Ms. Pascal has run the film operation for almost 17 years, while Mr. Lynton has been the studio's top officer since 2004. Steve Mosko, president of Sony Pictures Television, has been at the studio 21 years. Sony Pictures Classics, the art house division that puts out about 14 inexpensive films annually, has been run by Michael Barker and Tom Bernard for 21 years, and they recently extended their contracts into 2017.
Stability became a core value at the studio in the late 1990s, after a long period of dislocation. During the first decade that Sony owned the studio, highflying mangers like Jon Peters, Peter Guber and Mark Canton raised the company's profile but delivered uneven performance and created confusion with distracting hirings and firings. (Sony built Sony Pictures around Columbia Pictures Entertainment, which it acquired in 1989 for $3.4 billion and about $1.6 billion in assumed debt.)
Ms. Pascal, who was a production executive at Sony in those tumultuous years, left for a time to run Turner Pictures but returned under a new chairman, John Calley. She established a regime known for its creative and long-lasting relationships. Often, ties with stars like Mr. Sandler and Mr. Smith delivered a string of hits and created a general air of prosperity.
Given those relationships, a Sony management shake-up might provoke rebellion among some of the most respected and powerful filmmakers in Hollywood.
''They're the strongest, smartest and most well-loved and respected studio management in the industry,'' said Scott Rudin, the Oscar-winning producer. Mr. Rudin is behind ''Captain Phillips,'' a serious, ambitious film set for release by Sony on Oct. 11. It stars Tom Hanks as Capt. Richard Phillips, whose cargo ship was hijacked by Somali pirates in 2009.
''Michael and Amy have a massive amount of shrewdness, experience and institutional movie business knowledge and an almost unquantifiable reservoir of talent and filmmaker loyalty,'' Mr. Rudin continued. ''And, as such, they are likely better positioned to run a sleek, modern movie company than any of their competitors.''
But, as Ms. Pascal noted in a 2011 interview with The New York Times, a series of hits, even among friends, inevitably leads to escalating pay demands -- and, ultimately, the kind of profit squeeze that is now troubling Mr. Loeb. And in the film world, stable relationships can set off the occasional disaster.
Sony weathered one of those in 2010, with ''How Do You Know,'' which had a reported production budget of about $120 million -- huge for a romance film. Starring Reese Witherspoon, it was written and directed by James L. Brooks, who was behind hits like ''As Good as It Gets.'' But it generated just $49 million in worldwide ticket sales. Mr. Brooks, who had long been close to Ms. Pascal, has since left the studio.
As summer approaches and Sony turns to mainstays like Mr. Smith for ''After Earth,'' Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill for ''This Is the End'' and Channing Tatum for ''White House Down,'' the studio will face the usual questions about whether its favorite stars can generate big-enough profits. And this time, the person providing the answer may be Mr. Loeb.
